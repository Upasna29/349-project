I quit the game in early 2014 because it was a clustercluck of awful optimization, no end-game content, bland heroes and nonstop grind and I just couldn't take it anymore. The groundwork for a good game was there, and the developers were some of the coolest in the industry and they actually listened, but I just couldn't handle it anymore so I took a hiatus.\n\nI came back in 2015 and I am SO GLAD that I did. I knew the developers listened to it's community so I had high hopes, but they absolutely shattered my expectations for the game. Their "52 reviews" (where they rework older characters to stay on par with newer characters) has added a ton of depth to the bland older heroes, end-game content is still a bit off but they've added raids and are constantly adding more end-game material to play around with so there's actually content now. They have daily login rewards and multiple events every month to reward their playerbase, and most importantly they still listen to their community. The best comparison I can think of for this company would be early Riot games, before they started focusing on the LCS and drifted away from their community and playerbase.\n\nAnyways lets finish up this review, I was rambling a bit. Think of this game was a Diablo MMO that focuses more on playstyle diversity and playing a well-rounded roster of heroes than grinding out 1 character until he's a god.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphical fidelity is the weakest spot imo, it's really tough to see what's going on with so many flashy spells going on. You're basically forced to turn off the effects from other players, and even then on some heroes its nearly impossible to see what's going on. For example if you're playing Human Torch you literally light the entire ground in a giant blaze of fire and it becomes really hard to follow what's going on.\n\nEarly Game Content:\nEarly game content is very diverse, which makes leveling a breeze. Mondays you'll find yourself grinding out Midtown because every Monday they have an event where you get bonus loot and experience from Midtown, but they also have different types of challenge modes (never ending wave matches are one of the more popular, where each level you defeat increases the difficulty and rewards of the next level, and you go after floods of enemies until you die). Then there's also terminals and legendary quests which give upgraded rewards. Cannot complain about early game content at all.\n\nLate Game Content:\nIt's not the best, but it's being actively worked on. Raids are really fun and require a lot of coordination to be pulled off if you're doing them in higher difficulties. I thought Raids would be really tough to pull off in this type of game but Gazillion did a great job. Late game is mediocre but improving.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters are great, they spend a lot of time making the playstyle of each hero feel fluid and accurate to their comic book counterparts. As of now there's more than 40 characters to choose from, with each one having variable costumes from their different comic book appearances. (The new Age of Ultron Hulkbuster costume, for example, is SO sick). There's still a few outdated heroes that need their 52 review, but they're coming up. In the next couple months we can expect Thing, Cable and Deadpool to all be updated and brought up to par with newer heroes. Not much else to say here, you can check out their roster online, you're pretty much guaranteed to find characters you like or would enjoy playing.\n\nCost:\nIt's free to play, why would I talk about cost? Because this game is expensive if you want to play multiple characters. You get one starter hero for free and are able to unlock all heroes either by VERY RARE in game drops or by using an in-game currency known as Eternity Splinters to unlock them. The heroes go in tiers and cost either 200, 400, or 600 Splinters to unlock. Your login reward for your second day playing is 400 splinters so getting your first hero is an absolute breeze, but the drop rate for these is guaranteed and happens about once every 6-8 minutes, which means worst case it could take you from 26-53-80 hours of grinding to unlock 1 hero. Which is high, but it honestly does add up pretty quickly as time does seem to fly in this game. You'll want to use your 400 splinters from the login reward on your favorite hero, and then use the rest on random unlock tokens, which only cost 175 splinters and have an equal chance of giving you a 200, 400, or 600 splinter hero. not so bad.\n\nOverall:\nIf you like both Marvel and ARPGs (dungeon crawlers)? Absolutely download this game right now and get into it, you'll love it.\n\nIf you're impartial about Marvel but like ARPGs? You'll probably like this game, it's a fresh take on ARPGs and it's free, you should do yourself a favor and download the game and at least give it a shot.\n\nDislike Marvel but like ARPGs? You can ignore the IP and play the game, at least download it and give it a shot, as said above its a fresh take on ARPGs by the makers of Diablo 2, arguably the best ARPG of all-time.\n\nLike Marvel but dislike ARPGs? I'd at least recommend trying it for 2 days, using your log-in reward on your favorite hero and giving it a shot that way, you may or may not get hooked.\n\nDislike Marvel and ARPGs? You can probably avoid this game altogether, but downloading it and giving it a shot is free and couldn't hurt.\n\nChances are if you've played it before and quit because you didn't like the state of the game it's probably much better than when you left, the devs listen and the game is constantly improving. Highly recommend at least giving it a shot.","May 1, 2015","true","176.9"," 474 of 551 people (86%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","86","474","551","25","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/recommended/226320/","thirdrail1","Thirdrail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thirdrail1/","181 products in account","I recommend this game IF, and ONLY IF:\n\n1) You bring your own friends.\n2) You never contact customer support, or require help or moderation of any kind. At all.\n3) You are ok with boutique pricing.\n\nIt's a fun game. They do a great job on the heroes. The roster is the highlight of this game, and depth and diversity of roster is what holds the Diablo clone that is Marvel Heroes together. That said, there are thirty-something heroes and maybe one and half heroes worth of content to play through, so there is a lot of repetition. Of course, repetition is the foundation of all video gaming, so, as usual, it's more a matter of finding a form of repetition you enjoy, as opposed to avoiding it, which is virtually impossible.\n\nThe main problem here is the community, by which I mean both the devs and the players. The players are the most sycophantic group of white knights I've ever encountered online, which is really saying a lot. You'd think you were playing the game with the dev's spouses, as personally as they take any and all criticism of such a deeply flawed title. And there is a lot of legitimate criticism to be made of a game that was downright terrible a year ago, and still, in its new playable form, remains only one-quarter finished, at the most generous estimate. Mention that fact, or allude to it in any way, and prepare to be made pariah by Marvel's zealot based online community. Worse, you could ask a question, and reveal yourself to be someone who does not comb the Marvel Heroes forums for the information required to play the game. Only a lazy scumbag would expect a game to be explained in-game, without having to go look up patch notes after leaving Steam to sign in at a third party website, and the Marvel community enforces this type of summary judgement with a mixture of glee and zeal that would impress even the most jaded citizens of Ironforge. This is internet tribalism at its finest, and the resulting experience as a player, particularly a new player, is correspondingly atrocious.\n\nThe devs and moderators, sadly, are far worse. Whether you're talking about the development team, or the moderators, poor communication is the hallmark of Gazillion Entertainment. Be prepared to do frequent out of game research, simply because the devs can't be bothered explaining even the simplest aspects of play in-game. And pray Yig will help you should you ever require assistance with anything, at any point, because the support department at Gaz certainly isn't going to help you. You will never be a good enough customer to even be treated like a customer, much less a good one.\n\nWhich is almost fascinating, because Marvel Heroes can be quite expensive. New heroes cost $4.50, $9, or $13.50, depending (mostly) on how long they've been available. A single new costume for said hero can be anywhere from $4.50 to $14.50. It is painfully easy to spend $500 on this game, and claims of thousands spent are not uncommon. This is boutique pricing straight off Melrose in LA, but the whole thing is run by a group of people whose customer service skills would be considered unprofessional by Orange County swap meet standards. The true marvel here is that Marvel has left their multizillion dollar IP in the hands of people who don't just ignore their customers, but often seem to have a genuine dislike for them.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The game is fun to play.\n\nJust bring your own friends. And be prepared to throw down big money. At a business where the proprietors and other customers will bridge the entire spectrum between pointed disinterest and open hostility.","October 10, 2014","true","714.8"," 579 of 729 people (79%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","79","579","729","74","33"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/recommended/226320/","wrathinside","Wrathinside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/","21 products in account","I've had varying opinions about the game, but ultimately the last straw was the forum moderation. If there is ever a nazi level of moderation - this is the Gazillion forum.\n\nYou can write a negative post about the game in a general discussion forum, then apologize, rename it, erase the text and turn it into a PSA for other players no to make the same mistake as me.\n\nYou WILL get banned(and they will call it a warning).\n\nAs for the game itself - it does have an engaging start. Variety of events, game modes, heroes and character customization - these are certainly the advantages. Also an advantage would be no real P2W, except for one paywall that I'll mention in the end.\nThe game is a good place to roleplay your favourite Marvel characters, but unfortunately that's as far as it gets.\n\nThe list of disadvantages is more numerous:\n\n>The game has practically zero multiplayer\nCo-oping story content or terminals - is a painful experience of you trying to compete with your buddy about who oneshots more enemies faster. Half of the characters have terrible movement options, while many others - can either teleport without any penalty, making them capable of rushing distances many times faster than any other hero, or who can at least fly or have skill that bypasses obstacles. In other words, casual content will be more painful to co-op than it is to solo, because of vast movement difference and class mechanics.\n\nCo-op farming challenges is totally unnecessary, because there are almost always enough people to do everything, but if you get a personal party - you can't even get private instance of that farming challenge. You just will have to deal with other people.\n\nCo-oping a handful of wave-based challenges is very recommended, with the notion of these modes being absolutely unrewarding. Maybe a couple of sick-geared people can outlast 60 waves of Holosim for the title, but beyond that - it's not something to co-op for rewards.\nUltron is one exception to this. It's a mode that's very rewarding, pretty challenging and favors premade groups. I would list it as an advantage, but it's probably better to call it an exception to disadvantage.\n\nFinally - raids. Let's put it this way: Green raid is accessible freely by practically anyone who has hit 60. It helps you to get weekly commendation cap to upgrade items to level 66. Red raid is hard-gated by the community until you have full 66 gear(at least a month of gameplay). Axis raid is only accessible with best gear in the game, because first boss is overpowered, second boss is facerolled and third boss is a matter of movement.\nRaids have practically non-existent rewards. People have ran both raids for months and haven't seen a single raid item drop on any character. Items from Muspelheim can be crafted at the cost of 2.5 weeks of gameplay and a very rare rune.\nSo you can surely get into a clan and run raids, but there is one thing you can be sure about - you will NOT see any unique rewards for it. If not for commendations, you would certainly have better places to play in than raids.\n\n\n>Power Climb\nThis game has one benefit - you can personally reroll almost all of your gear. Unfortunately, the cost and the odds of having something decent rolled on your favourite gear - are, literally, astronomical. Let's say that your favourite artifact has 4 stats. To roll them at 90%+ you'll need some huge luck. A roll of 95-100% is often worth many times more than the artifact itself.\nNow, imagine if your unique slot item has... again, literally, 12 stats. Calculate your odds of getting... let's be honest here, 80%+ roll on ALL of them.......... Yeah.\n\n>Item Grind\nWhile it's not something new to the ARPG genre, the grind in this game is very peculiar. Developers actually gave you hope to get the desired item. A hope to beat the evil RNG. A hope in form of an achievement that rewards a single, often personal(acc-bound) item after you have ran the instance in question - 500 times on average. Depending on the instance achievement\item, the average translation to hours would be 10-15 hours straight spent in that particular instance. And that's just for one achievement. After you've got it, and if you need another such item - well, you may not have seen a drop before your 500 runs. And, according to player testimonies - might not see one in another 1000.\n\n>Stone Age Barter\nGame's trading is strictly barter, meaning that it can be severely scammable by the seller and very unforgiving to the buyer. The standard bartering currency is one of the best artifacts in the game that has been farmed by hundreds of thousands of people and, upon reusing, has become the base currency. When you start, your only way up is to keep playing until you loot something worth trading, then either convert it into this "currency" or trade it for what you currently need. This is the one system that actually cries: "Diablo 3 AH was awesome"\n\n\n>Hero disparity, Cosmic Trial\n\nSome heroes are known to be popular and extremely easy\overpowered. This generally includes summoners, heroes with teleport and heavy healing capabilities.\nOther heroes can either be extremely boring to play or are just incapable of realistically competing. They are reviewing heroes, but it takes months, and it seems that they first poop out a hero, then think about it.\n\nCosmic Trial is a gate that can be facerolled by one group of heroes, and either requires very solid gear or is almost undoable by another. It unlocks more rewarding farming challenges for level 60, which, frankly, must be much more default.\n\n>Stash paywall\nPractically everything in the game can be acquired for free, and all players cry in unison that if you ever agree to donate - it must be Stash. It's not much of a disadvantage, but I'd rather donate for content that enhances my gameplay without too much P2W, than be forced to pay for something that inhibits my very acquaintance with the game.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf there is one thing I've learned in this game - it's "You must not want". Wanting something will get you mad about lack of drops, bad luck and lots of grinding.\nJust playing, from time to time, doing some event or dailies, and hoping, but not focusing on it - to get something valuable to trade - this is the more promising route.\nLike many other MMOs - this game is not about you.\n\n\nSince the review somehow got popular, let me make a few things clear:\n\n1. Review is OUTDATED. I have not played the game recently, have not been on forums recently, maybe things have changed. I do not particularly intend to check, but if a more adequate person comments with proof of change, I will reflect it.\n\n2. The main gripe is the grind. The grind that revolved around key factors of the game. It may not be too bad, but it wasn't very promising either. The horizon is either totally obscured, or it's so far and wide that you really don't want to walk it. In other words, you either have no idea if you have to reroll an item 10 times or 10000 times to make it good, or you know you need to run a dungeon 500 times to get a crucial build item.\n\n3. The game had reasonable trade progression, or maybe I just had some luck before I quit. But ultimately tradable things could be reached, this still does not resolve point #2.\n\n4. Game itself is quite engaging, and to an extent this review is indeed biased. But how would you react when you are a frequent buyer at a store. Some items were good, some were bad. In general, it was convenient and you used it. But one day, a clerk totally ♥♥♥♥s you up and you really don't want to visit this store again. What will you say about this store?\nFrankly, people should be thankful I've at least tried to be a normal negative commenter - one who actually describes how things work, instead of "I can play as Rocket, 10\10". I could as well say "game is bad, forums are bad, not recommended". Somehow people who disagree can only see\comprehend these few words.","August 23, 2015","false","329.5"," 710 of 953 people (75%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","75","710","953","36","13"

I mean, seriously? Why exactly would you need a good PC, for a game like this? But oh well, so I did not play it for a while and gave it a try again recently.\n\nHmm, I noticed all the patching really did some tricks. The game is quite playable now and it is kind of funny how there are so many things... SO. MANY. THINGS. to loot in this game. I like the atmosphere of it, which reminds me of the RPGs of the 90s (And this does not mean it is a bad thing. It is for me, in fact, a good thing, a great thing even). And since it is hard to unlock other heroes, or you have to pay, it feels special if you are the only person with that hero in the area you are in. I am right now playing as Spider-Man, and I noticed you can buy the costume of the Superior Spider-Man. You see, those guys know what kind of stuff makes money. Because in fact, I am quite tempted to buy this.\n\nIt felt really good when I was fighting Rhino as Spider-Man, and the other guy who was the Superior Spider-Man helping me out and all, it was something like a dream come true for me, Spider-Man and Doc Oc Spidey working together to beat down Rhino? Oh boy.\n\nAnd it was incredibly fun to beat down Venom with a bunch of X-Men guys as well. I would have to say, this game has potential. The whole combat system is pretty fun, too, and I really like how fast Spidey moves during the battle, it is certainly fun to watch.\n\nThis game, is quite interesting. Pretty fun. Even though I am a Marvel fan, if the game sucks, then I would not even think about playing it, but there is something about this game, that makes me want to keep coming back to play again. Certainly a great free MMORPG.\n\n8.7 out of 10\n\n*UPDATED in November 28th, 2013*\n\nNow that I have played this game for over 100 hours, it is about time I wrote a little bit more detailed review. First of all, I really like the fact that the things in the map can be destroyed, for example, all those window glasses and tables and such all get destroyed if you use AoE attacks around, making the whole battle appear a little bit more exciting.\n\nThe graphics are one of the best, and quite well optimized nowadays as well. If you have a good PC with a good gaming GPU, it is recommended that you max the settings, as there is a big difference between the lowest settings and the max settings.\n\nI've noticed that after some patches that happened recently, it seems like there are more people than there were in the past, and it's good to see that some new bosses and such were added as well. The game has certainly gone through a lot of changes recently, and I believe they did a great job.\n\nThis game will grow, and I can tell. I just wish to see a little bit more costumes for certain characters, like Emma Frost, Jean Grey and Spidey.\n\nIt's just, this game needs a little bit more love from more people.\n\n9.1 out of 10.","November 28, 2013","true","218.5"," 297 of 385 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","297","385","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celestialcharade/recommended/226320/","celestialcharade","Kurama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celestialcharade/","207 products in account","Marvel Heroes is an interesting game. It plays like Diablo, as in it’s an action RPG with loot drops and classes (heroes) to play as. That said, it has had an interesting history, at least as far as video games go. It was originally developed by Cryptic Studios under the name Marvel Universe, but it ended up getting cancelled.  Gazillion Studios took over the rights and rebranded it as the name we know today, minus the 2015. That came in May of this year, though I expect it to change to 2016 next summer. We’ll see about that, though. Anyway!\n\nI’ve been playing Marvel Heroes 2015 off and on since July, and I’ve been having a blast so far. I picked Rocket Raccoon as my first hero (the one you get for starting the game) since he looked like he’d be a lot of fun, and Guardians of the Galaxy was about to hit theaters. I played him for a bit, to level 12 or so, but heard he was getting his powers completely changed by the developers. This made me wonder whether it was worth the time leveling him up or not, since he was going to change anyway, and I ended up putting him on the shelf for later.\n\nSince I enjoyed the game enough to buy a hero, I chose to buy Loki; his powers were pretty unique, and I thought that it wouldn’t hurt to try something new. He has the ability to make illusions and send them after the enemy, either by hitting an enemy with his scepter or using another skill to create several. I remember using the ability he gets far down his illusion tree pretty often – the one where his illusions drop down like a meteor. Unfortunately, Loki’s Ultimate (a skill heroes get at level 52) is pretty lackluster. I admit I don’t know much about the comics (and I do hope to eventually change that) but Loki’s Ultimate has him turn into a frost giant for 20 seconds, changing the skill bar to unique skills only the frost giant can use. This would be fine if the frost giant didn’t move so slowly and if Loki actually did this in the comics. The Marvel Heroes 2015 forums are full of people expressing their distaste for Loki’s Ultimate, so hopefully it will change eventually. I thought it was kind of neat at first, turning into something so huge and powerful, but moving so slowly killed it for me. I did get Loki to level 60, though, and that helped me level up other heroes, since the game gives an experience boost the more heroes you have leveled to max.\n\nOther heroes I have bought or randomly acquired with in-game currency (Eternity Splinters, which drop once every 6-8 minutes or so) include Iron Man, Squirrel Girl, Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Human Torch, Thing, Taskmaster, Deadpool, Wolverine, Storm, Nova, Rogue, Moon Knight, Daredevil, Emma Frost, Punisher, Colossus, and Thor. So far, Human Torch and Iron Man have been my favorites to play, but I’ve just started to play Nova now and I haven’t touched Rogue yet.\n\nAs a whole, the gameplay is fun. I haven’t done any raids (end game content) yet, but even so I have felt some heroes needing more attention from the developers than others. Some heroes, such as Scarlet Witch, have not gotten their ’52 Rework, or 52 Review’ yet, which means she has no signature power. Like Ultimates, Signatures are unlocked at a certain level, though this level is 30, whereas Ultimates are 52. Signatures are usually pretty vital, and heroes without them really feel it. Not only that, but 52 Reviews usually end up with a complete overhaul of a hero’s powers. In other words, I haven’t played Scarlet Witch because I’m waiting for her Review.\n\nEven with Reviews, some heroes are still lackluster, and need attention. Captain America is the one most people think of when they think of a hero who needs help. He’s squishier than he should be, and his signature doesn’t last long enough, with a minute long cooldown. (Most signatures have a 20-30 second cooldown, for comparison.) My boyfriend played Cap and really wanted to like him, but felt like he had too many problems right now. Hopefully Cap will get a loving readjustment, but we’ll see how long it takes for that to happen, if it ever does.\n\nThe free-to-play aspect of the game is pretty fair, especially compared to similar ones on the market. Eternity Splinters drop about once every 6-8 minutes, and are used to purchase heroes, box space, or team ups. 175 Eternity Splinters allow you to get a random hero. The downside to this is that you might get one you already have; if this happens you can level their Ultimate to have a shorter cooldown. The only thing I’ve felt needed to be purchased was box space, or Stash space. This cannot be purchased with Eternity Splinters and without enough boxes you will feel overwhelmed. Each regular Stash box costs 500Gs, which equates to $5. If you like the game, dropping $5 every once in a while isn’t a big deal.\n\nThe bosses are usually fun to play against, though when there are a lot of players on screen things can get laggy and you may miss Juggernaut charging you; this isn’t a big deal, though, since dying doesn’t really feel detrimental in any way. (Probably does in raids, but like I said, I haven’t done any of those yet.)\n\nThere are events that happen very regularly, some very grindy. (Get 2000 of an item to have Agent Coulson from SHIELD be your team up.) That said, the events as a whole bring life to the game, and the developers are constantly adding things. New heroes are being added once a month or so, and while some feel rushed out the door, others are almost perfect. All in all, I would recommend trying this game out if you’re interested in Diablo-like games and/or the Marvel Universe, especially since it’s free.\n\nView with pictures: http://thatwritingthing.com/marvel-heroes-2015-review-keep-reviewin/","October 26, 2014","true","233.4"," 153 of 184 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","153","184","9","5"

It is a great MMOARPG that is completely FREE TO PLAY. Not paying with cash handicaps one through stash space, only thing you have to purchase, you can and I have found several free costumes. One of the things that keeps me coming back is the amount the devs care and update their game, every month a new hero is released (recently 2 this month) and many changes are made. This game is worth a try, forget about other FTP games and any other ARPG (POE, D3, etc) on the market. The reason this game gets a bad wrap is it released in what I would even consider a late alpha stage.","November 23, 2013","true","075.4"," 192 of 239 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","192","239","0","0"

Though I initially enjoyed it, I can no longer recommend it as it is a clear-cut poster child for everything that is wrong with the F2P model. In the course of the year that this game has been live there has been barely any content released for it in the form of levels or increasing the game expereince. However, there has been an unprecedented amount of content released into the cash shop.\n\nThe entirety of the game's story mode can be completed in about 3-4 hours. Anything beyond this is an endless exercise in grind and scavenging for loot. This game was created by David Brevik, who created Diablo and this is evidenced by the fact that game is exactly like Diablo in every way save for the setting. Beyond the story mode, there is not much else to the game. There are two "survival" modes, a series of copypasted "instances" and another free-for-all zone which is also copypasted from a story mode map. A WoW-style Raid was recently added, but the difficulty is off the charts and is essentially barred to anyone but the highest geared individuals in like minded supergroups. (I.E. guilds)\n\nMarvel Heroes is essentially a cash trap. The developers have no interest in improving it beyond that, despite their constant and disingenous claims to the contrary. Players who are critical of their business model and practices, regardless of how constructive they are, will be met with harassment and ostracization from the moderators and community alike. To further that point, the sycophantic nature of the MH community is the reason Gazillion gets away with this behavior. Much of their player base is spending lavish amounts of money and heaping cult-like praise upon the developers despite their inherently lazy efforts and obvious attempts to silence criticisms.\n\nThis game is a trap that uses a "carrot-on-a-stick" approach that attempts to keep you interested with log-in gifts and promises of better things that are never fulfilled. It is a waste of both your time and your money. Do not be fooled by the Marvel name, it's not worthy of that monicker.\n\nIn Short: AVOID","June 9, 2014","false","571.0"," 1,465 of 2,072 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","465","2","0","96"

But that's an old story.\n\nNow they've renamed the game as "Marvel Heroes 2015" in a clear attempt to get rid of the vast negative reviews they once had, and deserved. The game is now really far from how it was in the begining. This is both good and bad.\n\nGood:\n- The game improved in playability; heroes are getting "reviewed" so they are as powerful as any other, and addapt to a certain type of standarized power trees; this does not mean they all have the same powers, but they all receive ultimates at the same levels, and such.\n\n- The graphics got improved by a huge margin, they look quite good if your computer can handle them. They very customizable as well.\n\n- Content: Some new game modes have been added, terminals, one-shot stories, X-Defense, even raid content. This is already enough to spend quite some hours a day of grind, if that's what suits you.\n\n- Heroes: Your favorite Marvel Heroes get introduced in the game, at a rate of 1 every month, with some surprise heroes being released from time to time.\n\n- Community: People is usually nice, both in the forums and in the game. There might be some minor trolling or the occasional jerk, but it's pretty much ok all the time.\n\nBad:\n- F2P model: The game flow and direction is completely managed by the marketing department and the F2P model. Their community managers do a great job censoring any criticism on their brand, as well as the hyped community does bashing almost everyone whose sight goes beyond the fanatism. Drop rates that allow you to get new Heroes/costumes get constantly nerfed (and you're never told about it in change logs). This means the following, you could get every hero from the game just by getting ES, items that drop from every mob. Every hero costs 200 ES, 400 ES, or 600 ES, depending directly on the decisions by this marketing department. Community managers have speculated with they costing that much depending on the "work" they required to be made, or the new "technology" or whatever they added to the game. If they consider us that naive to believe such bs, that's too bad.\n\nAnyway, even if in the begining heroes could drop from any mob (by the time I got a hero to level 30, I had a drop), then this was eliminated and substituted by the ES system, wich allowed you to get 200 ES every 26-27 hours of gameplay. Now they've lowered it to 33-34. That quite some time playing, for just a hero, oh, and remember they're adding them at a faster rate of 1+ a month, so, good luck getting all the heroes, just by playing.\n\nCostumes dropped as well from mobs as rare drops. These drops rate got lowered a lot. I mean, a freaking huge lot. Look at my time played, and notice I've got a whole lot of ONE costume drop. You'd most likely win the lotery that getting that costume you want from a drop.\n\n- Transparency: This company is anything but transparent to me. They do talk and interact a lot with the community, but that's just strategy. Every single path notes they release doesn't contain everything that has changed. They change some drop rates, you never know about it until you start missing those drops.\n\nThey also add a lot of events in form of special holiday drops, login gifts, etc. But something always slips through them, and somehow if that flaw affects them, it will be fixed/removed asap, but if it affects you, you'll have to endure it for weeks, or months. Difficulty in the fix does not matter here.\n\n- Community: I already said they're usually nice. Now I'm heading at a different direction; this is an mmo-rpg. If you played Diablo 2, this is like mixing Diablo 2, Marvel, and the possibility of 1000 people being at the same spot you are. Still, all the content, except for raids, all of it, can be completed solo. And will be completed solo. You might end up in a party to get some of the stuff done faster, and then you'll quietly leave to another zone. Interaction is minimal while playing. This being said, most of the time, having so much people around is more of a flaw than a perk. If I want to kill some guys that spawn at a point, and there's 15 guys camping it, then, that's frustrating. This happens more than anyone is willing to accept. There are supergroups (guilds), 95% of them are a bunch of guys randomly invited into the same guild, with no will to do anything together whatsoever other than having some name above your head. These also tend to dissapear with time, usually when the leader stops playing and the invites stop.\n\n- Graphics: They improved but they also require a big PC to handle them. Even with a powerful one, you'll end up seing so much effects that sometimes you won't know what the hell is going on.\n\n- Balance: Whenever you head on to the forums and read an announcement on a hero being put on the level of any other, this means they're bot gonna get hit hard. One's gonna be nerfed, the other is gonna be screwed. Anytime you read 52 review, keep this in mind. Adjust = nerf. Improve = possible nerf. Nerf = don't get close to that.\n\nI'm already getting bored of this, so I'll sum up. The game might be fun for some time, but it requires an awful lot of time to get anything, or you could pay for it, big $$$. Even though I kind of enjoyed it sometimes, it's really hard to hook up friends on this. I've tried with 10+ friends, they all despised it.\n\nI'd give this a 60/100, Marvel is cool, developers in F2P models are not.\n\n","June 19, 2014","false","097.1"," 933 of 1,338 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","933","1","0","28"

What a great decision that was!  The game's a hell of a lot more fun than the first time I tried it.\n\nIf you don't know what Marvel Heroes is, Marvel Heroes is free-to-play, dungeon crawling action-rpg with a cash shop that features non-stop action, fun, and of course LOOT.  If you're familiar with Diablo or Torchlight you'd be familiar with the type of gameplay Marvel Heroes has to offer.  If you never played either of those games, but you're familiar with a little game called Marvel Ultimate Alliance, you may enjoy this.\n\nBefore, when you created a new account, you were only able to choose a starter character from a given list that included:  Captain America, Black Panther, Punisher, Black Widow, Luke Cage, Human Torch, Colossus, Cyclops, Storm, Hawkeye, Rocket Racoon, and DareDevil.\n\nThe developers changed that and now you can play ANY of the currently released heroes up until level 10 and with a new account, you can unlock any one of these as a starter.  The only exception would be the newly released hero of the month.  You will have to either buy the newest hero from the cash shop or from the NPC that sells characters for in-game currency/tokens called Eternity Splinters.\n\nAs mentioned, there's a cash shop in this game since its free-to-play.  You'll find characters, costumes, team-up characters (characters that fight alongside your character), and items such as XP boosts, rarity boosts, pets, and random item boxes in the shop.  The characters and team-up characters found in the cash shop can also be earned in-game by collecting a token that drops off mobs about every 8 minutes called an "Eternity Splinter."  These let you buy characters from the Eternity NPC for different amounts.\n\nA worthwhile note:  You receive 400 Eternity Splinters as a day 2 login reward.\n\nSome characters (like The Thing, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, X-23, Hawkeye for example) will cost you about 200 Splinters.  These same characters cost about $5 in the cash shop.  Most characters however, can be bought for 400 Spinters, which costs around $9 if you buy from the cash shop.  Some characters like Iron Man, Spider-Man, Rogue, Doctor Doom, just to name a few, will cost you quite a bit.  They can be bought for either 600 Splinters or ~$13 in the cash shop.  If you're feeling lucky, you can try your luck with a Free Hero Box that costs you 175 Splinters.  These let you have a chance at a random hero unlock that can get you one of the more expensive heroes, including newly released ones!\n\nThe cash shop isn't the main attraction for this game.  You can save yourself some cash on shiny new characters or costumes if you wait for sales (which come pretty frequently).  The summer sale for example, saw a 50% discount on a lot of stuff.  So it's sometimes better to wait, or earn things yourself.\n\nGameplay is the main attraction here and it's very fast paced and extremely FUN.  Each character plays differently and with the amount of characters, it feels like there's over 50+ different classes.   Some are debuffers/support, others are DPS or tanks.  Some of the newer characters work better than the older ones but Gazillion is doing updates every month to older characters.  Even after hitting the level 60 level cap, you're going to get sucked into going after loot, and boy is there a lot of loot.  Until then, there's plenty to do before hitting the cap.\n\nPlayers can participate in a variety of game modes including: story mode, patrols (Midtown and Industry City), Terminals, One Shots, X-Defense (group survival mode), Holosim (single player or two player survival), Age of Ultron, raids (Currently 3 raids), and Player vs. Player (have yet to try PvP).\n\nAt level 60, the Cosmic level difficulty unlocks for both Patrols and Terminals.  This difficulty mode is basically for the hardcore player because it offers a greater amount of challenge but also best opportunity for loot.  Also at level 60, you can join in on a 10 man raid and take part in some of the endgame content that the game has to offer.  Currently, there are three raids and each one scales up in difficulty, so in order to do the next, you'll have to work hard on getting the necessary gear.\n\nIf you happen to like a character a lot, you can prestige them, which restarts your character at level 1. This gives you a fancy new chat color (not that great) and the ability to buy a new pet, which can be used to gain bonus stats for your character.  Prestiging doesn't add any bonus stats so you don't have to do it if you don't want to.\n\nThe support for this game is tremendous.  Gazillion really cares and they listen to their players when it comes to new content.  There's always suggestions for costumes or characters that Gazillion considers making for the game.  The support services are also fantastic.  I bought a character and the very same went on sale a couple of days later, submitted a ticket and they refunded me the difference!  They have a 7 day price guarantee.  You don't see that EVER on a f2p game with a cash shop.  You know what else you don't see a lot of on a f2p game? A good community, and this game really has a great one.\n\nIf you like Diablo or Ultimate Alliance, give this game a try. It's free, so the only thing you'd miss out on is time.  Watch out for your wallet if you become addicted though!","May 31, 2015","true","297.0"," 131 of 166 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","131","166","13","1"

It was there but then Gaz changed.-\n\nI've played this game for quite awhile, as you can see, and what I can say is this.\n\nThis game had potential - real potential.\n\nHowever, that potential was never realized. So many lies, unkept promises, lack of new content (Remember that promise of a bunch of new content? Where is it exactly?) after the initial 2015 rebrand, and worse of all the Dev team has took a turn for the worse as time went on.\n\nWhen the game was young and failing they were kind and open to the playerbase, and even accepted criticism, as they needed their fans if they were going to keep their jobs. However, as the game gained traction, thanks to many of us investing even when no one else would, the Devs changed. They no longer accepted ANY criticism about the game and began silencing any that weren't a bunch of Yesmen. Now that they had $$ coming in they could care less about the players but the most elite high paying $$ players.\n\nFunnily... The Devs, time and again, said that what happens on the Forum and the Game were separated from each other.\n\nThat was a lie.\n\nIf you're "punished" or "silenced" on the forums for revealing these truths they will GLADLY accept your money still yet you're never ONCE told that you lose access to Support. So if you need a Refund, your account is compromised, or ect.? You're on your own but it's "okay" (/sarcasm) as they'll still take your money!\n\nSo if you aren't a high payer that brings in a lot of $$ than your opinion means NOTHING to them. While those that did pay a lot of $$ to the game? They're treated as if they're Gods/Goddesses whom the Mods protect even as they abuse other users who're free or didn't pay as much $$. And the Rules? It doesn't apply to them at all.\n\n-An Unbalanced Mess for the $$-\n\nIt's clear that new Heroes were meant to be the "Best of the best" as nearly every new Hero has been leagues higher than nearly every other character before it. In some cases they were literally the best of the best with the competition being so far behind. Such as with the release of Venom whose was extremely broken.\n\nThis is all part of the Pay2Win system they have. It wasn't bad early on but, like many things, that changed as Gaz started getting the $$ and no longer "needed" the fans any longer.\n\nThis is all to get you to buy the latest Hero as they're simply built to be better than the Heroes before them in every way.\n\nFurthermore Hero Synergies and soon Team-Up Synergies mean that those who don't put forth the $$ are at a severe advantage and then there's the highly unbalanced Omega System that doesn't reward skill, it rewards those that have the most free time to grind it out. Heck, Gaz altered the Omega System to make it even SLOWER than before. There's simply no way a non-grind player can match up to that guy sporting +10 Fighting and other goodies from the Omega System.\n\nPrices are STILL ridiculous, even for old costumes/heroes\n\nThere's no excuse for the prices of many of the costumes - especially older costumes. Not even "Enhanced" fit the high price point on them and these "Variants" have very little added them beyond a slightly altered look yet they cost nearly as much as Enhanced? Ridiculous.\n\nGaz REFUSES to lower the prices of very old Heroes and Costumes despite many of us PAYING fans begging them to do this so that the game could appeal to more players and entice more to become paying customers. This is because we wanted the game to grow and have a healthy fanbase as well as for more people to enjoy a game that we saw had so much potential.\n\nHeck, we were ripped off about Team-Ups as well. I was one of many that bought the original Team-Up Pack and let me tell you this - We did NOT get what was advertised.\n\nWhat we got was a passive boost where the characters we bought aren't even there to serve as our "Team-Up". Sure there's talk of a "Revamp" but I have no faith in it.\n\nGameplay... Is not challenging at all.\n\nThis game is extremely easy, if you're one of the "newer" Heroes, while it can be extremely frustrating if you're one of the "Older" characters like Captain America or Daredevil. Furthermore many Heroes play VERY similar to each other with the new Heroes obviously doing everything better because if a Hero isn't broken at launch it cannot rake in that $$, no?\n\nChallenge... The game has none at all. Everything but Red Raids can be done mindlessly, though only the "best" Heroes have good clear times, while Red Raids themselves? An unbalanced mess where only "certain" Heroes are allowed in because the MANY other Heroes, not to lack of player skill, cannot compete due to outdated concepts or simply poor design even after being "remade" with the 52 mess which is a direct jab at DC's New 52.\n\nIt's a multiplayer game... So why am I alone?\n\nThis game does little to promote "teaming up" with other players or building meaningful friendships with other players. The leveling experiences suffers GREATLY from this. It's far more efficient to be Anti-Social in this game and grind it out yourself while leveling and even at Max level as you do the same Cosmic Terminals over and over again. That is boring, heck Green Raids can be pugged as well while only the more "Elite" are allowed the "Honor" of being in Red Raids so unless you're ready to devote a stupid amount of time grinding the same content over and over again you are out of luck there.\n\nFurthermore, the experience gain without any Synergies or Boosts is appalling in this game. I've had many friends/family quit at the level 40 and 50 marks because it took FOREVER to level up and there was literally nothing I could do to help them out as they refused to grind out the same content over and over just so they can get to 60 to grind Omega Points which take a very long time.\n\n-Drop rates are horrendous-\n\nI've only had 1 costume drop for me and it was a dupe in all my time that I've played this game. Even during events like the Cow/Omega/Cosmic/Midtown Monday Madness event(s) and running at 600% boosts in everything I didn't see a single costume drop or even a rare Artifact drop at all. The drop rates in this game are simply put... Horrendous. The Devs have even nerfed said rates for specific "rare" artifacts before because they were dropping at "unintended rates" so had to be "adjusted" to the "intended rates".\n\nThe Devs want to have a "Loot Hunt" but if someone is running at 600% boosts during events and still doesn't see what they're looking for even after MANY hours of repeating the content then there's a HUGE problem. Many times drop rates have been brought up and over and over again yet Dev's ignore the fans and even go as far as "silencing them" by deleting posts/topics, issuing bans, and all kind of intimidation tactics so as not to ruin the "Image" they want to sell.\n\n-Closing-\n\nThis game has so much wasted potential all because of greed. All that good will they wanted to form and to show that they "cared"? All of it was an act to get $$ from their fans, with lies and unkept promises, and the moment they got enough of that $$ and a steady revenue they betrayed and threw under the bus those very same passionate fans that helped to keep the game alive even during its darkest hour.\n\nI've invested so much time and money in the past towards this game as well as the forums, to share views/opinions/ideas (Some of which the Devs took like my suggestion towards making Power Cosmic only have 1 Sphere... You're welcome, it was heck when it was 2 Sphere.) towards improving the game because I wanted it to succeed, and I can honestly say that I regret it because the Gaz that I respected and  supported  for so long is no longer around, they were replaced by pure greed who doesn't care about the fans at made them into who they are to this day.","February 24, 2015","false","676.1"," 1,596 of 2,510 people (64%) found this review helpful 226 people found this review funny","64","596","2","226","228"

Players play as their favorite hero and procede down a condensed set of recent Marvel Comics story arcs written or supervised by Brian Michael Bendis, the prime writer for past and some current Avengers, X-Men and Spider-Man books.\n\nThose familiar with dungeon crawler style Action RPGs will quickly understand the controls and camera perspective.Despite some performance issues, the game is still enjoyable. However some will become turned off by the fact that you and many others can be playing the same hero in the same space at the same time.

Just like Squares online magnum opus, Final Fantasy 14, which launched to horrific reviews and incredibly scathing and toxic user experiences all round back in 2010 only to resurface as a critical favorite three years later with A Realm Reborn that now boasts an impressive 2 million subscribers, Gazillion entertainment seems to be taking a leaf out of Square Enix's book by heading back to the drawing board for its online free-to-play aRPG after a not so stellar launch that was bug riddled but also lacking any real merit-able content to make a person want to invest time with it. Most promptly threw it to the sidelines and forgot about it after launch but Gazillion Entertainment seems to have been toiling away listening to suggestions made by the die hard community that stayed behind because what has reemerged is a fun and addictive Diabloesque game set within the Marvel Universe.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=311006223\nTaking on any kind of MMO is no small feat. They often require dedication and patience. Sadly, most are hamstrung by the genres conventions (kill X and fetch me Y, incessant level-grinding to get anywhere – which can get particularly offensive especially in free-2-play MMO’s where users are often bombarded by cash shops selling items to help advance leveling at a quicker pace). I admit I love exploring these living; breathing digital worlds but as I have gotten older and wiser I can’t really say I enjoy playing them. There was a time when all I did was play MMO’s. They literally consumed what playtime I had but as my time got more and more precious I found I started to enjoy more focused, less time consuming games and therefore was rather reluctant to plunge back into these waters. Seems I need not have worried at all because Gazillion Entertainment has crafted a fun, entertaining and incredibly generous free-to-play aRPG that is actually a blast to play and boasts an impressive quality and sheen to it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308936667\nWhile all the super-star heroes are still locked away in pay packages what heroes are available for immediate play are fun and certainly don't dampen the enjoyment that can be had here. On the odd occasions you will get the chance to invite one of the more weighty Marvel stars into your campaign through an in-game currency that is dropped at quite an alarming rate. Granted they do cost a certain amount of this in-game currency but now they are not unattainable in the way that forces you to head for the cash shop or else face grinding until you are blue in the face. Crafting has also been overhauled and is vastly different to any kind of crafting I have come across in other MMO's. Vendors are upgraded by donating excess items which in turn levels them up enabling them to assist you in crafting higher spec'ed items as their portfolio of wares grows. There is also a welcome Omega system addition which is varied enough for end-game level 60 characters. Raids and exclusive end game content that was sorely lacking from the original launch is now also available which allows for ten superheroes to band together to take out the supreme evil in the form of the Norse fire giant Surtur. With more content to be offered in the not so far off future, Marvel Heroes 2015 is poised to enjoy a healthy longevity.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=310921895\nThere are still some slight niggles though. Skill trees are a bit bland to be honest as there appears to be a lot of repetition of skills across many of the heroes and PVP is still a bit of hit and miss with equipment and gear not visually distinct enough thereby having no impact on your characters appearance whatsoever. Although at the current rate that Gazillion entertainment is spicing things up I imagine it will be just a matter of time before these issues are addressed. Visually and aurally the game looks and sounds great and Marvel Heroes 2015 is just as dynamic and fluid as any of the big hitters in this crowded field. If you enjoy clicking, looting, fast paced action all set within the Marvel universe I can highly recommend you give the game a go - you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 14, 2014","true","19.7"," 129 of 188 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","129","188","10","9"

There are some improvements in the game and a really nice movie promotion event to get new players but nothing for players who have put some time into it.\n\nTo make things better, take a look at this post(I dont even want to link official forums to not to make things look worse than it is, but they are pretty bad right now).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes/comments/4jbc51/stop_playing_until_gazillion_fixes_the_server_or/\n\nEDIT: 2016 rebrand introduced 2016 new bugs, some of them are gamebreaking/causes distress to many players, but I only encountered a few of them thankfully.\n\nStill comparing Chapter 10 to Chapter 9(which was after Thor's second film) shows how the quality has decreasd. Both are chapters/content that was added later but Chapter 10 is flawed to the core.\n\nChapter 10 is just reused maps with new mobs that die to dash skills and bosses that you dont even pay attention to because they are boring. It is obvious that a mapper created the Hightown map, others on dev team saw how good looking it was and thought creating a gimmicky story chapter for it would be nice and may actually trick people into thinking that they are willing to add new content.\n\nHightown really looks nice though, traversing it is also pretty easy with the sewer system but the events and bosses it has makes it somehow more boring than Midtown.\n\nThey also added Black Cat with the rebrand but after the first two days, only a few players are playing her and even in her first day there were more Deadpools than Black Cat, just like what happened with Cap/Bucky.\n\nDeadpool players seems to be divided on his rework, but it just "random funny ♥♥♥♥ xDDD" abilities and no secondary resource! No spirit or anything. All of his powers are free with low cooldowns and he has high health regenaration. No resource + high survivability + random and funny animations that would look out of place even in mediocre comics = target audience for modern Deadpool. At least his movie looks promising with less random ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn Mid-2015 they promised 2 new gamemodes(Savage Land patrol zone, which will be something like a Tower Defence mode and Hightown) we only got one(which looks good visually but fails to be fun and engaging), they said Thanos raid will come with rebrand but they havent talked about the raid at all in the last 2-3 months except in one interview where Ryolnir says its coming. This is still a negative for the game and company. They are promising a lot and delivering less/scraping stuff/saying soon™, so Gazillion still havent learned anything.\n\nAt least we got new Variant costumes! I will actually get the Thor one too, looks a lot nicer than the original AoU costume which I liked a lot.\n\nOh also they managed to make the game even more unoptimized but who cares. I dont know how that happened but the engineers of Gazillion keeps amazing me with their inability to code but still get a paycheck.\n\nBut I am looking forward to playing as Black Bolt and hoping the unannounced 7th hero to be someone unexpected and fun to have playable(unlike Wasp or Beast, ugh) like Captain Britain or Hercules.\n\n----------------------\n\nTL;DR: Play but dont spend money until you are sure. Dont pay attention to "omg bad game/devs cuz they ban me x((("\n\nBefore I start, let me say that this game is truly F2P. Every content is available for free, each hero can be unlocked with ingame currency. Only costumes(which are purely cosmetic) and extra storage spaces(which you will have to get if you plan on playing more than 200 hours and some players will tell you to get it even earlier).\n\nReally loyal to Marvel heroes/villains/organizations from the comics(even though newer content is obviously inspired by the movies, which isnt a bad thing). Although if you are a fan of the comic books some character dialogue may annoy you because they are outdated/not true to character/takes jokes on the internet too seriously. Locations are pretty nice and diverse too.\n\nGame will get a rebranding for 2016 in late January. It will add 2 new gamemodes, a whole new story chapter(although it will have reused  locations from previous chapters), a new raid(almost less than half of the playerbase plays raids though) crafting system rework and some changes to omega system(will also unlock a new omega node).\n\nNormally I would recommend this game, but the future of the game doesnt looks bright.\n\nIts only servers are located in US, so if you are outside US prepare to get at least 120 pings.\n\nGame always gets patches at thursday/friday, downtimes are usually 3 hours longs but depending on the size may be lower or longer. Weekly patches are good, the bugs gets patched in less than 7 days. But the downside to weekly patching is the incompetence of developers. They introduce more bugs than they fix with the patch, they dont know how to compress game files, smallest patches are 360mb and they can reach 5 gb in size(in the second half of 2015 patch sizes were at least 1 gb with 2-2.5 gb patches were the most common ones).\n\nHero releases gets delayed constantly and even with delays they are filled with bugs, broken mechanics, undertuned skills and general whining from the playerbase. Gazillion releases new characters on Test Center so that they dont need to pay for testers and use playerbase for testing, but in the end they usually dont listen to what players say until the hero gets released.\n\nHeroes with Unique mechanics were non-existent in 2015. Doom had specialisations, a really huge mechanic and was unique to him until they implemented it to numerous heroes and that left us with Magik and Iron Fist as the only unique heroes(but all 3 of them are really worth playing).\n\nBut at least Gazillion is on the right path on this subject. We will see around 8 heroes in 2016 as confirmed by Ryolnir(lead designer).\n\nAnother lacking aspect of the game is the loot. Its drop rate and RNG is just a bit better than Darkest Dungeon. But trading is pretty active and easy to get into so you shouldnt have much problem if you want to play the game seriously.\n\nGraphics are good since it uses Unreal Engine 3, special effects and sound effects are top tier. Only visual part that isnt good is the animations of character. But you dont even notice them during fights. Game really feels like a comic book game.\n\nBut games future is pretty questionable. A lot of big names(the ones with real experience and did the most work) have left the company but not on bad terms(for example 3 devs got hired by Blizzard as seen in their Linkedin profiles). But these people are the ones responsible for the games huge improvement in 2014 and it shows because of the quality of content as I have mentioned before.\n\nIf you want to play, start playing now but wait until late February or early March to see how 2016 rebranding changes the game to spend your money.\n\nA few notes.\n\n-Dont mind the negative reviews of people who got banned. They are all banned for a reason and most of them are either forum bans or bans for constant bad language and breaking rules(Terms of Service) in the game.\n\n-Be sure to check forums and active community websites for active events and codes. Devs get generous at times of promotion.\n\nwww.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes\nMarvelHeroes.info\nhttp://www.mhbugle.com/\n\n-Lastly, use Steam. Standalone launcher has far more issues compared to Steam. This especially gets depressing because of patch sizes.","December 31, 2015","false","162.1"," 398 of 638 people (62%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","62","398","638","39","15"

Fan of Marvel Comics?  If you're both, then this game is for you.  If you love Marvel but haven't played Diablo or any similar games (Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc), then you'll probably find a lot of good stuff in here too.\n\nFree to play action-rpg, with many, many different characters to play.  Your first character is free, you can buy any other characters with real money, as well as their costumes (which there are a LOT).  But if you're not into spending money, you can collect items (Eternity Splinters) and purchase characters with thouse, either as a Random Hero Box where you might get a character you already have but costs the least amount of splinters, or you can get the character directly.\n\nYou can easily play the game for a long time without spending a dollar.  I've spend 10 bucks across 150 hours of gameplay, and I have 7 characters.\n\nThe game is constantly being updated/patched, and new characters/costumes/items are being added all the time.  A character you have might not be fun to play, but down the line it might get reviewed and be fun as hell afterwards.\n\nMax character level is 60, and every character you get to 60 gives you an EXP boost across all other characters you have.  And you'll generally get enough splinters for a random hero by the time you get one character to 60, so you'll have a chance to start working on a new one immediately.  Or you can join a Supergroup (Clan/Guild), do raids, farm items, make your level 60 a total badass.\n\nSo yeah, if you're looking for a fun as hall ARPG, this is a great game.  It's not perfect, but it's much better than it was beck when it originally came out, before the MH2015 rebranding.  So give it a shot, blow up dudes with your mind powers or laser eyes, or just punch them with your rock fists.","October 18, 2014","true","402.9"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","51","67","6","0"

If you do then check this game out. The game is F2P and lets you pick one of nine starter heroes that you can level to 60. Features story campaign, various replayable boss instance "terminals", 10 player co-op endless mob/boss wave zone (Midtown), 5-player survival mode (X-Defense), 5v5 PvP (Dota style mode), with more maps and modes coming in the near future. There are currently over 30 heroes and over 200 costumes with new ones added every month.\n\nStraight Talk: Game is fully F2P, no gated content (time or money). You have extremely limited storage space which means at some point you will buy more using real money. Heroes cost 200/400/600 "splinters" which drop one every 6-10 minutes, which gets you around 10-12 per hour of steady play. Heroes can cost $2 up to $15 apiece and costumes can range up to $20 for "enhanced" versions (addition animations/voice work). You CAN get costumes to drop in-game, but the drop rate is ridiculously rare (I have none in 700 hours). Best bet for new players is if there is a specifc hero and costume you want to play, either pick up a bundle on the website or in-game store (combo would probably cost around $20).\n\nThe developers are extremely dedicated to this game and regularly interact with the community via the forums and live streams. Player feedback is used often in design decisions, and the game is patched weekly. One new hero is added per month (sometimes surprise heroes are added in between, such as Taskmaster and Loki) and other game content is rapidly being added or revamped.","April 21, 2014","true","547.5"," 488 of 800 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","488","800","0","17"

It's gameplay is fun, lots of flashy effects, high damage numbers, having to dodge and kite and most of the heroes have their own interesting little gimmick / mechanics. The atmosphere is awesome, bringing the marvel universe together in a convenient diablo-like world with 'acts' represented as chapters and all the big bads you could want from Shocker to Doctor Doom. The loot, rather important in an ARPG is done in a way that rewards players for time spent,  with small thnigs like relics that drop atleast once every 3-5min that stack upto 1000, giving you slow progression in addition to the fast progression like artifacts and uniques that are boss-only and are invaluably important to getting your character viable.\n\nLategame in Marvel Heroes is basically an externsion of the story mode with easy/medium/hard/intense/oh god difficulties for players to work their way through - from fighting bosses on 'easy' in Green terminals, to Cosmic terminals where Doctor Doom will show you the meaning behind his name, Holo-Sim waves defending virtual civillians, or defending Xavier Schools students from invaders in X-Defense - to now even being able to raid - Marvel Heroes has most players needs covered. I think the later game still has potential to be worked on, and imporved - but as it stands I do enjoy it.\n\nIt IS F2P, anything you can get in the store is either - avaialable pretty easily, or purely cosmetic - such as costumes. The only exception being Stash Tabs - which you will not need until you're entering the lategame stage of Marvel Heroes, and by that time you've spent towards 30-40hours on the game, and I'd say that's about fair. Every F2P ARPG at this point in time charges extra for additional stash tabs - I don't think it should be this way but I do think it's one of those things that won't be going away so it's kind of pointless to argue about it.\n\nUpdates - Holy hell, the updates. When I first played this game at launch it was a horrible mess, and hardly worth 20minutes of my time, coming back to it later I fell in love! Every week or so a new event comes around, or a new rebalance, new content, or another Hero for everyone to sink their creative teeth into - and that's one of the best parts about Marvel Heroes to me, the constant Developer discussions, interaction, compromise and updates that make the game a delight to keep playing.\n\nAll in all I think Marvel Heroes is currently one of the best ARPG's on the market in my opinion, That said everything boils down to ones preference, as such I recommend you try it, rather than read reviews! It's free, if you don't like it, delete and complain about it over VOIP for 20minutes and move on - that's how we gauge F2P's now-a-days anyhow :D","October 8, 2014","true","342.8"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","39","51","5","0"

In the review, you can probably tell that he thought the game was terrible. But you have to check the date it came out, June 15th 2013. 2013! A year ago when the game was first released. A game can change TotalBiscuit, and im about to show everyone how it did change.\n\n\nSo lets start off with the beginning and storyline. Once you make an account for this game, you automatically get to choose a hero from the starter hero list(11 starter heroes to be exact, including Human Torch, Rocket Raccoon, Storm, Thing, Hawkeye, Captain America, Colossus, and i cant remember the others). Once you pick a hero you automatically get a starting cutscene sort of explaining the main story line, where Dr. Doom has stolen the Cosmic Cube. In this cutscene, Uatu and Doom fight in order gain control of the Cosmic Cube. I bet you can guess who wins, but no spoilers!\n\nAfter the beginning cutscene you are traveled to Queens, where a current bank heist is going down. Fight in the streets to the bank to stop the heist. Once you have defeated the badies in the bank and saved all the civilians, you go over to the vault where (surprise!) Black Cat pays a visit. This is your first boss. Defeat her, and go to the front to speak with Sergeant Acedillo to travel to the prologue stark tower. In order to keep the review kinda short, lets just wrap up the story line here and have it for you to do the rest. Also, when you travel to Stark Tower, speak to Jocasta. She'll give you a box that if you right click on it gives you some shiny items called Eternity Splinters!(Which, you may or may not have picked up on your first mission)\n\nNow you may be asking yourself, what are these "Eternity Splinters" anyway? Well, you couldve just looked at the item description in your inventory, but if you didnt, ill explain them to you. These items are the way you get special items from Adam Warlock, located in each hub. Through Eternity Splinters, you can get new heroes! If you save up 175 of them, you can get your first random hero box! Right click on this item in order to open it, and youll get a shiny hero token which(if its not the same hero you already have), you can write click on to add that hero to your roster! Also from Adam Warlock there are Team Up tokens, which is a companion system which you can learn about from the forums or something else.\n\nOnce you are completed the story line, you probably will be level 30, or almost atleast. That means your halfway through the leveling system! The max level cap is lvl 60, but you get a really cool power for your hero at lvl 52 called an ultimate power!\nNow, in order to level, there a ton of things you can do! Terminals, Shared Quests, XDefense, SHIELD Holosim, Legendary Quests, and much more!\n\nNow, this reviews gone on long enough. Notice i didnt really include anything bad about this game, and thats because i cant really think of any! The games just getting better and better, with more stuff to come!. All id have to say is that, surprisingly, this game takes a good graphics card in order to run it. Also, if your a non marvel fan, this game isnt probably for you. But if you enjoy marvel, diablo like clones(because realize-the maker of diablo 1 and 2 helped make this game), this is definatly a game to try out!","August 8, 2014","true","619.5"," 48 of 75 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","48","75","0","5"

After writing this I do actually believe it's more of an introduction to Marvel Heroes with my own opinion mixed together. Anyhow... Recently Marvel Heroes re-released as Marvel Heroes 2015. Gazillion had a rough start but they really turned the game around in to something great. There are weekly updates, events and patches to keep everyone busy. There are heroes and some villians to play in MH2015 but I will just talk about heroes (easier to read).\n\nGameplay\nYou get to choose one of the 11 starters, which are; Captain America, Black Panther, Punisher, Black Widow, Luke Cage, Human Torch, Colossus, Storm, Hawkeye, Rocket Racoon & Daredevil. After choosing one, the journey begins. First you will start with the storyline, which is set up in chapters. In total there are nine chapters located all throughout the Marvel universe. After gaining a certain level, more game modes will open up to you, giving a lot of different options to level. Gameplaywise, Marvel Heroes is an ARPG, similar to Diablo 2. Furthermore, It's loot heaven. Really, I have never seen this much loot. Like most ARPG's, it can be grindy, expecially if you don't like the game (duh) or hero. The game is set up as a serious time sink. At the moment, you have around 35(?) heroes and villians available. These can all be leveled to 60. If you enjoy a hero that much, there is the option to prestige him/her, 5 times. The prestige system basically means starting over having a different coloured name and the ability to buy a special pet (pets are only for showing off). If you still don't have enough from playing your favorite character, Gazillion recently added to option to cosmic prestige your character. This takes 25 times the normal leveling rate. Talk about a major time investment right? The game has three difficulty settings. Normal, heroic and superheroic. While leveling you will unlock these modes automatically. In my opinion, the game is not hard (except for some endbosses which are rediciously difficult) and very forgivable. This is not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it because I don't have all the time in the world so it always feels like I am progressing.\n\nEndgame\nWhen you're level 60, there are various different ways to gain the best loot possible. To be honest, I haven't done a lot of endgame yet. I do have 3 level 60 heroes at them moment, but I prefer leveling over endgame. Gazillion added raids not too long ago but I have yet to try them out. I will update this section as soon as possible!\n\nBusiness Model\nThe game is F2P, but it may be the fairest I've ever encountered. So far, I've only spend €4,- on some extra storage and a hero. I will spend more soon (those packs are sooo tempting!) but that's because Gazillion deserves my money, not because I need to. I do think some cash shop items are overpriced when they're not in discount.\n\nEternity Splinters\nThis is the in-game currency. You see, most of the stuff in the game is obtainable through the in-game currency called Eternity Splinters (ES). These ES drop on an invisible timer. You just play and they randomly drop from anything giving XP. From ES you can buy heroes, team-ups or anything else you'd like. The only thing which is not obtainable through ES are storage space and fortune cards. It's a neat system and you get some extra ES on your first playthrough to help you on your way.\n\nGraphics\nOn the highest settings, the game looks great. The newer heroes/areas all have detail and you can see Gazillion puts a lot of care in designing their game and characters. Some of the older areas and heroes however, look a little bit bland. They are working on this by updating the older heroes. I haven't heard any plans on updating some of the older areas. Another thing is the performance. After playing for a while, the game's performance gets worse. This is a known problem for players and most think this is a memory leak. Over the months I've played, it already got better, but this is still an issue.\n\nLongetivity\nTHERE. IS. SO. MUCH. TO. DO. Seriously, the possibilities are endless. There are so many heroes that you can choose from. Also I have the feeling the game is gaining momentum because of the re-release and the ever growing popularity of Marvel. They connect their game to the Marvel movie releases with great updates (latest example Guardians of the Galaxy).\n\nSummary\nMarvel Heroes 2015 is an endless timesink. And a very very very fun one at that. So far I've spend a fair amount of time in the game. I prefer leveling over endgame, so I will have to spend some more time on that part. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is in to Marvel (or anyone in to comics in general). Gazillion really nailed the feeling of being your favorite hero (or villian). The game does tend to get grindy at times. Also, this is not mentioned before, but the community is great. The official forums are very active and in game there's always someone willing to help.\n\nTips for new players\nDon't sell the loot you don't need, but donate the stuff you don't need/use to the crafter. By donating you level him up giving you nice options later on.\nWhen buying heroes with Eternity Splinters, you can also buy a random hero box. This box is 175 splinters whereas the heroes are 200/400/600. This box will give you a random hero so if you're not too picky on which hero to play, this is a great option. There is a chance that you receive the same hero you already have, in which case you will get an ultimate token.\nmarvelheroes.com official website.","August 16, 2014","true","301.3"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","28","40","2","0"

You get to play one of many marvel owned characters, ( heroes and villains) using powers that are unique to them in some way and work your way through the world based out of the Avengers towers aka Stark Tower.\n\nCurrently there are 38 heroes available to play, with 12 more in a pay for x-pack, and level up with a hand full of different play styles.\n\nFree to play...\nThis is a free to play game, So far I only felt compelled to buy Nightcralwer, who I have had a crush on since I was like 14. His teleport abilities and straight up DPS has been well worth my money. I bought my husband the new 'advanced' Rocket raccoon costume. This gave him the skin from the latest Guardians of the Galaxy movie and the same Voice actor saying thing you expect the movie Rocket to say. “I wonder if there is a goodie inside” when braking boxes. “Humans come in interesting shades of blue.. and you can teleport.. tell me how!” and lastly. “Braking stuff is more of Groot's thing, I like shootin stuff!”\n\nBuying costumes are one thing that isn't tooo expensive and I feel is well worth it. Seeing a lot of the fun factor is seeing the heroes or villeins you know and love kicking ♥♥♥. Most heroes have two to five costumes out there including some for the comics and movies. Million shades of Wolverine, to the phases of storm threw out all the comics. Deadpool has a hand full as well including the Lady Deadpool.\n\nThere is is a gambling box you can buy and can give you gear. Meaning there is a Pay to win.. but it is  such a slaughter fest no matter if you are soloing or working in a group of four. As far as I can tell beside costumes there is no other reason to put any money into this game. Most of the things you can want including other unlocked toons can be done threw in game gathered things eternity shards.. mostly or special event drops.\n\nLastly there is a daily-ish log in reward box that gives away much of the power ups exp boosts and so forth you can buy on the market.. soo just play and have fun.\n\nFun factor\nOnce I got Nightcralwer I really started having fun. Listening for the lines that triggers when he is around other hero's he knows. The fact he plays exactly how I expect a teleporting powered half daemon to play. Much of the gear also has throwback to the comics on it. I like to read the quotes that appear on the gear tooltip.\n\nI also got Loki as a buy one get one free deal. He was surprisingly fun. Though I look forward / hope to see a costume / skin based of him in the Avengers movie. The costume is good but I feel if it was the actors skinny frame and voice acting I would want to pay for that.\n\nLoot is not shared, you mostly will get drops for your current toon with an occasional drop fro one you may have locked or unlocked. Most of the time I just sell them or use them to level up a vender.\n\nDifficulty\nThere is a feel of challenge, among the chaos if taking on one or ten to many mobs at once and seeing my health go down faster then I would like. Nothing I could not teleport out of and take a first aid kit. Leveling with someone really has pushed up to see how far we can go in some of the events. There are dailies, and weekly events and holidays to really help break up the flow of the game if you're trekking through for your third plus time.\n\nThe most difficult thing for me was the trickle of upgrades that dropped. Seeing that most gear has bonuses for abilities or skill trees on it I was finding only two out often or so drops that were even the right skills or trees for my Nightcralwer. The events really have me hordes of gear to look through, so that is a nice bonus.\n\nReplay ability\nAfter I max out Nightcralwer I could go and max out Loki. In the story line I will be given 3 more toons while completing the story. So yes.. but I already can tell that if you are a person who looks for more than just mass slaughter and enjoying seeing your favorite marvel characters do something awesome. It might get old.\n\nSide kicks aka Team-Up\nNow there is a NPC based side kicks available in the game. I have earned enough of the dropped random currency to have bought one, but seeing I am enjoying my play with my husband I decided to save my shards for my next hero to level with him.\n\nVenders, crafting and leveling.\nBecause you can play this game many times through on many different toons. You get to level up your venders. You can do this by “donating' loot to them and Shield metals. With a crafting being mostly upgrading the quality of gear you find, and changing the random not for your toon gear into your toon gear.\n\nI have chose to level my 'crafting' NPC and my 'enchanting' NPC vendors first. Seeing that my level has shot up by fifteen in just two Agent S.H.I.E.L.D. Events it is more important to be able to upgrade the gear and enchant it then it is to be able to but random loot boxes from the weapons and armor vendor.\n\nIn Summary\nFun game if you like that style of games, mowing down near armies of baddies. I would suggest it as a free to play game for those who want to hang out with the marvel goodness but doesn't really want to fork over the wallet. I simple 15 one time payment can unlock any hero or villain you want to play and the costume you may want for them.\n\nReview\nGameplay 8/10\nEsthetic 7/10\nFun 7/10\nDifficulty 6/10\nroleplay 0/10","September 26, 2014","true","207.8"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","20","26","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/recommended/226320/","IStayPuft","I Stay Puft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IStayPuft/","552 products in account","Marvel Heroes 2015 is an action role playing game in the vain of something like Diablo set in the marvel universe. That's simply the best way to describe it without going overboard. You take your cursor point it at things, kill enemies, collect loot, and so forth until your character is max level and you eventually get better and better equipment to put on your character as time goes on. This game is a loot driven game plain and simple. You like seeing progression on your character and do it over and over on repeat again and again? Then this is the game for you. If you've never been a person who has been into clicking and collecting loot then there really isn't anything here for you. Sure this game has the Marvel license attached to it, one of the largest franchises in the world but if you don't like the gameplay then seriously there really isn't much here for you. Even less here for you if you don't like the Marvel license.\n\nFor you see that Marvel license is exactly where this game makes it's bread and butter. When it comes to free to play games the game has to attract their audience in two ways that are pretty much valuable to us as gamers, TIME AND MONEY. You spend the money on the heroes & costumes you thought are cool within the Marvel univese, you eventually spend your time leveling up that character you spent your money on, rinse and repeat. For the most part that's what is considered fun.\n\nBut here's the real kicker with this game, let's say you didn't spend a dime on it. Would this game hold up? Would you still be having fun?\n\nThe short answer: heck yeah!\n\nGazillion Entertainment, the developers of Marvel Heroes 2015 has done something quite remarkable that I've only seen f2p developers like valve do. They have made a polished and refined free-to-play game that if you seriously wanted to you could play this game completely free and still be able in a small percentage of a way get everything in the game free as long as you are into the game for the long haul. You want that spider-man hero for $13.50 but don't have the money to buy him? Well just use the starting hero you got free (they actually have quite a good selection of starter heroes from when I started out) and earn 600 eternity splinters (currency drops) and you can have him. You want a certain costume but don't have the money for the exceedingly priced costumes to buy one (cosmetic costumes for $15.00 is seriously way too expensive) well then either spend a hefty amount of time playing and possibly get a costume as a drop, prestige and possibly earn enough costumes to recipe the costume you may have wanted. The numerous ways in which you can gain value for something in the game is equivalent to the amount of time put into it and a whole lot of luck.\n\nWe spoke of the business model but how is the actual game? Each character in the game can fit into categories usually used for these types of action role-playing games. You got your melee tank characters (ex. Hulk, Thing) you got your ranged characters (Hawkeye, Cyclops) you have your character who excel in dps, you have characters who excel in aoe. Each character in the game intertwines between these certain categories and while you do see some similarities, each character never feels exactly the same. There is a wide variety to this game that will make each character you play as that much different with each playthrough.\n\nThis game is truly remarkable and my hat is off to the developers and community for this game who have shown a way of making a game better than what it was a year ago. When I played the beta and release a year ago, I played and enjoyed the main campaign but there was never really anything there to really suck me into that cycle of time and money. I gave it a few months off and was quite surprised how addicting the game has become.\n\nMarvel Heroes 2015 is befitting of it's new game title and hopefully a second chance on making an impression on players.","August 20, 2014","true","933.9"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","30","44","0","1"

Yes it has raids not usually seen outside of traditional MMO's where a group of ten people must work together to take down the bosses.\n\nThe only in game item that can't be bought from simply playing alot is storage space and this is few pounds per storage bin but given the time spent if you enjoy, easily worth the investment. Heroes can be bought for 'Eternity Splinters' as well as the 'Team Up Heroes' (limited AI pet henchmen with some skill configuration and gear itemisation) which drop on a semi set period of time (approx one drop per 8-12 minutes of play).\n\nThe only negatives with this game (assuming you enjoy the type of game it is obviously) is that its still a bit of a beast to run on a PC and while patches are weekly (with an outstanding development team running things) bugs and wierdness continue to exist and creep into each update.\n\nAll in all its a game I really enjoy and if your bandwidth can take the initial download without problem, then please give it a try!","July 7, 2014","true","290.4"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","29","43","0","0"

The grind is supplimental to your entire account, not just characters so it ensures that you are constantly rewarded just for playing whatever you like and however you feel. There's 50+ classes and they release a new one every month. The ultimate ARPG grindsink. Insanely fast and satisfying gameplay with exploding environments, throwable cars, and large scale group fights. You can play and unlock everything solo too. Your choice.\n\nI bought a stash tab, a couple costumes and blew 25 bucks trying to gamble on BOGO hero tokens (and won) during one of their sales, but that still doesn't equal the money I've spent on AAA games and played fractions of the time. You can currently play the whole game for nothing and the unlocks are 1000% more generous than they were on launch.  You can even gamble on costumes for free if you want to become a prestige grinder. They give paid stuff away, even heroes all the time. There's a ton of different ways to play, more end game scalable content than paid-for-MMOS and some things I still haven't seen done in an ARPG to date. It seems like I try to get people into this game and they think they have to spend money, and absolutely do not.\n\nand the best thing: They finally fixed the performance on higher end gaming machines.\n\n9/10 mechafists\n\n\nFew negatives and things to address just to be fair though:\n\n- you are no longer forced to raid for that high end slot gear or medals. Everything can be unlocked via the rep vendors now and crafted. Raiders will get it quicker of course, but you don't need to kill a boss and hope that item drops anymore. This shouldn't translate as to "you don't have to work for anything and it's handed to you". This note is for people that played before and were possibly turned off by having to raid or for people that just don't like raiding. That said though the raids are actually really fun and mostly a zerg that takes 20 minutes or so. Nothing like a 4 hour wipefest for an MMO grind. You'll get a shot at gear and now you'll also get the currency to craft the same gear. You get the currency through events and quests outside of the raids albeit in much smaller quantites.\n\n- in the past the inventory system was a bit unfair and space was still limited. They revamped the stash and you can grind for in-game currency to unlock another tab. I've only had 2 tabs for  years now and it's enough to work with. It used to be pretty much that if you wanted to play on a 'serious" level you almost had to buy one. No longer.\n\n- peformance improved dramatically for me in the past couple patches. They finally went full 64 bit. If you didn't play before because it was laggy, try it again. The game was so fun and original feeling that I just dealt with it, but super glad that I can now play public zones with a full party and not suffer while actually helping my team do damage becuase I'm not lagging my ♥♥♥ off.\n\n- still need a pass on movement/travel powers for most of the classes. Teleporting heroes feel like playing a Ferrari compared to some people that can't even hop 10 feet in front of them while trying to catch up with the RAPID pace of the game. That said some people are just great to play despite their crap movement powers, but it's understandably trying to stick to their source characters. It would just be nice to have that not as a factor. It's pretty much irrelevant in some content though.\n\n- some of the older and original classes feel like abandoned Early Access games and need refreshing to catch up with the new heros where the team got WAYYY better at making new ones that feel more fluid, creative and interesting.\n\n- game is themed around MCU, so if there's a new movie, expect something new from the movie be it a costume, hero or events. This isn't entirely a negative, but it creates hilarious situations like getting all hyped about Spider Man in Civil War and then surprise, balance pass! Right now the Civil War characters are getting a bigger bonus than say the X-men, so it's not always favorable to your favorite character.\n\n- I'm not joking when I say maxing end game stats is grindy. Like I know you think Diablo 3 or Path are grindy because it might take a whole week to grind and/or trade for a set a gear in a new season, but you can't even fathom the Omega system, perfecting end game gear for multiple classes and so forth. It's a system that caters more to people that love theorycrafting and min/maxing, but the game is still fun for people that want to throw cars and just be a comic book hero here and there... but if you are completionist and want the most out of a particular character you enjoy, you are going to be in it for months and then more months. This is a pro for me, but it has to be noted.\n\n- some gear is event exclusive, meaning you'll have to wait until the event comes back around to grind/unlock it. This isn't a situation of say.. "you need this piece to play the character" by any means. I'm talking about maximizing. It's not always just kill a boss, or collect currency. The events keep the game insanely fresh from month to month and week to week, but it does have that bad side to where if you miss the event, you won't have access to the stuff on the vendor, but you will if you play during the event. The good thing is though, their events aren't disposable items. They are are some of the very best the game has to offer so the events are well worth it unlike most games that give you snowballs and cookies for xmas and pat you on your santa hatted head.","May 16","true","796.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I like the art style and the gameplay. What keeps me from playing though is the inventory. There are so many cards, fragments, shards, trinkets, and baubles that take up inventory space it drives me nuts! Every time I think about signing on and playing a little it's like getting into a closet that's so full of stuff you're afraid to open the door or it'll fall out on you.\n\nThis game has loot, like boots, weapons, gloves, capes, etc. The thing is, you don't just pick that loot up and sell it. I mean you could, but you'd be shorting yourself. No, what you do is you take it to either the crafting vendor or one of the item vendors and donate it, which levels that vendor up, and that unlocks new things you can buy (or craft). But even then, say you have a pair of boots or something and they're pretty nice, but don't get rid of them. Upgrade them with some of those shards and baubles you've been collecting! Provided you have the skills needed.\n\nThen there are these card merchants where you turn in cards to get... something, I don't know. It's just all too complicated. So many different currencies, collectibles, and different systems. You play a game like this to run around beating stuff up and seeing explosions all over your screen. This is a game where you spend half of your time messing around with your inventory and different NPC vendors. Not fun.\n\nI want to like this game. I actually spent some money on it to unlock some different heroes. But the thought of wrestling all those different systems keeps me from wanting to play.","February 8, 2015","false","12.7"," 164 of 294 people (56%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","56","164","294","19","15"

The developers seem to think the only content worth creating is more and more heroes. Worst yet, it is often new heroes with skill and abilities that are direct copy and paste from existing heroes kits.\n\nBut before you have to worry about hitting the "all aboard the new hero train", you must first get past the "unreasonably hard gearing boss". Where in, you have to grind out RNG on top of RNG to even be able to obtain the gear fitting of your characters best build. But even once you do, you are going to waste all of your accumulated in game currencies to re-roll that .1% drop chance item (This is actually generous, a lot of the best items are reported around .05% chance) you worked so hard to get, to make all of its applicable rolls high enough to be worth the effort in the first place.\n\nAfter all of that, if you are strong willed enough to stick around and want to play multiple heroes, you have to get "past the free-to-play gating" boss. This games restrictions on free-to-play players is the worst I have ever seen. Base in game storage is aweful. Just to hold all the reagents you need for crafting will take up all of your free stash space, and most of your inventory. But beyond that, to purchase new heroes for a free to play account you need eternity splinters. Those splinters are gated behind an in game cooldown, and only have a chance of dropping. Without hard to obtain or store bought potions, its about 1 splinter per 10 min or so with an average kill rate, which at 400-600 splinters needed for most heroes you are looking at 66-100 hours of in game grinding just to buy a single hero.\n\nThis games expectations of its playerbase are unreasonable, and will burn out a free to play player almost instantly. The only way the game can be consumed at an enjoyable pace is if you spend an ungodly amount of money at the in game store to circumvent what at its core, is a very unbalanced and underwhelming game.\n\nThe game was overall enjoyable for me until I hit end game and realized just what was expected of me to compete. But once you take a step back and look at the big picture, and realize just what you have to do to gear a single character, and then what it takes to purchase more, you can't help but be demoralized by the whole ordeal.\n\nI will likely only log in to check out any new content that  might come, however rare. But I can't see myself ever considering this a game I would spend most of my time in like I would have previous MMO's in my past.","December 28, 2015","false","471.3"," 180 of 326 people (55%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","55","180","326","16","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RETropolis/recommended/226320/","RETropolis","RETro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RETropolis/","709 products in account","Think Diablo meets Marvel Ultimate Alliance meets F2P MMO. While a fairly simple ARPG, it adds complexity in that every single character is its own class. Now there's 30+ characters, and a new one is added every month. Although you only get one character free at start and get an easy second when you complete the story campaign for the first time, you can grind currency to buy them in-game for free, or just drop real cash to make them available now. The majority of my characters I've gotten through this method, and I have roughly 1/3 of them.\n\nYou really get to feel like your favorite Marvel super hero in this game. When I lay down thunder and ice storms and tornadoes as Storm, or teleport around as Nightcrawler, or simply punch everything in the face as Hulk, it really gives you the feel good buzz that you are the character, not a generic hero like most ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes allow you to be. While it's fun making your own, I'd much rather play as the real deal. There is enough characters now that you don't often see more than one of your character on the board, depending on how new that character it is, and how popular it is.\n\nThe downsides to the game are mostly F2P related, including the multitude of in-game currencies that confuse your bank storage, and the fact that each bank storage slot costs $5 each. This is fairly expensive, and you need a decent amount once you have more than a few characters. I currently have something like 6 general bank slots (2 free, 4 bought), 2 crafter slots, and 6 Hero specific slots. I'll likely buy them all at some point as my bank fills to the brim with stuff I can't bear to sell. Also, costumes are really expensive, running from 4-15 dollars, about the same price as characters. While I definitely purchase a lot of them, I wait until the BOGO sales to do so, so I have a chance to get another one for another character I own. I've gotten quite a few free costumes this way.\n\nThere is raid content, cosmic, hard, and normal difficult boss fights, sandbox style street brawls across Manhattan and two wave spawn modes, the content is a bit thin. The campaign isn't really replayable, even if you play thru on another character, as the rewards are just too slow compared to the instanced boss fights you can level on. It does feel like the game needs more content, and the devs are creating more as we speak, including a bunch of new one shots, a new campaign chapter, and higher tier raids... something for everyone.\n\nWhen you first start, the game is easy. It doesn't really challenge you. Step one foot into the challenging door, raids, or terminals, or oneshot stories, and the game drastically goes up in difficulty. The campaign prepares you for this, however, as long as you don't go crazy and skip difficulty levels on the repeatable content. I found the game very satisfying the first way through. Now when I level a new character, I jump in the wave survival matches and level up 10x faster. The game's character synergies boost all of your character's stats as you reach lv50 with them, and boosts their XP gains when you hit 60 with each character.\n\nAlthough the F2P stuff and the limited content are a bit annoying, the game is still amazing and playing it is really fun. I love killing Magneto, and Dr. Doom and Loki over and over. Playing as Loki is equally as fun! Pick your favorite Guardian, X-man, Avenger, Fantastic 4, or other Marvel hero and give this a spin. It's free, so it only costs bandwidth to DL and install.","August 2, 2014","true","524.3"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

It's Diablo MMO style but in marvel universe. People complain about the fact you can't create your own character and you have to use the standard marvel heroes and you will find thousands of ironmans flying arround. But actually this is not the main problem in this game.\n\nI really don't mind to be forced play with the marvel characters and have to look same heroes everywhere. The REAL FACT of why I don't recomend this game is: Pay to Achieve/Unlock, but definitely not P2W.\n\nYou will start with one of "starter" heroes that, with the exception of Captain America and Punisher, aren't so popular between the fans. The most popular heroes are the most expensive and not available for starter heroes choice.\nThe only way to unlock those heroes for free is collecting Eternity Splinters, kind of special coin droped in map when you defeat enemies. The drop rate is 10 per hour and this is a big problem, because:\n\nMost popular and cool heroes cost for free: 600 eternity splinters\nMedium popular heroes: 400 eternity splinters\nComum heroes: 200 eternity splinters\n\nIf you want to unlock Ironman for example, you will have to play for long 20 hours doing the same thing: walking arround, killing mobs and collecting stuff....\n\nIS THIS GAME PAY TO WIN?\n\nNo. All heroes have a great potencial in diferent roles. All will depend of your playstyle, equipment and skill. You can buy the expensive Thor with real money or eternity splinters, but you still can be defeated by a cheap Black Widow.\n\nIS THIS GAME PAY TO FUN?\n\nYES. unless you like to play with the same heroe the entire campaign and expend weeks farming eternity splinters. I UNDERSTAND the company has to pay his taxes and this money have to come from somewhere. BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME IS MADE TO MAKE YOU BUY SOMETHING, YOU DON'T ACHIEVE NOTHING BY PLAYING THE GAME ITSELF. THERE IS NO CHALLENGE, NO OBJECTIVE, NOWHERE TO GO... JUST COMPLETE THE CAMPAIGN AND BUY OUR STUFF IN STORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S MARVEL UNIVERSE, WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE YOU ENJOY THE GAME.\n\nIn other words: Spend your money or get bored.\n\nThey already have the heroes and costumes market, the boosts and special services like portable crafter and power point reset. Is Eternity Splinters really necessary? The company will fall if the players could unlock the heroes spending in-game credits? The answer is no.\n\nThis game still standing only because it's Marvel. The good free to play games must follow some standards:\n\nFIRST play the game and enjoy;\nSECOND spend some money because you really liked the game.\n\nI'll take Neverwinter as an example of a good F2P game. The game is free, but is so creative and funny that make you spend money just for love by the game and the company.\n\nMarvel heroes just make the oposite: you will hate the game first and after spending some money, you will love it, a perfect example of a bad free to play game that should be a paid game: FIRST PAY AND SECOND HAVE FUN.","August 10, 2014","false","19.5"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","37","63","2","0"

Everything you could want and a marvel theme to go with it.\n\nThat said, in a flood of F2P games, it's average at best, there are no "OH DAYUM" moments, you won't ever be impressed, and from my limited game time, it's clear the devs have 1 goal, money.\nNow I'm all for making money, I'm the kind of user who will clear out your store, if it's value for money. I think things in F2P games are getting stupid these days though, and this game takes the cake.\n\nHeroes cost about $10 each. Cosmetic costumes also cost $10 each. I can buy so many good games for $10 and I mean $10 will get me 5-6 good games, that a costume or hero in a game for $10 is pathetic. I hate to think people would buy anything. I'd hate to know people who bought things.\nI'm all for supporting a game, but even games I consider rip offs like Heroes of the Storm still have prices better than this game, and the graphics, artstyle and game quality leave this game in the dirt.\n\nPersonally a hero of such low calibre should cost around $2, it's not like there isn't enough of them, $5 max, maybe if you bring out a truely impressive hero you can get away with $7.50. Costume don't deserve more than $0.50 just look at the screen shots, most people won't even know you have a different costume on!\n\nLike I said, the game is fun, but it's not amazing, the shop is huge, I think you could spend several thousand on this game without owning it's entire collection....

And i was truly surprised and delighted with what I found.\n\nThis game plays alot like the diablo games but with alot more additions, in essence its what diablo could have become.  The skill trees also synergize as in many skills will be upped in effectivness if you have other skills.  In addition there are lots of characters to play.  Every character you play in addiiton will add a synergy to all other characters which you must choose....these are an added bonus for using differing characters.

David Brevik, one of the lead devs on Diablo 1 and 2 is the President of the company and was involved in the games development. For whatever reason, I find MH to have more of the old skool D1-D2 playstyle than D3 does. D3 didn't hook me but MH did. The game features some rudimentary MMO style additions to the genre and many have dubbed it an MMOARPG. These features are pretty simplistic compared to a game like WoW but they do add a little something out of the norm for ARPGs.\n\nThe game had a really rocky start. I initially played it for a few weeks and quit once completing the story through. I picked it up again about six months later and there have been numerous changes to the game. New gameplay modes have been added aside from the regular story mode. There are group modes currently for 2 or 5 players that you can queue to run, as well as standalone maps that can be played through at any level.\n\nThey also fundamentally changed the way you can unlock new characters. Previously heroes had to be either bought for cash or you had to get lucky with a random (very rare) drop for a new hero. Now you are guaranteed to get eternity splinter drops which can be used to unlock new heroes. They don't come all that quickly though, so it will take awhile to unlock all of the heroes if you choose not to invest any cash in the game.\n\nIn a way this game is a little like Diablo meets Pokemon. Half the fun is in collecting the different heroes and leveling them. It is very "alt-centric".  There is a syngery system in the game that grants bonuses based on how many heroes you have at level cap as well as levels 25 and 50. This means that over time you will get substantial bonuses to XP earned as well as your heroes abilities. This makes leveling multiple characters get easy over time and can become quite addictive.\n\nThe game has weekly patches that usually involve some sort of server wide event. Some of these are great and some are a little underwhelming but it's nice that there is always something new going on. Content keeps being added and 10 man raids are coming soon.\n\nCaveats: It's a free to play game which of course means theres a store that you can crack out on if you aren't cautious with your spending. Heroes and costumes are expensive although they frequently have bundles and special deals that reduce the cost. It's expensive vs a standalone game but less so than a monthly MMO unless you go super nuts. I highly recommend that if you enjoy the game, at least drop $20 or so on some upgraded bank space (known as stash). That's one of the only things that you cannot get just by playing the game and is very useful.","May 29, 2014","true","835.4"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

The story is neither interesting nor boring – nor is it hero specific giving you little replay reasons, and you won’t ever get immersed into your character. The way they handle F2P means they want you to buy costumes – for ridiculous amounts of money, and as a result gear is absolutely boring and you’ll look like almost every other hero out there.\nHad Marvel Heroes not been an online F2P game, had this been an on- and offline game with a one-time purchase, I could see this being a ton more enjoyable and worth playing. Or even simply allowing you to pick from any of the super heroes on the list at the start, while pricing them all the same, would have been far more reasonable.\nAs it stands, Marvel Heroes is boring in its combat, boring as a loot hunting game and boring as an immersive experience with an incredibly unfair microtransaction system.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kDnfo3im3k","November 27, 2013","false","17.3"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","42","76","0","0"

Fun and pretty good about in game purchases.\n\nIn Detail\nAt this point, I've played two characters (Cable & Dr. Strange) fairly extensively but not to max level and some of the others up to the level 10 cap. You can of course pay (either real money or time gated in game currency) to uncap other characters and it seems worthwhile to do so (the slow free option does anyway) since every character I've played has felt different from the others even if they function the same way. There also isn't the overused tank, dps, support character type mechanic which for me is a plus (though some characters are definitely tankier than others).\n\nBeing F2P, there are of course some things that you can't get (or are very unlikely to get) without paying real money. Unlike many games with this monetization scheme, it doesn't really bother me as most of what's on offer is cosmetic or a variation on something you can get through other means and isn't pushed too hard (at least so far).\n\nThe gameplay itself is repetitive but fun. You'll take on hordes of enemies, most of which will die from a single shot if you're playing an area at level, with a few tougher ones thrown in for something to use your powers on besides a boss. Difficulty varies depending on the character as some are significantly less durable than others, but this generally fits the character as expected and as long as you can keep an eye on your health while fighting actually dying is a rarity.\n\nOn the whole, I'd recomend it as an F2P title since it doesn't have any "pay to win" mechanics that I've seen (yet) and is fun to play, especially with friends.\n\nI'll probably update this review when/if I reach Lvl 60 and see what the end game is like.","April 9","true","115.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

I played at launch and wasn't too impressed.  However, since then they have made many improvements and added a ton of heroes.  I will list the PROS and CONS from my experience so far:\n\nPROS\n\n* Plays great on even lower end hardware\n\n* Graphics are surprisingly good.  The character models aren't amazing, but the spell/power effects and such are a lot of fun to look at.\n\n* Combat is fun and fast-paced.  Some issues will be listed in CONS.\n\n* Hero build diversity is the cornerstone to this game IMHO.  Each hero is its own distinct class.  How many ARPGs out there have so many classes??  And they're from the Marvel universe to boot!\n\n* Story is comic-style and pretty fun.  It isn't really required for more playthroughs, but fun the first time.\n\n* MOST content is obtainable via ingame currency.  You can earn heroes and most good stuff if you play enough and play smart.  There is something here for casual and hardcore min/maxers alike.\n\n* Heroes can be played for free to level 10.  Then you can pick 1 for a free unlock.  So much better than it was earlier in the game's lifespan.\n\nCONS\n\n* It can be a little overwhelming and complex for new players.  I suggest checking Youtube for new players, especially those new to the ARPG genre.  Wilfred Wong is my favorite presenter on there as he explains things well, while still having some endgame knowledge for those looking to optimize.  Don't look to him for min-max, but he's a very nice guy and worth a look for beginner/intermediate players.\n\n* Inventory is insane.  You need to really understand what is and isn't worth keeping, which will take time.  If you have a large roster of heroes, it is EXTREMELY difficult to avoid having to buy space from Gazillion.  But, the game is free, so I personally don't mind paying for something, it's fun afterall.\n\n* Like any MMO-style ARPG, open world content can be a little nuts.  It's usually a zerg race to bosses/quest targets, as better geared players can melt down just about anything in a couple seconds or so.  But respawn isn't terrible and you can get what you need if you watch the map.\n\nTLDR: It's a fun game for Marvel fans and ARPG fans alike.  I say give it a little time if you feel overwhelmed with it all.  Check the Youtube I mentioned and hope you have fun!!!","March 28","true","373.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

A lot of the heroes play similarly to each other but they have enough of their own flavor to stand on their own. This game has a wonderful cash shop. The whole game is playable for free and you can earn currency to purchase heroes. This is a game I have been willing to put money into because the cash shop is so fair. It boils down to buffs, costumes, and heroes if you don't want to wait to get the ones you want.\n\nGazillion has done a great job of introducing heroes with incredible frequency and even heroes that a lot of people feel are underpowered are still totally viable for leveling if they are a character that you feel strongly about. You can't go wrong trying this game out.","December 28, 2014","true","328.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I used to play Dream of Mirror Online. I like anime/cartoon style games and this satisfies my taste fully. I'm especially a Marvel fan, growing up with every action figure known to exist and collecting comics and really love that this game brings heroes and villains that I haven't seen in years to life!!\n\nIt may sound uber geek, but when I first fought Mr. Sinister, I think I may have yelped like, "oh snap, I had him as a toy when I was a kid!" Now next to nostalgic reasons for playing this game, I'll list below the reasons why I actually love the gameplay and content.\n\nThis game doesn't have a really tough grind to level up to 60 scale. It's fairly easy but fun in the process as you learn so many mechanics that are built into the game. From designing the build that best suits the skills you like to use, to hunting for unique items and skill combinations that work best. It's a great game.\n\nAs far as content is concerned, there has been a weekly event each week I've played so far and the release of new Heroes and Teamup Heroes. The devs at Gazillion are putting forth effort to revise characters that may need a review suggested by players of the game from what I can tell. It's very well balanced and has many different angles to play the game which keeps it fresh.\n\nThe characters in the game are many, which is great and once you level up to 60 you can Prestige your character up to Prestige 6. The more heroes you bring up to 60 the bigger experience bonuses you get to help level other heroes you get.\n\nIt's not a pay to win game as anything in the game can be purchased by playing the game and saving up. I willingly purchased inventory space and a costume because I found one of my favorite characters to play with, Dr. Strange!!\n\nAll in all, I suggest giving this game a shot as the community is very helpful and fun to chat with. This is by far the best game I've played in a long time and so much to learn and do in the game, I can't seem to put it down and do homework! lol Again the community freakin' rocks!! So yea I'm not sure about other reviews and they're gripe with the game but the ones that play and are in-game love it.\n\nTry it for yourself and make your own educated decision :)","October 8, 2014","true","346.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Do you wish Torchlight 2 had a constant community to interact with ingame? Do you enjoy Path of Exile, but sometimes want an easier and less hardcore experience? Then Marvel Heroes might be your go to game this summer!\nDon't let reviewers shy you away from the game because a lot of its problems from last June have been fixed (mostly). The game does still have its problems and shortcomings. As of writing this they still do not have a proper trade menu, which every MMO ever has gotten right if they were made in the past decade.\nCharacters are imbalanced but a lot of the free starter characters offer fun diverse playstyles. After completing story mode you'll be offered the ability to get another free one. Heroes are no longer random drops, but rather awarded to you for playing long periods of time. The only real thing that only money can buy is storage space.\nYes this game is not as great as Dota2 or Path of Exile at the Free2Play Model, but it isn't the worst anymore. All heroes have been marked down since the original release and are (for the most part) priced fairly for the amount of time a person invests in the hero. There's also a server called Test Center that allows you to test out a character at the max level, to see if you'll enjoy the character before ever buying them. Something that was a major problem at the game's initial release.\nHonestly the game has come a long way since last June. However the lack of a trade system, quickly running into inventory management, no autosort option for items, weird chat UI, and lack of partying incentive during the grind from 1 to 60... really holds the game back from being a major recommendation. However if you're a fan and want to try a new Diablo style lootfest, Marvel Heroes might be worth your time.","June 2, 2014","true","829.6"," 59 of 111 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","59","111","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theslorg/recommended/226320/","theslorg","TheSlorg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theslorg/","302 products in account","This game ranks as one of the best free to play games on Steam as of this writing.\n\nA game similar in feel and gameplay to the Diablo and Torchlight games, only you get to play through as your favorite Marvel heroes (and a few villains) - with new characters being introduced regularly. The initial character selection is limited to a few basic heroes, but complete the story mode and you will unlock another random hero for free. Additionally, while you can pay real money to unlock any hero you want (as well as customizing them with various costumes), you can earn every hero in the game for free by collecting Eternity Splinters that drop from time to time.\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward. Click on an enemy to attack them, with up to six special ability hotkeys (and plenty of skills to choose from). One downside is that many heroes play very similarly at the earlier levels, though you do begin to see some differences as you progress and unlock new abilities, with every hero having a unique ultimate attack that can be unlocked and upgraded.\n\nLoot is a big draw here. Like all Diablo-style games, loot will drop regularly and in the familiar rarities (grey garbage, white normal, green uncommon, blue rare, purple epic) as well as a few others (yellow cosmics, red artifacts, gold uniques). Old loot can be sold or 'donated' to a shopkeeper which will, over time, upgrade that shopkeeper so that he or she will offer better items or services.\n\nAnother benefit of this game is that there are many events that take place which offer chances to get items for free that you might otherwise have to pay for. And speaking of paying for items... this is hardly a 'pay to win' game. Sure, you can pay for an experience boost if you want to level up faster, or you can pay for a potion that will give you a better chance at scoring really good loot, but most pay items are cosmetic. Costumes, pets, and so forth. And while pets can give you small boosts to your stats over time, you can earn free pets that do the same thing.\n\nWhile it isn't exactly breaking any new ground or stepping into new territory, Marvel Heroes is a great game to pass the time either solo or with friends, and if you ever get stuck, the community is generally quite helpful to newer players. I'd recommend this game to anyone, even non-gamers.","December 1, 2014","true","167.6"," 45 of 84 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","45","84","7","0"

Secondly, your customisation options are very limited - it's a Marvel game and they're ferociously protective of their characters' images, so apart from the preset costumes you're basically limited to cosmetic effects like glowing auras, you can't customise your characters' appearance to any real degree.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's a pretty solid Diablo clone, the different characters all play sufficiently differently to each other to make it interesting, and you can unlock all the characters for free if you're patient enough. There's some things you can't earn ingame - such as additional bank slots - and some like costumes which you can theoretically earn in game, but the drop rates are absolutely terrible. But it's just cosmetic and quality-of-life stuff which you need to buy, if you don't mind a bit of grinding you can unlock everything else without paying anything.\n\nUltimately it comes down to how much of a Marvel fan you are - there are better ARPGs on the market, but none of them have such a strong brand behind them, and if you're even a casual fan of the comics, cartoon series or films, being able to play as the characters will probably be all the counragement you need. And if you're still not sure, it's competely free to play with no restrictions on what free players can access, so you may as well give it a go and see for yourself whether you like it.","November 25, 2013","true","231.7"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoy this game. It's made by the original creators of Diablo and Diablo II so it has that feel to it, which works surprisingly well in the Marvel universe. Although a lot of the content can be paid for to unlock, you can also earn 90% of it in-game, without having to spend a dime. It's pretty well balanced, so that it doesn't take a ridiculously long time to earn something. You don't feel like your hand is being twisted to buy things with real money, which is a breath of fresh air in games like this.\n\nThe graphics are above average, if you don't have a decent PC it will struggle a little bit. The gameplay is pretty much identical to Diablo and similar action RPG games. There's a lot to this game I could spend hours talking about, but overall I would definitely recommend it.

You get an excellent game, that's what! The game is truly free-to-play requiring nothing to be spent for anything in the game (except time played if you want to buy more heroes). Of course like any good f2p game you can optionally spend money to buy exactly what you want when you want it. No matter what though, either way you approach Marvel Heroes 2015 you are in for a treat. The only real downside to the game is the same downside to every single ARPG. I gets VERY grindy at the end. Fortunately rather than just grinding the end-game indefinitely, new heroes (classes) are released every single month. On top of that so far a handful of new game modes have been added every few months or so as well.

I don't worry about seriously gearing up to min/max etc. I don't have to. My incentive to play the game is for fun and to earn more characters to play through eternity splinters. I was in beta and the way the cash shop and Free to play system worked was terrible. It is much improved. The only thing you really need to pay for in this game is STASH Tabs for quality of gameplay purposes as well as convenience. The costumes are optional and for cosmetic purposes and the best way to obtain it is via store. I haven't bought any costumes because I find paying for STASH tabs are more productive.\n\nLeveling,Earning more characters to play, eternity splinters, and Fun, is reason enough to hop on and play from time to time. I however wouldnt play this game to a hardcore extent, its a hop on and hop off type of game.\n\n9/10 "Great Casual A-RPG Game"\n\n2016 Review:\n\nI would edit the last part and say that I would play the game to a hardcore extent cause there are now options to do so with raids and grinding for artifacts, its a really fun time.

I played this game when it first came out, and even though it was OK, it didn't impress me that much. However, I heard TotalBiscuit recommend the current version a LOT, he basically rediscovered the game and was playing it a ton. And, well, I tried it and was hooked quickly, and the improvements made to the game ever since it was launched make it a LOT better.\n\nSo, basically, this is a Diablo-type game, kinda "Diablo in the Marvel Universe". However, IMO, the game makes you feel much more powerful than Diablo ever does. You will run into screens absolutely filled with mobs, and then commence to blow up that screen with your powers. There is tons of loot, and inventory space can become an issue, so I recommend to set the option to auto-destroy grey and white gear. You can also level your pet by "vacuuming" up gear you don't need, and you wanna donate a ton of gear to level crafters for better item mods etc.\n\nAnyway... the game is SO much fun. It's not deep or anything, it's basically "run around and blow up everything". But gosh, you DO feel powerful. It's a blast.\n\nEach character really is different, plays differently. You have ranged guys like Cyclops or Hawkeye, each with different abilities, or you can smash enemies as Hulk or Colossus etc. It's quite impressive how they came up with that many different character-abilities and "styles", as they actually DO feel a lot different. Example: Both Cyclops and Iron Man can be specced for long range fighting (or melee), and they do feel different, so it's not just "two ranged guys who just look different".\nEven more off-beat chars like Ant-Man are cool, that one is a personal favorite, and so is Deadpool, who is, appropriately, totally bonkers.\n\nThe game actually IS F2P. You can play for free, and when you start, you can choose ONE character to level beyond level 10 (you can play most characters to level 10 at any time). You can unlock more characters by grinding for Eternity Splinters, or buy them at the store for ingame-currency. If you are into cosmetics, you can buy several very cool or even legendary costumes for those chars (esp. Iron Man, Cyclops, Spiderman, Cap etc.). However, those are cosmetic, so this is not "P2W" or anything.\n\nI am not much into the endgame, so I am just having a blast running around with some of the characters I have loved since childhood, enjoying playing them a lot, regardless of which one is best for endgame or whatever.\n\nSure, the game can be grindy, but it is very alt-friendly. Each char you level unlocks special perks (you can choose which ones you use) for your alts, and leveling speeds up the more you level your characters. You can either play the story-mode, grind the legendary quest and challenges, or simply do stuff like "Monday Midtown Madness", which is a rush.\n\nI am not sure whether this is the kind of game you wanna "binge-play". I love to play it for an hour or so each day to blow off some steam, get my mind off of things. As I said, it's not terribly deep, but terrific fun, so it's a great game to just run around and blow up thousands of mobs.\nAnd- if you are a Marvel-fan, this is like paradise.So many iconic characters and costumes (like from classic comic issues, or the Ultimate series, or the movies etc.), so many references to the comics... just amazing.\n\nIf you are into Diablo-type games, give this a try. If you are into Marvel, same. If you are into both, knock yourself out, I am pretty positive you will enjoy the heck out of this. Performance is good, even though slower PCs might struggle with screens full of mobs and explosions.\nLoving it, and big kudos to the dev team for turning this into a much better game and putting so much fun stuff and so much Marvel-lore into this. Just... FUN!\n\nPros:\n- Great variety of heroes, which all feel different\n- Lots of Marvel lore\n- Nice visual style\n- Actual F2P. You have to grind for more heroes, but you CAN, even without investing money (unless we talk about inventory)\n- FUN\n- Great performance even with gazillion mobs on screen on a decent PC\n- Lots of events and references to current comics and movies\n- Solo-friendly if you prefer that\n- Alt-friendly (VERY)\n\nCons:\n- Inventory space will run out VERY VERY quickly. Your heroes share bank-and bag-space. If you wanna collect relics and legendaries, crafting mats and items you might use later (some items are char-specific, some can be used by any char), you will most likely have to buy more space. This is the only money I invested here.\n- Can be grindy, YMMV\n- Some quests might be bugged.

I actually have had more positive interactions with social chats than any other game I have seen, but of course, chats can get toxic as with anything else, be ready for those small moments.

Marvel Heroes has a large roster of heroes to choose from and while you can acquire them through micro-transactions it is completely optional, you can get all the heroes through collecting “eternity splinters” which you can trade them off for heroes of your choice. While getting heroes can be done at the cost of nothing, getting “fancy” new costumes for your heroes does cost money. Marvel Heroes has a large storyline which you can play through and the developers constantly add more and more chapters, might I say you can play through the whole storyline for free if you’re wondering. Marvel Heroes is if you haven’t guessed yet is a lot like Diablo so if you’re a fan of that game and a fan of marvel then this game is perfect for you. There are lots to do in Marvel Heroes from occasional events, players vs. players and lots of different things you can do after you have finished the story.

Everyone who played it at launch fully admits that the game was ♥♥♥ on toast then.  Currently, Marvel Heroes is a fantastic ARPG well worth looking at.\n\nUnlike a lot of ARPGs that have come down the pike since Diablo 2, what the devs at Gazillion rightly realize is that the reason that D2 was so beloved was that it's just plain fun to mow down gigantic hordes of mooks like a hot knife through butter, slowing down only to sort your loot or focus on a boss (or four).  The source material fits perfectly with this gameplay - of course Iron Man or Hulk can smash through absurdly large numbers of foes without breaking a sweat, something would be wrong if they couldn't.\n\nCouple this with attack effects as flashy as you'd expect from comic books (and the fact that you can't help blowing up/breaking virtually everything in sight) and it's basically the perfect ARPG for the ADD set.\n\nMoreover, Marvel Heroes is massively generous as a free to play game; you've got 9 different characters to choose from at start and every single character in the game can be unlocked for free just by playing the game.  Sure, you can buy characters with money if you want but don't feel like you have to in order to play the game, most of the starters are perfectly viable.  The only thing that absolutely can't be gotten via just playing is extra stash space, but by the time you've played long enough to really need/want more you'll probably have gotten enough entertainment value to lay down a few bucks.\n\nGazillion is a developer that patches and updates the game incredibly often (sometimes too often, but they're getting better) and they're fantastic with communicating with the playerbase.  New heroes are coming out pretty much every month.\n\nThis is not the hardest ARPG around, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, but it's well worth checking out and a lot of fun.","January 5, 2014","true","316.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This game has great potential.  I love all the different characters and the gameplay is fun.  However this game still needs a lot of work.  It's structured poorly when doing quests or trying to follow a poor excuse for a story.  I found myself wasting a lot of time wandering around just to do a single quest because many of them have no quest tracker to tell you where it's at.  This gets really annoying.  I compare this game to diablo 3 naturally and it just seems to need an awful lot of work and improvement.  Till then I'm done for now.  For those just looking to play the game for the sake of grinding and destroying things and not caring for a great story or a well structured game, knock yourselves out.  Hopefully the Devs put alot of work into updating the story and make the quests easier to find as well as a better mini map.

This game is chock full of flavorful tidbits that delight in every sense.\nThe customization for builds is nearly limitless and the same hero can be in a group with two different builds and feel like two totally different heroes.\nThe endgame is MASSIVE. There are a lot of things to do once at max level, and the game even has options to rerun the level up process for your favorites, with some cool benefits for those who choose to do so.\nSolid gameplay and controls. This game feels very polished and complete. Brevik's team knows their stuff.\nThe game is genuinely and oftentimes GLORIOUSLY fun.\nThis is how Free-to-Play SHOULD be done. You have access to most things without ever LOOKING at a store to spend real money. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you can get access to whatever your heart desires (for the most part).\n\nThe Turn-offs:\nLack of fresh content. Though there is a full storyline mode, it feels short (which the game has on 3 difficulty modes, so you run it 3 times to totally complete the story on a character). The One-Shots and Raids have their own storylines, but they are mostly setups to boss fights, and not a ton of character progression. The new Ultron game mode also has a story, but it isn't anything to be impressed about.\nDepending on who your favorite character is, you may be completely useless in a raid setting, being forced to level up a raid-appropriate character to run on if you wish to participate in raids.\nRepetition. This game has it. In spades. This game has it. In spades. Repetition.\n\nSummary:\nThis game is worth playing through and is a very solid MMO that is fun. There is stuff constantly being added to the game and plenty of events in which to participate. So Assemble your team and get to Smashing.\nExcelsior!\n\n(P.S. Plenty of cameos.

Marvel Heroes as a game has grown a whole lot since its really bad release. Various numbers and formulas have changed for damage calculating, and heroes have been revamped (making OP heroes less OP while making the boring and weak heroes a hell of a lot more fun).\n\nSince my departure from the game, I can't say that a whole lot of content has been added, because it hasn't. However, end game content has been revised and the game as a whole gets better each week thanks to the Devs working really REALLY close with the community in terms of QA and asking the players how each Hero feels with each and every new patch that is released.\n\nIn terms of the f2p of the game, the heroes arent as pricey, they are all much more acceptable with most of them costing less than 10 dollars, leaving a small few which include IronMan, Deadpool and Spider-Man (and maybe one or two more I cannot remember) costing around 12 bucks. With costumes still being roughly the same price they always were (varrying from 10 for the average skin and 20 for a Enhanced skin) as that is now their main source of revenue. But this is all because Heroes are much more easy to obtain in game now with the addition of a new currency that the player earns as they play overtime. With the currency players can now save up to purchase their desired hero (for varrying costs) or can opt-in for a much cheaper "gacha bag" option where the player buys a random hero at a reduced price.\n\nAll in all I recommend checking out this game if you are at least a fan of ARPGs, its not quite on the same level as Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile just yet, however I have no doubt that it is getting there. If you don't believe me check out their weekly patch notes, its crazy how many things are changed each and everytime.\n\n7.6/10....for now!","January 5, 2014","true","359.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On June 07, 2015 at 12:09 PM PDT I submitted a support ticket to their customer service team requesting assistance with 2 items that been removed from my character as a result to patch 1.55. As of 12/26/2015 at 2154 hours (202 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes and 0 seconds since I've opened the ticket), Gazillion Entertainment has yet to assist me with remotely anything close to an attempt to resolve the problem. I have since changed my positive review to a negative review and would not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nThe reason I have changed my review from a positive to negative, as well as, would not recommend the game to anyone is because if they're going to utilize a Free-to-Play ("F2P") business model, and  then make no effort to keep a customer reasonably happy (basically just take your money and tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off), then Gazillion does not deserve a positive review. Future customers should know that if you have a problem with MH that requires customer support, then don't hold your breath.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n_____________________________________________________________\nAlthough Marvel Heroes had a rocky start, they've made vast improvements to the game in positive ways. The game still has a long way to go to be considered extraordinary, but is a great game in its current state. Beginning with the negative aspects, many heroes (who were with the game at launch) are in dire need of rework (which they are actively working on, but no ETAs as of 28 NOV 2013). Additionally, new heroes (such as Loki and Gambit), are lack luster and Gazillion Entertainment has failed to launch these heroes as quality polished products, which has upset the community. Simply put, once the heroes are released, they're forgotten for the most part, but they typically do a round of nerfing in the form of bug fixes and/or leave the character greatly under tuned for weeks. However, on the positive side, they have a large hero roster that is growing and they do actively push patches fairly often. Of the recently reworked heroes that they have completed, they have done an exceptional job with them. If you're looking for a fun dungeon crawler that is centered around the Marvel Universe, then I certainly would recommend giving this Free to Play game a try. Also, please note that unlike most F2P games, Marvel Heroes has a lot of ways to get things without buying them, of course it takes some investment of time, but they're obtainable. 4:5 stars, 85/100.","November 28, 2013","false","565.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't listen to them. This is a wonderful game that is absolutely worth your time, especially if you're a fan of ARPGs such as Diablo, Torchlight, the Sacred series, etc.\n\nIt plays EXACTLY like them, but in the Marvel universe, with marvel characters. And boy, are there a lot of characters to play as. There's over 40 I believe, and they just keep adding to that number semi-frequently.\n\nThere are three difficulties to play. You start in normal mode, and as you complete the campaign mode, you'll unlock the other two. The higher difficulties will give you better loot drops, more gold, more experience, etc.\n\nThis game has a lot of unique things going on that make it even more sensational. There's an omega system, which is basically paragon levels from D3, but it's really interesting, and there's a TON of variety, which in turn, makes customizing your character almost an endless affair. You can do so many things with one hero, it's amazing.\n\nThere's this feature called "Team-ups" which I think are pretty cool as well. They're essentially pets, but in the form of other heroes that'll tag along with you. However, you can outfit them and customize their abilities as well, so it really adds even more depth to your ever-growing ARPG OCD :P\n\nThere's also PvP and group play, which is to be expected from an online game. Group play is pretty cool, as you'll drop down in an area and team up with nearby heroes to take down tough baddies. Don't worry though, there's no fighting over loot, it all drops seperately for each character.\n\nHonestly,  it's just great fun. If you love superheroes, if you love ARPGs, it's the perfect match for you. You can purchase every hero/team-up in the game for free. The currency, eternity splinters, drop frequently and a person is more than capable of not spending a dime on this game. That being said, you have nothing to lose, and I guarentee you'll have some fun if you give it a shot.","August 23, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Came back to it recently after hearing about the changes and despite the stigma of a free to play... it is incredibly fun. You can unlock heroes without money in an expected amount of time. The hardest thing to do without spending money, is inventory control. You won't have access to a ton of inventory slots so you would need to be careful. But the game is worth 40 dollars. I had 50 hours in easy. No plan to stop. So throwing 10-20 bucks at later on for quality of life is a no brainer. I have paid a lot of more games that kept me a lot less entertained and of a much lower quality. Heroes is excellent. Beyond that, the crew that works on the game is amazing. The devs join in on streams, they listen to the community. We vote on new hero releases. It is definitely worth your time and if you want to definitely worth a couple dollars later on.","June 14, 2014","true","395.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Pick somebody that doesn't really have super powers, which in my case was Black Widow.\nSuddenly things felt a lot nicer. Overcoming challenges felt more in line with the character, and beating a C-List villain after a long boss battle feels satisfying instead of weird.\n\nSo, if you try out the game, do yourself a favour and pick a character that "shouldn't" be that strong, and you'll have a far better time.\nBeyond that very specific gripe it's a decent, if very, very run of the mill isometric MMORPG. There's a decent main plot, tons of barely distinguishable loot, a pile of monetization mechanics (but no "stamina" or avoidable revive penalty or something, so it's not quite that bad).\nAs a free game it's worth a look, whether you stick with it is very much dependent on your resistance to tedium.","May 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Since release the game has improved with their monthly patches adding more to the story and endgame content to make grinding less monotonous with multiple ways to level and find loot. Developers listen to the community and constantly makes improvements with to the heroes and game play.\n\nStarting Hero's are decent but be careful. Once you select one of the starters you will have to stick with that one until you find one via the drop system or buy one via collecting shards in game or real money. I think they should give you 2 starts to try to avoid slight stress on what to pick first.\n\nIt's a fun game. I would give it a shot if you want Diablo with Marvel characters. I spend a few hours on it a week. Its a good time killer if anything.

Six months ago I would've not recommended this game and not given it a second thought. I'm really glad I decided to pick it up again recently, all of the new additions to the game have made it much more fun and a bit addicting. I'm often hesitant about free to play games of this style as I have found they usually tend to have a large amount of important content that needs to be bought to really play the entire game. I have found that's really not the case here. While there may be a few convenience issues for non-paying players (primarily in STASH space) the payment model is actually quite fair, with nearly everything in the game available through in-game currencies, including every hero and team-up hero. If you like the Marvel universe, or ARPGs in general you should definitely give it a shot.","September 2, 2014","true","804.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, when you find your favorite marvel heroes you will grow to love and enjoy their playstyle and their personality and will be happy to find the first marvel game with all of the iconic powers of a character accessable.

They tend to release a new playable Hero each month as well as weekly bug fixes and some other content such as weekend events etc.\n\nIn terms of Content it is releasing PvP and Raids in Beta with Raids being out of Beta in a few weeks. Also other game modes are added such as X-Defense which is a wave based mode which was not implented on release. One Shot terminals which are small story arcs. Shared Quests that allow you to group up. Plus there is other stuff coming in the coming months such as Endless Dungeons.\n\nNow to the Free to Play part. People who say this is pay to win are clearly unaware that all heroes can be bought without spending a penny. Yes it will take time to earn but the game is by no means pay to win. the only thing you will need to purchase is bank space and even that is not a necesity if you can keep your inventory tidy and are willing to not horde items.\n\nFinally the Devs. Anyone who does go on the forums for this game will be aware of how active the devs are. They take alot of community feedback on board and try to gear the game to be enjoyed by the player.\n\nIf your not a superhero fan then maybe this isnt for you as much but it is a great way to get into the universe of Marvel.\n\nBrilliant Game and Enjoyable for most ages in my opinion. 10/10 and best superhero game i have played","June 16, 2014","true","882.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There are a few things to do besides playing the story missions of the game such as the open public dungeon Mid-town Manhattan and specific challenge terminals with a boss at the end, you can also queue up for X-Defence which is a survive as many waves of enemies as you can solo or with a group, and the Fire vs Ice PVP arena. More content is arriving monthly with new story missions and challenge terminals and of course new heroes and new costumes.\n\nFREE TO PLAY:\nWhen you create an account over at https://marvelheroes.com/ and login to the game from Steam you will be able to select one free “starter hero” from a pre-set roster. Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Thing, Daredevil and Storm were the original starter heroes you could pick from at launch several months ago. I’ve heard from other people that Gazillion has changed this a little and that certain heroes have been added to the starter hero roster, namely Captain America. I can’t confirm this because I already have Cap in my main roster.\n\nYes Marvel Heroes is free to play, you don’t need to pay for new heroes if you don’t want to… but you will be required to grind fairly hard if you want to unlock your desired hero. A special item called an Eternity Splinter can drop at random at any time during the game when you defeat an enemy, you will need to collect anywhere from 400-600 of these to unlock one hero of your choosing.\n\nYour best bet to play as the hero you want is to actually purchase him or her, the average single hero pack will run you around $20 US currency or less.. There are some benefits to doing this.\n\n-You unlock your favourite hero right away, no grinding for weeks to earn Eternity Splinters.\n-You get your heroes STASH tab, this is an extra inventory tab in your shared STASH locker. Stash tabs at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.\n-You get an additional costume or two for your hero. Costumes at the moment cannot be unlocked with Eternity Splinters.\n\nPAY TO WIN:\nYes and No. There is a cash shop in the game where you can buy new heroes, stash tabs, costumes and items such as temporary XP boosters or Retcon devices which reset you’re heroes skill points so you can re-allocate them. The only real advantage a paying player has over a non-paying player at the moment is the XP boosters so they can level up a lot faster and the ability to buy more stash tabs for inventory space. There are usually a fair amount of seasonal sales in the cash shop throughout the year.\n\nHEROES and VILLAINS:\nThere is a large roster of heroes to choose and play as, like..\nIron Man, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Gambit, Emma Frost, Storm, Colossus, Deadpool, Cable, Spider-Man, Rocket Raccoon, Ghost Rider, Luke Cage, Punisher and many more.\n\nIncluding some upcoming heroes and villains that have been announced for a release in 2014 such as Magneto, Juggernaut and Venom.\n\nEach hero for the most part plays differently than the next and has many different skill trees to put points into as you level up. You can literally have two people playing as Thor with two very different skill tree builds leaving you with two very different play styles.\n\nThe basic types of heroes are you standard melee and ranged heroes… and those who are a hybrid of both. Spider-Man is a great example because depending on how you spend his level up points you can build him as a pure melee or pure ranged hero.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you loved Marvel: Ultimate Alliance on the Playstation or are a comics fan and loved the Diablo series, then you will feel right at home here. Marvel Heroes continues to get better each month in terms of re-balancing and content being added, this game has come a long ways for a “Free to Play” game in one short year.\n\nIt is almost criminal that this game is free to play because it is very fun and addicting, especially if you are willing to pony up the dough and purchase a few of your favourite heroes.","January 4, 2014","true","919.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Being able to fling Squirrels at enemies and seeing them explode makes this game an automatic 8/10. Everything else added on top of that averages out to be about 20/10. A little unfair perhaps? Perhaps you don't judge squirrel flinging as astutely as needed.\n\nThe game follows the Diablo format while adding plenty of reasons to actually spend money on it. You can, in theory and practice, play this game for free. So go ahead. Yet, when you want to join in on the squirel chunking antics, go ahead and drop a few dollars on a great experience.\n\nThis game is executed better than the new Diablo, but still feels like the design team is missing out on a few things. The UI could use some work and finding your way around feels too chaotic considering their attempt at a flowing narrative. The story seems to follow one straight line, yet they seem to have multiple instances of HUBs and a confusing array of shops and needlessly difficult crafting options. With the amount of loot the enemies drop, you'd assume a better labeling system would allow you to sort and pick better. It doesn't. A simple Green or Red arrow would allow me to see if equipment was better or not. I understand that each bit is entirely unique in some cases, but mostly, the amount of judgements I have to make is a little tiring compared to other titles.\n\nIgnore Metascore and try this game.

It can be annoying because in most other jobs you'd get fired for something like this, but that's besides the point.  Oh and the community managers like to delete any type of post they don't agree with and may or may not suspend your account on the forums (not in the actual game) so beware.  I try to avoid the forums because of this and I also feel and others agree wholeheartedly that the community managers like doomsaw are very unprofessional.

That is to be expected in game with the Marvel universe Canon and the expected amount of playable heroes.  But, when playing it really seems they relied heavily on older mechanics and really went for nothing innovative or new and that is REALLY dissapointing.\n\nbut once again, for a free to play game-where every hero can be won or purchased using free in game currency, it is definitely (at least) a must try.","August 9, 2014","true","362.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game wasn't the greatest but Brevik and team did not give up and the game is worth what i have spent on it.  I bought a large amount of Gs which I have barely spent any.  I'm not a costume guy or feel the need to get every hero soon as they come out.  So the $100 or so I've spent which has kept me occupied for at least 6 months and prevented me from buying a new game has been worth it.\n\nThe actual review:  If you're into Diablo and the endless item grind that it is then this game is for you.  The amount of heroes will never end and make this game the most repetitive game ever played.  I do enjoy it as a game that i can pick up and play anytime and there is at least something new be it a hero i have yet to get to or actual content.\n\nActual content added within the year:\n1 Midtown madness an endless instance which isn't the greatest content.\n2 x-defense wave like survival mode for 5 players.  Holo sims wave like survival mode for 1-2 players.\n3 Omega & Synergy systems that equates to more grinding the same content (account leveling).\n4 Enchanting a new crafter\n5 Asgard content (thor dark world content)\n6 Man ape one shot story (actual content)\n7 Muspelheim raid (actual content but hard to get in unless you're part of a large group)\n\nSo as you can see as far as actual new content and new stuff to do its very limited.  Compared to releasing 1 hero a month (and now team ups) you can tell where their focus was and continues to be.  This game to me feels like it's still in beta since they still haven't completed the full review of the starting heroes.  But it's on the right track and the next year is/will be exciting with the release of villains and another one shot that's on the list for sure.","August 9, 2014","true","831.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Of course you did!\nDo you enjoy the Marvel movies that have been bringing us pretty colors, bright lights, loud sounds, and Scarlet Johansson in a skintight catsuit? Of course you do!\n\nNow that we've confirmed those two things let me tell you why Marvel Heroes 2015 is the game you’ve been looking for all your life.\nTo start with, it’s not Marvel Heroes!  That’s a good thing.  Marvel Heroes was the bottom rung, the last horse out the gate and the farthest from the finish line.  Over the past year Gazillion Entertainment has been turning that withered nag into a proud, polish, thoroughbred of the ARPG community.\n\nIf you’re anything like me, you were disappointed with Diablo 3.  Sure it was fun, but it lacked that certain element of chaotic delight that made Diablo 2 an entertainment darling. Well, folks, Marvel Heroes was made by many of the same folks that made Diablo 2 what it is.  This IS the spiritual successor to Diablo 2, with the bright shiny veneer of the Marvel universe lacquered onto it!\n\nLove Spider-man? You can be Spider-man.\nLove Wolverine? Well, bub, crack open a cold one cause he’s here too!\nAre you heralding the coming of Galactus? Silver Surfer was added to the playable heroes list on June 21st 2014!\nMore heroes are added every month. If your favorite character isn’t playable now he will be soon!\n\nI know what you’re thinking “But it’s F2P, that means the character I want to be is locked behind a paywall.” WRONG!   Anything you want in this game you CAN get without ever spending a dime, and it doesn’t even take time grinding to make it happen. On average I can unluck a hero every two weeks, just by playing 1 hour of this game a day. That’s 14 hours, that’s one lazy Saturday when you’ve got nothing to do!\nIf you want it you can achieve it. The only things locked behind a paywall are cosmetic items, and even those have a randomized chance of being unlocked for you through the games crafting system!\n\nFolks, if you love comics, if you love super heroes, if you love good ARPGs, this is the game for YOU! Give it a try. It’s free, it’s fun, and you’ve got nothing to lose but one lazy afternoon!\nIf you join the legion of fans look me up in game. I’m TheFiveVirtues, representing the Skrull Infiltrators, if you want a fun SG, or just need some help learning the ropes I’ll be happy to help you out!","June 20, 2014","true","672.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's just pure explosive smashy-flashy fun, just what I want in my isometric hack-and-slash games. Do not be fooled by the low Metacritic score, this game has been improved vastly since the (admittedly pretty awful) launch.\n\nThe F2P model doesn't require you to spend a penny, no content is blocked off and almost everything in the game has a chance to drop. You're not forced into MMO-mode either, unless you feel like teaming up and kicking some villainous butt. It's perfectly possible (with some informed hero/build/gear choices) to solo 95% of the content. PVP is also entirely optional and still in the works, but looking promising.\n\nIf (like me) you enjoy your Pretty Princess Dressup and have a bad case of Alt-itis, then you will be hooked by the cosmetic choices and ever-growing roster. The game's sparkly visuals are accompanied by some of the best voice-work I've ever heard in any ARPG or MMO. The Dev team seems to be on the top of their game and really willing to listen to the community, too.\n\nBut the most important thing- killing things in this game just feels so satisfying! Juicy punches, smashing jumps, laying waste with fire or hordes of squirrels, confusing a whole screenful of enemies - whatever the ability or style, it just works and feels so damn good. It really grows on you too. Once you get access to your hero's skills and stick with it, combat in other ARPGs feels like hitting stuff with a wet newspaper.","December 2, 2013","true","321.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Since release the game has gotten esponentially better. Newcomers get a beter starter hero selection and all heroes can be unlocked with splinter drops, which happen to drop pretty often. Yes costumes still cost money and their drop rate is ridiculously low but Gaz needs this to be their money maker so I have no problem throwing money to them to make my character look how I want.\n\nIf you like ARPG's or the Marvel IP then theres no reason not to try this game.

When the game originally launched back in June of this year the reception wasn't great; okay it was bad. The game gave a bad first impression to new players that didn't participated in the beta. Marvel Heroes has a lot of heroes to choose from (27 heroes and counting) and at launch the only way to obtain more heroes outside of rare drops (which were pretty damn rare) were to buy them with real money. Okay, that doesn't sound to bad right? Wrong. The pricing for the heroes were outrageous at the time, costing upwards of $20+ for some of the premium heroes like Iron Man and Spiderman. This left a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths.\n\nBut now, this has all changed. Gazillion Entertainment has listen to their community and brought prices down to much more reasonable levels. Top tier heroes will cost about $9 to buy, much better than $20+ dollars back then. There are packs that may cost more but that's up to the individual on if it's worth it to buy. But the best news was how Gazillion added an ingame currency called, "Eternity Splinters" that you can farm and use to purchase the hero that you want, without paying a dime. This was a welcome and needed change. Now players can get every hero in the game just by playing the game!\n\nSome of the other things that Marvel Heroes had a bad rap about was the combat was boring and there was nothing to do once you beat the game. Well, Gazillion has been busy reworking heroes and changing visuals and making combat much more exciting this time around. I remember playing Iron Man on launch day and thought to myself that he was kind of weak and dare I say it..boring. But when I came back for update 2.0, Iron Man felt like, well, Iron Man and he was so much more fun to play.\n\nThe endgame was lacking as well like I mentioned before and once you beat the game you were either running the same terminals over and over to grind to max level or you were leveling an alt. Gazillion has added much more things to do this time around. Along with your daily terminal runs you can also replay the game in two other difficulties, Heroic and Superheroic. Or you can farm items and grind levels on huge maps like Midtown Manhattan with other players or play a survival style game in X-Defense where you protect students from the Xavier School from an invasion. Also, a new addition to the game is PvP called, "Fire & Ice", which is still in beta where it's a 5 vs 5 where you protect your giants and attack other players and their giants onto destroying their base to win the match.\n\nOn top of that, Marvel Heroes is now starting to add more chapters to the game, starting with Chapter 9 in Asgard. In the coming months there will be more additions to Asgard as it expands, for now, we have a small taste of what's to come.\n\nGazillion is doing a tremendous job listening to their players and making changes as quickly as possible to ensure quality. As well, as giving us new content and updates every month. If you played the game when it first came out or are discouraged about its low Metacritic scores, don't be, the game has improved leaps and bounds since then. Gazillion has a determination to make Marvel Heroes the best ARPG ever, you can be sure that greater things lies in store for us in the near future and the best part is that's all free! Give this game a shot (or another shot) and you won't be disappointed.","July 2, 2013","true","212.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I'd heard it had greatly improved over the last 5-6 months and was much better, so I decided to give it another shot. I'm glad I did.\n\nIt's a really fun ARPG with frequent content updates, a sane pay model (all purchasable content is either completely cosmetic [costumes, pets] or also available through playing/grinding), regular events (with bonus XP/loot), and a decent loot/crafting system. Although you're playing on servers with other people and while there is support for groups (and talk of raid content coming in a future update), it also seems to be one of the most solo-friendly ARPGs of recent years -- nice for when you're feeling antisocial and just want to grind some loot. Marvel Heroes can be a little rough around the edges in spots but overall it's a really enjoyable game, regardless of how much or how little money you spend on it.","March 28, 2014","true","421.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You can earn everything in game without cash. Including costumes (however, costumes are extremely time prohibitive to earn, and random besides.)\n-Large roster of playable characters, with a new character coming out every month.\n-Older characters don't get forgotten, every month an older character also recieves a review pass, ensuring that they're keeping up with the new guys.\n-Tons of stuff to do, including pvp, terminal missions, neverending zones with progressive difficulty ramp, story mode, one-shot story lines (side stories not related to the main storyline), numerous items to farm, several collectable currencies, crafting, enchanting, etc.\n-Characters often have multiple builds that work efficiently.\n-"Team Up" sidekick characters with multiple skill paths add variety.\n-Constant updates, with significant progress, and a willingness to listen to the playerbase.\n\nThe Bad\n-Story mode gets repetitive, however several story quests give permanent bonuses to your character, forcing you to complete them if you want to max everything out.\n-The fortune card system is just aweful, and needs to be rethought.\n-PVP is still in 'beta' and needs a lot of polish.\n-The sheer number of Iron Man costumes taking up my stash space.\n-Some costumes are just re-colored versions of the original.\n\nThe Fugly\n-It can get repetitive. Of course, it Is an ARPG, where repetitive is the name of the game....\n-Grouping and guilds need more content, which is starting to be adressed with the release of raids.\n-Pvp.\n-Stash space is bought with real money only, making it the only thing not attainable through in game means.\n\nIn conclusion, I think Marvel Heroes is the perfect backup game, the game you play when you want to take a break from The Elder Scrolls Online, or League of Legends, or whatever it is that floats your boat. The way it's built, and the rate at which it's being actively developed, even if there's something you hate, if you come back a month or two later, odds are if it isn't fixed, it's at least different. I've been playing since closed beta, and have gone through spurts where MH is my main game, and spurts where I'm addicted to other games, and go back to MH when I get bored. It's kinda like your wife, really. When you get tired of your hot mistress, you can count on her being there, waiting for you at home, with your dinner ready for you.","May 25, 2014","true","365.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I like this game and play it a ton but it definitely has some flaws as an ARPG. It is held aloft by clever use of the Marvel franchise.\n\nProsGameplay\nFree to play.\nWide array of Marvel characters to choose from, new release monthly.\nDifferent types of game modes, up to and including MMO style raids, with varying levels of "difficulty" and time commitment.\nFlavor! Popular classic and new costumes, variant costumes, ENHANCED costumes that do things like gender swap, character swap, power color swap, VA swap. Many Team-ups that can tag along with you. A few cool visual effects you can add to your costume.\nMMO style build trees with unlimited resets allows some variety in power sets. Plus Omega Point system allowing further stat customization with tons of choices.\nCybernetic pets add a small extra possibility for stat customization along with the ability to "vacuum" (eat) loot off the ground plus the actual pet following you around when summoned.\nDesign shift towards for easy travel with vehicles, fast running, flying, teleporting at low or no resource cost.\nPlay solo or in a group.Graphics\nAt max settings there is a nice colorful style taking the middle of the road between gritty realism and cartoony. The dynamic lighting and shadows are quite nice and the motion blur effect is not overdone.\nWith full effects on this game looks absolutely bonkers. You actually really need to turn them down or you can't even see your own character!\nConstantly improving character and costumes design. Many older characters are starting to get reworked looks to be of much higher quality than release.\nAudio\nBeing an official Marvel approved franchise they have some great known VAs and realistic lines for fully voiced heroes, Team-ups, and villains.\nIndicators for certain rare drops.\nPricing and Misc.\nYou start out with one free hero and by earning in-game currency you can buy any hero or Team-up of your choice without $.\nThrough log-in rewards  you are given enough currency to buy a medium priced hero or Team-up and then other things like bonus exp, power tree resets, and even some special pet and Team-up items after 100+ days.\nThere are multiple special events that run almost constantly with special rewards and/or server side boosts.\nCons\nGameplay\nAs with any ARPG, grinding is the name of the game. You can buy $ boosts but the drop rate of most things you want is so low you won't feel  an appreciable difference until you have 4 or more $ boosts going.\n"Difficult" another trap of the ARPG this is largely based on your gear and Omega points level, not skill. I would say MH falls into artificial difficulty harder than any other MMO and ARPG games I have played. Especially the largely disappointing "boss" fights that exist outside of raids that have less to do with the boss and more to do with not standing in stuff on the ground.\nBalance with 40+ heroes on the roster is a tough job and the variance between top and bottom is quite extreme in both dummy TTKs, live DPS efficiency, and especially TTL. Newer heroes and recently updated heroes are largely better off in all departments. Some old characters excluded from current raid content entirely.\nLots of multi-tree heroes only have one build that is considered viable and this is not a problem with power design but simple numbers tuning.\nPower sets and especially buff durations and debuff durations are becoming completely normalized and homogenized over time. This makes future balance easier but it also makes heroes feel less unique from each other.\nSome of the game modes have such a lack of reward and tuning that they are abandoned at the moment by the players AND the devs until they can be modified and improved. (X-DEF, Holo-SIM)\nThe stylistic choice of real world size villains is understandable but with some villains and heroes even being the same, and the huge amount of spell effects flying around, tracking combat (mainly where the boss is facing so as not to stand in front of it) can be very difficult.\nCrafting is outdated and tedious. One of the remnants of release MH from before the 2015 rebranding that is simply too low on the priority totem poll to be adjusted. One of the main crafting ingredients, Runes, have too many rare drop rates for useful Runes and too many completely useless Runes which is both pointless and confusing for new players.\nOmega system is bloat, most options are useless and it's new player unfriendly. It also encourages EXP farming over loot farming if you want to cap points.\nGraphics\nEverything can be turned off but I'm not sure there is actually much gains for doing so.\nWhen I had an older CPU I could play perfectly on the TEST Center but had extreme lag on live, so poor server performance can exacerbate CPU usage of MMO type games which are already notorious for being CPU heavy.\nAudio\nAccents tend to be questionable at best and quite inconsistent.\nThe same VA used for multiple characters in some situations and unfortunately it's obvious.\nA few characters have a disconnect between the mix of eras their look and voice and lines were pulled from. EX: Rogues default look is modern but her voice sounds very young and rebellious and her lines are like OG completely scared of her powers and unable to control them, yet her power set has no instability, She steals and uses whatever she wants whenever she wants.\nSome characters have a lot more lines than others.\nLow pool of lines for villains.\nPricing and Misc.\nExpensive. A hero, Team-up , costume is ~$10 per. Boosts ~$1 per hour per. Playing just one hero is not something most people do because you run out of content variety very quickly.\nCostumes and bank space are $ only.\nNo lowering the price of old content. That means that this old style release costume[i.ytimg.com]  is the same price as this new style 2015 costume[glasscannon.ru]. Team-ups were made the same price as playable heroes because they took the same work, and I respect that in part, it just doesn't make sense from a consumer stand-point for those two things to be the same price.\nThe actual gameplay time involved in getting even one hero or Team-up from free currency is significant.\n\nDevelopment\nBalance, improvement of older AI, outdated modes, and graphics, restructuring of outdated systems, all take a backseat to new content and the all-important Release Schedule.\nHero balance comes in monthly single characters reviews. That means unbalanced heroes remain untouched for over 6 months at a time. But "OP" builds get nerfed within a week, and often into oblivion.\nThey clearly had and have a huge vision for the scope, but it comes more and more at the expense of current gameplay. Almost everything from the original release needs to be updated or reworked and this happens much much more slowly than new content which comes with its own issues and bugs.\nSo many bugs reported on TC and purposefully released to live, to be fixed at a later patch date.\nIt seems that Marvel approval interferes occassionally and Gaz is forced to take the blame for it.\nSome of the devs can talk and act unprofessionally when interacting on social media, making personal and petty insults to customers and taking criticism, while understandably personally, poorly.","May 25, 2015","true","842.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ageofjensen/recommended/226320/","ageofjensen","HydeJensenMC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ageofjensen/","163 products in account","This game, is one of my favourite F2P games I have played for a long long time. Besides Warframe, I enjoy this game HIGHLY, because of this lush enjoyment and it's variety. As a fan of Marvel and Comics in General, I love seeing the references to Marvel's Lore and all sorts of Marvel things, which makes this game the more entertaining.\n\nThis game is said to be similar to Diablo III, which I haven't played so I cannot comment. Though I have played for only a short few hours (In game terms, it would be short), I have so far had fun with the Hero I had started to play with, as well as the one who I am currently levelling along side with my Mid 30's Gambit char (I got Gambit, Punisher (Defunct) and Psylocke). That being said, it can be quite a bore just levelling, but then again, this is minor due to the variety this game gives.\n\nA few cons for me would be the Eternity Splinters, the alternative to the Pay To Win route in this game. I admit, I paid for Gambit and Psylocke because both of these characters was a major want for me. But, for something like a Team Up char, I want to use the in game alternative. Why am I complaining? because the spawns are set on a timer and they only ever spawn once every few minutes (Sorry I do not know the specifics) and you can't farm. That's fine, but I really think they should atleast add extra splinters for reasons like increased difficulty boss fights, X-Defense etc.\n\nAnother would be some forms of repition, mostly because sometimes the Midtown patrol spawns the same bosses or the same enemies without giving you more challenge. This is minor, because it can be fixed wiht a simple difficulty change from Normal to Heroic (Hard).\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game, and thats suprising because I never always liked Free To PLay games (AHem. APB. I am looking at you.) and I never liked Pay to Win, but this Pay to Win is a good system.","July 5, 2014","true","252.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dontpanic42/recommended/226320/","dontpanic42","Weathersby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dontpanic42/","200 products in account","This game is an innovator. Like anchovies and cherry Jell-O, Marvel Heroes has dared to combine two ingredients that were conventionally kept separate: MMOs and ARPGs (aka Diablo-style games). Any challenge, story, or sense of skillful execution that previously existed in the ARPG genre has been thoughtfully removed from the game, so that the player may enjoy a more pure experience of applying their mouse skills onto a screen that is marvelously flashing.\n\nNostalgia seekers rejoice! The talent trees in Marvel Heroes have rolled back the clocks on modern MMO talents that focus on important decisions and noticeable changes to gameplay. Instead they embrace the charm and whimsy of early-era talent trees that provide incremental damage increases and minor improvements to existing abilities. Don't worry about needing an abacus to figure out the talent trees though, it's literally almost impossible to make a decision of any sort as you fill in the points.\n\nThe challenging and exciting dungeon crawl experience that we all remember from the peak of the MMO era lives on Marvel Heroes. The challenge of coordinating carefully and skillfully with your team mates to overcome incredible odds has been seamlessly replaced with the challenge of racing to keep up with your team as you all swing, slide, teleport, and sprint for the center of the next room. And you'd best master your simple movement ability quickly! You want to get to the next room while enemeis are still standing so you can begin pressing your strongest AOE attack! It makes colors!\n\nWhile the excitement of hard-earned triumph is only a faint memory, the pulce-pounding thrill we felt as we peeked into a slain monster's treasure horde has been generously shmeared across the entire experience so that it never violently peaks like that again. This leads to a very mellow, constant influx of unexciting rewards. Ideal for today's anxiety-prone gamers.\n\nTake a step away from the pressure of needing to learn complex "mechanics" in your game. I don't even know what a carburetor is. Something in bread that makes you fat? Whatever, leave the science to the "hardcore" gamers. Sit back, prop up your mouse hand, and take a stroll with a reasonable approximation of some of your not-quite-favorite "super" "heroes".","August 10, 2014","true","14.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

You pick from a decent handful of starter heroes, like Punisher, Black Widow, Captain America, Colossus or Storm, then go about fighting through a nine-chapter campaign either by yourself or with friends. If you’ve ever played Diablo, Torchlight or other games in the genre, this is exactly like that except a bit more bombastic. Overpowered doesn’t even begin to describe how it all feels, but it fits the topic well.\n\nAs you play, an in-game currency drops with regularity which can be used to unlock additional heroes. Or, if you’re impatient, you can buy more heroes with real money. But I’d recommend just saving up the in-game currency for the hero you want, it doesn’t take that long. Once you finish the campaign, you can replay it on increasing difficulty levels for better drops, or hit up a variety of end-game content types like horde-style holo missions. There’s even high-level raids, but those require max-level characters and a firm understanding of how to play.\n\nBefore the “2015” patch, I was hesitant to recommend Marvel Heroes to anyone. But to Gazillion’s credit, they’ve overhauled the game dramatically, and now it’s a must-play in my book.","September 22, 2014","true","75.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The game underwent a massive rebuild because the old game was boring, and you didnt get to play who you wanted to. As of now you can play all heroes up to Lv 10 and unlock anyone from the start.\n\nNow game play wise I find it to be a very relaxing pick up and play type game, no stressful things like dps gates/hours of required grind. There is alot of variety in the people you can play like Venom who can be a hybrid ranged/melee who is all about regen to Storm who is a walking AoE (Area of Effect) with well storms. Now some heroes are still not up to date to the new current standard of fun but they are being worked on.\n\nThe cash shop is fairly standard like League of Legends $10 more or less for heroes and costumes (with exeption of ENHANCED that change model voice lines and ability flavor). Small boost comsumables etc.\n\nNow the game isnt for everyone if you dont like dungeon crawlers for loot this it not for you. If you are concerned about the END GAME there are raids and cosmic trials/danger room that ups the difficulty, two raids currently in game more on the way. If want to feel powerfull kill tons of goons and get loot this may be the game for you\n\nTLDR\nPros -\nMost heroes feel strong\nJust about everything can be earned in game\nLarge variety in playable classes\nDecent story\nFor Marval fans lots of fan service between costumes and character interactions\n\nCons -\nStorage Space is a large problem free players dont get that much (This is they only thing they dont give away in spades)\nJust starting out everything can be a bit slow\nIf you have bad RNG it can take a while to get what you want","April 10","true","113.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Do you like Marvel? If you answered yes to both, you really need to install Marvel Heroes right now.\n\nStrong, solid combat. Very high quality voiceovers. A classic Marvel storyline in the main quests, and all sorts of Marvel villians, tropes, and references abound. The graphics are great, both in effects and tunability. Animations are fun to look at, fun to execute with.\n\nIn the current state of the game, it thrives on repetition just like other ARPGs. Marvel Heroes throws enough uniqueness into the mix to keep gameplay from going stale. At the time of this review, you have 36 superheroes (and counting!) to play. No two heroes play the exact same. There are a ton of choices and I'm sure that anyone can find a favorite or two out of the mix. Every gameplay style you'd want in an ARPG is here. You can boil the abilities down to simple types ("single target spirit spender") but they'll all have different effects, different damage, different synergies with the hero's passives and gear, etc.\n\nThe game is receiving constant updates. The developers are on top of the community at all times and have a very active presence on their forums. The game developers are making it clear that everything in the game is verified and allowed by Marvel.\n\nTo touch on the free-to-play aspects; you don't have to spend a single cent. The cash shop consists of heroes, costumes, boosts, and miscellanous items. All heroes and costumes can be obtained in-game; the cash shop just speeds up the process. The boosts are also obtainable in-game. Most of the miscellanous items have zero effect on gameplay and won't make much of a difference. In my opinion, you should only spend some money if you absolutely want to try a specific hero (like in the hero packs here on Steam) or if you don't like your starting hero. If you like the game enough, you'll be able to decide for yourself if you want to spend more money on it.\n\nThere is one con. In the current state of the game, performance is an issue. The game will run the same on just about any system, and most graphics settings will not make much of a difference on higher-end systems. There are some significant performance penalties in the largest/busiest maps of the game. The game is still very playable but it will not achieve high framerates or responsiveness in these areas, even on an exceedingly fast computer.\n\nThis review was written during Marvel Heroes 2015 patch 1.05 - Gazillion reset the patch numbers with the release of the 2015 update.","July 6, 2014","true","857.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Read on to find what I mean by that.\n\n**EDITED INTRO 11/15/2015*\nOriginally I rated this game a 'Yes', but now I definitely lean more towards no. Maybe my tastes have changed. maybe I've simply beat the game too many times. Maybe I haven't given the 'endgame' a decent try (I really haven't). but whatever the reason, I don't feel like playing this game anymore. :(\n**\n\n(NOTE: this is more 'what you need to know about Marvel Heroes' than a review.\nIt includes tips, info, & me explaining features of the game. If you want in-depth pros & cons, there are other reviews for that. thanks.)\n\nMarvel Heroes MIGHT be worth you checking out. I have 'played' this game for 415 hours so far, but I have a hard time recommending it unless you...\n1. like...marvel's heroes A LOT &\n2. have a friend or 2 that will play it with you sometimes.\n3. have means/money you can add to your Steam account when the time comes\n\nBasically it's a fun Action-RPG BASED ON BEING (A) CERTAIN CHARACTER(S).\nIF you enjoy being said character & don't care too much about level design or story, then you will enjoy this for its gameplay and FEELING LIKE said character(s).\n\nbut you have to have really good self control. The game rewards you with Eternity Splinters that let you buy/unlock more characters. The main negative is you will be tempted to buy a lot of things with real money (in currency called 'G') -especially more STASH- OR you will constantly have to clear out your storage spaces (which is what I do all the time always, even though as-of this review, I have 9 STASH's +3 character-specific STASH's). The upside is they are constantly updating it, adding playable characters, events, team-ups, etc.\n\nkey features to know:\nBODYSLIDE: this is a teleport that takes you back to a HUB at any time. It has a cooldown of 10 minutes. It can be used twice before the cooldown starts: once to take you to the hub and once to take you back (to the spot you bodyslid from).\n\nULTIMATE: every character has an Ultimate power/skill. To my knowledge, they all unlock at Lvl 52 (max lvl is 60). The cooldown for the ultimate starts at 10 minutes (but you can put points into it to be less).\n\nkey TIPS to know:\n\nyou have to LEVEL YOUR CRAFTER (by donating items to it): this is just a tip, but it's an annoying thing considering much of the early game you are left wishing your crafter was a higher level, but all the crafter is really good for IMO is tranfering an item over to another character. And also for upgrading blue gear to purple.\n\nYou get a LOT of LOOT: So plan accordingly. Until you get a 2nd stash, I wouldn't even think of getting a 2nd character, but that's just my advice. Once you get a 2nd STASH, then you can start another character, maybe even 2 if you can handle limited storage.\n\nbut there are a LOT of different items in this game, including artifacts, costume cores, 'crafting items' (4 different types with 8 different tiers for each), boost potions, pets, rings, runes (used in crafting with URU gear), URU gear (1 wearable per character, can't wear until Lvl 25), medals, medallions, and a few more I can't think of now.\n\n*update1 [05/13/2015]* - I feel I should mention the cost of things in this game\n*update2 [06/18/2015]* added in 'crafting tab'  to pricing list below, & its price/value/usefulness\n*update3 [07/04/2015]* added introduction to try to better explain my goal of this 'review.'\n\nPRICING\nSTASH (regular) : 500 G ($5.00)\nCharacter-specific STASH : 350 G ($3.50)\nCrafting Tab: 200 G ($2.00)\n^The first 2 are the main 2 tabs you should ever 'NEED' to buy in this game.\nI recently realized how valuable crafting tabs are later in the game, since I had a TON of runestones and crafting items that can be stashed there. I didn't know Runes (aka. runestones) were allowed in that stash, but NOW that I do, I think they are a good deal if you have 4 or more rows of runes sitting around (that you don't want to get rid of).\n\nThat said, MH only lets you buy Gs in 'bundles', otherwise known as lump sums.\n\nThere is 500 G bundle, 1000 G bundle, 2100 G bundle ($20), and so on.\nThis is an annoying model and I dislike it very much, but what can you do about it?\nThe only thing I will say in DEFENSE of this model is the fact that it's KIND-OF like a subscription fee...only you actually get something in return, and if you look at it that way, it's not so bad. Especially since you are NOT forced to pay anything to play this game.\n---------\nTL; DR = if you have a friend playing this with you, & you like a marvel hero a lot, try it.\n\n....if you have no money to buy anything, you probably DON'T want to try it, because you will be muy (very) frustrated.","April 9, 2015","true","543.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ominousflare/recommended/226320/","ominousflare","Ominous Flare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ominousflare/","31 products in account","Pros:\n- The wide variety of characters and costumes that you can buy are actually decently-made enough to worth the money, sometimes.\n\n- The powers are varied and feel like their comic book counterparts, not half-♥♥♥, which is more than I could say for other superhero games.\n\n- You could unlock numerous characters very easily (I think they might unlock heroes for you when you buy one of their characters). I only have one character left that I need to unlock after ONLY purchasing Spidey, which is Ant-Man.\n\n- The story is well-written enough to look and feel like a Marvel comic book, and the aspect of fighting the wide variety of villains from the comics brings back that immersion we had from Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The quest-lines are well-written and immersive enough for Marvel fans that you won't realize most of them involve the simplistic action of mob-killing.\n\n- This is probably the only Marvel video game out there that doesn't 'juvenilize' the stories the way LEGO and Disney Infinity did with their games. DOOM will not crack stupid, nonsensical jokes for the most parts, and characters will act like their serious counterparts from the comics.\n\n- Opportunities for future epic storyline to be tied into the game, stuff like the upcoming Civil War movie (god, I hope they make you choose a side) and maybe even The Infinity War.\n\n- Christopher Daniel Barnes voices your Spider-Man when you buy the '90s 'Amazing' costume. Nostalgia galore. The developers at least know enough of what the fans like to create such fanservice.\n\n- Daily rewards when you log in encourages you to return to the game.\n\nCons:\n- Kill-steals. You will not bother to do a lot of side quests because of this, as their requirements rely on event-bosses that you WILL miss because they are all the way at the other end of the city, and by the time you reach there, other players would have killed off that boss and you would have to wait 5 minutes for him to respawn. This isn't essentially a problem if you remember where the boss respawns, but not only do some bosses respawn at different places (Green Goblin in the Lower East Side mission), the kill-stealing also becomes a problem when your quest-requirements involve destroying items like statues. If you're a low level character without an AOE power of some kind, have fun watching Iron Man stealing all your statue-kills with his lasers. Gazillion needs to fix this, as it sucks out the fun for newbies like me who want to enjoy the entirety of the story without skipping annoyances like this.\n\n- Some costumes are terrible, and you can't change it unless you buy a new one.\n\n- The community isn't as toxic as the LoL or CoD community, thankfully, but it's rather difficult to form groups or socialize with the people there. It kinda reminds me of those forums where everyone's doing their own thing and ignore each other's existence. It's not very friendly or helpful, so you'll mostly be wandering around confused if you're a newb to this game and especially if you're a newb to MMO. Almost every MMO has this problem, right? Not really. GW2 has a lot of helpful and friendly people willing to step out to help others. Even WoW has people like this.\n\n- Crafting sucks. It's boring as heck due to the awkward design. Instead of combining your "elements" together with ease, you'll have to combine click on them one at a time thrice, click on combine, and then click on "take all". It doesn't seem much, but when you need a lot of these elements to craft the good stuff, it can be agonizing. Gazillion needs to learn from Arena Net's Guild Wars 2 on how to do crafting properly. GW2's crafting is fast and done in a breeze, leaving you to do the fun stuff like questing with your newly-crafted weapons.\n\n- Bank slots are understandably restrained. It's a f2p game after all. The bank slots won't really affect your gameplay that much, but it can be annoying how they want you to pay after only giving you a single constrained bank slot of 42 grids. That might seem a lot, but when you add up the numerous runes, various elements of different quality, rare items you want to keep because your character level is not high enough, Sentinel Limbs (collecting them will give you a miniature Sentinel pet, I think), and crafting ingredients, the spaces would run out in about less than a week of playtime.\n\n- The currency for unlocking costumes, "Splinters", aren't exactly that easy to earn. Sure, continuous, I repeat, "continuous" fighting (grinding) will earn you a Splinter every five minutes, but when you're crafting or sorting out your bank items, and due to the awkward crafting system, that can take up around 10-15 minutes, the Splinter-earning will seem kinda slow. Not to mention the little breaks you take in-between the grinding and farming, so you'll maybe earn 1 or 3 Splinter every hour. Depending on how many hours you clock into the game per day, you won't be buying another hero for at least a month and a half. I wish the Splinters are awarded to you by the hour.\n\nOverall, it's recommended if you're a big Marvel fan who wants to play with your favorite superhero in an MMO. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking in terms of its MMO elements. The charges you pay for unlocking the heroes and costumes aren't that much, so I'd say it's definitely a worthy experience for a f2p game.","August 27, 2015","true","57.5"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","22","42","4","0"

This game, everything you need, at all - is literally free. And no, it doesn't take forever to find, just actual work. You can't buy anything really to help you get an edge on anyone, except potions to increase XP, etc. You can buy costumes from Marvel Lore (it's a lot of fun), and the game itself is so well rounded.\n\nHowever, they have in the last few months, gone back on their word (quite a few) when they first started this game. I hope this is just a temporary thing and they go back to how they were in the beginning - honest and there for the players.\n\nThis game USED to be the most amazingly responsive game I've ever been a part of. You'd post on the forums and within days suggestions would be implemented. However, since certain people have taken over, that's not the case much lately.\n\nThey do need to start working on bugs and past content 'issues' than continuing to try to throw out more costumes or characters. If they would go back and fix the bugs, then start adding in more content rather than characters - this game would be back on track.\n\nI'm just taking  a break hoping they are having a brain fart.","August 16, 2014","true","530.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Thats the most BAD feeling to me.\n\nFor the GOOD side:\nTons of heroes to play with, they will constantly review on heroes' skill and re-desgin for better gameplay experenice. Also this game has quite large amount of contents, after finishing Story, you can continue on harder level, go to an open map for killing enemies or boss hunt,  enjoy wave defend with your friends, etc.\n\nHow FREE is it:\nI think that the costume and EXP/item drop boost are their main source of income.  If you dont brother about costume, the stash space is the only thing that will cost you money.  Heroes can be obtain using in-game item, but it takes time to collect.  Remember to check for the promo code, they gift players items very often.","August 14, 2014","true","038.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also has the best online community I have ever seen in a MMO and I am very proud to say I am a member of this community as well as the fact that my love for it has lead me to become a streamer. I am the type of person who never sticks with a MMO (often because of the community) and rarely level caps more than one or two characters.

I want to start off by saying that thereis alot of hype about having to buy the characters you want to play with. You are able to unlock every character through rare drop ingame without having to pay. The characters range anywhere from 6$,9$, & 12$. Ironman, spiderman and deadpool are 20$ which i think is due to how popular they are. I will agree that the costumes are overpriced starting anywhere from 6$ to 20$.\n\nThe gamplay aspect of the game is amazing. If you are a fan of Diablo 1 & 2 you will have no problem falling in love with this game. The characters look stunning as do the abundence of costumes. There is bosses everywhere and they are very tough at times. There is plenty of skills to build and they work fluidly.'\n\nAll in all this is a must play f2p game for comic fans and arpg fans.

It's one of the most fun games ever.\n\nMarvel Heroes puts you in the shoes of your favorite heroes go to the Marvelheroes.com to see a list of chars that is in the game there are over 30!. You pick a free starter hero and in game you kill things and pick up " eternity splinters " that you can use to buy ANY hero you want. So if you low on funds you don't have to spend a dime!\n\nCons\n- When you gear you char, It doesn't change the look of your char. This is more Marvel then gazillion. Marvel wanted the charactors to look a certian way. if you want to change the look of you'll have to buy a costume from the store.\n- Costumes and charactor's can be costly. For the people that don't have the time to " grind " and want to buy the char's you can do that. But they can get really expensive. But if you'r willing to put into the time you can get the new released chars for free!\n- Gear space. This is one of the only real " hard " limits the game has for " free " users/payed users. Unless you're an ulimate founder the space can be limited, and you'll prolly have to buy some space.\n\nPros\n-Its diablo and ultimate alliance mixed together\n-Dev's are super active and interact with there customers daily\n- Add at LEAST one new char a month, sometimes two!\n- Patch every week and add stuff like Story, Raids, Power review of weaker chars\n- You can get 96% of the stuff in the game free free free! Just buy playing the game they do have exclusives and such that if you want you'll have to pay for. But of all the F2P games this is by far the most generious\n-Crafting, PVP, Different modes, and diffculties.\n\nI love this game, it does have it's flaws but they are always working on it and that's enough to keep me coming back for more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yverthel/recommended/226320/","Yverthel","yverthel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yverthel/","146 products in account","Mechanically, this game is basically Diablo 2 with superheroes. Simple, clean ARPG controls that any veteran of the genre will pick up in 2 seconds flat, and all the loot ever. No, more loot than that.\n\nOne great thing is that unlike many superhero games, this one you start right offf feeling pretty super, you're not sitting there going "3 enemies, can I handle this?" you're going "MOAR BADDIES!" and charging headlong in to everything because you think you can win.\n\nThere's a ton of heroes to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. I've yet to find one who wasn't fun.\n\nThe downside to this game is the business side:\nYou start with 1 free hero, and get the credits to get a 2nd one on your second day playing. After that though you have to farm an in-game currency for 30-90 hours (roughly) depending on the hero you want, or spend 5-15 bucks on single hero.\nIf you want a costume beyond the base one for each hero, be prepared to drop $7+ per costume.\nIf you want a larger stash? $5 to add a new tab. Or $3.50 to add a item-type specific tab instead.\nWant a hero to help you out? $3+\n\nGot a random free hero that you don't want? Too bad. Already have it? Have a point for their ultimate. Costume you already have, don't want, or don't have the hero for? Too bad. There's no player trading of heroes or costumes.. Or most of the in-game resources.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and worth dropping some money on, but ... you really have to look at it as if you're paying for the game you're enjoying, not specifically what you're getting for the money, because nothing is exactly a 'good value' when you consider it's cost.\n\nStill though, the game is way too much fun to let that put you off. I've dropped some money on it already, and know I will again in the future.","July 2, 2015","true","579.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Failing that, the game also sells heroes in prices from $4.50-$13.50. It may seem much, but games such as PlanetSide 2 get away with charging $2 for a decal, $10 for a hat, $10 for a SINGLE weapon (in which they could have up to 3 of them), which could get expensive for the several classes it runs. In Marvel Heroes, each hero is being balanced constantly with 52 reviews, and is much more different than the previous.\n\nYou're given access to a choice of 11 starter heroes, which is about a third of the roster, and these aren't filtered by strength of character, as both top-tier and bottom-tier characters are littered among them, though you'll get 200 splinters (the currency for buying characters and other stuff that you could get with actual money, such as Team-Up heroes, which are passive-granters OR a companion with inventory space similar to diablo) for completing the story (defeating green goblin & doctor doom)\n\nTo reach 60, you can reach it in several different ways, though it's unfortunate that it's usually the constant grinding of Legendary Quests, which are quests where you either backtrack through previous story missions on tougher difficulties or finish terminals by killing X amount of enemies, destroying a certain amount of an object and also defeating the boss of that terminal. These terminals are in 3 difficulties, with 12 of them in each tier, each difficulty giving even better loot. Other ways to level include X-Defense and Holosim, which are wave-based in killing as many enemies as you can in Holosim, though X-Defense is defeating a set amount of enemies and bosses while protecting several AI (an escort mission without any movement). There's also Midtown Manhattan, which is scattered with enemies and bosses which spawn every so often, which is usually the ideal way to get loot. For the end-game, there's cosmic terminals (the toughest difficulty) and green raids (red raids coming soon! at the time of August), which require much gear to be completed well.\n\nHowever, one problem with the game is you've got a limited amount of space, you have 30 slots for your Teamup Hero (which you get regardless if you own the teamup), 48 stash spaces, as well as an inventory the size of 60, this will quickly fill up unless you purchase one of the stash spaces (which come with hero packs on the steam store or ingame OR purchased indiviually), which not required can be a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ when you're trying to gather up unique-tier items to trade in for credits/relics/any hero uniques.\n\nEvery week, there is an event that uses a currency, while also boosting the XP, rare and special item find (that boosts the find of drops such as Splinters, the event currency as well as loot), these events are recurring, such as ARMOR Incursion event, Cosmic Worldstones, Omega Access Files and the Midtown Madness, where only Midtown lacks an event currency for unique items, but instead boosts the Midtown drop rates to an INSANE RATE, which managed to get my character Gambit geared out in less than an hour.\n\nThere's a selection of over 35 heroes, with more coming every single month, with most of your favourite Marvel Heroes and even some Villians (read: 'Anti-Heroes'), though these are most likely to absolutely be a pain to keep up with if you don't have money and want heroes that are already out.\n\nOne major issue also is that the game is artificially extended, with some recipes having an astronomical price and some loot items, as well as 'Droppable costumes' (which seem to be a once in a lifetime experience) taking forever to drop, the game can be an absolute grind to acquire all of the items needed to be adequate during the endgame, as well as some characters being downright terrible (Ghost Rider) or boring (Cyclops), though these characters will get a buff and some changes to add a signature move, as well as a bosskiller and improved Ultimate.\n\nI'd rate this game 77/100, though it's not even half as bad as some F2P games on steam, but has some severe graphical issues for some people including memory leaks during LONG sessions of gameplay.","August 29, 2014","true","291.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My past experience with F2P games hasn't been the best, but I figured I'd give Marvel Heroes 2015 a shot since I'm a big fan of Action RPG games. At first, I wasn't very sure about this game... but the more I played it the more I liked it. It's got everything you'd expect from a full fledged MMO, and it feels like playing Diablo (only with Marvel characters). The depth of this game will surprise you.\n\nAfter having played 3-4 chapters through the storyline, I was completely hooked. I remember thinking "I'm gonna spend a lot of money on this." Which is exactly what I did. And I don't regret it! Where some games feel like they're just made to milk you for money, Marvel Heroes 2015 is simply an enjoyable game deserving of some recognition and support.

It's one of the most fun games ever.\n\nMarvel Heroes puts you in the shoes of your favorite heroes go to the Marvelheroes.com to see a list of chars that is in the game there are over 30!. You pick a free starter hero and in game you kill things and pick up " eternity splinters " that you can use to buy ANY hero you want. So if you low on funds you don't have to spend a dime!\n\nCons\n- When you gear you char, It doesn't change the look of your char. This is more Marvel then gazillion. Marvel wanted the charactors to look a certian way. if you want to change the look of you'll have to buy a costume from the store.\n- Costumes and charactor's can be costly. For the people that don't have the time to " grind " and want to buy the char's you can do that. But they can get really expensive. But if you'r willing to put into the time you can get the new released chars for free!\n- Gear space. This is one of the only real " hard " limits the game has for " free " users/payed users. Unless you're an ulimate founder the space can be limited, and you'll prolly have to buy some space.\n\nPros\n-Its diablo and ultimate alliance mixed together\n-Dev's are super active and interact with there customers daily\n- Add at LEAST one new char a month, sometimes two!\n- Patch every week and add stuff like Story, Raids, Power review of weaker chars\n- You can get 96% of the stuff in the game free free free! Just buy playing the game they do have exclusives and such that if you want you'll have to pay for. But of all the F2P games this is by far the most generious\n-Crafting, PVP, Different modes, and diffculties.\n\nI love this game, it does have it's flaws but they are always working on it and that's enough to keep me coming back for more.

The eternity splinters is a MUCH better way to farm for new heroes than the previous. Especially when you factor in that they had it set for a higher drop chance of the current hero you were playing, solely for an upgraded ultimate. The ONLY thing I can really downvote this game for is the fact that EVERY hero shares the same inventory. I know it is because the game is F2P and they have to make money somehow, but Path of Exile is F2P and they don't share the same inventory. It is a hindrance unless you PURCHASE more stash space.

Coming to see it a year later, it still failed to grab my attention. Today, with the release of MH2015, I find myself juicing this game into a full glass of simple fun. It is a simple level and loot grinder, the kind of you expect from people who made Diablo.\nThe game has a couple problems, though. It lacks visual customisation apart from expensive costumes for each hero. Said costumes are too expensive, costing almost as much as regular heroes, though, to be fair, each costume allows you to apply upgrades, so it's not pure visuals. Hero team-ups, again, cost at leastr as much as lower-tier heroes, while being basically a useful pet. And the worst offense, or lack, of this game is...it has you play as a pre-set character. The roster is decent and growing steadily, but it is no Champions Online, where you get to create your very own, original superhero, complete with stories, a nemezis (or several), even powersets.\nAll in all, however, Marvel Heroes 2015 does a great job being a free-to-play MMO action-RPG. Has a ton of loot for each hero, weekly event and grindzones, decent story and allows you to play as some of your favourite characters from Marvel comics.","August 25, 2014","true","358.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is extremely expensive to play if you want to have all the heroes and a lot of costumes.\n-To get heroes or costumes and also to level your character, get omega points, eternity splinters, etc  is annoyingly grindy to the point where you'll want to just buy them (just like mobile games).\n-Some heroes are extremely similar in playstyle.\n-Balance of characters is quite off. Some are much, much stronger than others.\n\nOverall: I've definitely had fun with the game as I love action RPGs and super heroes.  I would rate the game a 6/10 as of Aug. 13, 2015.  If the game wasn't an insane rip off to buy characters, costumes, team ups, etc I would give it an 8/10.  I had a good amount of expendable income before, so I've paid over $500.  That's just to get characters, costumes, stash spots, and team ups.  Even paying that much I still am missing characters, 70% of costumes, and over half the team-ups.","June 7, 2013","true","88.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am the type of person who never sticks with a MMO (often because of the community) and rarely level caps more than one or two characters.

The community is one of the best ive ever met. I love speaking to about 90% of the people on here. Extremely helpful and welcoming. Very often willing to help you out with missions or raids, etc. New missions, items, characters, costumes, locations, enemies are being added every so often, keeping things interesting.

Maybe you heard about it from a friend or are just perusing steam and thinking about trying a new game. Whatever the reason, I think this game has evolved exceptionally from its initial release and reviews. Since it is an online game with many many players, you will see people that complain. That is the nature of the world we live in. I have personally enjoyed the progression this game has made and feel that it is quickly approaching an established and refreshing place in the MMO space... and all that aside, it's just plain fun.\n\nHere are the top 5 reasons to play this game:\n\n1. Free. It's free. It doesn't have any hidden charges or the need to spend money to play or get the best characters or items. The more you play, the more rewards you get IN-GAME. That said, time is considered by many to be money. So if you don't have time, you won't be getting a lot of stuff by playing. But... if you don't have time... you probably shouldn't be playing games anyway :)\n\n2. You used to play diablo 2 online and want a modern interpretation of that. This game is a better implementation of a multiplayer action rpg than diablo 3. I'm sorry to say it because I loved diablo 3... but I have not touched it in several months because of this game.\n\n3. You enjoy both solo and coop play. Sometimes you want to be the lone wolf, sometimes you want to play with a few friends or strangers... Marvel Heroes has both options. Best part about this flexibility is that if you are ever struggling, just hop on the social or LFG channel and you will probably find someone to help you in under a minute. Sometimes, under 5 seconds.\n\n4. You like playing games with lots of action. Most of the time, everything on the screen is getting blasted, punched, stomped upon, lasered and/or blown up. If you are looking for a quiet game of chess, go play a quiet game of chess. This is about action.\n\n5. Flexible play time. Play for 5 minutes, play for 12 hours... the choice is yours and both are viable options. This is radically different than other MMOs where they purposely make you travel for 10 minutes before you get to your actual gameplay.\n\n\n\nHere are a few warnings just so you know what you're getting into:\n- The character you pick when you start is the one you will play with until you have enough Eternity Splinters to buy a new character (in-game)\n- Sales happen so if you are considering spending real money on anything, you might want to consider waiting for a sale.\n- I am a PVE player that has tried PVP. If you are looking for world-changing PVP, this might not be ready for you yet. Their PVP arena is intense but there is only one option that I know of. They are definitely working on it though, so maybe try the game out and see how it develops.","January 7, 2014","true","265.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays similar to a Diablo game and each hero is a unique "class" so to speak.  From what I've seen for the most part the heroes are pretty unique from one another, and the best part is they actually did an EXCELLENT job translating the "feel" of the heroes into the game.  The gameplay of each character really feels the way you would expect it to.\n\nUltimately if you do plan on giving the game a try I'd recommend buying a hero that you really like at the start.  It can take a little while to unlock new heroes depending on how much you play.  And having a hero that you like definitely makes the game a lot more fun.\n\nJust to keep up to date information in this review to keep it relevant, Gazillion has done a PHENOMINAL job keeping this game not only relevant but improving upon it constantly.  With their new level 52 reviews where they break a character down from the ground up and rebuild them so that they are both fun, effective AND still feel like the character that they should is pretty incredible.  They are constantly rolling out with new content, both new characters and new areas/mobs/endgame so that the game is never stale.  You can get just about everything in the game for free.  The one thing that is limited to real money purchasing at the moment that matters is bank space, but if you're not a hoarder like I am and can manage it then you should be fine.  Ultimately if you like ARPGs or Marvel characters and you're not playing this game you're doing yourself a disservice.  If you like both why did it take you so long to have this game installing?","October 29, 2013","true","140.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are willing to grind a bit you can get evreything u want in this game for free minus skins which in my opinion are kinda pointless unless you absolutely can not stand the way the base skin looks for some reason and also extra stash slots which are nice but not completely necessary. So all the reviews about the company who makes the game money grubbing are pointless to me at least. I have almost 20 char at max level and have only spent 10 dollars on this game and that was for 2 char and a stash box and some other goodies when they were on sale. In other words i have gotten 600 plus hours of gaming for 10 dollars and could have had that for free if i didnt want the extra inventory and a char BOGO sale purchase. Is there some things that could be improved upon? Most certainly. I agree with the reviews that state that some new levels need to be added. They keep pumping out new characters which is great and all as i love many different marvel characters and enjoy playing them. I love  getting to use their powers and building them to my liking as far as the skills and powers go but it is getting a litttle old as it is the same levels and fights again and again since their has not been any new story added. So they only real difference  Character to character is the fact that the skills and powers are unique and the dialogue which in itself is entertaining and very true to each character. If you are not a die hard Marvel Comics fan you may not enjoy  the little things as much as i have though. i suggest give it a try as it is free and you lose nothing unless you choose to buy something. In which case if you are selective about what you buy and when it still is not a waste of money as far as i am concerned.","August 21, 2014","true","034.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a ton of heroes to play, boatloads of different attacks and abilities, a vast array of items both functional and cosmetic, and for a free to play game, it is pretty unobtrusive. You don't really have to pay much if anything to get a lot out of it. It's very colorful, has a sense of humor, and delivers mostly satisfying action. If you're really into comics (I'm not) I'm sure it's doubly interesting. Me, I just like the goofy over the top lootsplosioins and tossing cars at people.\n\nThat being said, oy, the bugs. Even a brief search on the web will show that many, many people over the past two years have reported, and continue to report, crash bugs, both those that crash only the game and those that blue screen your PC. Most of them involve some sort of error messages about missing files that Unreal's debug routines reports. Often, these involve .dlls like, um, the windows kernel and various directX thingamajigs. I mention these because even on a brand new installation of windows, with hardly anything else on it, the game crashes routinely. These crashes transcend processor type, GPU type, OS, memory configuration, whatever. They've been going on for months if not years and Gazillion seems no closer to either fixing them or even communicating to anyone about them.\n\nAdd to this the ongoing glitched quests, unresponsive clickable objects/portals, items that won't equip properly, UI displays that don't update with the correct stats based on changing items, and all of that, and yeah, you have a seriously wonky game at times. It's a tribute to how essentially sound the concept is, and much of the execution even, that I even continue playing the damn thing. But the crashing and glitches are, to say the least, annoying. And even though the game is free to play, most everyone who plays for more than a few hours will put in a few bucks, if only for stash space and stuff like that. Once you put money in, your concern about bugs starts to get more intense, you might say.\n\nAnyhow, if you like Diablo III or Path of Excile or Grim Dawn type games, but want something faster, more gaudy, goofier, and over the top, this is a good place to find those things. It's not as polished as Blizzard's game (duh), nor is it as intricate as PoE, but it does what it sets out to do very well, and entertainingly.\n\nIf it just didn't have so damn many bugs....","June 21, 2015","true","107.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

That may be the best thing. Now they have a preview option for the characters before perming your choice. I had lag in one instance, however upon going to another it was cured within the same game. The beatem up linear style is usually something I am against. But due to the MMO style fan base where you can see others, and have them help you along your journey makes it even more entertaining allowing it to go above passable.\n\nThe loot system to me is a bit complex, but I played MMO's when Warcraft was first releasing so I may be out of my league until I get more up to snuff which I am sure will happen easily with time. That isn't a fault on the system, just me failing to easily become familier with it in a quick amount of time.\n\nThe end game seems decent enough, I have yet to achieve it due to the level cap and how long it takes to reach it with a single character. However I hear very good things, and if that isn't your flavor you can always swap characters trying a new one out.\n\nOne downside as with most Free to Play titles, is after you choose your character. You only get one character, that you can fully level up. With out putting in some good amount of time, or money you will be stuck to this character. So make sure you choose wisely and test each one to ensure your good experience.\n\nPath of Exile with Marvel. That is what it feels like to me, maybe even a bit simplified which isn't a bad thing.\nBest game I have seen Free To Play wise, and with a controller it is a fun way to spend some hours messing around at the very least. I would give this game a try even for casual beat em up fans, that have some what of a back ground in being a Marvel fan. Because the Marvel cosmetic really keeps the game fresh to another extent. At least it does for me.","May 10","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

First off, let's start with the heroes. This game has a myriad of different heroes, and it's a guarantee you can find your favourite one in this game. Every hero is well balance, making the playing field even, yet at the same time still allowing you to feel like your hero can do what he was meant to do. Hulk is still a walking tank, Wolverine is still a close combat menace, and Deadpool still excels at shooting, slicing, and most importantly, talking. As for the story, my honest opinion would be that it is sub-par at best, with many logic flaws, and the fact that your hero is most likely not even in the cut-scenes is a huge immersion breaker. The game-play on the other hand, is amazing. For a free to play game, this game is NOT pay to win in anyways. It's not too much of a grind if you want to get your favourite hero, if it isn't even in the tons of free available starters in the first place. And if you want to unlock a hero that isn't a starter instantly, you can just buy it. It's a tad pricey(About US$10-US$15), but for the hours you'll put into it, it's well worth the money. The controls are very easy to master, and the combat system is simple yet effective. The fact that the graphics are amazing and yet can run smoothly on my laptop is a bonus. What's more, much of the map is destructable! If you're a fan of MMORPGs and Marvel, this game is a must have!","October 16, 2014","true","35.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I find tons of fun playing this and playing as multiple heroes.  This game is 100% free.  Your given a good selection of heroes to pick from and can get more either by spending some cash or collection what's called eternity splinters and trading them in for a new hero.\n\nIf your a Marvel Comics fan then I recommend you give this a game a shot.","July 27, 2014","true","114.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

So if you want to Hulk Smash! you can (though he will take some time or money to get).\n\nAbout once a month they release a new hero for purchase, some of which are villains that occasionally have worked with heroes in the comics.

For instance, Black Widow entering the room to fight Doc Ock and saying something to the effect that the Doc of all people should know to fear spiders. or Loki looking at Deadpool (another player character) and wondering if he was a lunatic or a visionary.","December 24, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can get a new one every week or so if you play about 2-3 hours a day. Inventory space is very limited and shared between all your heroes (it will drive you insane after a while).\nAlso bugs.

I personally love playing a new hero and hear what they are commenting on. For example when you destroy your surroundings (a couch, walls, chairs) you have heroes who will say they prefer not making a mess, while other heroes seem to enjoy the destruction. The hero will also comment on other heroes. "i do not trust you" or "Finally a worthy apponent" are examples my heroes have said while in a hub with other players.\n\nMarvel Heroes is an MMO with a nice community. Yes there are trolls, that cant be helped. But for the most part the other players are willing to give information or direct you to informative pages. There are Supergroups, that are this games guilds/clans.\n\nThe one reason i would give to NOT play this game is about money. It is free to play. With patience and time you can do everything this game has to offer, except for inventory space. So your game life will be A LOT easier if you spend money. And in my opinion it is an expensive game when you do want to buy something. Things like heroes you can unlock through enough playtime to get 'splinters' to buy a hero in game. But inventory space is not attainable by other means than moeny as far as i know. And i do think that is a bad thing.\n\nTo end with a positive: the money that players do spend is used on the game. And from what i hear from the older players, Marvel Heroes is constant in development. Older heroes are reworked for improvement, new heroes are added, other things are added/improved, events, patches.\n\nSo give this game a try!

The development team care about the game, the player-base and also the IP. "Free-to-play" games tend to have a nasty sigma attached to them - cash grabs or pay to win. Well in Marvel Heroes none of that is true. All the heroes that you would like to play can be obtained from just playing the game. None of the heroes are gimped in anyway and all feature an exciting set of powers.\n\nWhen you start you can choose from nine different heroes. Characters such as Human Torch, Storm and Scarlet Witch. Other characters which can be unlocked include classic Marvel characters such as Spiderman, Thor and Hulk along with some of the more out there heroes like Rocket Raccoon and Squirel Girl.\n\nCurrently there are 31 playable heroes with more released each month - Invisible Women, Pyslocke and Reed Richards are the next scheduled heroes to be released.\n\nA good story mode, decent end-game content and PvP (exiting beta soon) all combine to make a great game.\n\nNow, as with many free-to-play games there is a premium currency - but you do not need to spend any of your hard earned cash. Sure, you can purchase heroes and costumes should you desire but you do not need to. Marvel Heroes has been designed to allow total and full access to all content for free.\n\nIf you enjoy Diablo, Torchlight or other Action RPG games then you will enjoy Marvel Heroes. It's free so download it and try it, you've got nothing to lose have you?","April 2, 2014","true","376.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also being free to play means you won't have access to most of the playable heroes/villains unless you pony up some serious cash. There are sales frequently, but it still costs at least $8+ per character and skins cost money as well.\n\nThe graphics are decent, the gameplay is solid, and most characters have meaningful differences. Unlike most Marvel video games, I actually feel like the characters I have played actually feel like decent representations of their comic counterparts.\n\nThe free to play hooks can be annoying (multiple currencies, grind, etc) but you do get to choose a free hero when you login the game for the first time. I recommend this game, just remember the free to play stuff might be far too much for some people. Throw $20 the game's way for a character or two (that you actually want to play), and maybe a skin, and you'll be just fine.","October 18, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My review in a nutshell: it's a free game, so download it and take it for a spin. It's really, really fun in the short term, but likely not in the long term.\n\nI found out about this game around the time I was looking for an alternative to Diablo III, which was plagued by both frustrating, unbalanced difficulty and (worse yet) a hostile and arrogant developer base that constantly found new and fresh ways to nerf players. When Marvel Heroes launched, it pretty much had the same issues, with numerous bugs on top of that, but eventually the lead developer stepped into the forums and told us they were going to overhaul the game. And they were wildly successful. Comparing the game at launch to the game at the end of 2013 is like comparing a dying firefly to the sun.\n\n2014 saw Doomsaw, the lead developer, begin reneging on his anti-nerf stance[i.imgur.com] and, worse, begin underhandedly silencing anyone who voiced their opinions against him[i.imgur.com]. The people in that compiled screenshot were far from disrespectful and it became clear Doomsaw was basically going on a power trip. Doomsaw's philosophy is to make heroes with high damage output but really terrible survivability. An example is when people pointed out that melee heroes couldn't survive a boss affix that summoned high-damage area-of-effect around them, whereas ranged heroes could just run away and still attack. The developers' response was to implement the Missile Reflect affix because clearly, the problem wasn't that melee survivability was in the toilet; the problem was that ranged heroes were surviving too much.\n\nThe second thing really hindering this game is its lack of longevity. The main draw is to level new heroes, which is great if you've got a particular hero you want to play as, but after a couple of iterations of (1) complete the story 3 times, (2) level up using legendary quests, and (3) hunt for gear, the game becomes stale really fast. I leveled 13 heroes and the only thing keeping me going was that I have an OCD-level aversion toward leaving something unfinished. Don't get me wrong – new heroes come out frequently and their artwork and powers are absolutely superb, but this doesn't really give the game longevity.\n\nThe game's free, and the first hero or 2 is amazingly fun. Download it, play through the story, and experience the different modes (Midtown Patrol is my favorite one). You'll have a blast for a month or two. Avoid the forums, and move on afterwards.","October 19, 2014","true","288.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I personally love playing a new hero and hear what they are commenting on. For example when you destroy your surroundings (a couch, walls, chairs) you have heroes who will say they prefer not making a mess, while other heroes seem to enjoy the destruction. The hero will also comment on other heroes. "i do not trust you" or "Finally a worthy apponent" are examples my heroes have said while in a hub with other players.\n\nMarvel Heroes is an MMO with a nice community. Yes there are trolls, that cant be helped. But for the most part the other players are willing to give information or direct you to informative pages. There are Supergroups, that are this games guilds/clans.\n\nThe one reason i would give to NOT play this game is about money. It is free to play. With patience and time you can do everything this game has to offer, except for inventory space. So your game life will be A LOT easier if you spend money. And in my opinion it is an expensive game when you do want to buy something. Things like heroes you can unlock through enough playtime to get 'splinters' to buy a hero in game. But inventory space is not attainable by other means than moeny as far as i know. And i do think that is a bad thing.\n\nTo end with a positive: the money that players do spend is used on the game. And from what i hear from the older players, Marvel Heroes is constant in development. Older heroes are reworked for improvement, new heroes are added, other things are added/improved, events, patches.\n\nSo give this game a try! See if you enjoy it :)","October 30, 2014","true","709.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Its initial goal was not pvp and thats okay .. i play pvp games for pvp .... things to do .. do i just loggon level do dailys and do another character the same again? ... no there are remort options collecting stackable objects for +1 bonuses , pimping all sorts of gear  ... hero point missions to earn special items which forever boost that character , pvp , pvp rings , several different story mode difficultys .. a heavy loot map , mid town and x defense  which is a place where you cn just go for same level play or a challenge without haveing to change maps . Most stuff in mall can be got through in game means . I am a casual gamer and how is my experience?

But later, as I slowly am growing more of a Marvel fan and wanting to look more into the story, I always found a funny feeling that struck me after I watched a Marvel movie.\n\nWhat, is it like, to be an Avenger, or part of the X-men, or anything else?\n\nWhat does it feel like to be a hero?\n\nSo I looked at this game again after putting it away for who knows how long, and I thought, hey after all, I am looking for a new game, might as well just give it a try. Trying to ignore the fact that it took 13GB of my space on my computer to play, I downloaded it, created an account, and got started.\nI chose a starter hero(Cyclops) to start the game, went through the whole beginning process, unlocked more heroes(Captain America by accident, Iron Man, Star Lord), stuck with Star Lord, and I played the whole game with Star Lord constantly upgrading him, soon making him impenetrable, and I have to say, it felt, absolutely, amazing!\nIt felt so great, the feeling of half-immortality, power, and the interesting things I can do to enemies. It was just a great, never-ending, action packed time. I NEVER got bored. The story may be long, the beginning may be a bit boring, but when you reach the  Avengers Tower to start the real journey, inspiration and excitement just fills you. So soon enough, I completed the storyline, defeated the "immortal" Dr. Doom, found out that wasn't the end, and I got Loki to worry about now. Everything, turned out great.\nThats not the end though, you think you're doing this alone? You think you can't be apart of your own Avengers in this journey? You, are wrong!\nVisit the War Machine to buy a scroll, to officially create a group of remarkable heroes and name the team, and grow your team to be a great, big, and famous group, known throughout the Marvel universe!\nI tried it out! I created a group known as the "Constellation Army", and I started inviting friends to it, soon enough, I felt the courage to go public, and now I have a huge team of superheroes who are known throughout the whole game, and now people ask to join! Its a great feeling to create something small, and let it grow to be famous, and life-changing!\n\nNow, the Constellation Army is always on duty fighting for SHIELD, and one thing we cover as a family, that no one, is alone on a mission(Literally, we always have a party going with HYDRA and us..)\n\nSo the point I conclude with is, this game may take a lot of space, it may have expensive prices and values, but you WILL NOT regret installing this game. You WILL not regret ANY choice you make, and remember EVERY choice you make in this game makes a difference.\nAnd the question I bring you, are you going to join the Constellation Army and help us fight the dastardly villains out there? Are you going to play a superhero YOUR way?\n\nAre you, going to become apart of the mysterious Marvel Universe today?\n\n\n(Talk to me if you're interested in joining us in the Constellation Army, and in the universe, I'll walk you through it!)","January 19, 2015","true","43.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

(Since it was made by the same people) Also, as a fan of comics/super-heros the experience is only enhanced that much more. They did this game very well, the beginning is newbie friendly and gives a large margain for error, but not so much that it is TOO easy. the end-game features an omega system (similiar to paragon from D3) and a raid with variable difficulty.\n\nPros:\n-FREE\n-Play as your favorite (marvel, duh) character.\n-Multiple costumes for each hero (purely cosmetic, but cost $)\n-Most helpful community I have ever encountered in any MMO (think opposite of WoW)\n-Drop rates* and XP are fast-paced and rewarding. (!!! loot'splosion emminent !!!)\n-Crafting/Enchanting\n-All currency/collectibles are account wide\n-Content updates regularly, Almost always a "special" event going on.\n-Interesting story with comic-book sytle cinematics (although it is relatively short, and can get repetative after playing through multiple heroes ... so could become a con, but I imagine ANY story when told 50+ times gets old)\n\nCons:\n-While all content (heroes, team-ups, gear, crafting/enchanting) is totally free, stash space is NOT. (this is where Gaz gets their money)You either have to trash most everything you dont plan on using in the very near future, or spend cash for stash.\n-Leveling up crafter/enchanter... This basically starts you off in credit debt, you have to donate "trash" items to the vendor of your choice to increase their abilities. BUT this isn't as terrible as it seems, since you really dont need credits for things until late into the game anyway. (no repairs)\n-No death penalty. (Outside of raids) Raids are the only area where dying has any effect. If you+your team die 30 times it auto-fails the encounter and you gotta start over, but other than that there really is no fear for being defeated/loosing. I understand this may appeal to some people, but personally I dont like it.\n\n\n*-All drop rates are subject to RNG. (What a fickle mistress she can be) Obviously late game BiS (best in slot) items drop rates significantly decrease, but you can still have comparable items without having "best"\n\nEdit: *There have been updates that allow you to purchase stash space with in-game currency.

Gameplay-wise, MH2015 is very similar to Diablo or any other isometric adventure game with the biggest difference being that the game is set in the licensed Marvel Universe. So you can see Black Widow in her Avengers movie costume running around, Rogue in her classic outfit fromt he 90s cartoon, and many more. Like all of the other games of this genre, end game is about grinding all unique gear and equipment to get as strong as possible. If that's not enough, and you're a glutton for punishment, you can 'prestige' your character by leveling them up to lvl 60 again with an exp gain handicap for a fancy color name. Not enough of a grind? Do it AGAIN with an even bigger handicap for a different color name. Yeeeeeah... that's not for me, so instead I'm more interested in outfitting a few characters.\n\nWithout bonuses from buying in bulk or deals, G (in-game $ currency) is 1-$0.01, so another storage page is 500G = $5.00. You can buy up to 19 more for a total of 20 storage pages. There are cheaper storage pages for specific things. You can get up to 6 pages that can store only crafting items for 300G, of which you'll likely want at least 2 because 1 of each Rune Word will take an entire storage page alone. You can also buy character specific storage pages which are essentially for storing alternate gear for 350G. Items stored on these pages have to have been worn and bound to the character. And of course, the game will give you 250G which is just barely not enough to afford any storage to help nudge you into that first purchase. If you like the game and want to play a lot without throwing all your items out, you will likely spend at least 1600G on storage alone for 2 pages of crafting and 2 pages of storage.\n\nIf you know exactly what you are looking for and don't keep any spare equipment/ items, you could get by with 1 storage (48), character inventory (60), and team-up inventory (30). This will probably keep you from trying to equip multiple characters a time and saving alternate equipment to switch builds but it's probably possible if you insist on remaining F2P. Of course there are some restricted costumes that you can only obtain by paying $ for, but all characters can be obtained with in-game currency without spending $. All content is open and access is unrestricted. But man, that inventory cap is just killer and is really the biggest push to make you spend $.\n","November 18, 2014","true","68.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an easy loot-fest, with a fantastic marvel skin.\n\nThe pricing model is a bit egregious, but the "free" currency you earn is pretty easy to get, and if you're patient enough you'll never have to spend a dime (unless you want more bank storage space..)\n\nYou get 1 free character out of a set 10 they have, you get to play each of those 10 up to level 10, and upon the first time that character reaches 10, you'll be given an option to "uncap" that character to essentially unlock them for you.\n\nYour Day 2 login reward gives you 400 Eternity Shards ("free currency") which essentially allows you to unlock 1 (or 2!) new characters by the 2nd day you're playing the game. Each character has a different cost ranging from 200 to 600 Eternity Shards, with 400 being the "average" price for most characters.\n\nOverall, it's an incredibly fun game, and I'd be singing it's praises from the rooftops if the pricing were a bit more friendly ($10 for a hero, $10-20 for costumes? Yikes.. fortunately, you can buy a character pack for ~$15 that gives you a character & 1 or 2 costumes, as well as other goodies.)","March 4, 2015","true","121.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not knowing the marvel world isnt a hinderence in fact it can lead to you looking up now favourite heros you play to find out more about the character . griefers can be "/ignore insert-name" . Its initial goal was not pvp and thats okay .. i play pvp games for pvp .... things to do .. do i just loggon level do dailys and do another character the same again? ... no there are remort options collecting stackable objects for +1 bonuses , pimping all sorts of gear  ... hero point missions to earn special items which forever boost that character , pvp , pvp rings , several different story mode difficultys .. a heavy loot map , mid town and x defense  which is a place where you cn just go for same level play or a challenge without haveing to change maps . Most stuff in mall can be got through in game means . I am a casual gamer and how is my experience? Great i came back like 2 months ago to find lengendary items were now availible I go away then come back and rune equips are now there .. everytime i seem to go away something fantastic happens when i loggon next lol . a massive change from my old game where the only change in 2 years has been the shape of a couple space ships.","February 8, 2014","true","757.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Or you could buy your favorite character and play that one or earn shards to unlock other characters either randomly or save for an exact one. This game is said to play kind of like a super hero themed Diablo. It's 100% free and you don't NEED to ever spend any real life money if you don't want to, you can work for the other heroes by playing the game. I enjoyed buying multiple characters then unlocking more because I get bored with one character when I play MMORPGs. You can even play some "villains" such as Magneto, Venom, Juggernaut, Loki, Deadlpool, etc. The character voices in this game are nice in my opinion. I feel like they got actors to try to sound like the characters and I think they did a good job. You don't even NEED to team if you don't want to, you can solo to 60 if you want. I bought a Team-Up Hero to add more flavor to my play style and because it helps you kill people and you solo faster.\n\nThe only "con" to this game for me is I feel like once I run the story on one character to nearly max level, I feel like my next character and ones after that are repeating in the same footsteps. It's still a fun game and it's worth playing. There are multiple things to do besides running the same story lines so don't think that's all there is to the game. Tons of other side quests, and there's some raids, and you can re-beat old villains at higher levels to get better versions of their loot.\n\nI give this game a strong 8/10 because it kept my brain busy for many hours and I haven't seen any serious flaws in the game. It's 100% free so try it out. I think the game developers did a good job. They're always adding new characters and items! I like their sales page because they're always putting something on sale for you too.","December 26, 2014","true","303.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Ignore the meta-gaming about who's the "best" hero to play and just pick your favorite.\nThis game is very dangerous to have installed. I keep finding myself loading it up instead of working on my backlog. The heroes are so varied in playstyle that it's the most fun I've ever had leveling up alts. If you played this when it first came out (sans the 2015 part of the name) you owe it to yourself to try it again. They've made massive improvements since its launch. Most of the voice acting is great, and none of it is bad (some lines do get annoying due to repetition, but that happens in every game). The free-to-play element is really set up well. The only thing you'll really feel like you need to spend money is extra storage space, but the game is so well done that I don't begrudge them for it. Their hard work deserves to be rewarded somehow.","December 26, 2014","true","880.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The community is also very active, there is VERY little toxicity and everyone is quite nice and will happily lend you a hand in information and even enchanting materials.

The game was way too freaking easy.\nEverything about this game when I first played it felt like a joke, I face smashed through the first 3 major areas of the game and had not one single moment where I felt like I might die.\nIn fact, the hardest boss I ever fought was 3 bosses (king pin, elektra, and bullseye)\n\n\nSadly, the game still feels super easy on the normal mode, but now once you pass up normal mode it does feel a lot more satisfying on the harder modes, which you can only unlock after beating the game (prior to the new added last boss).\nThe first 30 levels still feel like sort of a breeze, but it's not so bad that you just feel bored luckily.\n\n\n\nOver all, this is a great dungeon crawl type game, with a decent crafting and upgrade system, and fun satisfying characters and abilities.\nThe voice acting and little interactions between characters is also entertaining, and now that picking your first character is more hands on and open, you wont suffer from seeing 900 copies of "IT'S CLOBBERIN TIME!" on the screen, or 400 scarlet witches.\n\nOver all, very worth it for a free to play title, and if you grow attached to a character, consider a skin.\n","July 2, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Or you could buy your favorite character and play that one or earn shards to unlock other characters either randomly or save for an exact one. This game is said to play kind of like a super hero themed Diablo. It's 100% free and you don't NEED to ever spend any real life money if you don't want to, you can work for the other heroes by playing the game. I enjoyed buying multiple characters then unlocking more because I get bored with one character when I play MMORPGs. You can even play some "villains" such as Magneto, Venom, Juggernaut, Loki, Deadlpool, etc. The character voices in this game are nice in my opinion. I feel like they got actors to try to sound like the characters and I think they did a good job. You don't even NEED to team if you don't want to, you can solo to 60 if you want. I bought a Team-Up Hero to add more flavor to my play style and because it helps you kill people and you solo faster.\n\nThe only "con" to this game for me is I feel like once I run the story on one character to nearly max level, I feel like my next character and ones after that are repeating in the same footsteps. It's still a fun game and it's worth playing. There are multiple things to do besides running the same story lines so don't think that's all there is to the game. Tons of other side quests, and there's some raids, and you can re-beat old villains at higher levels to get better versions of their loot.\n\nI give this game a strong 8/10 because it kept my brain busy for many hours and I haven't seen any serious flaws in the game. It's 100% free so try it out. I think the game developers did a good job. They're always adding new characters and items!

Ignore the meta-gaming about who's the "best" hero to play and just pick your favorite.\nThis game is very dangerous to have installed. I keep finding myself loading it up instead of working on my backlog. The heroes are so varied in playstyle that it's the most fun I've ever had leveling up alts. If you played this when it first came out (sans the 2015 part of the name) you owe it to yourself to try it again. They've made massive improvements since its launch. Most of the voice acting is great, and none of it is bad (some lines do get annoying due to repetition, but that happens in every game). The free-to-play element is really set up well. The only thing you'll really feel like you need to spend money is extra storage space, but the game is so well done that I don't begrudge them for it.

The game was way too freaking easy.\nEverything about this game when I first played it felt like a joke, I face smashed through the first 3 major areas of the game and had not one single moment where I felt like I might die.\nIn fact, the hardest boss I ever fought was 3 bosses (king pin, elektra, and bullseye)\n\n\nSadly, the game still feels super easy on the normal mode, but now once you pass up normal mode it does feel a lot more satisfying on the harder modes, which you can only unlock after beating the game (prior to the new added last boss).\nThe first 30 levels still feel like sort of a breeze, but it's not so bad that you just feel bored luckily.\n\n\n\nOver all, this is a great dungeon crawl type game, with a decent crafting and upgrade system, and fun satisfying characters and abilities.\nThe voice acting and little interactions between characters is also entertaining, and now that picking your first character is more hands on and open, you wont suffer from seeing 900 copies of "IT'S CLOBBERIN TIME!" on the screen, or 400 scarlet witches.\n\nOver all, very worth it for a free to play title, and if you grow attached to a character, consider a skin.\n","July 2, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I find the gameplay to be addicting and fun, every hero plays differently.  There's some overlap, big tanky guys like Colossus, Thing, and Hulk have similarities in powers but there's enough different in each of their trees to keep them feeling fun.  To me it's very much a social experience, I'm in a great guild with lots of fun folks so it makes the content grind a lot easier to bear.\n\nIf you're a fan of Diabloesque games, or Marvel comics in general I'd suggest giving this one a try.  There's plenty to spend your money on, but you can get just about everyting for free in game.  Eternity Splinters are an in-game currency that drop every eight minutes or so.  You buy new heroes with them.  The prices range from 200, 400, and 600.  Or what most newer folks opt to do is spend 175 on a random hero box.  Which as the name implies, can give you any hero on the roster at random.\n\nNew costumes can be obtained by a sort of costume blender at the crafter.  Three of any costume gets you any random one.  The prestige system grants you a copy of your starter costume everytime you use it, so if you prestige all six times, that's two shots at the blender alone.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone.  When you hit the max level it gets pretty grindy, and if you're not into that then you won't have a lot of fun doing the end game stuff.  The first raid is pretty cool though, and they have new ones on the way.  They release a new hero every month or so, and have new game and story content coming all the time.  Not as often as the heroes but it's just enough to keep a lot of folks interested.","September 23, 2014","true","935.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yet, it's still extremely different somehow.\n\nAre the controls hard? Meh, I'd say it's moderate, and just takes time to get used to it. Is it awesome? It's very fast paced, that's for sure! Is it hard? No. Not as far as I can tell, that is. Hopefully they'll fix that, because I've been kicking ♥♥♥ playing as DareDevil, so surely to everyone else, it's easy enough to catch on to the powers/attacks. Though, after awhile, I'm going to want a more serious challenge.\n\nFinally, do you have to know much about all these Marvel Super Heroes? Not really... In time, and with enough effort, you can eventually play as any hero you want, and with that, you can simply look at their bio to see who they are, and what their story is.

Designed by the man behind Diablo 2, even plays a bit like that amazing classic, but with Marvel Heroes, and a few anti heroes (Loki, Dr. Doom, Taskmaster).

They are constantly upgrading, adding content, new heroes, pets, and team-ups.  The community of players are the best I have encountered in gaming, new players aren't put down, or berated for asking questions.  There are giveaways on the forums done by the players all the time for in game items, as well as store items.  These are all things that one would expect from a top tier pay to buy, and play game.  But, this game is free to download, and free to play!!!  You can test any but the most recent heroes up to level 10, then decide which one you want to unlock to max level.  You can buy heroes, etc from the in game, or website store, but all heroes, and team ups can be unlocked for free with an in-game currency called Eternity Splinters, which are drops.  Really the only major thing you have to buy with real cash is extra storage, or S.T.A.S.H., though there are rumors that they may be available for purchase with the Eternity Splinters in the future.

Try it!-\n\nThis is surprisingly a good Diablo clone.\n\nThe obvious negative about this game is it's free-to-play model, and the fact that you only get one character (to start with.) If you pick someone you don't like, too bad. A period at the start where you could try them out first for a map each, or something like that, would help offset this. The 20 dollar price tag for most of the other characters is really steep, as well.\n\nStill, the actual gameplay and things are done very well in my opinion. The maps have the normal story missions, as well as little events that can pop up. You can just dog pile these, without having to worry about grouping with the other players. You can collect these rare shards that drop to purchase characters as well, but the number required is a little ridiculous.\n\nOverall, it's a good game that is worth checking out if Diablo, Torchlight, and other games in this genre are your kind of thing.","June 17, 2014","true","816.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So far i have invested $25 cause i likes stash space.\n\n\nStash space can now be bought with in game currency.","July 24, 2015","true","087.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The free2play model was actually quite good in my opinion. No matter what was implemented, Gazillion always made it an option that a player could play the entire game without a true NEED to purchase anything. A player could easily get by without spending Gs and still experience all the content.\nBy launch, the game was ready in the sense that most of the promises had been kept; but the game lacked replayability, character distinction was non-existent, and there was not a single item in the game that would keep a player playing after they hit level cap. Starting a new character was the only draw, and that meant you were not distinct or empowered moreso than someone who just created a new account. Purchasing new characters could cost $5-15 and would not offer any new content other than a slightly different playstyle or look. As a free2play game, the game was decent and offered a bit of fun, but the store was not worth it as after playing through all the missions with one character, the game went stale.\nThankfully--those days seem to be over.\n\nAs of Jan. 2014, after having taken an MHO hiatus for nearly half a year, I started MHO back up and it seems they have come quite a ways. A few of the promises have not been kept up, but most have been; and some that weren't are at least seem to be in the works. There is a new Synergy system where leveling up a character to specific levels (25,50) grants account wide bonuses to all heroes. Seven new heroes, including the unexpected Loki are now playable, so their original lofty goal of having a new character once per month was nearly attained. Several new item slots have been added: Uru-forge, legendary, ring, and even a pet slot. It is also very nice to have seen some of my ideas make it to live as well, such as having various packages for fortune cards, and various icons in the mission log to distinguish completion for various heroes. A "prestige" system seems to be in place as well, though I don't know the details of that just yet. During early beta I also wrote up an achievement system to enhance replayability and customer retention--the devs promised that although such a system would not be done by release, it would be implemented sometime after launch. As with most promises Gaz made, they held to it as an achievements tab is there with a note saying "coming in 2014," so I am very much looking forward to that! The store also has several new costumes, including some rather cool and strange ones, such as a Lady Deadpool costume, Daredevil "I'm not Daredevil" costume, and others. Not to mention the graphics seem to be much more refined and smooth as well as having far more options available. During beta I spent most of my time in the technical support forum helping those on low-end machines run the game and Gaz had optimized the game even down to the HD3000 graphics chipset. I suspect the game may run even more smoothly on low-end machines than during beta so hopefully that promise has been kept as well.\n\nAll in all--the game looks to be far more replayable than it ever was and I plan to dabble in it for a while and pick it up again strong when the achievement system fully gets in place. Post-launch I did not recommend this game to anyone, though I suggested they try it but without high hopes. In its current form--I do recommend this game and will be recommending friends to give it a try. =)","January 29, 2014","true","124.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

From the market you can get costumes and new characters, but nothing to give you an in game edge (other than items that boost your item finding and XP rates--but that's not gamebreaking IMO.) I've played a lot of Diablo 3 and Path of Exile lately, but this game by far in my opinion surpasses both of them in both. There are like twenty marvel superheroes to choose from. Each one is unique and specific--they stand out. It's like a they created a unique diablo class for every character. There are multiple game modes and the story-mode is so awesome--to me it feels like you're playing in a Marvel comic. The loot system is intelligent, giving you loot thats more specific to your character. Crafting is amazing. If you find a good piece at lower grade, you can easily craft it into an epic (purple) item for just a small amount of materials.\n\nThey're adding new playable characters and content all the time. There's several game modes, so it never gets stale and you're not stuck repeating the story over and over again! I don't normally toot so much about a game, but I'm just blown away. I think I finally found my game--after months and months of searching. Anyways, check it out. You have nothing to lose other than some disk space and you can always free it up if you dislike it.","February 15, 2014","true","204.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is a watered down "Pay to win" in that additional storage space has to paid for and is a must have, which may put off some players, but there is plenty of content and plenty of fun to be had without spending a penny.  However spending a moderate amount of money (about $19) to purchase enough storage to accomodate a crafting materials storage tab and two additional general tabs should be enough to cater for most players needs.  Essentially a game of this size, scope and quality should sell for about $40, so spending some cash is a nice way to thank the developers and the publisher.\n\nThe player is given a selection of ten starting heroes which can all be leveled to level 10.  In the free to play side of the game the player has an option to unlock one of the heroes (after reaching level 10) enabling leveling to level 60.  Additional characters can be unlocked using in-game currency (eternity splinters which have a drop rate of one splinter every eight to ten minutes) which will take many hours to grind in-game, or players can purchase game currency from the in-game store for real world American Dollars.  The most efficient way to unlock heroes is to purchase random hero boxes which cost 175 eternity splinters each.  Playing an average of four hours a day most players will be able to unlock one random hero a week.\n\nGameplay is fast and fun with a seamless and smooth massively multiplayer drop-in drop-out mechanic.\n\nGraphics is in full HD (1920 x 1080p) and the artwork is true to the original Marvel comics and animated TV series and spin-offs.  Voice acting is well done and the Super Hero quick witted edgy comments make the marvel universe feel alive.\n\nGameplay bears similarity to titles like Syndicate/Syndicate Wars and Diablo 3.  Viewpoint is isometric 3-D and the user interface is well designed and easy to use and navigate.  There are a good selection of customizable game settings.\n\nThe design is open-world and quests can be either accepted from quest givers or discovered by exploration.  There is a linear story mode with animated cut scenes and voice-overs but players are free to explore and grind levels elsewhere if they so choose.\n\nPlayers can sell excess items to vendors for credits, or can donate the items to the crafter or the enchanter to level their abilities and unlock crafting or enchanting recipes respectively.\n\nPlayers will meet many of the villains and experience a variety of locations.  The world is huge, possibly even massive with plenty of small corners and hidden pathways and back alleys to explore.\n\nOverall a competent time waster that is free to play but will reward players who are prepared to dig into their back pockets.  There is plenty of fun and enjoyment to be had regardless of whether you play for free or pay to progress faster.\n\n7.7 / 10","March 5, 2015","true","196.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Marvel Heroes 2016 is not the Marvel Heroes that was released straight out of Beta. When I first played it I wasn't sure if I really liked it. I would have given it mediocre at best. But as it stands today with the amount of content it offers, this is quite possibly the best Free-to-Play game on the market - especially if you're an ARPG fan as I am.\n\nYes, I said Free-to-Play and NOT Pay-to-win. Just about everything (if not all) in Marvel Heroes is attainable in some form or another without needing spend a single dime. But I do admit it can be time consuming, and if you're hoping to get a specific costume for free then pray to RNGesus. I put money into the game because it's a game that I love and believe deserves it. The only thing I still don't agree with are the costume prices, but at least they have no bearing on gameplay or how well you perform.\n\nI've played just about all the current ARPG games out now and Marvel Heroes is still my favourite. It offers a cast of characters that I love, gameplay that is really addicting and fun, and varied modes that keeps it refreshing. At some point I'm sure I'll wander off to play something else, but I know I'll eventually be back for more.","May 19","true","516.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It helps that they also made it ridiculously entertaining and fun to play.\n\nOnce you pick your first hero from the list of Captain America, Punisher, Black Panther, Storm, Colossus, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Human Torch, and Luke Cage, you are thrown into the midst of things pretty quickly. There's a decent amount of in-game instruction, and the community is surprisingly friendly and (usually) willing to help out if you have any questions, a far cry from the norm in a F2P game. Before long, you'll be hunting down D-list supervillians, hunting for new loot, and working your way through your hero's skill tree.\n\nBecause each hero has a completely unique skill tree, and by extension, power set, they can each be thought of as an individual class in a traditional Action RPG. Instead of a Paladin, Archer, and Barbarian, you've got Iron Man, Deadpool, and Rocket Raccoon.\n\nNearly every week, an event is going on that offers some sort of bonus. It might be double experience, it might be increased drop rates, it could be as simple as getting a random item when you log in. The in game currency used to purchase new heroes, Eternity Splinters, drop at least once every 5 minutes. I've sat there and timed it. It's like clockwork. You could save up 175 and get a random hero, or save up either 200, 400, or 600 for the specific hero you want. The only thing you can only get with actual money is more storage space, and given the quality of this game, you'll be needing it.\n\nIf I haven't convinced you to try it out yet, maybe this will. David Brevik is the lead on the game. Brevik worked on a game called Diablo 2.\n\nMarvel Heroes is awesome.","February 23, 2014","true","519.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The work and progress done by the developers since launch has made this game completely different from what it was when it first began. The effort put to bring this game where it stands now is attributed to both the developers and the amazing community this game has. Forums are an active pool of information, which should be checked occasionally, since the developers are very active there, providing information, asking for feedback and spoiling things - content which is to come.\n\nThe game is free to play, although this genre is perceived differently to each individual. The game is definitely not pay to win since there is no way to pay cash in order to obtain some sort of unique gear which puts you on top of other players who don't spend real money. Most items sold through the cash shop offer comfort throughout your playing experience (more stash space, xp boosts, costumes to alter your heros appearance etc.).\n\nMoreover, your get to pick and play heroes (and even some anti-heroes) from an ever increasing hero roster.\n\nOverall the game has very good depth and offers quite the excitement and is worth trying. You should keep in mind though that the game is following a weekly patch schedule with non stop updates, bugfixes etc. The developers are moving with babysteps into improving this game so some things are not added to the game immediately.\n\n\nPros\nA free to play Marvel superhero game\nFast paced with depth and many things to do\nMany different game modes and more new ones to be added in due time\nAmazing community and communication - interaction with the developer team\nWeekly patches with small/big changes and events\nAlmost every month, a new hero to play\nHeroes, Team - Ups (followers who add special bonuses to your hero, assist in combat etc) are also purchasable with in-game currency called Eternity Splinter.\nXP and minor stat synergies(whih are account wide) gained through leveling heroes\n\nCons\nOccasionally on some zones the game suffers from memory leaks (can be fixed with a quick relog)\nIf you decide to spend cash on the game, it is a bit expensive\nRNG can be painful sometimes\nUltimate Upgrade mechanism is against the current philosophy of the game which encourages you to level many heroes\n\nFinally the game holds some sort of veteran system through two (2) modes (this is a personal view). These are the daily login rewards and the omega system. Login everyday to receive a small reward which can help you through your gaming experience and finally as you progress with lvling heroes you obtain omega points. New players will find themselves behind veteran ones as they start with zero omega points.","December 30, 2014","true","060.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There are other things than the main quests to undertake such as wave modes in the shield HQ and you can repeat alot of previously completed missions and some new unique ones, on higher difficulties for chances of good loot, like the rifts in Diablo 3.\n\nI didn't try PVP but everyone so far is saying it's a broken mess.\n\nThe gameplay has alot of comedy to it, for instance, I had a few items with reflects damage on them while playing as Iron Man and I zoomed in up close and watched as a bunch of mafia dudes fired their guns and the bullets bounced back at them and killed them. So funny watching a bunch of mafia goons with baseball bats KO themselves out by hitting iron man.\n\nIt's also funny picking up trash cans and launching them at people.\n\nBut, after the novelty has ended you're basically left with a Diablo clone, it becomes all about the numbers you inflict when you press your buttons and the game is nowhere near as polished as Diablo. Despite being free, if you want to quickly have access to the heroes you want to play, you'll have to pay money for them. You can maybe once every few days afford a free unlock token but it's for a random hero. The actual hero tokens are more expensive and take a long time to farm with the ingame currency.\n\nThe game also swamps you with items, many different kinds of items and expects you to get your head around all of it. For example you have these things that drop that you need to craft items and they stack up very quickly, requiring that you sit around in HQ transforming them into the more valuable variants for long periods of time or your inventory will fill up quickly. The game gives you one or two inventory slots for free when you start and you get like 4 for free as you approach level 60. This is not enough. The game also gives you cases of gear, with epic legendary items that you can't use yet, so you're left with this overwhelming amount of items just flooding out of your pockets and guess what? It costs money to unlock additional inventory spaces.\n\nThis ruined the game for me, alot of people love the opportunity to manage loot but whatever happened to just dollars and basic stuff like that? There are different forms of currencies and all these multitudes of items and tokens and in the end it just left me feeling burdened by it.\n\nNeverwinter had the similar problem, where I was faced with Gold, Astral Diamonds, tokens of this, tokens of that, these gems, those gems, all these different other things to screw around with, half of which costing real money to obtain, when the real successful games have One form of currency and maybe some elite tokens you need to farm to get uber gear. Games like EverQuest, you had platinum aaaaand that's it. World of Warcraft you have gold aaaand that's it. Any other forms of gear progression are introduced to you slowly at the correct time for when you need to know about it. In WoW, enter a battleground? You find out you earn Honor points, and these are what you need for the gear (at least it used to be when I played) that helps you kill people and survive better in PvP. In Neverwinter? You're swamped with many different kinds of currency and tokens from level one.\n\nIt's exactly the same with this game. The sheer amount of stuff it just throws in your face is too much and that's why for this game I award the score of:\n\nStanding in s**t at your birthday party / 10\n\n\nYeah you're having a decent amount of fun as you're punching people around, roasting people as Cyclops or leaping around smashing stuff as The Hulk, but there is just too much gimmick here, too much cheese, not enough polish and a large amount of poop on your foot","July 21, 2015","true","182.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The work and progress done by the developers since launch has made this game completely different from what it was when it first began. The effort put to bring this game where it stands now is attributed to both the developers and the amazing community this game has. Forums are an active pool of information, which should be checked occasionally, since the developers are very active there, providing information, asking for feedback and spoiling things - content which is to come.\n\nThe game is free to play, although this genre is perceived differently to each individual. The game is definitely not pay to win since there is no way to pay cash in order to obtain some sort of unique gear which puts you on top of other players who don't spend real money. Most items sold through the cash shop offer comfort throughout your playing experience (more stash space, xp boosts, costumes to alter your heros appearance etc.).\n\nMoreover, your get to pick and play heroes (and even some anti-heroes) from an ever increasing hero roster.\n\nOverall the game has very good depth and offers quite the excitement and is worth trying. You should keep in mind though that the game is following a weekly patch schedule with non stop updates, bugfixes etc. The developers are moving with babysteps into improving this game so some things are not added to the game immediately.\n\n\nPros\nA free to play Marvel superhero game\nFast paced with depth and many things to do\nMany different game modes and more new ones to be added in due time\nAmazing community and communication - interaction with the developer team\nWeekly patches with small/big changes and events\nAlmost every month, a new hero to play\nHeroes, Team - Ups (followers who add special bonuses to your hero, assist in combat etc) are also purchasable with in-game currency called Eternity Splinter.\nXP and minor stat synergies(whih are account wide) gained through leveling heroes\n\nCons\nOccasionally on some zones the game suffers from memory leaks (can be fixed with a quick relog)\nIf you decide to spend cash on the game, it is a bit expensive\nRNG can be painful sometimes\nUltimate Upgrade mechanism is against the current philosophy of the game which encourages you to level many heroes\n\nFinally the game holds some sort of veteran system through two (2) modes (this is a personal view). These are the daily login rewards and the omega system. Login everyday to receive a small reward which can help you through your gaming experience and finally as you progress with lvling heroes you obtain omega points. New players will find themselves behind veteran ones as they start with zero omega points.","December 30, 2014","true","060.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So if your a fan of those games then you should definitely check this title out. It's free to play so there's no excuse. It's a typical ARPG with roots in Diablo. You have a huge roster of heroes to choose from, there are skill trees for each hero, and you have gear to farm for. The game consists of nine acts, with three seperate difficulties. You also have what's called terminals that offer a variety of different modes such as X-defense which is a survival style gameplay, Midtown Manhattan is a endless beat em up, group challenges, solo challenges, and finally PvP. With more modes to come!\n\nIt's a solid game with a good F2P model and the development of this game has come a long way. Both Marvel Heroes and Gazillion continue to improve dramatically.\n\nTL:DR - Play this game, it's like crack cocaine with super heroes.","November 27, 2013","true","902.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However there has been one tiny problem that is really bugging me: HOW DO I CHANGE MY NAME? So a year or two back when I was making my account, it would say for every name I used that it was taken, so I got really mad after 100 trys (literally, 100) and made my name: "FUUUUUUUUUUUUU" and it worked. But I thought that later I can change it, however I forgot about making a new account because I realized I couldn't change it because I got so caught up in the game that I spent money in game from real life and I have leveled up the character I bought to lvl 30. And so I thought that if I make a new account now I would have to make a new game, I would have to start over, level up again, and buy what I bought before again. So yeah, that is pretty much all I wish was different about this game, other than that however this game is AWESOME.","June 10, 2015","true","204.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","5","9","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VenetianHamburger/recommended/226320/","VenetianHamburger","Pop Culture Reference","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VenetianHamburger/","94 products in account","I grew up with Marvel, I read the comics, watched the shows, and debated in YouTube comments about who would win a fight against. I've fantasized about a game like this, where you can run around as your favorite characters doing the ♥♥♥♥ that they did in the comics so this game is pretty much a dream come true for me. This does not however, mean it's free of problems. In order of how annoying these problems are with 1. being the most hair pulling:\n\n1. ♥♥♥♥ not spawning- this is particulary annoying if you're trying to level up your character as quickly as you can. There are these things called Legendary Quests that you unlock at level 20 which are basically 1-3 things the game wants you to do with certain restrictions. Some of the times, the game will want you to kill X amount of a certain enemies in a certain place, or clear Y amount of Treasure Rooms (instances). The maps are randomally generated so you won't know where the enemies or Treasure Rooms are before starting the quest. Occasionally, the game will bug out and either not spawn enough enemies for you to kill, or simply not spawn the Treasure Room at all. And since the maps are randomally generated, you won't know the game bugged out until you've explored every corner of that area, which takes about 10-15 minutes\n\n2. "Expensive" ♥♥♥♥-  Costumes and new heroes are expensive. Not extremely expensive, other popular games like LoL, DOTA, and Smite have new characters and costumes that cost more than they do here. But paying $15 to play as Doctor Doom is kind of insane.\n\n3. Not a lot of new ♥♥♥♥ to explore- Starting from complaint 3, these are more mehs because they come with an upside. Most of the negative reviews are about how there aren't too many different areas to explore. After about 30 hours of playing the game, you've seen about everything the map has to offer, Gaz's priority isn't giving additional content for your heroes to explore. What their priority is however, is releasing new Heroes for you to play. Marvel Heroes is really a game about the characters, you entertain yourself for the amount of time it takes to level 1-60 because all the heroes are different and you're trying out different builds. By the time you start getting bored with a Hero, you'll be around level 50-54, at which point you decide you might as well max them out before moving onto the next Hero on your roster. So this really isn't a complaint because it's still giving us new things to do\n\n4. Sassy Community (not ♥♥♥♥♥♥)- I love sassy. If I were to ever get married, I'd want my wife to have sass. It's entertaining, funny, and keeps the time flying. The sass does get a bit annoying when you need help with something. Most of the time, when a new player asks for help, the chat looks something like this:\nPlayer A- Hey, what do the ship's engines look like? I need to destroy 20 for my Legendary Quest\nPlayer B- Engines.\n\nThe community is helpful at times though, they'll give genuinelly really good advice that you won't find on the forums. It's a friendly community, and people will often start talking about other video games, movies, politics etc etc\n\n\nFinal Thoughs: Play this game, especially if you're a fan of Marvel like I am. There are about 50 Heroes you can play with, and more are being added constantly. The community is friendly (although occasionally unhelpful), the gameplay is fun, and although some things are expensive and the game will bug out (rarely), no one's forcing you buy the new Hero and if the game bugs out, you just reload the instance.\n8/10","July 5, 2015","true","390.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","2"

I started playing Marvel Heroes during beta and it was in pretty bad shape. I had a lot of hopes for this game because what could be better than everyone's favorite Marvel characters in a arpg? In the begining it was awful.\n\nThe game has changed since then adding in a lot of requested features and there is a weekly patch that usually adds in some quality of life changes or a new weekly event. As in any arpg there is a siginificant grind to the game, so if you are a gamer who hates that I would stear clear. I personally enjoy it to a degree and there are other activites to entertain you to break up the gear grind ranging from the story to terminals to one shot stories and raids.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about the game is that since it is free to play some of the most requested items and costumes (which are for vanity purposes only) are often locked behind cash items called fortune cards. These cards are a gamble as the most requested items are a rare drop from these cards and are affected by a random number generator, I have no problem with a company creating a free to play game and selling vanity items, hell I've spent my fair share of money on this game, but it really bothers me that the most requested costumes and items are not for actual sale. We have to gamble to get them and because of the RNG the cost can be incredibly inflated.\n\nOverall the game mechanics are great. Best arpg since Diablo II in my opinion and the closest game we will get to another X-Men Legends or Marvel Ultimate Alliance for the foreseable future. The downsides are the gear grind if you hate doing that sort of thing and some vanity items being locked behind a RNG. I give it a 8/10.","January 7, 2015","true","363.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKRIIIEX/recommended/226320/","SKRIIIEX","aesthetics","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SKRIIIEX/","4 products in account","Surprisingly Addictive\n----------------------\nMarvel Heroes 2015 has become a new addition to my gaming library. As an avid rpg fan I was happy to find another game to add to my arsenal. I've only played the game for just under a month and can definately say it is worth the investment in both time and small amounts  of money.\n\nAfter playing DC Universe Online, I had low expectations for another super hero mmo rpg; 'pay to win' comes to mind. However, it is fairly difficult for an rpg to be pay to win. You play the game in your own time and enjoy it more as you progress, this review will focus on the Leveling aspect of the game, seeing as you will need to do this 88 times (88 heroes at the time of writing this review.)\n\nYour first 20 levels will be your easiest and can be accomplished in under 15 minutes on some Heroes. However, once you hit level 20 leveling becomes a lot more tedious. You will be introduced to Legendary Quests, this is what you will be doing all the way to level 60. My first character took just under a week to level (playing for 2-3 hours a day) and it became a tedious chore to push through the last few levels. Never the less, it does become easier; the more heroes you have at 60 the more boosts you will receive both experience and stat wise. Keep in mind there are many factors to take into account when grinding. Some players have reported taking only 4 hours to level a hero from 1-60, utilising bonus experience boosts, hero synergy and server-wide boosts. Overrall, leveling isn't as bad as in some rpg games.\n\nThis game is heavily grind based but is some-what surprisingly addictive despite the end-less hours spent killing mobs and bosses. Each time you reach 60 you want to play a new hero however, although all the heroes are available to you up till level 10, you feel an enhanced sense of relief when you 'uncap' a hero, even if they don't sound exciting initially. I have uncapped 4 heroes at the time of writing this guide and can comfortabley say I enjoyed levelling each of them, mainly due to each of them having a unique skillset.\n\nThe end game content is still heavily grind based in the sense that you're trying to obtain the best items in the game, but once you've achieved this on one character you have 88* more to look forward to.\n\nThis game is certainly not pay to win, nor pay to enjoy, but I do recommend buying heroes when there is a particular special or sale like 'buy one get one free' as the more heroes you have the more you will enjoy the game.\n\nOverrall, I give Marvel Heroes 2015 a 7.5/10.\n\n*at the time of writing this guide","July 9, 2015","true","113.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Apparently such a game mode is being added at some point in the future though.\nTimed drops, boosting "item find" through "potions" has almost no effect.\nEvery new patch introduces new bugs as well, QA is almost non-existant even though a test realm does exist.\nIf you're outside of the US you will often get a very high ping resulting in lags during peak times.\nUnbalanced heroes, power creep....new heroes feel overpowered compared to old ones.\nUninspiring loot, a lot of filler items. Almost every character has the same BIS (best-in-slot) items, random uniques are almost always useless compared to hero-uniques.\nUnoptimized game areas can result in frame drops, regardless of your setup.\n\n\nBe prepared to spend some money for stash if you plan to play more than just 2-3 heroes as you will need it, it's one of the few things you can't get without spending some money.\n\nEven though it seems like it's a lot of bad points I would still recommend the game, try and look at it as if it was still in "beta" and you won't expect a highly polished game ;)\n\n\nThe developers promise a lot of new content for the coming months, so this game can potentiall go from "good" to "great".\n\n7.8/10","January 18, 2015","true","845.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

This has been the greatest Free to Play experience I have ever happened upon.  Gazillion has consistently made this game better with each and every patch.  The business model is brilliant.  I have spent more on costumes than I would have spent buying this game at a $69.99 price tag, and every time I make a frivilous purchase to make a character I love look cooler I feel good about it.  I want this development team to have more money and continue making a fantastic marvel experience.  Every character feels like it came straight out of a comic or movie and if for some reason it doesn't, just post in their forums about it.  The dev team has this revolutionary new working concept where they listen to what the community wants, and then...they give it to them!  Crazy right?  So if you haven't tried Marvel Heroes recently, you have nothing to lose, you can be a total cheapskate and you still have access to the full game and every character just by playing it, so get in here and get raid ready already.","January 17, 2015","true","780.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","11","21","6","0"

More artifacts![4!]) pets not being just vanity, synergy system (More heroes leveled? more bonuses! more exp!) omega system (level up your account, get bonuses)... With all THAT, the game has a new lease on life, the score has gone from a paltry 58 on metacritic to an 80+ with the new stuff, if you didnt like it before because of the lack of meta-game, since it was essentially a single player Diablo 2 with MMO thrown on, now its an MMO Diablo 2 style, with a ton of content and more coming down the pipeline (Rather quickly too! great devs Gazillion) This game has replaced ALL of my action-RPG's I was playing (Path of Exile is amazing too! just not my cup of tea, and AVOID Diablo III IMO.) Community is hit-or-miss too, you can get really helpful people (Me!) and people who will troll the hell out of you if you deserve it (Also me!) What do you have to lose? its free! and you get 1 free starter hero to get you going (Rocket raccoon is a starter now! He's badass!) so what are you waiting for? Give it a go, its worth it.\nEdit: looking at some negative reviews there is a complaint about the cost of costumes... being that they are the ONLY thing you cant just pick-and-choose to buy with in-game free currency, and being that MOST of their income comes from costumes, this complaint is junk, and also, they have added a recipe in crafting where you take 3 any costumes and grind it into a random costume, and i have gotten costumes worth anywhere from 4$, to 20$ (Grinded TWO enhanced costumes) If you complain about paying for COSMETIC changes in a f2p game, and dont like the pricing point, then dont buy them. deal with looking standard and play the GAME for the GAMEPLAY. Damn stupid steam reviewers sometimes, I swear.\n\n\nOld Pre-2015 patch Review:\ndont let the 58 score bother you, that is because a lot of those reviews are from during the beta still, which should be removed but metacritic is biased (Go look at Diablo III and tell me where the reviews from the big names in gaming news are? mysteriously absent.) this game is great, especially since 2.0 patch with new areas, new heroes, a real loot table (Unique items that ACTUALLY DROP before reaching post-end-game) collectables, bonuses for playing multiple heroes (Extra drops, synergies from other heroes you have leveled). eventually this game has potential to be perfect, with the re-tuning of PVP going on they are really listening to the input from the fans. and it's free, check it out, you won't feel robbed like I did with Diablo III\n\n\nTL;DR: One of the best action-RPG's ever. Plays like Diablo 2 did. Its worth a second look if you were unimpressed at launch, tons of things have changed and most complaints people had with the initial game have been adressed and fixed, there's a ton of new content and new systems in place. not pay2win at all. true free 2 play too, you can earn almost anything with free currencies.","January 20, 2014","true","624.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It was on the Diablo forums I saw someone recommend to Blizzard 'Please make end game content and community events as often and as creative as Gaz does with Marvel Heroes'.  It was that statement that made me go "more events?", it peaked my interest so I figured why not go give it a try again.  Installed it up on Steam, logged into my account, hopped on Wolverine and had a field day.  There was so much stuff that was new, which is the biggest compliment I can give this game, since launch.  I was probably gone from the game for a good 9-10 months I would say.  Once I got going I never looked back.  In fact I haven't logged back on Diablo 3 and played in nearly 3 weeks.\n\nThis game is has so much endgame and does a successful job in making the inbetween (leveling) a lot of fun.  The community events are great, from the addition of a new story chapter, one year anne, cake event, and the tons of free gifts Gaz is giving to their fans right now is unreal.  Great devs, great free to play game that is definitely not Pay to play, and your favorite Marvel heroes (and villains) right there at your finger tips to toy with.  Its literally the best game I play right now and takes up 95% of my gaming time, I can't stop!\n\n***HEADS UP!  If you are on the fence about playing, PLEASE give it a try and I will tell you why.  Right now if you play and get a hero to level 30 you will get TONS, and I mean tons of free gifts from the Developers just for playing during this 1 year anniversary event.  I'm talking XP boosts, a free skin, items, free stash tab, potions, bonus XP & rare item find, and more.  It is literally the nicest thing I've ever experienced in my time gaming from a dev to its players.  The devs listen to feedback and they give back to the community.  Its a fun and rewarding experience, just give it a try! The 1 year anniversary will end on June 28th.***\n\n10/10\n\nRegards,\nOolan","June 19, 2014","true","415.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I should start by saying when this game was first released I thought it was not very good. I played Hawkeye and ran through the game and lost interest very soon after. In all honesty when the game was released they should of said it was in beta, because that's exactly what it felt like.\n\nAs a kid of the 90's I grew up on Diablo and Diablo II. This game is in that same vein just spliced with my other love of the 90's Marvel comics.  You can choose one of a couple free to play characters and run through an okay story written by Marvel Comics own Bendis. It's full of heroes and villians. Theres characters you can straight up buy characters from the store or go the cheap route and play the game and get randomly dropped splinters that unlock characters.\n\nThere is a PVP mode that is in beta and it's not very good.\n\nThere is a grind fest mode called Midtown Madness, which is fun to zone out and just level.\n\nThere is a mode which is a horde mode where you and a group take on multiple waves of bad guys.\n\nThere is loot and a ever expanding world. (As of writing this we just opened up chapter 9 Asguard)\n\nThis game is a lot of fun but I that might just be my inner fanboy talking. I would recommend it to anyone who has a love of super heroes and diablo. If you don't care for either you may want to pass on it.","November 26, 2013","true","853.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Based on the Marvel universe, this free to play release sports some 30 Heroes. All Heroes have Diablo II styled skill trees allowing a variety of customizable options to give the player tactical options within each hero. This is not a simplified game for children but instead a complex hard hitting and high impact action game that stomps on other game of this genre. The gameplay accomidates all playstyles including casual up to extreme aggression. This game being a work of Diablo II devs including Gazzillion CEO David Brevik can be considered the next logical step for the Diablo series and it won't dissapoint hard core Diablo fans.\nFree to play meens: No buying power. Most things can be achieved ingame without purchase. Heroes can be unlocked with ingame currency or with cash allong with costumes which only provide asthetic changes to each hero. Stash tabs are the only thing I've found that you must buy. Priced from around 3.00 for hero tabs to around 5.00 for generaql tabs you will consider putting 10.00 to 20.00 towards inventory.","April 14, 2014","true","040.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The smooth overhead combat combat makes encounters seemless and the action very fluid. Most players will find the crafting system simplified, but integral to the progression of your character. One of the best crafting features is the ability to transform an outgrown epic item into an epic item that another of your characters can use. The thought of 'The Thing' handing used pants down to 'Storm' is hillarious, but quite practical. You can easily switch between your characters anywhere in the world... but don't get any power leveling ideas, it seems there is some limitation based on the level range of party members.\n\nThe major down side is the lack of a secure trading system or auction hall and currency is never directly tradable. Just toss that item on the floor and anyone can pick it up without concequence. The pay to use product service is expensive as always on F2P games.

Whatever you'd like to call them, the genre has seen quite a revival as of late. It has always been there, and always surviving, but in recent years they have certainly gained a bit of popularity with the releases of Torchlight 1 and 2, Diablo 3 and, yes, Path of Exile. Driven by nostalgia of the glory days of Diablo 2, thousands of players flock to these releases, hoping for an addictive and endlessly replayable experience. But most have ignored and dismissed one certain game... and that is, of course, Marvel Heroes.\n\nI will admit that Marvel Heroes is far from perfect, and in many ways can be inferior to some of the other products on the market. However, it can also be said that Marvel Heroes is quite different in many ways as well. Rather than trying to directly compete, Marvel Heroes has carved out its own slice of the hack-n-slash pie.\n\nWhy do I like Marvel Heroes? Why do I play it? I'll give you all my reasons in a simple format.\n\n1) Marvel Heroes has the Marvel IP -- No swords and sorcery. No warriors and monks. No traditional mages and archers for the billionth time. Here we get super heroes. And with super heroes, anything goes: Teleport. Invincibility. Laser beams. Explosions. Robots. Flight. Invisibility. Monsters. Aliens. Modern setting. Dinosaurs. Ninjas.\nBeyond the sheer variety and breath of fresh air, who can deny the fact that playing as a super hero is awesome?\n\n2) Each character is essentially a class --  In other games you create a character based off a certain type of class. In Marvel Heroes, you simply play a character. I'm not going to pretend that they don't have similarities. But even so, each character is still a class of their own. Tired of one? Switch. It's as simple as that. These type of games do get repetitive, but with over 30 characters to choose from, you can always find a new experience.\n\n3) The game is constantly evolving -- They just added pvp. They're constantly changing, tweaking the powers of heroes. A new hero joins the roster every month. They've been adding new mission types, new game modes, they added new equipment, they added Midtown, they've been giving the crafter new recipes. Some heroes may be OP one moment and terrible the next. Yeah, it's often imbalanced with constant buffing and nerfing, but that's due to the ambitious nature of what they're trying to achieve. To some that may sound terrible. But to me, that's exciting... because that means I can look forward to what's in store for the future.\n\n4) It's more of an MMO than most -- In traditional games of this type, most of the game world is instanced. Marvel Heroes does away with this concept by having public areas in addition to smaller instanced areas. This makes it easy to group up with people of your level and do quests. It also means you can experience huge boss fights with tons of crazy powers flying around. Everyone only can see and grab their own loot, so you don't have to worry about butting heads or being begged for an artifact/cosmic that you found.\n\n5) Free to play -- Yeah, not free to get everything you want. Not free to get costumes you want. Not free to have plenty of inventory space to store things. But it's certainly free to play. There's no gameplay gated by a paywall. Play as much as you want. Pay for what you want. The prices are insane. But if you plan on playing for hundreds of hours, why not buy a few things?","November 25, 2013","true","013.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The "feel" of the game definately owes to the Diablo games but this game is so much more than that.  Unlike other superhero mmos out there that expect you to create a nobody hero Marvel Heroes lets you step in to the shoes of great heroes like Hulk, Spiderman, Wolverine, Thor, Ghost Rider, and so many more!   You get to use all of their iconic powers and you can equip different costumes for the heroes to get that perfect look for your hero!  Like Wolverine's X-Force costume the best?  Use it!  Everything in the game, from heroes to costumes, can be gotten in the game for free with a bit of work or use the in-game store for a quick fix to buy your fave hero right now.

It is your standard ARPG with superheroes and like every ARPG they all have there own twists and takes on the genre, but generally you destroy things, pick up loot and develop your character's gear and skills.\n\nGameplay is fast and frantic and combat is smooth as butter, abilitys are extremly reactive and combat itself has so much weight behind it its crazy - camera shakes, massive crit bubbles sound effects of explosions with death and pain being rained down on the unlucky souls who turned up for work at hydra that day. This is easily where it stands out from other ARPGS on the market today and you really feel like your character is a superhero. This can lead to one issue though, difficulty.\n\nI have only completed the first 2 difficulty levels and i hear that the later zones on the last difficulty ramp up a lot more, the boss fights became a bit harder on herioc but apart from Dr Doom and Loki the other boss's i found a tad easy, the fights themselves are fun but they need to incorporate better phasing with bosses to promote more movement in gameplay - You can basicly go to town on a boss till you need to heal up, take a med pack and carry on.\n\nThe good news is there adding a lot more new content this year which is geared towards the issues i just pointed out with both 10 man raiding and Terminal levels designed for high end well geared players that are looking for a very tough challenge.\n\nCurrently the game supports quite a few different gameplay modes all based around collecting things to buy things, you have a animated comic that tells you a story as you play for the content which you recieve character upgrades, respec devices, experience boosts and Eternity splinters. (talk about eternity splinters soon) There are also terminals which give you access to other parts of gameplay. For instance these terminals offer varied boss fights for varied dificultys, you can decide how hard you like to make it.\n\nThen you have Midtown madness and X-defence, Midtown madness is an always open map where you have bosses spawning consistantly with lots and lots to kill and is a great little XP earner. X - defence is a wave based game where you and a party needs to defend the X mansion from large mob and boss packs and with each wave you defeat the difficulty scales up.\n\nThey have recently added PVP terminal to the game but it is still in BETA and i have not tried this out yet. But with Cosmic Terminals and Raids being added on top of there current content list there will be a lot of ways to improve and build your character. I also forgot to mention there adding a Diablo 2 style Rune system as well.\n\nThe Free to play\n\nThe free to play system works well for the games setup, but i would like to warn you to do some research on the character your looking on playing first if you do not want to drop any money down straight away. This is because when you start the game you will have a pre determined list of characters, And you can only choose ONE so make sure that character will suit your playstyle. Remember that ALL other characters in game can be earned in game without any payment.\n\nThe current starter line up is: Luke Cage, Punisher, Captain America, Black Panther, Black Widow, Human Torch, Colossus, Storm and Hawkeye.\n\n''Ok there all cool but i want spiderman or iron man how do i earn them in game?'' - Well the game drops Eternity Splinters and these splinters are used to purchase everything (including Hero's) that can be paid for in the store, there is an exception though and that is Stash space (place to store your items). This works well though because anybody looking to spend 100's of hours in the game with multiple Heroes will probably want to drop a few dollar so gazillion can pay the bills. Any part time players will not need that much room.\n\nA tip for any UK players is to buy the in game currency directly from there web site as it sells it in dollar not pounds\n\nSo far i have dropped 20 pound (35 dollar?) on the game and have 5 Heros unlocked and im working towards my sixth so value for money is very good, but again you dont have to spend anything.\n\nAll in all the game is very solid it has a lot to do and they are reviewing and updating each current hero every month to make them more fun while adding new content and new heroes. They really are pushing the boat out to turn around the terrible initial reviews gathered on metacritic. If you like ARPGS and Marvel or find yourself with no enough time to devote to a full blown MMO seriously play the game its fun, free and you have no obligation if you dont like it!!","January 20, 2014","true","93.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

As a comic book fan, I am a huge fan of the storyline of the game and the allusions to situations that occured in comics books. There is a great manipulation of the stories of the marvel universe here. But that's not where the real meat of the game is. There is a huge amount of challenge and random event content, and the whole game is one big lootsplosion. The microtransactions are... a bit disenheartening. But it is possible to get together enough in-game 'eternity splinters' (random drop) and purchase pretty much everything that costs money in the 'G' (premium in-game currency) store. Characters, partners, pets, quipment, it's all obtainable without using real cash. But not without a time investment. The loot aspect of this game, and the many, many ways to improve your character (and, duh, a name like MARVEL) make this game 100% worthy of playing.

I feel that micro transactions have become more optional but at the same time can improve the level of enjoyment, because of the time it takes to get heroes with Eternity Splinters (the in game way of getting heroes) is really time consuming.

More artifacts![4!]) pets not being just vanity, synergy system (More heroes leveled? more bonuses! more exp!) omega system (level up your account, get bonuses)... With all THAT, the game has a new lease on life, the score has gone from a paltry 58 on metacritic to an 80+ with the new stuff, if you didnt like it before because of the lack of meta-game, since it was essentially a single player Diablo 2 with MMO thrown on, now its an MMO Diablo 2 style, with a ton of content and more coming down the pipeline (Rather quickly too! great devs Gazillion) This game has replaced ALL of my action-RPG's I was playing (Path of Exile is amazing too! just not my cup of tea, and AVOID Diablo III IMO.) Community is hit-or-miss too, you can get really helpful people (Me!) and people who will troll the hell out of you if you deserve it (Also me!) What do you have to lose? its free! and you get 1 free starter hero to get you going (Rocket raccoon is a starter now! He's badass!) so what are you waiting for? Give it a go, its worth it.\nEdit: looking at some negative reviews there is a complaint about the cost of costumes... being that they are the ONLY thing you cant just pick-and-choose to buy with in-game free currency, and being that MOST of their income comes from costumes, this complaint is junk, and also, they have added a recipe in crafting where you take 3 any costumes and grind it into a random costume, and i have gotten costumes worth anywhere from 4$, to 20$ (Grinded TWO enhanced costumes) If you complain about paying for COSMETIC changes in a f2p game, and dont like the pricing point, then dont buy them. deal with looking standard and play the GAME for the GAMEPLAY. Damn stupid steam reviewers sometimes, I swear.\n\n\nOld Pre-2015 patch Review:\ndont let the 58 score bother you, that is because a lot of those reviews are from during the beta still, which should be removed but metacritic is biased (Go look at Diablo III and tell me where the reviews from the big names in gaming news are? mysteriously absent.) this game is great, especially since 2.0 patch with new areas, new heroes, a real loot table (Unique items that ACTUALLY DROP before reaching post-end-game) collectables, bonuses for playing multiple heroes (Extra drops, synergies from other heroes you have leveled). eventually this game has potential to be perfect, with the re-tuning of PVP going on they are really listening to the input from the fans. and it's free, check it out, you won't feel robbed like I did with Diablo III\n\n\nTL;DR: One of the best action-RPG's ever. Plays like Diablo 2 did. Its worth a second look if you were unimpressed at launch, tons of things have changed and most complaints people had with the initial game have been adressed and fixed, there's a ton of new content and new systems in place. not pay2win at all. true free 2 play too, you can earn almost anything with free currencies.","January 20, 2014","true","624.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only problem I have is the constant disconnections. I'm not sure why this keeps happening. I haven't lost any character or item progression but I've had to restart the level I was playing.\n\nAnyway, the implementation of skills is good and it has solid gameplay at the very least. The comicbook style story telling is interesting and keeps things fresh. The best part is, you don't have to pay a dime if you don't want to. There are only cosmetic effects to paying and you might be able to level faster than others if you pay. It's definitely not pay to win, which is my main concern with free to play games these days.\n\nI suggest at least trying it out if you have the connection for it.

This game really tailors to any fan of ARPG and MMO's alike. It has everything you'd want an ARPG to have while retaining MMO qualities with some underqualifying regime but still unbelievably enjoyable. While leveling through the story, if at any time you get bored. you can do instances to quench your thirst for mobs with a boss spawn, go to Xaviers school to fend off waves of enemies, do patrol with infinite spawning mobs, bosses, and events, and almost anything else you could think of that an ARPG or MMO has. The idea of wide scale gamer caitoring is strong with this one. I believe it's the best of it's class due to having such a wide array of content to do. Being still somewhat new, the raid content is somewhat limited, it's still worth the effort to put in and try things out. I just can't wait to see how this game pans out in a few years!\n\nThe best ideas are yet to come with this game. The CEO of Gaz, and the help of Marvel and Disney, this game will stay close to any current and upcoming storylines as in contract per Marvel and Disney. You can only imagine the possibilities with how this game will work out!\n\nYou'd be insane NOT to try this game out. It's free, and you can keep it free. The only thing is that you do have limited space with keeping it free, so don't horde things. I wouldn't bother as most people in game drop gear they don't want or need anyway!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkegbf/recommended/226320/","darkegbf","Kuuhaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkegbf/","240 products in account","Marvel Heroes 2015 is a third person bird's eye view action game where you control one unit with a variety of moves you can use on a hotbar. Think Diablo 3 mechanics. It does set itself apart in ways other than the properties though. For one, it's technically an MMO. There are various hubs like Avengers Tower or Odin's Palace where you'll find plenty of other players above the 4 or 8 person limits of some games of this type.\n\nFor another, loot visuals. These characters that you're playing are well-established Marvel Comics characters like the X-Men or Avengers. They have years of visuals to draw on, but each appearance is its own separate thing. With this in mind, instead of each piece of loot having its own appearance on your character, there's only one slot that affects the visual makeup of your character - the costume slot. You start with the default, but can buy different costumes. So while you might start as standard Mark IV Iron Man, you can buy his Hulkbuster Armor, or Starburst, or Heartbreaker, or any of the movie costumes for a few bucks, and they alter what your character looks like in game. It's really a good move because instead of clownsuited dudes running around, you get set outfits that pay homage to plenty of well and lesser known versions of the character that have shown up in the comics and movies over the years. Did you know Colossus once gained the powers of Juggernaut, and wore the iconic helmet? How about Captain America's stint as Director of SHIELD, complete with a shield made of hard energy instead of metal? There's lots of options for appearance.\n\nThe game is a love letter to each character's past, with every piece of loot from common to unique having a quote on it tailored for the character or item. Comic references abound in this game, they're everywhere - the loot, the voice acting, the enemies, the story. It's all good stuff.\n\nMost importantly though, it plays well. Much better than it did when it originally released. If you're a fan of the comics, give it a try. If you like Diablo-style games give it a try. This one is much faster paced than what you're probably used to. Every single character has at least one decent travel power with no cooldown that can be spammed to traverse the map. Some are faster than others (Nightcrawler can teleport across the entirety of Midtown in a few seconds whereas Wolverine riding a motorcycle might take more like 30 seconds), but they're ALL at least as mobile as the Monk from D3 with Dashing Strike (any of the runes). If you gotta go fast, this game does it. There's a common artifact that gives you teleport, as well.\n\nThere's plenty of interesting content, and there's a lot of challenging content as well. Cosmic difficulty terminals are fun to farm and have some tough enemies to fight. This game even has raiding, which is unique for this genre. Two levels of difficulty, in ten player groups. In addition to a story mode, raids, and cosmic terminals (akin to bounties from D3), there are also two endless wave modes (X-Defense and SHIELD Holo-Sim) and three one-shot stories (think a few dungeons worth of enemies to clear followed by one or two difficult bosses that drop really nice loot). All can be done either solo or with groups, and you can choose to be auto-paired or to go by yourself.\n\nBy this point, there are more than enough characters that everyone who is a fan of the Marvel universe will have one of their favorites available to play. The developer is constantly updating and presenting new content (a new character every month or two is standard), and it's very easy to farm up the in-game currency to buy new heroes with, instead of paying money. A week or two of regular play will probably yield enough currency to buy any but the most expensive tier of heroes. Definitely a great approach to the F2P model, which seems to have been contaminated with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lately.\n\nTLDR: Like Marvel comics/movies? Like Diablo? You'll like it. Try it. Just logging in on the second day gives you enough currency to buy almost any hero for free right off the bat.","February 11, 2015","true","679.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A highly addictive ARPG that anyone a fan of marvel comics will be hooked on\nConstant events and new content keep being added all the time. The devs give alot of gifts to players.\nHas a very fair F2P system that only gives cosmetic and timesavers to people that want to spend alot of money\n\n- Poor performance/optimization in some of the public event zones\n","February 17, 2015","true","696.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its pretty fun. A nice rotation of heroes to play, a decent story, Diablo esque gameplay, and a decent representation of the Marvel brand.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ambrose99/recommended/226320/","Ambrose99","Ocho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ambrose99/","321 products in account","I use to have zero interest in the whole superhero genre. Comics? Meh. Movies? Cheesy. But on a whim, probably because I had seen many people I know giving it a shot, decided to give Marvel Heroes a shot myself. The game is a Diablo-clone that feels like it does Diablo better than Diablo.\n\nMarvel Heroes is instantly fun from the very beginning, where you choose between an array of iconic characters and start beating on the bad guys. Since the game is free-to-play, there is a reliance on the cash shop, but the meat of the game, the heroes, are very easily obtained just through gameplay and logging in. The only items that I have really felt compelled to purchase through the shop is just more inventory space, and I only needed more inventory space as I'm finding it more and more fun to level up a bunch of different characters. All other items in the game are easily attainable through play or through one of the never-ending series of events.\n\nAnd now? I'm almost caught up on watching all the superhero movies that Marvel has come out with, can't wait to watch the next episode of Daredevil in my Netflix queue, and I can't wait to see more of the movies as they come out. I still don't know about the comics yet, but I'm definitely much more of a superhero fan than I was, and I have to thank Marvel Heroes for that.","April 20, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the continuing addition of characters to the already impressive roster, as well as the ongoing development to the gameplay itself, both which break the tedium of post regulation gaming. A casual gamer wont get the full experience as creating a powerful roster takes a lot of play time, but it's also a game that's easy to pick back up after a few months away. It's a free game, so you might as well try it.","June 4, 2015","true","244.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still haven't felt much need to spend more than $5-10 so very reasonable design.  Plays like Diablo 2, which is a good thing and definitely feels like you are playing a hero in a comic...very happy with the game so far.  Also multiple mechanisms for obtaining most of the purchaseables, costumes, hero's etc. with in game currency.  Wish there was a mail system or some sort of AH for some of the items.","December 30, 2014","true","744.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
