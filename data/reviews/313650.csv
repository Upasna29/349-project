It's not uncommon to have to click on a object 2-3 times to get the game to recognize that you've found something, which is pretty much a no-no when you're dealing with achievements awarded for minimal clicking.  The design of the story can also be prety frustrating here, and it's not intuitive compared to a lot of their other games.  Also, the achievements are a little lacking compared to A.M.'s other games... there's no tier of achievements tied in to the mini-game that substitutes for the hidden object scenes.  Perhaps most egregious of all though, is the fact that several of the objects in pictures are literally hidden COMPLETELY behind other objects.  No recognizable piece of the object sticking out, literally the ENTIRE object is obscured by something in front of it.  Which means in several of the hidden object scenes, you're going to end up just randomly clickling around hoping to find the object behind other objects.  If you want a great hidden object game, check out Enigmatis 2, Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart, or Abyss: Wraiths of Eden.  All three of those games are much better in their design.  Even Clockwork Tales, a smaller effort, feels of a piece with those three, and the sequel to Nightmares From the Deep, while not as good as the first, is certainly worth playing.  Time Mysteries 2 feels like it was designed by different people, from the cut scenes, to the structure of the gameplay, to the hidden object scenes themselves.  It's a bit frustrating when played after the standards set by those other games.","August 2, 2014","false","8.0"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","53","62","0","0"

The hidden object scenes are nicely drawn, but it's often hard to find the objects because they're quite well hidden and undistinguishable from the others. Most scenes come with a color palette containing many shades of gold, orange or brown, and these can be incredibly difficult to complete. Nevertheless, there is a hint button that recharges almost instantly, in case you get stuck.\n\nThe novelty that this game brings is the travel device that allows you to travel to important moments in your family’s past, and the actions you do will alter the future scenes. The device also serves as an incredibly helpful map - you have different symbols for the rooms you need to visit (those that have incomplete actions), for the unexplored rooms and for the scenes that change due to actions in the past. It also serves as a fast-travel device, even within the same time.\n\nI found the game very enjoyable and interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it to people that are beginners in this genre because the difficulty of the hidden object scenes will probably set them back.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","August 3, 2014","true","9.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","1"

There's just something about them that's like a drug that won't let you go. After seven hours with this game, I'm almost inclined to go cold turkey.\n\nThis is the first hidden object game where I've ended up dreading going into new puzzles. Mouse clicks don't always register on legitimate items, and in a few cases objects are ambiguous-- there may actually be two of an item on screen, but only one will satisfy the game. Almost as frustrating, the game recycles hidden object scenes to an absurd degree, going back to the same well over and over again. That backtracking is really the meat, rather the gristle, of the game. It makes sense within the context of the time travel angle, and the puzzles that emerge from that, but you're visiting the same rooms and performing the same puzzles over and over again, and that wears itself out very quickly.\n\nThe rare one-shot puzzles aren't necessarily much better. Most follow a logic that is easy to work out. Others are simply baffling, accompanied by an unhelpful, cryptic comment by the protagonist if you click outside the playfield. The follow-up adventure is particularly bad for this; I'm not sure that one of them even works properly.\n\nI get the feeling that this is one of Artifex Mundi's early efforts, because I've played a couple of their other titles and they seemed much more polished and enjoyable. I'm disappointed, because the gimmick of a family of time travelers is intriguing, and the time traveling mechanism is elegant, but the game felt like it was padded for length.","October 13, 2014","false","16.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileyfax/recommended/313650/","smileyfax","Smileyfax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileyfax/","1074 products in account","This game is a poor showing from the normally superb efforts of Artifex Mundi. The stand-out worst part of this game was the puzzles. The vast majority were hidden object scenes, with only a small handful of other puzzle types sprinkled throughout. Most scenes were visited two or three times apiece during the game, leading to extreme repetition and monotony. This is compounded if you choose to play on Expert mode, which I always do in these kinds of games, as you're forced to make a circuit of every room you've been to periodically to see which hidden object zone's gone active after you've advanced the plot.\n\nThe Hint button is often no help on Expert mode, as it'll usually point straight to the time machine -- I'm guessing since the Hint button works on shortest path possible, and the time machine is essentially a fast-travel device -- and on Expert mode there's no indication of which room or even which year you're supposed to be investigating. (I made it probably a third of the way through the game before I just started mashing the Hint button to find the next hotspot, and straight-up turned off Expert mode about halfway through).\n\nAt one point, I even experienced a glitch, or perhaps oversight, in one of the hidden object scenes. The first time through, I had to open up a box in order to get the object inside. On my third visit to the scene, one of the objects remained elusive, until finally I gave up and pushed the Hint button, finally revealing the object to have been completely obscured by the open lid of the box (which I had no way of closing).\n\nThe story is somwhat enjoyable, at least -- untangling the web of what happened with all the time travel rigmarole was one of the bright points of playing through the game. Even this was not without flaws, though, as the game ended abruptly on a cliffhanger, with no hint that the ending was that nigh.\n\nI wouldn't be so overly critical of this game, but I normally play HOGs with my girlfriend, and while normally we have a good, fun time with them, this game provided nothing but frustration and seriously put the damper on an otherwise romantic evening.\n\nI'm afraid I cannot recommend this game, unless your craving for hidden object games overrides all other senses, or you can get it on the cheap somewhere.","February 25, 2015","false","15.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

Reason for that is because pacing is just right in this game. As soon as the map becomes available early on the game moves on like it's on rails. Sometimes you have a large list of objectives to fulfill and sometimes it slows down and forces you to calm down and catch up on your bearings/read some journal entries - but you are never completely stuck.\n\nHandy map shows where there are actions to do - a very essential tool since the map is also a time machine and you are constantly jumping from one time point to another while still staying in the same areas.  Without it the game would be quite frustrating as 'green cloud' object puzzles appear in different time points and places most of the time without any logical reason so locating them on the map is essential.\n\nI did not complete the most demanding achievements but i must say i was tempted to really play the game cleanly and not use any hints or random clicks as the puzzles were very challenging.\n\nAll in all money and time well spent with this title. Perfect for quick 15min+ game sessions where you must also stress your brain a bit. Some puzzles are plain devilish in the way it hides item in the picture.","February 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Some riddles are bugged, or so destructively constructed that you won't find a solution after you started to dabble with the riddle. I would prefer a reset button for the riddles, because once a mistake is done you can only use hint (which also isn't always helpful). The HOS are sometimes unfair, because you can't exactly make out what is what (in one picture it was incense that wasn't found, in another a butterfly, and then there were other things so well hidden - that you can't find them without a hint).\n\nPro:Good graphics, sound and Bonus Content.Con:Unfair riddles because there is no reseting them - some of them are unsolvable after dabbling with them!HOS are overloaded and sometimes too dark to see them clearly.\nConditionally Recommended\nBecause of the sometimes unfair riddles that can't be set back to start (and thus can't be solved after playing around with them). In my oppinion the game has earned more a no then a yes, this is why I said no... others might have not such a bad start with the game at all...

Both with story, artwork, game play and voice acting. While the game leaves some questions unanswered from the first one, it adds more depth to the Ambrose mythos.\n\nYou play Esther, an orphan who suddenly finds out she's a member of the Ambrose family and is sucked into the time traveling adventures. Through her you learn how far reaching the Ambrose family is as well as about the great Merlin and Viviana who started the family line.\n\nThe biggest improvement to the game is how you time travel. No more rings and Time Museums, instead you have a portable device that you add time crystals too, a different one for the year and place you wish to travel to making life super easy. As such, what you do in the past can alter the future of a certain location. You can plant a sapling in the past, then go say 100 years into the future and there it is as a fully grown tree.\n\nAs you time travel you'll be solving puzzles and playing hidden item scenes which are all filled with beautiful artwork and a challenge. There is no room for boredom in this game, especially if you're after the achievements which aren't hard to acquire. The game also comes with trading cards if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThis game left me so eager to continue the story I started part three the same day I finished this game.

(Sadly the only good thing of Inheritance, the hint system, was also removed.)\nAlthough it’s hardly an important point, since Ancient Spectres is not really keen on plot: you wander around in two buildings in three time periods trying to stop the clichéd evil entity from escaping its prison, and that’s about it.\n\nThe shortcoming of the story is compensated by a difficult, but not overcomplicated puzzle system, including a well-balanced hidden object skipping minigame: it’s easy, but slow.

Even though it's an Artifex Mundi game it has a lot of issues. First issue is the story, and how it's told; it would have required a lot more work as it feels really unpolished. They seem to have concentrated all their efforts for the bonus adventure, leaving the main game in a rough confusing state. The second issue is the voices, they're not really well done and have some errors (wrong voice assigned etc); it's not a big issue but it adds to the unfinished game feeling.\n\nHowever the biggest issue is the display: if you have a wide screen monitor you will be stuck with a stretched display and there's no work around, making all game's graphics distorted and blurry, turning all the hidden objects scenes into a nightmare. And fiddling with the monitor display and the desktop setting won't help. So unless you have a 4/3 monitor, forget this game.\nIf you don't have a wide screen monitor, you should still wait for a nice discount, the game isn't worth it at full price.","November 13, 2014","false","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The whole game's plot could be summed up in three sentences.\nThere is no atmosphere or mood to talk about the game.  It's so much "goal-based" that everything else is irrelevant. You need to get some runes to reach your goals? Then from now every single thing will serve the goal to get runes, and nothing else will happen. I mean, in other games usually there are shorter goals, then some info/happening, and story takes a turn. Not in this case.\nAnd the main reason I can't recommend this:\nReally, really underwhelming if you take consideration that this is an Artifex Mundi game.  Go and get Nightmares from the Deep 1-2, Grim Tales, Abyss, 9 Clues, Dark Arcana, Enigmatis 1-2.

There's way, way too many hidden object scenes this time around. A decent number of unique scenes and you visit each one two or three times. It gets overwhelming and tedious. I thought the minigames here were pretty decent though. The time travel framing device is pretty interesting too though it's not taken advantage of too often. And there's a lot of stuff that really shouldn't be in an 1830 time setting, even with time travel. Addressing the main problem of this game is futile, though, as everything wrong with this game has been fixed by the most recent Artifex Mundi games I've played (and there are plenty I haven't played, too).","March 1, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also the mini-games that you can escape to are boring, but that's not so bad either.\n\nNot so cool that you can't save your game, then go back and correct something or do it better; the game saves its own progression and puts you back where you were everytime you log back in.\n\nWhat unleashed my fury:\nI finished the game and started the bonus adventure, called "Save Esther". I was in the doing a puzzle and decided to close the game to continue later. When I wanted to come back to the game, my profile disappeared, so all my progress (meaning, the entire game) was completely gone.

Most of the time, the rest is fun too though. Here not so much.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are a bit too difficult for my taste. Some things are really hard to find. The sparkling thing that helps find some objects is always in the same spot for HO where you don't combine things. (Edge of inventory, pointing at leaving the scene.) In scenes where you combine things, it stays stuck on an already solved part of the combination.\n\nThe alternate to the HO games is great though. A different kind of matched-blocks-disappear game. That adds a lot of replay value for me. Too bad it doesn't count for the achievements for hidden objects, so I have to play them anyway if I want that.\n\nThe story... At the start, in the mansion, it somehow didn't feel like a whole place, but more like disconnected, unrelated rooms. The immersion I am used to from other games, including other Artifex Mundi titles, was missing. Maybe it was the setup for the story. Too little reason to go there, nothing urgent.\n\nThe jump-to-room-and-time function is great to save manually walking around, while I had it, anyway, but here it increased the above mentioned feeling. Without any real goal/coherence, I ended up just ticking off of exclamation marks from the device. Maybe that it didn't show where I was added to the feeling of being detached from the whole story.\n\nThe puzzles (mini games) could use an explanation on what to do. I had to find a guide for the disks and knobs thing because there was no indication of what to do with the discs. Same for some puzzles in the bonus chapter.\n\nSo, with all that, the only part I can recommend it for is the alternative to the Hidden Object games, for those who like those types of games.\n\nEdit: It seems the alternative is not available via extras, so I'd have to play the story through again to get to those games. Boo.","June 3, 2015","false","27.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/recommended/313650/","Kailen","Kailen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kailen/","1108 products in account","I want to recommend this game.  I really do.  The story is more interesting than the previous game, the mechanics are far better, and it doesn't use "smudge graphics" for the animation.  The animation is still terrible at parts, but this game is miles improved over the previous.  In fact, if you enjoy these casual hidden-object games, particularly by this developer, this one can be quite entertaining.\n\nHowever, it's the bugs that prevent me from recommending it.  In particular, one very large, progression halting glitch.  There is one puzzle that you can activate part of early, before you've set the rest of the pieces down.  If you do this, and then set the pieces before resetting it, the puzzle is rendered unsolvable.  The only way to advance is to skip the puzzle, thus denying you the chance to earn the achievement for completing it without skips or hints.  Other than that, since the game automatically saves progress, you have to restart.  Fortunately the puzzle is fairly early in, but that is a major flaw that I cannot give a recommendation to any game possession of.  Progression stoppers are major bugs that need to be tested before release.  This one clearly wasn't.  (And, three and a half years after it came out, it seems the devs are only hearing about it now.  I will give them credit in that they did promptly respond to be when I brought it up, but whether or not they manage to fix it has yet to be seen.)\n\nThere are other bugs as well.  Most of them minor.  The next major one, not as severe as the previous, involves one of the hidden object puzzles.  There is a portion where you have to move something in order to find parts behind it.  However, once this is done, you cannot move it back.  Yet later on you can get items that are behind where the item was moved to.  Thus making some items 100% invisible and requiring random clicking.  That's bad.  Other bugs include some things being mislabeled ('file' instead of 'saw', 'tusk' for 'tooth/fang' when there is an actual tusk in the scene, and the like), and some portions where there should be dialog, but no audio for it.\n\nThere's some other flaws, such as obtaining an item, using it, then throwing it away... and later having to obtain the same item again.  The developers also absolutely love "all metals must be melted by acid", and even if you have tools in your inventory specifically designed to cut metal, you must wait until you obtain the acid.  This has been seen in several other games of theirs.  It's flaws like that that show that, ultimately, there is a lack of concern for the quality of the game.  The developers simply want to slap together the bare minimum of effort and get the next game out.\n\nAll that said, in the end this game is actually pretty good for the genre.  Some interesting, if frustratingly vague, puzzles.  The hidden objects are mostly well done, aside from the occasional confusion, and multiple objects that could qualify for the same terms.  The story is interesting, and the time mechanic is very well done.  Though, expect a whole lot of traveling back and forth to the same areas time and time again.  This is a "Collector's Edition" of the game, which includes a bonus story (which wasn't bad, but not great), and the option to replay many of the puzzles, and the hidden object areas again.  On top of that, all of the achievements can be done in a single play-through (something some of their other games were lacking).\n\nIf they can fix the game-breaking bug, I may change my recommendation.  But even then it would be a soft 'yes'.  If you like these games, and can avoid hitting that bug, and can live with the others, than sure.  Pick this game up - cheap.  It's certainly not worth full price.","May 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Cannot stress enough how great the graphics are and how beautiful the scenery is in nearly every scene. Play it, it's so interesting!","May 18","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
