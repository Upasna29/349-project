"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattnovosad/recommended/34030/","mattnovosad","IlluminatiRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattnovosad/","726 products in account","Having purchased this game in the glorious year of 2010, it marked my true entry into the world of PC Gaming. And for that, I thank Napoleon: Total War.\n\nIt was early in 2010, and a friend of mine had brought a Game Informer Magazine into school one day, we were in 8th Grade at the time. I was flipping through it in our Computer Class, when I noticed "Napoleon: Total War" in there. I had never heard of Total War before, but I sure knew I wanted it as I was in a bit of a Napoleon craze at the time. Of course, my teacher noticed me not paying attention on how to type with the home row keys (77 WPM without it, suck on that Home Row!) and took the magazine away from me. I swore on that moment to buy Napoleon: Total War, and to play the living hell out of it.\n\nAnd I did. I bought it on Friday, August 27th. The day I joined Steam. Got home from Target with my brand new copy of N:TW and a twinkle in my eye. "What the hell is this Steam stuff?". So I spent the night getting Steam set up. Then came the instiliation. It wanted to download it, but I was getting roughly 30KB/S at the time, and that would take a long, long time. So I went to sleep frustrated. The next day I learned how to install with the disks. A useful tip. Then came the patches.\n\nMost of Saturday, and for the morning of Sunday I waited for the patches to finish installing. They finally did. I hopped into the computer chair with glee, the moment had finally arrived. *Click* and I hit the "Play" button on Steam for the very first time.\n\nI still remember that music in the intro, and the intro itself "My enemies are many, my equals are none". The main menu appeared before my eyes, was I really playing this? I hit custom battle - I don't remember my army composition but I was just escatic I finally got to play it. I only got to play that battle though, I had to go to my youngest brother's Football game. For the rest of my Freshman year, it was nearly all I played. Day in, and day out I was commanding armies. I didn't even have an exceptional computer. It was still like a dream come true for me.\n\nThat my friends, is just the beginning.\n\nNapoleon: Total War is the 6th main entry in the Total War series of Turn Based Strategy and Real Time Tactics game. It takes us back to a simpler time, when the French were ruled by an Emperorer. Having the experience of the failures of Empire: Total War under thier belt, CA was able to fix many of the issues that plagued Empire. It feels much more coherent and fluid. It's a better game, with the exception of the scope to some.\n\nThe map, unlike Empire: Total War, is limited to Europe for the Coloalition Campaigns, and a few smaller maps for Napoleon's Campaigns. For some, this loss of scale is a detriment. To me, it's a plus. The campaigns feel tighter and more worthwhile, and less daunting.\n\nThe game's score is wonderful, and takes you back to the time period. With memorable pieces, you'll be sure to remember some of these tunes for time to come. It is truly a highpoint for the score of Total War.\n\nThe units are well done, and represent the uniforms of the period accurately and beautifully, The graphics, especially for 2010 are great, and have a nice feel to them.\n\nThe game is also extrememly moddable, and there are many mods for many tastes. From small mini mods, to large overhauls like The Great War mod, you'll never be bored with the game.\n\nOverall, I give Napoleon: Total War a 10/10. It truly introduced me to the world of PC gaming, and is a real highlight in the Total War Catalouge. It is by far my favorite Total War game, and one of my favorite games that I have played.","March 27, 2014","true","156.2"," 159 of 171 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","159","171","0","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/recommended/34030/","Smiledozer","*IC* Smiledozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/","484 products in account","The Total War series has always experienced pressure to create historically correct games. It is all too often difficult to create a turn-based grand strategy game that is on point with history. This is because the game must inevitably deviate from the historical timeline at some point in order to appease players' wishes for open-ended gameplay. That is, make that nation their own through conquest.\n\nWell, Creative Assembly managed to hit the nail dead on with Napoleon: Total War. With Napoleon, there's great gameplay without sacrificing much of the beautiful graphic work or experience. You also get historical content mixed into your play. What I mean by this, Is that you will be required (or asked) to follow in the footsteps of the nation you choose to play as. Also, just as in Empire you will find snippets of Inventions or famous happenings from that time.\n\nGameplayThe battles are the best part about this game hands down. Playing single battles, online matches, or just enjoying the battles of the campaigns is what this game is about to me. Napoleon brings some of the most realistic combat to the battle maps. The guns and artillery effects will blast you away (pun intended) and you'll immedietaly notice the change in the beauty and accuracy of the battle maps.\n\nIntroduction of New Systems to Total WarNapoleon was the first game in the TW series to add the Attrition system, where your armies will take slow damage from extreme weather. It is simply a realistic thing as opposed to being able to march your army over the Alps in the dead of Winter and suffer no losses. Attrition is now seen in all Total War titles.\nThe technology tree for this game is also more simplified than Empire's and the diplomatic features are more interesting. If it is one thing that I know gamers like to see out of a grand-strategy game, it's diplomatic options. The choice of "Liberating" a country and ruling over it, the choice to threaten your enemy and make them concede defeat, or the many, many others that Empire and other TW games are lacking in. The newest TW games include great diplomatic systems, but it wouldn't have happened without Napoleon: Total War.\n\nDLCThe DLC options that are available for this game are  pretty decent. The DLC campaign is The Peninsular Campaign, an add-on featuring a British campaign against the French in the Iberian Peninsula. Playable factions include Britain, France, and Spain. There is also a great extra 'Propoghanda' element to this game, where you can win over populaces of territories simply with your nations' influence.\nThere are also three Special Unit packs which are all great to improve on your existing armies. The Coalition Battle pack, Imperial Eagle pack, and Heroes of the Napoleonic Wars pack.\n\nPros:\n- Historically accurate objectives, troop units, ship, maps, and battles.\n- Inclusion of Napoleon's Italian and Egyptian campaigns and most famous battles. These are great plays.\n- Graphically breathtaking\n- The best and most realistic gun/artillery work that I've seen in a Total War game (More realistic than even Fall of the Samurai)\n- Introduces Attrition, new Diplomatic features, and new military management mechanics (i.e., auto-refresh troops, 'wounded' Important General such as Napoleon or Blucher, etc.)\n- Educational\n\nCons:\n- The AI, as in most of the Total War games, is a bit lacking. However, it's still a major improvement from Empire's AI.\n- Vanilla game only allows you to play as Austria, Prussia, Russia, England, or France. With modding you can play about a dozen other small nations.\n- The scale of the theatre covers Europe and the mid-Mediterranean, but still feels a bit cramped. Also, the edges of the ocean are treated as Trade Posts to other areas of the world.\n- Regional Online Play (as with many of the Total War games)\n\nVerdict?\n\n8/10\n\nI can't not recommend this game. It is a pillar in the Total War series, whether you love it or hate it. Napoleon satisfies a battle-map junkie's dream while also giving the player a rewarding experience in the campaign theatre. While the game tends to be historically correct and a great learning experience as well, it almost forces your nation in the footsteps of that country with objectives. You don't have to perform these objectives, but you are rewarded greatly for doing them. The battles are the best experience in Napoleon, hands down. The gun and artillery mechanics are finally done justice and the battlefield in general just has a more realistic feel to it than Empire or previous games. The feature 'Napoleon's Campaigns' also gives you access playing the Italian, Egyptian, and European campaigns which are incredible fun.\n\nAll around I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the Total War series. If not simply for the realism of the battles and the fantastic graphics/effects. The features of this game are pretty great and represent to me a game-changer in the Total War series.","June 3, 2015","true","704.1"," 121 of 127 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","121","127","11","5"

Bradley","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030849172/","285 products in account","Napoleon: Total War is easily the most divisive of all Total War games. Some folks love it, some folks hate it. It is, to be fair, an almost carbon copy of Empire at first glance. The most noticeable difference is that Napoleon concentrates exclusively on Europe whereas Empire allows the player to conquer the globe.\n\nBeyond first blush, Napoleon does feature some improvements over Empire that make it worth consideration. Chief of those is better coding - Napoleon is accepted by most to be a much more stable and better running game than Empire. It is also better looking. AI is supposedly markedly better, however that is debatable. There are a number of mods available that greatly improve the Napoleonic experience - but you're fine running the stock game.\n\nIf Empire and Napoleon look too similar to you - if muskets and dragoons are all the same to you, you may prefer Empire over Napoleon due to the globe. But... If, like me, you have a fascination with the Napoleonic Wars, you owe it to yourself to give Napoleon: Total War - beyond dominating Europe, there is also a series of historical battles and campaigns that are very enjoyable.","July 23, 2013","true","290.1"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","76","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007213063/recommended/34030/","76561198007213063","kathan_tl","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007213063/","56 products in account","The early vanilla version of this game was pretty good, but limited in many ways: a very predictable AI opponent, limited number of playable factions, minimal battlefield music and sounds, relatively small field 'armies' (max 20 units, usually with a few thousand men total); this is barely a brigade in the actual Napoleonic Wars. Yes, the initial version of this game showed a game with a solid foundation, but unrealized potential for such a fascinating period in history; full of pagentry and spectical, when hundreds of thousands of men clashed on huge battlefields dressed in colorful uniforms with gloriously ornate flags, batteries of thundering cannon and thousands upon thousands of clattering muskets. The designers missed an opportunity to really do something great. Then they failed to developed the uniform editor they had promised for the game and that didn't help. They just didn't seem to want to go the extra mile. I liked the game but was a little dissapointed, even with the DLC they added later.\n\nThen I discovered a mod for this game called 'DARTHMOD NAPOLEON v2.6 Epic Edition' and quickly realized this game's potential. Darth Vader (the mod's author), teamed up with a group of similarly talented modders and buffed this game up into something special. They vastly improved the battle sounds, music, unit flag details, battle smoke, etc. They added so much detail that it was like a new game altogether. You can also play the game now as almost any nation state of the Napoleonic Age, which enhances replayability enormously. Want to try building an empire with Ireland, do it. Like to try conquering Europe with little Portugal or the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), sure. It's harder with these small factions, but it can be done; and with a smaller faction it's a real challenge. This mod also allows 40 unit max armies and 30 unit max fleets for many of the major nations, making for huge battles on land and at sea, and the units can have as many as 500 men in them; so a land army with this mod can often contain 12,000 to 15,000 men. On the new scale, with all the aforementioned visual and audial improvements, the battles become like interactive movies; they are a joy to simply watch, let alone get actively involved in. One warning though: you will be very busy trying to control such a large army. After a big battle you will likely feel a bit worn out, and you will be wearing out the pause button during the battles, both for your army's survival and a means of taking a break from the action just to appreciate the amazing beauty of whats going on before your eyes. It's really quite astounding. You pan in and hear men muttering in the ranks, horses neighing, orders being given in the units and so on. The sea battles are just a spectacular and just as labor intensive (but worth it).\n\nYes, even with DARTHMOD NAPOLEON, the AI could be better, but the rock-paper-scisors tactics of Napoleonic warfare are alive and well. Charge a well formed infantry square with cavalry, bad idea. Let your infantry stay in line when cavalry charges, bad idea. Form infantry square within range of artillery (especially cannister), bad idea. Leave your cannon batteries without infantry or cavalry support to protect them, especially from enemy cavalry, bad idea, and so on... The one main problem I have with game play is the morale model, especially for the French and for cavalry units in particular. I often see units almost die to the last man that should have long ago fled the field. A batallion of 360 men with 20 or 30 left should be long gone, and certainly should not have 'steady' morale. Still, I can overlook this issue and the others that are less severe, because they are so greatly outweighed by the good points of the game.\n\nI have come back to this game over and over for the last few years (8,000 hours plus listed but probably about 1,200 to 1,500 or so actual, when you exclude the time the game was in the Strategy Map planning mode or paused in tactical mode). There is really no other game like it for the Napoleonic era, and the entertainment value and unbelievable replayability (with Darthmod installed) are amazing.\n\nIf you like Napoleonic Wargames with spectacular, realistic battles, rolling drums, booming cannon, thundering cavalry charges, shattering musketry, beautiful, fluttering flags and a smoke enshrouded battlefield, you'll love this game.","June 23, 2015","true","619.1"," 78 of 85 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","78","85","4","9"

From a 60-man Jaeger squad up to 200 men in your division. I would greatly recommend although you have to be a certain kind of person to like this. If you are nót that kind of person, don't buy it. You probably won't enjoy it. I have a little bit over 120 hours into this and it still hasn't become boring. The campaigns offer really versatile land- and sea warfare at tons of different locations with different strategical set-ups for every single one of them. You're in the hills? Bring infantry. You're in a flat area? Bring artillery, lots of it.

I'm not talking about the Multiplayer Campaign alone, but about things like the craters in batllefield, improved AI behavior in battle (slightly better as at Empire), more provinces as for example "Meckelnburg" north of Prussia or "Oldenburg" north of the Netherlands or "Hessen-Kassel" ... as well splitting France and Spain into more provinces. People asking why this was not done in Empire too get the correct answer that the game machine has problems to handle more provinces and factions as given ... and that's for example the reason why in North America is huge area with no province Between the East and the Plain Indians. Here in Napoleon the focus is only on Europe and so the map could be splitted into these further provinces and factions.\nAlso, other things like the Arsenals were in origin planned to give with Emipre too as well things which were introduced / changed by the Darth Mod in Empire were here at Napoleon given by Creative Assembly.\n\nThe game makes fun, no doubts ... as well it is again much improved by playing with Darth Mod. It is always interesting that the Greek modder Darth Vader and his team are no wizards here, but as still done at Empire, they change and improve existing things in the game "only" ... something what developers of Creative Assembly had to do by their own with proper testing in my opinion.\nThe historic battles and the way of Napoleon with Italian and Egypt campain are a good thing and well done as small level campain feature.\nOne change in the game done at battles is the sort of infantry fire with no fire by ranks etc. Take a closer look and scroll down in a battle to a unit and count who is only fires and make comparison to Empire. Another change is the splitting into 2 types of howitzers with different ammuniution, which I can't really understand why done with historic view on it, but also with gamers view.\n\nConclusion:\nIn general Napoleon is an improved Empire on Europe map only, officially justified by Creative Assembly that this war was on land only in Europe. This is histocally true, but the map of the main campaign should be something bigger by including the same area as Europe in Empire ... means complete Turkey, Palestine / Jordan / Syria, North Africa and in the west the sea area up (and including) Iceland ... as well complete Scandinavia. Pure by number of provinces and factions it ia fact that the game machine could handle without problems and so it is for me not understand able why Creative Assembly did not include.\n\nThe game itself wasn't so bugged as Empire at release and worked very good.\nOne point I can't forgive is some type of lie done by Creative Assembly here:\nAs part of the promotion of the game and clearly written in promotion text it was told that "modding tools" will be given. Sure, most players are casuals and so lesser interested in modding a game, no doubts, but when a company tells it in promotion to give, then it is to rate as promise. People who asked them after release when these "modding tools" will come and what they are able to change in game was not told much and if any official answer came it was only a short consoling. Some month later, the promotion text was over night changed and the part with the "modding tools" wassimply deleted without any comment or reaction when people like me asked them about it. Result: Which modding tools should be given can people ask now and CA could answer we never told! Fortunatelly I have a screenshot of the original text and even if these tools are not much worth in practice, this behavior of CA is not acceptable!","December 29, 2013","true","065.8"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","63","72","0","2"

Average optimalization or many identical looking units for each country (i.e. line infantry) gave you that feeling that it could be done better. Fortunatelly, year after the release of Empire, Napoleon: Total War came out.\n\nWhat does it offer?\n- a lot of great looking units (including a lot of exclusives, of course);\n- several well made campaigns presenting Napoleon's career in Italy, Egypt and in whole Europe; one campaign that allows you to play as one of the strongest countries among anti-French coalition: Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia;\n- a lot of historical provinces (with some errors like Warsaw as the capital city of the province of Great Poland, while the real capital of it is Poznań);\n- a lot of nations that can be freed or can free themselves;\n- more options after conquering a province (you can choose for example if you want to annex it or create a puppet if there is possibility)\n- breathtaking naval battles;\n- being Napoleon in one of his historical battles (i.e. Austerlitz, Borodino) including battle of Waterloo, which can be made historical (playing as Great Britain) or ahistorical, trying to win this battle by playing as France.\n\nThis game also allows you to play a multiplayer campaign with other players, Nice thing, especially when you can try to play as for example Ottoman Empire and try to beat your mate who is playing as France. Normal multiplayer battles allow you to play 2vs2, 3vs3 or 4vs4 games with a lot of maps: from classic grassy one to those that need good maneuvers to win. Some people who leave the game might be annoying, especially when it's ranked and you're winning, but in general it's a lot of fun.\n\nSummarizing, Napoleon: Total War is a very good game that has got the things that weren't in Empire and adds some other improvements. If you like Total War series and Napoleonic age, then you're definitely going to love it! :))","September 29, 2014","true","119.4"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","55","65","3","0"

Had read a guide telling me to capture local city-states ASAP to get more territory quick. Do so, accidentally cause war with Denmark and Sweden. Austria hates me, all city states are wary. 99/10 Would f*** up again.\nBut on a serious note, this game is extremely fun. The campaign map is smaller than that of Empire TW, but still good. Just be prepared for Britain to sit on its ♥♥♥ the whole time and not help out with the Frenchies. (Should you decide to be an enemy of ol' Franzmann)\nThe mods for this game, although not as diverse as some other games, are still awesome. My two favorites are the Great War Mod, and Darthmod Napoleon. The GW Mod does exactly what it sounds. Converts the whole thing to WWI. My front line never moved, though my tanks won entire battles on their own, with no help from the rest of the army.\nDarthmod makes it pretty, lots of smoke, explosions, and morale-y stuff. Also giant unit sizes. 320 man grenadier units, 500 man Landwehr units, more swiss troops, an impossibly large number of French units... like Westphalian Fusiliers (whoopdeedoo)\nAnyway. Enough of my ranting. JUST GET THIS GAME.\nGraphics are pretty good, just put the settings up, Also some dialogue is rather entertaining.

If you are interested in multiplayer, I would rather recommend Empire as the game is more balanced. Napoleon suffers from balance issues online. Everyone tends to always either play England or France as they're the strongest nations, and there aren't a diversity of playing styles like there are in Empire. I also find players tend to play quite dishonorably by camping, spamming artillery, unicorns, or other cowardly tactics.\n\nFor campaign: I found Napoleon to be very fun, although slower and a bit more challenging than Empire. What I missed was the  epic grandness that was in empire, however fighting in regions as opposed to countries made much more since. I didn't like how I could easily march a stack into Paris and completely take down France in ETW.  The Campaign AI is also much more sensible, and you have more diplomatic options like Joining Wars, creating Trade Embargos, and Cancelling Alliances.\n\nThe battle AI is still terrible. A half-decent player will mow through battles to the point that fighting battles will get tiresome, but necesarry if you don't want to get screwed by the auto-resolve. I must admit after 3 hours, fighting armies gets downright annoying.\n\nStill, it's an enjoyable game worth getting. However, Empire lasted much much longer in terms of replayability, grandness, and online fun. Napoleon's online experience is extremely disappointing.\n\nUpdate: Still tons of bad players in this game. If there were a better community you might see me playing more often, but every game is hosted by a coward trying to tip the rules in their favor, camping in spawn/deployment with artillery, putting weather that disadvatages one army over another, just lame ♥♥♥♥. I've only had a handful of enjoyable online MP games in napoleon. It's still terribly unbalanced with a terribly poor community. So many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players. Most of them have memorized the maps and how to exploit them, for instance, playing ottoman on desert maps with high dust and camping in the corner so enemy will be exhausted no matter what they do. Adding an extra 30 mins to the game just so they can win without using any tactics. If you like REAL battle tactics, this is NOT the game for you get EMPIRE instead. If you like doing cowardly ♥♥♥♥ and playing like a ♥♥♥♥♥, then get napoleon and just the rest of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no skill.","May 13, 2014","true","273.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","29","35","0","3"

Not a problem though; you'll be too distracted by the enhanced strategy of it to notice this.\n\n- Story Mode; Story mode is great for those who are after a more story driven experience.

Napoleon includes the ability to liberate nations and set up their protectorates, like Romania, Brittany, and Poland. The system of converting buildings and the nice tech tree are also pluses. Some things I don't like that much are the limits on generals. Also, no religious agents, although given the short campaign time, they would not be able to realistically and significantly convert populations. Finally, one of my favorite features carried over from Empire: national buildings. For example, the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.","November 2, 2014","true","38.7"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

Epi-Pen [UNSOC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WTJapaneseTanks/","91 products in account","Let me tell you of the great Russian general, Sir Mikhail Kutosov. It all begins when the Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. His force's were immediatly put into action, starting with capturing the 2 towns Moldova and Romaneasca, his great Russian comrades attacked the rest of the Ottoman Empire and together they took all of the Ottoman Empire. After some time, he was deployed in France to fight Napoleon and his forces. After long battles and many casualties, Mikhail took Paris. When Napoleon and his allies were all "taken care of" he moved back into Paris to calm down the riots and rebellions of Napoleon's absence. Suddenly, from the north, Das Königreich Preußen declared war on Russia. Those damn Prussians! Who would've expected them to attack! But since Russia owned basically 19/20s of Europe the poor Prussians didn't stand a chance, however during this war he was injured from a stray musket round. He was almost instantly moved back to Moscow and when he was feeling better he was put back into action as Russia's best general, and during the time of Mikhail's injury Russia took England, Sweden, and Denmark. After more city-state battles, there were only 2 countries left in all of Europe.. Russia and their best ally... Austria. Mikhail being the best general had been sent orders to crush Austria and capture Vienna for the good of the Russian empire. However.. on his way over to Vienna, an ambush from a massive army! Mikhail had no chance as his men were shot and cut down. Suddenly in the midst of the already lost battle, a young Hungarian grenzer shot Mikhail Kutosov ending his life. (The ending is made up because Mikhail can never actually be killed in the game)\n\n(RIR = Rest in Ruski)\n\nRIR 1769~1808 Mikhail Kutosov\n\nBut for real the game is basically like 9.8/10 in my opinion (I'll be back with a Great War mod version of this)\n","November 19, 2015","true","225.7"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","67","20","30","15","1"

Of course a long Empire Total War game has fwe remaining kingdoms late in the game and most are rather large.\n\nThis is an excellent time peroid for warfare. Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry are all useful on the battlefield. There are many cool units during this time period.\n\nThere are off map trading sites similar to those found in Empire. These trading sites are nice for extra income.\n\nNapoleon Total War is one of the good Total War games. Total War games are great. I like them.

In Empire there were 3 continents with serveral cultures such as the European, Indian, Middle-Eastern and Native American, therefore the player had to adapt according to which they were fighting. In Napoleon TW the map is focused on Europe alone, with a small Ottoman Empire in Greece.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/recommended/34030/","commanderllama","Lord Captain Commander Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/","437 products in account","I grabbed Napoleon Total War on a sale years ago for reasons I cannot really remember. Maybe I had been playing Shogun 2 and enjoying that, and thought it would be a good idea to throw money at Creative Assembly.\n\nNapoleon has the same two layers of war that all the Total War titles do. You've got your Campaign Map strategic layer where you recruit troops, upgrade settlements, research technology, partake in diplomacy, and move your armies around conquering, retreating, or what not. Then you've got your Battles (when two armies meet on the map) which plays like a slow paced RTS where positioning and unit composition mean the difference between victory or defeat. I enjoy both layers of the game on their own, and put together they make this franchise. It works pretty well here as it does in all Total War games.\n\nEmpire Total War was very buggy for my then-computer and I didn't really enjoy that style of warfare, so I went into Napoleon Total War with low expectations. It grew on me pretty fast. I still question some of the game design decisions. Select your infantry unit, right click to attack an enemy unit like any other RTS? No. They'll be inefficient and terrible. Napoleonic warfare seems to be a lot about forming big lines and just sitting there, and on a lot of battles you do just sit there and watch your vast lines of troops slowly slaughter vast lines of enemy troops.\n\nNapoleon Total War feels like polished Empire Total War, and now that it's several years old I had the pleasure of playing through the game on maximum settings and resolution while maintaining a framerate above 60 at all times (usually above 100). It was not without technical issues. I experienced several Crash to Desktop errors in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns, but none in the European campaign. In battle, there were occasionally weird white-square graphical glitches that would flash across the screen. The campaign map had a few weird audio beeping glitches. At this point, assume there will be no patches for this game, so know you may be getting into some of that.\n\nAs someone chronically bad at RTS, though, I found ways to enjoy this. I would always try to field 3-4 units of cavalry, and while my line infantry sat there awaiting battle in guard mode, I made my own fun micromanaging a few cavalry units to harass enemy artillery, lone cavalry, or generals. By the time I had to pull my exhausted cavalry back, battle would begin, and I could often micromanage my artillery or tighten infantry lines.\n\nI enjoyed the historical approach to the campaigns. The tutorial campaign teaches you a bit about Napoleon's life while learning how to play the game. Each successive campaign after that is slightly larger, unlocks more of the game's complexity, and follows Napoleon's historic conquests. The Italian campaign only has a few factions and is landlocked on a small map, with no diplomacy or technology research. You learn to fight and do some basic economic management. Beat that and you're off to Egypt, where they introduce naval battles, technology research, and a medium-sized map. Finally, you take on the European campaign which is often called the "Grand Campaign" in the other Total War titles. Europe (and parts of Eurasia) are rendered on a huge campaign map with plenty of factions. I enjoyed the steady increase in difficulty and complexity. If I had dove right into the Europe campaign I would have done terrible, but after beating Italy and Egypt, I felt "ready" for Europe. Good design.\n\nI never enjoyed the naval battles much. My own ship AI seemed terrible, requiring massive micromanagement. Any more than a few ships was beyond my effective control, so I ended up building huge navies and autoresolving those conflicts.\n\nThis part of history still isn't my favourite, and I have a few other Total War games to play in my preferred more ancient settings. But if you're into Napoleonic warfare, this was a surprisingly good game to immerse yourself into. Of course, it is very similar to Empire Total War, which has a more global feel, and in terms of scope that might take the cake. But if you're happy becoming Supreme Emperor of Europe, this is quality game.","March 12","true","31.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","4"

Will Creative assembly get their name back? Find out, in my review of Napoleon: Total war.\n\nNow, being a strategy game, it must be known that you need patience, more than all. And keep in mind, I played every Total War game since Rome, so I'm a big fan of the series.\nThe thing that bothers me the most is that the AI is getting really clunky. It's really easy for me to win battles. They charged a group of Militia headfirst into my top level Black Watch soldiers. That's right.\n\nOn the positive side that Creative Assembly always gets right is the setting. It makes you feel like Napoleon, with your own army, or the various leaders of the Coaliton, from the Duke of Wellington to the Prince of Orange. You also learn to respect the soldiers from that period of history. Just following your orders, going whereverer you tell them to go. Fearlessly. There's just something about seeing them walking nonchalantly, staring at death at the end of a muzzle. It's quite fascinating, which make me rather interested in the period, and I am glad Napoleon developed with Line Infantry warfare as the key element.\n\nThe Campaign is pretty fleshed out, with 4 Napoleon Campaigns, battles, and of course, the campaigns of the coaliton, which are the standard Total War campaigns we learned to enjoy. I stayed up until 2 AM trying to prove history wrong and take Russia, much to the demise of my soldiers.  Did I succeed? Meh.\n\nThe Multiplayer is... Okay. The dual campaign still has numerous glitches, and some multiplayed battles I had were just disconnected halfway through. The drop in battle feature is really clever, probably used to deal with CA's clunky AI, which i spoke about a little bit earlier.\n\nBut, talking about the game itself, I have encountered numerous glitches, although not game breaking. The game, in this state, is alright. It doesn't hold up as the earlier games, but every new game from empire to rome II (except Shogun II) Had some flaws that made you say that this doesn't really feel like the last games. That's why I'm giving it this verdict.\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10. In this state, the game is alright. Although the previous turmoil cannot be forgiven. Being a long time Total War fan, I must say that Napoleon isn't as good as Shogun II, but it isn't as bad as Empire or Rome II. It's an adequate game, which I do think many RTS players will enjoy.\n\nThe reason I gave it an 8/10 is because of the feeling all Total War games give you. Immersion. You lose yourself in the power lust of trying to become the greatest country in Europe, stopping at nothing, and destroying everything in your path to doing so. Creative Assembly still retains that feeling to this day, but they hit a new low with Rome II.","January 26, 2014","true","46.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

On it's own, the game is not remarkable at all, but with the right mods, it suddenly becomes one of the best strategy games out there.\n\nNTW obviously takes place in Napoleonic times and features prominently a series of campaigns that mirror Napoleon's wars from the 1790s to 1815. The main campaign of the game is his European war effort from 1805 to 1812, beginning with the War of the Third Coalition and ending around the time Napoleon was trapeezing about the Russian steppes. The campaign, like all Total War campaigns, features elements of economy, infrastructure, and regional control that bring about challenges to building your empire and maintaining control, as well as feeding, paying, and supplying your troops. In addition to this and the usual mess that is diplomacy, NTW features weather prominently, with zones of attrition existing across the map, in places where weather and terrain  demoralize men while also killing them off. Spend too long in one of these zones, and you will have no army.\n\nYou can also play the parts of Russia, Britain, Prussia, and Austria, in this European campaign. It should be mentioned that without mods, you cannot play any other nation in this or any of the campaigns (which include an Italy-centered campaign and Napoleon's expedition to Egypt. In both of these, you can only play as the French). This totally take away from the fun of ETW, in which you can take any nation that existed at the time and turn it into a dominant power. And, because the game mechanics sevearly tilt the odds in favor of Napoleon (which is both fair and unfair), playing as any of the afore-mentioned powers can be a fruitless struggle in futility and swarms of French soldiers.\n\nThe battles themselves are where NTW, as all other Total War games, truly shines. commanding vast armies of a thousand soldiers on the field of battle in real time is exhilarating. NTW did a particularly good job with programming for soldiers (it is a step up from ETW, which is a relief to many), and especially with artillery. Spectaular graphics make the battles all the more incredible, but this has always been a hallmark of the Total War series. And of course, there are some problems with battles in NTW:\n-1) You really can just sit there in a defensive starting position while the enemy AI bayonet-charges you. It's like Pickett's charge every ♥♥♥♥ing game.\n-2) Shooting mechanics are not accurate for the period. There is no firing by rank, and light infantry, which have the same weapons as normal line infantry, can shoot as far and as acurately as most riflemen.\n-3) AI controled soldiers are prone to fire towards you, no matter if there are three units of their own men in front of them. Again, it's not much of a fight.\n-4) Battles seperate from campaigns have the added benifit of a complete lack of variety in maps, most of which seem to be geared towards tournament play.\n\nNTW does offer compelling battles, when fought against other players in Multiplayer mode. They even tried to add in multiplayer mode for campaigns, which was a brilliant idea and could have been wonderful but instead is a poorly-programmed piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe only way to have fun while playing a campaign, or to add fun while playing multiplayer, is to use the mod known as DarthMod. There is a DarthMod made by independent sources for every Total War game, and in NTW it is almost essential to have this mod in addition to the game. The mode enhances the sound quality, texture quality (smoke lingers in clouds, and blood splatters when soldiers are shot), melee fighting programming, the number of soldies per unit (from around 160 to about 360!) and most importantly, AI programing. Soldiers now fire by rank, and the AI is a cometent and worth opponent, both in battle and in campaign. Additionally, you unlock every availible nation with DarthMod. I've gone on rampages as Hannover, Portugal, Bavaria, and many more.\n\nIn short, if you are looking for a good Total War game, this is probably not the one to get. However, if Empire was your favorite Total War game, or if you prefer guns and cannons to spears and arrows, then get this game and the DarthMod for it.\n\nWithout DarthMod, NTW is a 4 out of 10.\n\nWith DarthMod, I give Napoleon: Total War an 8 out of 10.","July 25, 2014","true","370.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I say this because in the 9 hours I have tried the multiplayer I have only played THREE battles. And that isn't because there is a lack of games being started it is because a good portion of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hosting them have an ungodly hatred for players who have a one-star ranking which means people who have just bought the game have extreme trouble finding good matches and when they do people don't want to be on a team with a one-star because they think "Oh God he is a one-star I am going to lose if I team up with him" and then the game ends up with either a bunch of one-stars vs veterans at the game or other players begging the host to kick the one-star because they want more experienced players on.\n\nThe first game I played was 3 one-stars vs 3 5 stars we lost of course, then the second game no one wanted to be on my side so the host gave me an AI ally, finally my third game was the ONLY game where players greater than one-star were on the same team as me, it was a great experience.\n\nSo unless you have a friend who you can boost your stars with I would not get this game for the multiplayer as it takes a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears before you can find a single decent host. I unfortunately do not have such a friend.\n\nThe campaign mode is alright, not as good as Empire though.\nI assume the multiplayer could be good if you boosted your rank.\n\nSo I would give this game a 6/10 if you are unable to boost your stats and an 8/10 if are able to boost your stats.\n\nTL;DR The game is fun but the community need to get those logs out of their asses and not worry about ranking.","February 18","false","12.6"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","17","31","4","17"

Interesting to play on.\n+ Real-time battles where you command thousands of soldiers, artillery and cavalry at once.\n+ The Grand campaign map spans Europe, so it's a decent size. However, it's definitely smaller than most Total War games and is therefore less enjoyable.\n+ Nice diplomacy system.\n+ DLC packs (The Peninsular campaign) are fun, but be prepared for a challenge.\n+ Graphics are a step up from the previous title in the series, Empire: Total War and look acceptable, but they're not fantastic by any means.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Napoleon: Total War is less complex than its predecessor, Empire: Total War. It's missing a lot of features which would enhance it and seems a bit too simplistic at times. This is an issue which greatly detracts from the potential of the game.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nNapoleon Total War offers many gameplay options to players and is downright fun.

It looks beautiful, the music is hauntingly solemn--which is rather fitting for a game that teaches you how absolutely worthless human life actually is--and it's just an all-around fantastic game. My only complaint is the smaller size of the campaign, though I guess I was kind of spoiled by how extensive Rome II and Empire's campaigns were.\n\nAlso, a spy of mine stumbled into a French border town, and Napoleon just happened to be there. He had a 20% chance of assassinating the face of France himself, so I just kinda shrugged and gave him the order to do it, and he ♥♥♥♥in' succeeded. Napoleon was dead before the first year of the game was over. 10/10, would change the course of history again.\n\n","September 28, 2015","true","31.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

A definate must have, but it does have some flaws, such as The AI isn't the best, Charging with one unit at the time at my elite foot guards, or attacking my heavily fortified castle with a few militia soldiers. It is a huge improvement over Empire:Total war, And the DLC force you to change playstyles with the different units.\n\nThe AI is a bit dissapointing when it comes to fighting, such as when I charge with cavalry they don't form square, or how the artillery would target my fencibles when they were in thin line instead of attacking my foot guards who were in square\n\npros-\nVery good game\na large array of units, and most countries are playable.\nfirst person mode is alright, and when your guy shoots, you spectate the bullet (insert to first person)\n\nCons-\nBad AI\nThe map feels cramped\n","September 1, 2015","true","31.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you're wavering with the above, I would suggest buying the game, playing it to get used to it (even if you're a TW vet this one is a wee bit different in terms of UI) and then immediantly downloading the mod. It fixes the AI, doubles (or more) unit sizes without lag, and adds EVEN COOLER special affects, like more unforgiving wind in Naval combat, better cavalry physics and chare affects, and some lovely musket noises...\nOverall, I'd reccomend this game (as you can see I've certainly spent my share of time playing it), esspecially with Darthmod. However, if you're new to Total War, I'd reccomend Empire (and Darthmod Empire!) or Rome 1.","August 27, 2014","true","214.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Imagine managing any one of the multiple major nations at the time such as Russia or Britain, allowing you to make any decision from controlling your government, trade, industry, research, diplomacy and of course your most important is your military. Now not only are you given objectives to complete within a certain time period but also it gives you the chance for European domination as any one of those major nations. Plan your nation's expansion across Europe allowing you to pick any strategy possible from either destroying large nations to annexing smaller nations into your unstoppable empire! Once you're tired of playing Napoleon's 3 campaigns (Italy, Egypt, and Europe) you can play as any of the coalition nations against Napoleon's France or play multiple different battles that were decisive turning points in history from The Battle of Waterloo to The Battle of the Nile. Finally once you've completed all of that there is multiplayer that is quite entertaining when playing campaigns or battles with friends or anyone else too. Overall this is a pretty good Total War game to buy for you and a friend to play sometime together as a team or as foes.","April 18, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like this kind of tactical strategy, where you will need to keep the distance to your enemy, this game is for you.

Imagine managing any one of the multiple major nations at the time such as Russia or Britain, allowing you to make any decision from controlling your government, trade, industry, research, diplomacy and of course your most important is your military. Now not only are you given objectives to complete within a certain time period but also it gives you the chance for European domination as any one of those major nations. Plan your nation's expansion across Europe allowing you to pick any strategy possible from either destroying large nations to annexing smaller nations into your unstoppable empire! Once you're tired of playing Napoleon's 3 campaigns (Italy, Egypt, and Europe) you can play as any of the coalition nations against Napoleon's France or play multiple different battles that were decisive turning points in history from The Battle of Waterloo to The Battle of the Nile. Finally once you've completed all of that there is multiplayer that is quite entertaining when playing campaigns or battles with friends or anyone else too. Overall this is a pretty good Total War game to buy for you and a friend to play sometime together as a team or as foes.","April 18, 2014","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Die Neuerungen die bereits bei Empire punkten konnten wurden beibehalten und weitere Neuheiten wurden eingeführt (wie z.B. der Verschleiß oder das "Befreien" von Städten), was das Taktieren auf der Kampagnenkarte anspruchsvoller macht. Sehr postiv fällt auch auf, das man die Stärken der verschiedenen Einheiten besser ausbalanciert hat, so das zahlenmäßige überlegenheit nun nicht mehr so viel ausmacht wie in Empire. Dadurch muss beim "Bau" der Armee genau überlegt werden welche Einheitenart wie oft vertreten sein sollte. Die zahlreichen Änderungen im Multiplayer eröffnen auch viele neue Möglichkeiten (vor allem die Online-Kampagne) und steigern den Spielspaß ungemein. Was Bugs, Grafikfehler und Abstürze betrifft muss man bei Napoleon glücklicherweise sehr lange suchen oder warten bis man etwas findet. Ein Top Spiel, welches sich ohne weiteres in die erfolgreiche Total War Reihe eingliedern kann.","May 5, 2011","true","80.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The scope seems to be less than some of the other big RTS games, but that will be a plus for people getting their feet wet in the genre. There are a decent amount of variety in the units, and specifically, learning how to use the buffs from the general units is very satisfying. The protectorate system is a nice addition on the surface, but could have been fleshed out more (see below). The minor towns are a nice touch, and since not everything is centralized in the major cities, it makes for some fun times attacking and defending the country side.\n\nCons: A couple of cons, not many, but these two are pretty aggeravting. The AI is horrendous. In my recent playthrough as Russia, I have had to pretty much conquer France and Spain single handly while Prussia and Austria move 2 units around aimlessly. And then I had a French army walk, unattacked mind you, through all of Prussia and Austria, take none of their cities and then attack my lightly defended homeland. Thanks devs. Way to break my emersion.\nThe prectorate system is even worse. I tried to roleplay as the liberater where possible. Don't. Your main allies will just attack them, even before the big enemies are defeated. So count on Prussia to attack one of YOUR prectotrates while YOU are trying to singlehandly finish off Napolean and Spain. And they seem to be less than willing to accept deals.

All flat firing artillery is too weak compared to an artillery.\nAustrian forces and army is too weak.\nNo Ottomans,Italian States (Italy,Naples etc...) and some other states in campaign.(You cant play with them in campaign.)\nNo blood.\n\n\n\nMy system:\n\nGtx 960 2gb\nFX-8300 3.55 GHZ OC\n8 GB RAM\nWin 7 ultimate.\n\n\nIf you like my review about this game please send friendship request to me ;)\n\n\n\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","336.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to auto-resolve combat because I was concerened about getting pwned by hard AI. Not so anymore. Putting in the time to understand the battlespace and what I can do with my ranks in most circumstances has given me the confidence to face off armies almost twice the size of mine and still survive (and on Hard Battle settings). Finally I feel I'm getting the value out of this great title that thought was lacking a few years back.\nI've watched Oakley's THFE youtube channel and the one thing I have taken from his expertise is the finessing of your units. Subtlety in placement and timing. These factors are just as important as the skill and moral of your men.\n\nThe finer aspects of the campaign game are still a work in progress for me, as I'm not an accountant, though you don't really need to be to succeed. However accounting for cashflows when stretching multiple armies across the map is vital. Getting spys ahead of your armies to gater intelligence can save you the heartache of being double-teamed by opposing armies!\n\nI currently have a GTX970 and have the graphics cranked right up to ultra all around. I've upscaled my resolution to 1.5 native, reducing the interface just enough to be out of the way and still useable. The frames are pretty good at between 40 and 60, so the visuals are really quite spectacular, especially with large forces on the field.\n\nI thoroughly recommend this for any history buff and/or RTS gamer, and even for anyone thinking of trying something different.","July 28, 2015","true","55.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In addition to some vitally improved diplomatic options, more detailed region management and troop control, Napoleon: Total War allows an insight to the mindset of Bonaparte throught a rather enjoyable series of campaigns (especially compared to the War of Independance). If you're looking for a game that plays a little like Rome II but with cannons and glorious ships, this is the Total War game for you!

It features several different campaigns that take from the beginning to the end of the prestigious general's career.  If your computer is capable, the visuals are gorgeous, especially once the combat starts and smoke covers the field and blows in the wind.  The AI is decent for a total war game, and much better than Empire's AI, which could never seem to correctly fight line battles.  I love how tactical the gameplay can get, and this total war emphasizes on positioning and formation to win battles, not just charging everything in sight.  There have been several instances in custom and multiplayer battles when my smaller or less experienced force defeated a much more powerful army simply by being in better formation, and I love that.  I feel like each unit in this game is useful and can succeed when commanded well.  The game itself is crisp and clean and relatively bug free, and local multiplayer games have been a blast.  I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the time period or fans of the total war games, particularly empire due to the simularities.  What I expected to be merely a $15 mod for Empire total war turned out to be a much more polished and enjoyable game all around.","July 17, 2014","true","26.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It condences and streamlines the best of the previous Total War, and the close focus on Napoleon works for the games benefit. There are three main campaigns: Italy, Egypt and Europe. Italy and Egypt can be played through in a weekend, rely much on scripts and are likely aimed at new players. Europe is the keystone, and takes many days to finish.\n\nGraphics are improved, as are the sounds, and the interface is very clear. The single-player is completed with Campaigns of the Coalition, where the other powers get to try world domination, and scenarios retelling Napoleons famous battles. These battles may be the most rewarding in Vanilla. AI has great difficulties with making balanced armies and then leading them in battles, but the scenarios are built more like interesting puzzles. The multiplayer battles have a cutthroat reputation and there will be challenge there. Campaigns can be played in multiplayer too but that is not practical.\n\nDarthmod is absolutely vital, as with all Total War games. The Greek Darth Vader will always get my vote for greatest modder alive. It is a permanent blemish for Creative Assembly that they refused to hire him. Perhaps it was envy, perhaps not, we do not know but should enjoy the fruits of his skill, intellect and passion for completing Total War. Napoleon: Total War is fit for series veterans as well as newcomers and comes highly recommended.","August 28, 2013","true","98.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/K-Architect/recommended/34030/","K-Architect","Charlie Brown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/K-Architect/","70 products in account","Best Total War Series (aside from Shogun 2) all because of the faster loading sequences of the game itself; fast load in the start, fast game loading, smooth gameplay, this game is tailored to be the golden egg. Even though, it didn't focus on other continents other than Europe (not even a North Africa or Middle East setting in this one; Coalition Campaign), it focused a lot of details that happened in the Napoleonic Wars. The different minor factions like the Republic of Veneto (Venice), Italy (not the kingdom of Italy which this Italy shouldn't be here til ~1880ish), Savoy, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, Catalonia, Westphalia, United Netherlands and Batavian Republic (or Netherlands), Courland, Crimean Khanate, Greece, Hannover, Hessen, Bavaria, Baden-Wuttemberg, Romania, Belgium, Norway, and Poland (I think I named all the possible minor, emerging factions in this game). Its great to see such variety in the gameplay itself. Plus, you can even modify the files for this to your purposes, such as me making a pak file which lets me build Italian Velite Grenadiers (which is a speciality unit) and one of Napoleon's prized unit Grand Artillery and the Old Guard as playing the BRITISH. You can also change attributes of politicans/generals/admirals (name, face portraits, age, etc.) and even replace existing units to have different units (replaced Horatio Nelson's Rose 122 cannon ship to the Santisma Trindad 144 cannon) Sending the Spanish Armada to Davy Jone's Locker in the first turn (all of these are on twcenter.com/forums). Also edited my money so I can pay off nations to get territory without fighting, buying property and encircled my enemies lawl\n\nIn other words, I play this more and have tendencies of coming back to this game way after I bought this than Shogun 2 (maybe its the lag or lack of campaign replay ability, etc.).

Yes NTW's community is much larger however the reason being is that ETW's community was ruined by competative cod type trash players and they have all moved on to this, ETW had light dragoons spams where line infantry were there to soak bullets, the lights to break the stalmate and the extremly op light dragoons do all the fighting, Here it is dominated by infantry spams, just like ETW better light infantry wins, thats it. That aside the community is riddled with rage quiters and people who rig the rules in their favor. The biggest issue is the balance, instead of the factions having strengths and weaknesses like ETW and other TW games is bascially France>UK>Prussia>Russia>Austria> everyone else, yes there is still skill involved but some factions are extremly unbalanced and factions like the dutch stand no chance.\n","May 17","false","28.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I played a bit of this game and it IS a good game, just like all of the other reviews I made (generally, I make reviews of only good games). Anyway, the game consists of real battles, and other stuff (not much of a historian :P). It has realistic battles, tactics such as flanking your enemies and stuff. The campaigns are also based on real events too (please don't shout at me or anything if one of the campaigns are not real, just say  it quietly :D). Overall, 8/10 for this game, I just keep thinking why they had to make a standalone game for Napoleon. Maybe it was because he was a badass? I don't know. Maybe so. Epic game though, with a grand speech from Napoleon (Although a fact: Picture of Napoleon is not drawn to scale, they just made him look better in the picture, although he is actually fat lol). Anyway, GG as I said, and I would reccomend this game for total war fans.","February 27, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Along with every other total war fan I became hopelessly obsessed with NTW from the moment I saw the trailer and felt the tingles of empiricism run down my spine. We'll start with the campaign. Although I liked the fact that historical accuracy was kept intact with the coalition against Napolean, I found the campaign interface seriously lacking in my expectations. Having become accustomed to the layout of ETW I struggled initially to adjust to NTW and navigating my way through the campaign. Eventually I got the hang of it, but I found that everything took far too long, from ship building to unit replenishment, everything cost too much as well, making progression very difficult. However; what the game lacked in campaign dynamics it completely made up for in battle realism. I always found cannon shot on infantry in ETW to be a little, "underdeveloped" as it were, only killing one or a few men everytime. But in NTW it couldn't be more realistic; anyone with a brain stem can figure out that an 18 pound cannon ball hurtling towards a body of men all tightly bunched up is going to rip a hole through them! I find this is perfectly incorporated into the battle aspect of NTW. Along with this, I find the unit variety much more inclusive of the period, and my particularly favourite touch that was thrown into the battle sequence was the fact that unlike in ETW; when the troops fire their muskets they all don't fire at once. NTW truly is my number one game for battle realism, with brilliant detail, such as when you zoom in to view a unit up close, the screen shakes to signify the marching, you get sun glare, and music plays, which to my amazement is indicitive to the regiment. This is a masterpiece in strategy gaming, and I would reccommend it to any serious gamer looking to delve into strategy gaming. 9.2/10.","February 28, 2014","true","46.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now the thing that is lacking is the number of nations, and campaign, but for a clan player like myself, this is not much of a gripe since I never mess with campaigns anymore. The clan community of this game, I'm rather new to it, and don't know much about it, as I use to be prominant in etw's clan community, not this game. I guess in general, the players you'll find on here are more skilled overall, but also less trustworthy in my oppinion. I only have one real friend in it's community right now, and i'm admin to one of the most elite clans to the game, so I guess I'm not doing to bad. Overall though, this game just shows you what etw SHOULD have been like......imagine all those factions and each one being as unique as they are in ntw, and the realistic battle mechanics.......ETW2 will make, or break the success of the total war franchise......don't screw this up like rome 2 CA.","April 11, 2015","true","864.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is one of my favorite total war games, along with Shogun 2.\n\nThings I liked:\n\nI like the individual city based approach as opposed to the newer 3 cities in a province approach.\n\nI'm a fan of the Napoleonic era, and have played many strategic boardgames set in this timeframe.   This game has a similar feel to Empires in Arms, and other strategic Napoleon era games.\n\nI like the cav vs. artillery, infantry vs. cav, artillery vs. infantry matchups.\n\nAI for all computer games is somewhat suspect.  This AI is ok on defense, but lacking on offense.  For best results, the player should be on offense and the computer AI on defense.\n\nThe objectives and victory conditions are good.\n\nTechnology tree is ok, but nothing special.\n\nI've played several campaigns: Egypt, Italian, and Grand Campaign (1805-1812, both Napoleon or an allied power (UK, Russian, etc.).  My preference is the grand campaign because of diplomacy, trade, technology, etc., but the other campaigns are also pretty good.\n\n","May 16","true","174.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The ai is much better in Napoleon then Empire and bugs are much less frequent in Napoleon. Napoleon also has fantastic historical battles, which have never been my favorites to complete in the past. The campaigns, all 4 ( I'm not including Waterloo because it's one battle with cutscenes) while being more restrictive then in the past, are great fun, and present a challenge when set to very hard. The graphics are fantastic if your pc can handle them, but the game is a system hog and if you have a lower end pc you should rethink purchasing until you've read up if you can run it decently or not. Multiplayer is great, with very little connection issues and the introduction to the series of a multiplayer campaign.\nOverall Napoleon:Total war is a superb strategy game that deserves a place in every strategy players liabrary.\n10/10","June 17, 2014","true","96.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I only have two big gripes with Napoleon. The first gripe is that - much like Empire - the textures on units and structures are shockingly low res, even when set to high. Not that it ruins the game, but it's offputting how grainy it can look when zoomed right in. In Shogun, this wasn't as big of an issue. My second gripe is that the offline campaign - which is honestly about the same as that of any other Total War game - focuses strictly on Napoleon Bonaparte's real-world campaign. This shouldn't be a shock, since the game's called ♥♥♥♥ing Napoleon, but it would be AMAZING if this game had the same huge campaign map that Empire did. The time period could have also been a little big bigger - but again, it was to accomodate Bonaparte's epoch, so I get it.\n\nI grabbed some DLC for this when they were 0.50$ a piece during the Sega sale, and I really enjoyed the addition of some historical units for all countries. Especially the UK units! Total War has a good example of how to do DLC right - some neat additions that don't make the game better or worse, for a reasonable price. All the DLC does is add some historically accurate units, so really it's just for the sake of eyecandy and to please history buffs.\n\nThe combat also feels mechanically better than it does in Empire. Not much to say about it, but it feels better. Pretty much all there is to it.\n\n9/10, worth the money!

For beginners I recommend doing the campaign first if you ever want  a chance at the online battles. Speaking of campaign, you play as one of the great powers of the early 19th century. Either command Napoleans vast armies and rule his cities or defend yourself against the tinny (he was actully taller than the average Frenchmen) Emperor. While you command your armies you use napolianic tactics to win the battle, use calvary, foot soilders, and artillary to win the battle. At sea use your cannons to blow the enemy to bits. Of couce, in siege battles you must storm or defend your fort. The less glamourous, but equally important parts of the campaign is the economy, diplomacy, and your people . You must regularly oversee these things to make sure your army is at full strength.\nOnce you completely control Europe, you are ready to face off against other peoples skill in eighther land, Sea, or Siege battles. you'll pick up on it quickly and have a blast destroying other peoples armies.

First off the fife and drum music in vanilla is horrifying. It's computer generated, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and is generally nowhere close to music of the period. The AI as exprcted in all games litterally accidentally walks into your lines with total disregard for any bullets flying into the from any direction. The map is downsized from that of Empire and many of Empire's good qualities are gone. I can most definitely say that this isnt one of my favorite Total War games. It seriously needs revision as well as bug fixes such as the bug where the AI units stand in place and turn from side to side over and over for about half a minute. Some positives though are the updated graphics as well as adding in some fun gameplay.

The clan community of this game, I'm rather new to it, and don't know much about it, as I use to be prominant in etw's clan community, not this game. I guess in general, the players you'll find on here are more skilled overall, but also less trustworthy in my oppinion.

As per usual, we have the slightly bad AI system, but it has improved from the previous games, correct me if I'm wrong. This game is awesome, however can get slightly boring if you play without mods, it lacks range of units, but that is due to its setting, there wasn't much during the Napoleonic Era of History. Though still a great game to be playing, I love playing as the British, conquering the seas, blowing up French ships sky high, it is truly an epic experience.\n\nI highly recommend installing mods such as Darthmod when playing this, it adds a huge range of units and improves the game a lot, makes it much more fun basically. There are also other great mods out there, so you don't just have to play with Darthmod, go knock yourself out with the other mods, they're all fantastic additions to the game.\n\nHighly recommend this.","July 25, 2014","true","248.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Being British it makes you feel incredibly patriotic ! ;DThe unit detail is fantastic and the sea battles are just brilliant. Took me a year to complete the total domination of Europe from Britain as I was just casually playing. Most of my hours are just spent doing custom battles as those are most fun. A quick tip just spam  howitzers are the best by far.

Some folks love it, some folks hate it. It is, to be fair, an almost carbon copy of Empire at first glance. The most noticeable difference is that Napoleon concentrates exclusively on Europe whereas Empire allows the player to conquer the globe.\n\nBeyond first blush, Napoleon does feature some improvements over Empire that make it worth consideration. Chief of those is better coding - Napoleon is accepted by most to be a much more stable and better running game than Empire. It is also better looking. AI is supposedly markedly better, however that is debatable. There are a number of mods available that greatly improve the Napoleonic experience - but you're fine running the stock game.\n\nIf Empire and Napoleon look too similar to you - if muskets and dragoons are all the same to you, you may prefer Empire over Napoleon due to the globe. But... If, like me, you have a fascination with the Napoleonic Wars, you owe it to yourself to give Napoleon: Total War - beyond dominating Europe, there is also a series of historical battles and campaigns that are very enjoyable.","November 25, 2013","true","45.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
