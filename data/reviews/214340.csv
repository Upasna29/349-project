But the LucasArts we knew isn’t coming back, so I suspect it’s a good try it if you’ve got a hankering for that style of gameplay (with a similar amount of difficulty).\n\nIn contrast to its clear inspirations found in series such as Monkey Island, it suffers from production iffiness issues such as variable voice acting and animation quality (in the English version, there are some nasty translation-isms throughout, and multiple lines of that sort where they clearly stressed a word in a sentence that wasn’t the one that should have been stressed), as well as an indecisiveness as to what constitutes an appropriate style of fourth-wall breaking.\n\nMuch to the game’s credit, however, the setting is a unique junkyard world and the protagonist Rufus (at least at the start) is more the sort of guy you might expect a point-and-click adventure game kleptomaniac vandal to be: a near-irredeemable jerk. Unfortunately, people are all too willing to point this out to his face, which sometimes works in the story’s favor and sometimes doesn’t. Moreover, there are a lot of artistic details in the world that you simply can’t click on and have Rufus snark about, which is something of a must to get a real feel for an adventure game world’s presence.\n\nOne thing that is much nicer than typical old-school examples is that you don’t have to do the pixel-hunting if you don’t want to (hold space to see the interactive spots), and most of the time, you don’t have to watch a slow walk animation just to explore the map (double-click to fast forward through navigational arrows).\n\nFinally, the game is kind of crashy in a few spots (at least the Mac version is), so you may want to do some saving on top of the auto-saving. Some achievements are skippable, but at least one achievement guide in the Steam community is relatively spoiler free.\n\nFor all its flaws, the game is usually about as funny as it thinks it is, so at least I can say I enjoyed it. Nonetheless, this game has some mature humor, so don’t get too fooled by the cutesy noseless art; it’s not really for kids.\n\nDroggeljug.","November 25, 2013","true","11.2"," 141 of 164 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","141","164","0","0"

The only thing he wants is to leave Deponia- planet of junkyard and to go to Elysium which is a floating city above the planet that holds all the beauty and wealth.\nEveryone, including his close friends tell him he is a maniac and can never succeed in his stupid plans of leaving deponia. But as the attractive lady called Goal from higher sector falls into the trash heaps of deponia and she needs to go back; Rufus assumes that helping her and taking her back to her fiancé would be his only salvation.\n\nSome characters are weird, some are cranky and grumpy but all are really full of amusement. Most of the ideas that Rufus gets to escape from junkyard is by talking to different kind of people that show less politeness and more of a sarcasm. Most of the dialogues are often packed with lot of humor which will make you laugh out loud. The voice acting is top notch which is why i found the game really amusing and didn't stop playing.\n\nThe puzzles in the game were quite difficult(especially for me). Rufus has to collect weird stuff in his inventory; combining some of them together to make them work and to proceed his mission of leaving deponia. Finding the right tools and items was a difficult task.\n\nBackgrounds are colourful that even the whole junk and heaps of trashs seems to hold beauty in them.\n\nIn the end i want to say i loved this game a lot. It has unusual love story. I recommend this game, even to those who are not fan of such games. But you should try something different, as different is sometimes cool!","June 30, 2015","true","13.5"," 73 of 76 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","73","76","2","20"

But I suppose because I am new to this genre, I would often find myself stuck and wondering what do next. If it wasn't for online walkthroughs I would never have completed this game. But after completing it with much help, I'm glad I picked it up. It was fun, memorable, and something that I am not used to playing.

It also has a very beautiful and charming art style and great music and voice acting to go along with it. The humor is great...most of the time, and the puzzles make sense most of the time but every now and again it goes full on Monkey Island-logic, and you need to think way outside the box to progress.\n\nThe game has a lot of missable achievements so would recommend having either a guide handy or use saves very frequently to avoid more playthroughs then necessary. It also has an achievement for beating the game in its alternate mode that you unlock by beating the game: Droggeljug mode. This will replace all written and voiced dialog with the word Droggeljug along with all the info boxes. While funny for the first few minutes it gets really annoying, and you want to uppercut a kitten.\n\nTime to 100%: 6-8 hours","February 2, 2014","true","6.4"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!\n\nOverview: Deponia is the first game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium, following his dad's footsteps. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even some romance.\n\nPros:\nThe interface is really great and easy to navigate\nThe story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way\nGood length for an adventure game\nThe puzzles are really nice and sober--the game provides you not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world and they've really hit the perfect mark in this aspect. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. You probably won't need a guide, if you can deal with just the right amount of frustration that pushes you forward.\nCharacters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some "role play", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles.\nGreat voice acting\nThe 2D graphics are really amazing\nThe BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songs\nThe cliffhanger for the next game is just perfect--it closes a chapter really well, but you'll want to know what happens next\nCons:\nThe game crashed a few times for me (probably 2 or 3), mostly after videos. But it was so rare, it didn't annoy me much, especially because the autosave prevented me from losing progress.\nSome people report that a few of the achievements didn't unlock for them, but I didn't have any problem with them (maybe it was fixed after a recent update, idk), except for the Droggeljug one (I did use the shortcut, though, and it eventually unlocked)\nSpeaking of which, Droggeljug is probably one of the worst ideas I've seen in a game. All sentences, characters' names, item's names and literally every text in the game is replaced with "Droggeljug", from start to finish. But it's just a bonus mode you unlock after beating the game, so not a big deal. Still, it's so stupid I had to mention it.\nBought on: Scorched Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$ 0.27. This amount is ridiculously low for such an awesome game. The full Steam price is not exactly a steal, but I think it's fair. If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.\n\nVerdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check Deponia! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there.

The art design is good, the sound design and voice acting is fine. Overall it's competently implemented and predictable from the perspective of a mid-age mouse-centric adventure, like say Monkey Island 3. But there are a couple of problems.\n\nThe easy one is the mechanics. I've been spoiled by more recent adventures like Broken Age that provide sensible shortcuts for getting around, such as running or warping across screens. None of those are present here, which means watching the protagonist Rufus amble infuriatingly slowly across the map. And you'll be doing a lot of that, because the puzzles are often of the logic-free, "lateral-thinking", try-everything-with-everything-else variety that have thankfully become less fashionable these days. The walking in particular annoyed me more than other older games I've been playing such as Broken Sword. How did they manage to be worse than adventure games from almost twenty years ago? Not sure. In any case, dealing with these irritations to push through the game would be easier if it weren't for the second problem, which is the writing.\n\nIt tries so hard! But the jokes are either flat or just mean. I recognize the jokes, I just don't really feel like laughing at them. None of the characters are really likeable, the protagonist least of all, so I don't at all feel invested in seeing the story through. As a result, I've done my few hours of play and have given up.\n\nSorry, Deponia. Close, but not good enough. Perhaps the later games are better, but I'm not willing to play through this one to find out.","August 30, 2015","false","11.6"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","48","73","0","9"

Ok, I'm definitely relying too much on stereotypes, but from now on we could surely add "very nice point and click adventure games" to that list. Interesting enough, german developers released a lot of good adventure games in the last few years, becoming probably the main contributor to this little "renaissance" of the point and click genre. And Deponia is one the best examples.\n\nSomeone described Daedalic as "the European Lucasarts" and I'm not entirely sure I can agree to that, but their games are solid. Very good story, challenging puzzles, polished graphics, everything is surely above average, Deponia is definitely a nice game. Characters are crazy enough to make you often laugh, A LOT of location to explore, non linear puzzle solving, and Daedalic recently added new languages, which is always kind. As a first chapter of a trilogy Deponia works just fine, the player is always pushed to play more to see how the plot will evolve. I got stuck two or three times, which is great in my opinion, 'cause it means they focused a lot on the intellectual challenge of the game and not only on the narrative side.\n\nDefinitely worth a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.","September 25, 2014","true","12.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

As most of these games are 100% about the story, you certainly wont be disapointed with this one as its one of it's strongest features. Long story-short: It's a must for any fan of the genre and a good choice if you're just looking for something different overall.\n\nPROS: Excellent Cartoon-ish, almost Penny Arcade style of Graphics. Every background and character is so rich in colors and every screen was amazingly crafted.\nTop notch voice acting. They really put time and effort into this one,\nGreat mix of both Dry and Dark humour. There's plenty of scenes that will just make you laugh out loud.\nSimple interface and overall user-friendly game mechanics. It doesn't punish you if you happen to be completely new to the genre.\nDifficulty it's just on the spot. What most of these Point-and-click graphic adventures fail at is the crazy amount of times it just leaves the player blocked at a certain puzzle or scene, which just unables him of advancing the story. I found myself completing Deponia without hitting many roadblocks. There's always a tip or two hidden in the description and the game gives you the option of just Skiping the Hard Puzzles and advancing.\nEven though this is a trilogy, there's still a few good hours worth of game here, which is always good.\nThe Soundtrack is catchy, specially the Bard cutscenes. "HUZZAH, the chorus guy rule!"\nCONS:\nSometimes the subtitle apeared in German, instead of English. The voice was still in English.\nOn the Mine Cart level, the game oftenly exited to Windows right after the cut-scene. On the other hand, I'd always find an autosave right before it, so at least there's that.\nMinor crashes, probably got 3 or 4 on total. Again, the autosave really comes in handy here.\nThere were a couple of Items that were totally useless and were probably thrown there to confuse you. This isn't really a con since it's a staple of the genre but Newbies may find this irritating.\nVERDICT: As you probably know by know I just loved Deponia as I find myself enjoying all this crazy Junk world and the completely obnoxious character of Rufus. I strongly recommend you buy the Complete Journey pack which includes all three games. If you only get the first and you enjoy it as much as I did, chances are, you'll end up buying the other two on singles and that will really cost you.","June 16, 2015","true","9.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

The story in a brief few sentences is that you play as Rufus, an egocentric self-centered slob whose only goal is to leave his trash heap of a planet to go to the city in the sky.  The world that he lives on is called Deponia, a planet littered with trash. All of the rich folk moved up into the city in the sky, Elysium some time ago. During one of your endeavors you knock an Elysium girl off of an Organon cruiser. Throughout the first game you try to use her to find your way onto Elysium, only to end up finding out that the Elysians plan on blowing up Deponia! The second and third games are mainly spent trying to stop the Organon from doing this devilish deed while figuring out their motives along the way.\n\nThe story is a very big part of the game, which is why I only covered the basics. The series itself does not like to stray too far off of what is expected from a point-and-click game. As great as that is, if you are looking for an innovation in the genre, you might not find that here. Here, you will find a wacky and hilarious adventure that is dependent on the silly world and narrative. If you already enjoy point-and-clicks, you are in for an incredible treat. Besides the awesome narrative and dialogue, we have a lot of things that set the Deponia trilogy above the rest. The game universe in general is surreal and charming; nothing really comes close to its style in my opinion. You will be surprised how much a planet covered in trash can mesmerize you with its environments.\n\nThe trilogy gets better as it goes on. While the first game is great, everything just seems to improve with each one. The story makes unexpected yet oh so juicy turns and twists, increased amounts of detailed environments, an increasing diverse cast, and becomes one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time. The amount of information to tie up the trilogy in the third game alone will leave you with your jaw dropped to the floor. Then include that the second and third both have their own unique mechanics that make them much more puzzling, but so much cooler. One of the best things is seeing Rufus evolve as a character. It is incredibly rewarding to see everything come together.\n\nMy only sense of bitterness goes towards the ending. Before I go more into it, I am not saying the ending is bad. If anything it is awesome and leaves a lot for you to speculate and imagine. However, in this particular story, it wasn’t what I was hoping for.  There is so much I wanted to see and experience that was sort of thrown up into the air and left for you to speculate. It is not fair to spoil it, so I won’t. It just left me eager to know more, yet knowing the sad information that this is intended to only be a trilogy. Of course the possibility of a fourth game is always possible, but it isn’t intended. With that being said, I am personally dissatisfied with the ending. Not for the ending itself, but for the thing it did not answer. Good thing Daedalic (the developers) have made many more amazing games to sink my teeth into while getting over it.\n\nThat is all you need to know about Deponia before poking your head in. This is a must own for any people interested in adventure games. Daedlic is truly becoming today’s Lucas Arts, and now is a better time than ever to find out why by trying out this trilogy.","November 27, 2013","true","22.0"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","29","45","0","0"

It took me 17 hours for full completion of the game, I missed 2 optional achievements which would've taken about 2 minutes at the time so 17 hours is a good bet on time.\n\nFull disclosure: I did not use any guides or cheats or tips to assist me. There was one part I was forced to look up as it was a potential bug (crane, no spoiler) and I inadvertantly saw the solution (literally 1 click, not a puzzle). Most of my played time in the game was me sitting there saying "wtf do I do next, dear God".\n\nThat said, the game was fun. The voice acting was mostly okay.

It has great art, decent writing, some very creative characters, and a pretty interesting story.  The writing and voice acting definitely isn't the best I've seen, but it gets the job done.  The game has a very clean interface, letting you access your inventory with the mouse wheel and providing interact and inspect functions on different mouse buttons.  It's also significantly longer than most adventure games I've played as my playthrough clocked in at around 10 hours.\n\nThe one off-putting thing about the game is that you play as an idiot who frequently causes havok around town and everybody hates.  It's a really odd position to be in though the character is quite interesting and is responsible for most of the humor in the game.\n\nThe puzzles can get overwhelming at points with tons of items piling up in your inventory with little clue about how to use them though the game keeps it mostly reasonable.\n\nI did run into a very frequent bug where the dialog options window was misaligned, sometimes dropping options off the bottom of the screen, but it never impeded the game.  There were also one or two occasions where certain subtitles were displayed in German.\n\nDeponia is definitely a good game and stands by itself, though it is designed as a trilogy and buying all three games can be a bit of an investment for adventure games.  If you want good adventure games though, it's probably worth the price.","February 24, 2014","true","10.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I’m always on board for ye old point-and-click adventure, and Deponia knows it predecessors.  It forgets, however, that their fan base is now living the year 2014.  You know, where annoying manboy protagonists are not at all endearing.  Manboy Rufus is bad enough without his town of whiners. Every character you speak with has to either insult Rufus or recall some stupid thing he’s done in the past. Everyone.  I put two hours in before I found a kernel of a plot that didn’t involve someone proclaiming Rufus as a failure or the ginger-haired damsel in distress that fell from the sky. Her name is Goal, by the way, and, she’s spent most of my playthrough unconscious. Rufus claims that Goal belongs to him and that he will save her. The only other female character is Rufus’ roommate/ex-girlfriend, who’s your typical, annoying girlfriend that never stops complaining.\n\nThe puzzles are solid, I’ll give it that.  I found a few head scratchers.  I even laughed a couple of times. But, after a few hours of the game, I couldn’t deal with Rufus and his friends.  The story seemed to be circling the disappearance of Rufus’ father, the former mayor that abandoned him years ago. I wanted more of that and less of Rufus’ attempts to woo the woman in the tight jumpsuit.","June 27, 2014","false","5.1"," 37 of 62 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","37","62","0","0"

Boy, I was in for it when I started playing Deponia.\n\nThis game is really tricky.  "Tricky" meaning that it's difficult to know exactly what to do all the time.  Some tasks are easy to figure out while others are extremely random.  Often, I was stuck wondering how anyone could have figured out what to do without exhausting every possible option beforehand.  However, I liked this aspect of the game because if it was too easy, you would be able to finish it pretty quickly.  If you are an achievement hunter, this game is pretty easy to 100% with some help from gamesaves and/or backtracking.\n\nAnother thing I liked about this game was the art.  I really liked the different areas and animations of the game.  I enjoyed discovering new areas and going into all the rooms, ect.\n\nThe story line was alright, I was curious enough to keep playing it but not curious enough to purchase the sequel.  What really killed this game was the characters.  Although Rufus changed a bit towards the end, his personality in the beginning really put me off.  I almost found the game unplayable with his ever constant nagging about literally everything, and the way he talked about and viewed women.  There were likable characters in the game, but Rufus took a dump on all of them and made some pretty mean jokes.  Maybe his character in the sequel improves and this is all just about his ~*~character development~*~, but I wouldn't purchase the sequel at full price after listening to him for one game.","January 11","false","9.6"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","27","44","3","0"

The world of Deponia is interesting. This great junk planet is not only a bit unique, but it is also beautifully rendered. A junk planet full of scrappy, adaptable people should be a great setting for an adventure game, right? Well...right. But that game is not Deponia. Lets take a look at those other three categories...\n\nStory. Can't have a good adventure game without a good story. Unfortunately for Deponia, it didn't ship with a great story. While it starts off well enough, the plot becomes a bit predictable and uninteresting. Some reviewers have even complained about an undercurrent of misogyny in the game. My take? I can certainly see what those reviewers are talking about, but I'm not going to go into that here. Lets just say that there are few women in the game. Of those women: one gets naked, one is unconcious for 90% of the game, and the other is a man. And the unconcious one? Getting her and winning her over is the goal of the game. Her name? Goal. Clever.\n\nPuzzles. Some are good, but most fall into the "meh" or unintuitive category. Puzzles don't have to be unintuitive to be wacky or challenging. It's a cheat, and a poor one at that.\n\nCharacters...well...they're forgettable. That's not the worst crime though. The worst crime is that the main character - the one you should be made to empathize with (or at least get a good laugh out of) is actually irratating and unlikeable. Rufus, who is supposed to be a likeable slacker with a sharp wit and an inflated ego often comes off as posessing a grating personality with few likeable qualities. The puns? Bad...in a bad way. A few might be amusing, but the rest are either cringeworthy or fall flat.\n\nMy recommendation: Skip it or wait to pick it up in a bundle on the cheap - and only if you're desperate.","May 9, 2015","false","6.9"," 56 of 99 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","56","99","0","0"

Read with caution.]\n\nI don't think I have words to describe this game.\n\nI don't think I am even capable of remotely justifying how much I loved every second of my Deponia playthrough.\n\nThis is the kind of game I had been needing for a long time. Not because of its genre. Because of its charm. Its passion and attention to detail. Its... OK, you get the point.\n\nYou play as Rufus, a despicable inhabitant of the massive wasteland that is Deponia, and a damn cool character all around. No matter how many messes he has and is still getting into, you will definitely take his side in every confront of the game - because, well, it's him who you're rooting for since the beginning! This, blended with the game's very lively sense of humour and the intelligent puzzles that come along the way, make for an outstanding experience in Rufus' egotistical point of view.\n\nIt's difficult not to love Goal. She is adorable even while in her unfortunate damaged status, and becomes even more lovable after waking up and realising what is going on. On a more personal side, perhaps I may have connected her far too much to someone I love - but let's not get that in the way, shall we? At least for now.\n\nOverall, this... game? Wait, scratch that. To classify Deponia as a simple "game" is to insult this masterpiece of humour, storytelling and cringe-inducing moments.\nSo, if you're not even remotely interested in getting it for you and giving it a go, I'd recommend checking your brain activity and blood pressure.

You play as Rufus, a selfish and slightly empty minded tinkerer who wishes only to leave the junkyard he calls home. Well, the planet he lives on is a junkyard.\n\nDid you know if you double click a location you don't have to walk to it? I didn't, you should probably do the tutorial.\n\nI found the characters hard to like and the protagonist even harder to enjoy. He acts like a childish pig and makes for really cringe dialogue when talking to his ex girlfriend. I also found that there was too much highlight on the protagonist, making you fall out of the story every time he opens his mouth.\n\nThe puzzles follow little logic, often being very hard to follow and require the use of a walkthrough if you don't want to go insane.

For that price, I would definitely recommend it. At a much higher price, I wouldn't. But I don't want to base my recommendation on price, and since I wouldn't play the sequels even for free, I'm gonna go with "not recommended".\n\nIf you like humorous 2D point-and-click adventures, Deponia might be for you. It combines a fresh setting with "industry"-standard storytelling and mechanics. I liked the artwork a lot and the protagonist, Rufus, is quite enjoyable.\n\nThere are a lot of things I didn't like, however. First off, it aims for the classics, but the writing is not remotely as good (with a some exceptions). A few times the humour is so forced that I couldn't help but feel remote shame, as in "did they really think anyone would find this funny?"\n\nMost of the quests and puzzles are straight-forward. But some of the puzzles are just aggravating. We've all been there, trying anything with everything in the inventory, to no avail. Or clicking different levers to see the desired effect. But some stuff in Deponia is just completely non-sensical and drove me mad. I admit I had to look into a walkthrough a few times, and mentally flipped the finger towards the developers a few times once I'd found out how something was supposed to work.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there are 2 things I found wildly inappropriate for a 2012 title, especially if it's published at (almost) full price: #1, the animations. You will see a lot of generic "empty hand movements" when you do stuff with things. I found this particularly disappointing given how much love went into the artwork otherwise. #2, lots of interactions will just yield the same line over and over again. For instance, when you are trying one specific item in your inventory with every other item, you'll hear the same crappy joke over and over again. Very tiring.\n\nOverall, I would say Deponia shows lots of promise, but some aspects are just disappointing and frustrating.","June 18, 2015","false","6.5"," 59 of 108 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","59","108","0","0"

I played through the game without object highlighting, because only a defeated man makes use of that particular button of cowardice. Visually, Deponia excels. The characters and environments are consistently good throughout the entire game. While the humor does fall flat at times, the overall tone and presentation of the game harkens back to a time I remember with nostalgia. Rufus, the main protagonist in the game, is a deeply flawed character. He’s not a hero, but he’s persistent, goal orientated (haha), and in a weird way, endearing. And the puzzles. Modern adventure gaming, I feel, has become too streamlined and simplistic. Objects in many of the newer games have obvious purposes and the puzzles are too easy. This is not the case with Deponia, at least initially. The first “act” of the game takes place in a town filled with interesting objects to interact with and puzzles whose solutions are not readily apparent, but still approachable.\n\nHowever, the quality of the puzzles, and to some degree, the game itself, degrades when you progress to the “second” and “third” acts. Certainly, Deponia gets progressively worse, as the environments become more linear, and the puzzles become more of a chore than an engaging game play element. That’s not to say that the more advanced stages lack puzzles that will give you some pause, they just don’t have very many of them. Without spoiling too much, the story and characters seem to suffer the same depreciation in quality to an extent. Furthermore, there’s a mini-game type puzzle at the end of the second portion of the game where I encountered a glitch that would not let me proceed, even though I had the correct solution. Luckily, I received a steam achievement upon configuring the solution, so I was able to overcome this glitch after several repetitions using the same configuration.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Deponia to any fans of old adventure gaming, because many of its more charming elements have their roots in the old titles. I like the environments, puzzles, the artistic direction, and many of the characters. It is not a perfect game, nor is it the best in the genre, but if you can pick it up for half of its retail price, the game is worth looking into if you like point and click adventures.","February 7, 2014","true","14.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The art and animations are nice, the setting is pretty interesting and the voice acting is decent.\n\nThe puzzles can get on the cryptic side, but I was able to get through all but one of them without looking at a hint. Somebody that is new to, or doesn't really like point-and-click games might have some trouble with them though.\n\nNow for the reasons I don't recommend the game.\n\nFirst of all, the protagonist is pretty unlikeable. At first his behavior seems like it's being played up for laughs, or that it's a set up for future character development. Eventually you'll realize that nope, He's just a terrible person, and it's not funny.\n\nThis is a big problem when often the protagonist is the driving force behind the player getting past puzzles and finishing the game. Maybe this will change in the sequels.\n\nSecondly, this game is pretty unpleasant throughout. There is a lot of sexism, mean-spirited jokes and uncomfortable implications throughout the game, all seemingly in an effort to make the player laugh.\n\nSome people might think I'm being oversensitive about this, but I'm absolutely not. It is there and it is blatant. The fact that none of these jokes are even clever or funny makes it that much worse.\n\nDespite the game being decent art/mechanics wise, I really can't recommend this.\n\ntl;dr","April 12, 2014","false","0.1"," 38 of 69 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","38","69","0","0"

I mean, it was a good point-and-clicker. The puzzles worked, and were neither totally illogical nor too easy. Probably the only reason I played it through to the end was because the puzzles were compelling. The world-building is very thorough and clever. The story was decent, but predictable, and brought down by the characters. Deponia is a fun setting that deserves a better story and characters happening in it. The one-liners sometimes got a chuckle from me, but...\n\nMy two big complaints: First, the main character is not likeable in the least. They tried to write him a sarcastic, misunderstood oddball, but instead he's just a filthy, self-centered, misogynist jerk. He has a few decent one-liners, but he has remarkably few redeeming qualities beyond that. And hanging a lampshade on it by having literally every other character in the game also hate him doesn't actually make it better, and in some ways it makes it worse.\nSecond, what is with the rampant misogyny? The female protagonist (if you can call her that) is comatose for almost the entire game, and is treated as nothing more than an inconveniently large inventory item for most of it. Heck, one of the early scenes, she's basically being auctioned off (while comatose) by the mayor of the town to the men of the town to do what they like with her, and the major puzzle sequence is how the main character can eliminate his competitors to claim her as his possession. Heck, her name is Goal. She's a prize, not a person, for the entire game. And the only other female character in the game is the stereotypical violent, incessantly nagging ex, entirely one-dimensional, just one sitcom joke about her nagging after another. Is that all women are, Daedalic? Either pliant, helpless, brain-dead prizes to be won or violent nagging shrews? I think you can do better.\n\nLong story short, if clever puzzles and thorough world-building are enough to carry you through a game, go ahead and get/play this one. If you're just really into point-and-click adventure for the sake of a good puzzle (like me), get it on at least 50% discount, and it might be worth your time. Otherwise, I'd pass this one up.\n\nMaybe the sequel will be better.","November 19, 2014","false","11.0"," 82 of 154 people (53%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","53","82","154","11","9"

This game is breaks all the rules. Without going into too much detail and spoiling the whole thing, I would just like to say that I found myself enjoying a game that I thought I would hate. The opening sequence (not the tutorial) should have been a key indicator of what was about to go down. The humor plays a huge role in this game. Although not outrageously funny, it provided a few chuckles on occasion. The art style is not my favorite, but I also admit that this particular game would not have been as good without that particular style. The puzzles were a key piece to making the game. I did find a few moments throughout the game where I was unsure what to do next. The game is good at letting you know what needs to be done, but not necessarily how it is to be done. Even so, I found a majority of the puzzles had a good balance. They were neither too hard nor too easy and they always seemed have a unique variety to them. Although on the outside the game might seem like a pile of garbage, the game has so much more to offer. The story (not the greatest, but pretty well thought out), the music (you'll see what I mean), the locations (Kuvaq was one of my favorites), the puzzles (probably the best thing about the game) will all transport you to Deponia and unlike Rufus you won't want to leave!\n\n"Huzzah, you should buy this game!"\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","July 11, 2014","true","12.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you enjoy point and click games then you'll enjoy this one, I guess. There's an undercurrent of misogyny throughout the game, not too big of an issue but it is bothersome at times. The three girls in the entire game consist of an unconcious love interest who's name is Goal (yes, really), a drag queen used for purely comedic effect, and the ex girlfriend, a '♥♥♥♥♥' and several other lovely names who appears nude for no actual reason.\n\nThe puzzles aren't too difficult, and while some can be too easy they give you something to do other than wait for your character to walk across screen at the same, slow, unchangeable pace playing fetch.\nI bought this game when it was on sale for maybe a dollar or so, and I think it's about worth that.

Using peas as bait to catch a toothbrush. Fuuuuuuu\n- Silly puzzles.  Place detonation marks based on the resemblance of the hats and rooftops.

I... I... don't know. I don't know what to say about Deponia.\n\nIt's got some hilarious writing, especially for an adventure game, and I got through most of it without a walkthrough, so those are some good points.\n\nThe art in the game is spectacular. Like, really spectacular... until you get to the cutscenes, where they look like strewn-together flash animations. It still looks good enough that I can let it pass.\n\nBut... there's something about when the game says it's going to sit down, shut up, and be serious when it feels like something's amiss. The game just... can't be serious. Too much silly stuff is going on.\n\nI really like the way the game presents itself, as sort of a set of 3 open-world-y "scenes" where you have to work out the puzzles throughout each scene, and get to see the place turn to chaos as you slowly manipulate everything for your personal gain. It also fits the protagonist very well. Hell, the protagonist is basically the epitome of adventure game protagonists. He's basically how an AGP would actually act. He's actually kind of annoying to play as sometimes for that reason, but it kind of delivers with him a message about the genre. It's silly, and really shows Daedalic's writing style.\n\nI just feel like there's so much about the world we haven't been informed about though. I guess that's why Deponia is a trilogy, but it feels a tinge too short to make it worth being released in a trilogy.\n\nThe game is weird and silly and a whole lot of fun and hilarity, but it's just the ending that makes it fall flat, when you realize you've hit the ending and there's quite a few loose ends to tie up in the later sequels,\n\nI adore the setting in the game. It's beautiful, and I so badly want to explore it more. All the little eccentricities of the world really show itself off. Daedalic seems to be absolutely god-tier at worldbuilding, and if you really like a world that feels like it's full of life, you should check out this game. Heck, the stellar worldbuilding gets you so attached to the world that it makes a later twist in the game all that much more impactful. Too bad our protagonist doesn't share the same views.\n\nI'll probably amend this if I ever get the other games in the series, but right now Deponia is standing as "a pretty good adventure game". I do recommend it, but be warned that what you're getting into is a little below par.","November 16, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Deponia has a simple history and goal: you are Rufus, you hate your planet and wants to leave it. That's it. However, don't think that leaving your literaly trash planet will be simple. You will have to think, explore, realize things and be creative. You will find yourself in situations like "WTF DO I DO WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS PARROT, A LAUGH GAS BALLOON, A DENTIST DRILLING MACHINE AND THIS DEVICE THAT CHANGES THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE PLANET??" that will drive you crazy and curious.

I can't remember the last time I actualy read every single line of a game, if I ever did. Every single line of 3 games, in this case. Once you get familiar with Rufus, you laugh your whole way through... he is one of the best heroes ever... characters... anti-heroes... imaginary world threats... whatever.\n\nI hate to admit it but I had to read a walkthrough once in Chaos on Deponia and once in Goodbye Deponia because there's one particular situation in each of them that requires unusual solutions, which is great and in my opinion should be all over adventure games... but I couldn't figure them out, and now I hate myself. (Maybe if they ocurred more often we'd be ready for it... I tend to assume the game bugged... but, sadly, no, it didn't)\n\nOther than the dying/permanently screwing up your game that was possible in old Sierra games (although it is possible in one point), I think everything you can hope for in an adventure game is here, specially in Goodbye Deponia. A bit of Day of the Tentacle, some Full-Throttle's-end-like parts, and...\n\nTHE MINIGAMES! I almost forgot about them... mini-games, puzzles, call it what you will. Lots of them throughout the series, very creative, very interesting. Daedalic team was really inspired-- those guys are good and they sure put a lot of effort into this stuff.\n\nAnother thing is that instead of things declining by the end of the game (series), which I feel happening quite often these days, in the Deponia it ramps up nicely.\n\nIt is hard to compare against adventure games' golden age classics such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island 1-2 and Day of the Tentacle-- which in my idealized childhood memory are unbeatable-- but, from the adventure games I've played in the last 15-20 years or so, I'd say the Deponia Series is the best.\n\nEach game has several achievements that, if you want, you will have to go after on purpose. I left several behind, having no idea whatsoever of how to get/how did I miss them but they are there, and you can fry your brain further if you dare chase them all.\n\nDamn... now that I think of it, along with the achievements I probably also missed some good lines...\n\nLast and least, there's a con, which you may not see as one: you can hold the spacebar down to show all interactive spots on the screen. I hate that, it feels like cheating... and it's right there, so easy to use that I end up doing so.\n\nPut shortly, if you like adventure games, I say definitely get this one (these three).","September 16, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Oh, and she has a removable chip in her head, lives in a floating palace in the sky, and has the power to blow up the entire planet. No, this isn't the most conventional of love stories, but such wackiness is befitting for a game that is as much about providing oodles of comic relief as it is about telling the tale of two lost souls.","April 12","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not only is it hillarious from start to finish. It is also incredibly challenging. You really have to think outside the box for some of these, but at the same time it makes sense, just like in Sam and Max. So you will find yourself explaining your reasoning for solving a puzzle to someone who doesn't play this, to only get a facial expression thrown back at you that says "What on earth are you on??" Lol. The mechanics are very old school, which is great, and definately hark back to the early DOS days. Being able to bring the items menu up and down via the mouse wheel is pure genius, and gives me a great sense of pleasure every time I do it.The visuals are gorgeous. Every landscape and character you see is very sharp and clean, with loads of colour and detail. The script, storyline, characters, songs, music and voice acting is phenomenal! The humour is very adult so I'd steer younger kids away from this (It's not Deadpool or anything but there's the odd bit of language and double entendre and it can get a little dark in places). This game had me hooked from start to finish. Even though I had to break away from and come back to it occasionally when I got stuck. Getting stuck was definately the most frustrating thing about this game, because you'd get a real head scratcher, not be able to solve it for a while, but really want to know what happens in the story. Still I don't think I would change anything about this game. Amazing. Would definately recommend it and am looking forward to playing the next installment 'Chaos on Deponia'.","May 14","true","16.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then once you figure out that you had about half of the solution right but you didn't figure out the rest of it, you'll feel really stupid at not realizing that you were supposed to send a baloon up a chimney and that you spent probably about half an hour before you caved and looked at a walkthrough that made it seem oh-so-obvious.\n\nAdventure games rule.

I like the story, the humor, the voice acting, and the artistic style they've used for the graphics. The puzzles aren't too easy. Most of them are not too challenging to the point you just start grinding your teeth. The puzzles aren't bad. I've not come across anything like that horrid rain dance in the Book of Unwritten Tales yet, which is less a puzzle than it is an exercise in frustration. That required you to tap the keys given in a list that scrolls down the screeen. The list speeds up as you go along so if you're terrible at things that require precise timing or have painful arthritis problems in your hands that stiffen your fingers like I do, a puzzle like that can quickly render a game unplayable. Thankfully, there's nothing like that here in Deponia.\n\nSome of the puzzle solutions are obvious so if you like a constant challenge you may be disappointed. What I definitely find aggravating though is that some of the solutions bear no resemblance to logic at all and I found myself seeking hints. There were a couple points where I resorted to walkthroughs because the solutions made no sense whatsoever and I'd have never figured it out in a million years. I've also been tripped up by the related problem of some of the puzzles not using the logical and, to me, obvious answer and like I've mentioned before, using instead an alternate solution that makes no sense. It would be nice if I could use an alternate solution I see instead of being locked into the one the developers thought of.\n\nStill, those are the only drawbacks and while they are occasionally frustrating they haven't ruined the experience for me. I got enough enjoyment out of the game that I still consider this a good purchase and I have no regrets. I enjoyed the story and can't wait to play the other two games in the series.","January 16, 2014","true","43.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yet the first instalment, for the most part, is just another good adventure game, nothing more.\n\nThe protagonist, Rufus, is a stereotypical egocentric jerk who just wants to achieve his one goal in life (leave his home for good), no matter how much grief it causes to everyone around him. When the other main character, Goal from the (literally) upper society drops into his life, he sees her only as a ticket out… but eventually gets entangled in a much larger plot, which– the game being the first part of a trilogy– naturally ends in a cliffhanger.\nWhat makes this often seen story stereotype work is the writing. The dialogues are perfect from Rufus’ self-centric monologues to the sarcastic responses he gets from everyone else; the characters may be simple, but they have a good synergy.\n\nThe puzzles are what one expects from a point ‘n’ click: mostly inventory and map hotspot manipulation, with a few occasional (and skippable) minigames. The difficulty is moderate; if you know how adventure game logic works, you shouldn’t have problems– except for maybe the middle segment, which require some trial and error.\n\nAs a final word: the trilogy was re-released as a single game, making these individual titles somewhat obsolete… unless you want to play the famous drugglejug mode, which was never implemented in the Complete Edition.","June 8, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And it was fun at first.\n\nBUT: Then came the Adventuring part. Taking everything you see, trying to combine it and somehow figure out how to use something on something else. At first I've tried to figure everything by myself. Later I've started to look at the guide, here and there. And after a while I've found myself looking at it more or less constantly.

I loved all the art in this. The backgrounds were very interesting, detailed, and beutifully portrayed a wide variety of the many towns cities landscapes, and other areas of this trash-heap of a planet. The character designs had this simplistic "kiddy" style that I found particularyly appealing. I think that the characters designs were pretty effective in expressing each characer wtih a huge variety of characters of many shapes, sizes, and postures. The art of the game, while playing, overall reminded me of pajamasam, being a point-and-click adventure with upbeat, "kiddy" looking characters in combination with a vast world of many areas drasticly differeing from one another in tone and atmosphere.\n\nNow with gamplay, well... Puzzles in this game, thinking back now, where ususally ridiculously hard to solve. I was stuck several times only to look at a walkthrough only to find that the answer makes me think "how in the world was I supposed to figure THAT out." Without the walkthrough I porbably would not have finished the game. I already spent like a good hour sitting there trying to think of answers. I did NOT have the patience of trying EVERYTHING on EVERYTHING so it was either use my own logic to its most abstract limits or the walkthrough. There were sometimes were I was on a roll in solving puzzels and that was pretty satisfying.\n\nThe voice acting was pretty decent. It sure beats Dream. My friend told me he quickly got tired of Rufus' voice but I wasn't too bothered. I was pretty invested in the story. The story was the otherthing besides the art that kept me playing. It has some cool twists and reveals that suprised me. Aand I think the ending of the trilogy beats Mass Efect's.\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has good humour, nice exploration and beautiful illustrative artwork (think MI3). Downsides are that you're launched straight into a tutorial, rather than given time to watch the scene be set; in addition, the voice recordings aren't great in that a) the artists haven't received full direction, so sometimes they stress the wrong word and ruin the joke, and b) there isn't enough variety in responses. The game is also fairly short but is actually a lot longer than most, and definitely longer than your average Indie game. In all, really, really good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orlandeau993/recommended/214340/","orlandeau993","Voice of Reason","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orlandeau993/","991 products in account","Deponia aims to be quirky to sets itself apart from many of its kind. It has however fail in many different aspects:\n\n1. Characters: In a story-driven game such as this, the characters are far from memorable. Each one seems to try its upmost effort to sound sarcastic, cynical or downright idiotic to an extent that it fails to deliver an exciting blend of characters. Don’t get me wrong, I love characters that make a fool of themselves (e.g. Rincewind from Discworld) but what Rufus tried to portray feels way too forced. Instead of the light, bite-sized comedy pieces that I was expecting, I witnessed sloppy production and narrations. Granted, there were some funny moments, but it is difficult to give proper credit given the rarity of such occasion.\n\n2. Puzzle: Again, another essential element to a point-and-click game. This is the major flaw of the game. I give huge leeway to such games where logic and questionable detours need to be taken or when pesky puzzle elements are involved that somehow blocks the progress of the game simply to discover that it makes little sense. Deponia is King of this behaviour right here.\n\n3. Artwork: Despite the fact that I am not a fan of this kind of artwork, I must say this is where Deponia shines the most, the artwork of its kind is downright stunning, exuding a very unique feel towards the world of Deponia.\n\n4. Music: Passable music, though there are some memorable ones. This, together with artwork, ensures a great thematic feel of its kind.\n\nProblems: As of 11th May 2013 a bug exists in the middle of the game where you will be stuck and unable to continue. I find this very mind-boggling that such a bug could have existed until now. This needs immediate repair.\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of point and click game, this game might be worth it, otherwise, stay clear away.\n","May 11, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For me the games biggest strength have to be it´s quite humorous tone which is especially notable in the often hillarious dialogues filled with sarcasm. It should be noted that the main protagonist Rufus is not a very likeable character, he´s actually an excellent example of the 'anti-hero', which might put some people of but I myself found it refereshing to play as a flawed character instead of the usual Paragon.\n\nThe graphics and especially the backgrounds are really nice and the character models are not far behind. The Audio is excellent and especially the Bard theme during some of the cutscenes. The puzzles are varied in difficulty which I like but all those who where tougher to crack had some form hints often found in dialouges with characters nearby. The puzzles also have a 'skip' option for those who find them annoying and want to get on with the story which is nice I guess.\n\nOne final notice is that the 'silly mode' called Droggeljug which is needed in order to get the final achievement for 100 % is super annoying and I would actually go against my usual view and recommend to 'cheat' in order to get it. Having to play another full playtrough with no dialouges in a game based on dialogue was not a very bright idea by Daedalic in my opinion but it´s a minor flaw in a otherwise great game.\n\nI fully recommend buying this although the full price of 19,99 € might be a tad to much considering the lack of replayability but at a -50 % or better discount it´s definatly a good buy.","November 26, 2015","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The person making it is trying to be witty, creative, yet logical at the same time with the item combinations and just miss by a long shot.\nI’m fairly sure any point and click adventure fan has had this from time to time. There is always a moment or two you ask yourself… “Well, how was I seriously supposed to figure out that you had to put the chicken in the blender to get egg yolk, use that yolk with a daisy to make a cake, eat the cake and fart out the key to why I’m stuck.”\nMy point being, the solutions aren’t always as obvious as they might think. I was very glad to find that Deponia isn’t like that. It’s consistently logically throughout the whole game.\nAdmittedly, I did get stuck a few times, but it was more of a “how DIDN’T I get that?” rather than a “how did they think that made sense?”\n\nThe Art style in Deponia is beautiful. A planet consisting of junk has never looked so good.\nThe animation, music, voice acting and humour are all great to. There is a real charm about the characters and the little witty things that they say, that makes this game all that much more enjoyable. Which, talking of voice acting, reminds me…\n\nDroggeljug mode!\n\nI finished this game, looked back on the achievements I had left to get and I thought…\n…This is going to be interesting.\n\nWell, I never knew that Droggeljug mode would be as painful as it was. Finishing the game unlocks a new mode, where everything and anything that anyone says ever, comes out: “Droggeljug!”\nNow this is amusing all of a 10 second period, but after that it is quite painful. They say it in the same tone of voice every time. You may get the odd “Droggeljug?”, but apart from that it is fairly robotic. That being said it was still a funny little thing that they added which I thought was quite unique.\nI can imagine that this mode would make it a lot more challenging to play through if I didn’t literally just finish the game and still have everything fresh in my mind. Due to parts in the story where you need to note where the chat options are to get what you want off of them. (E.g. a character quiz’s you before they’ll give you a key, and all you have is a list of Droggeljugs for answers)\nIt’s a challenging achievement, but a fun one. Despite that a lot of people probably muted it because the noise drove them crazy, I left it on low. Just to keep reminding me how ridiculous what I was doing really was.\n\nAll in all, I love this game, it’s great. I can’t wait to start the next part in the story.\n\n\nTL;DR : Logical item combinations, engaging story, great humour, wonderful art and definitely a must have for any point and click adventure game lover.\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Chaos on Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/220740\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Goodbye Deponia:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/241910","November 23, 2013","true","20.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"

If any of these pillars suffers it could entirely break the game and make a bland if not a terrible experience. This is what happened in Deponia with its narrative that just utterly failed the game's mostly good puzzle and aesthetic design. I just found that I was never engaged with the protagonist or the overall narrative which lead me to simply turn off the game on multiple occasions because I just got bored of the entire affair. The worst part was that even when I finally did finish the game I was given that utterly vapid void of an ending that brings closure to nothing and essentially demands that I play the next Deponia game to get a better picture of the narrative, which just isn't going to happen when I couldn't give a rats ♥♥♥ about anything going on to begin with.  I definitely saw the potential in Deponia and I saw the reasons people like it, but I can't in good conscious bring myself to anything other than warn people not to play this game. This is something that I hate to do to game's since I'm a big adherent to the philosophy that a game can be good regardless of how long it is, but for 19.99 a six hour experience just isn't good value for money for the player and that isn't acceptable in my opinion especially when its a mediocre experience at best.\n\nIf you want to read a more detailed review you can find it over here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/07/deponia.html.","July 30, 2014","false","6.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The puzzles and adventures were discouragingly random-- for instance you finally find clean drinking water but Rufus doesn't want anything to do with *that* water, and you have to find completely new water? It's just complicated for the sake of being complicated, instead of being challengingly fun.\n\nThe storyline was all right, but the characters were pretty insufferable. I'm all for having a protagonist that we love to hate, but there wasn't really anything truly clever in Rufus' constant snark--it was more "emo goth kid" than "Louis CK." The dialogues were pointlessly long, and I wish they didn't automatically re-activate the entire exchange when you click on people and things again. Can I just hover over an inventory item to see a description instead of hearing three sentences about it over and over?\n\nI wish the ending was a little more fulfilling, since I'm not sure I'll go on to the sequels.\nDefinitely prefered Memoria by the same studios.","April 17","false","13.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I suppose that's how most are going to be picking this up.\n\nBut this game did not inspire me to play the rest of the series. Didn't enjoy it enough.\n\nThe game is a classic point'n-click, with all the hallmarks of the genre. The humour, collecting things, rubbing things together to make new things, list-based dialogue trees and "quirky" characters. So If you have nostalgia for these sort of games, you may enjoy it more. But I grew up in a different era, and while I enjoyed some of the monkey island games for their kickass music, this game doesn't quite have the same sort of charm. It also brings along the thing that ruined my enjoyment of the game: the adventure game logic. I played this game with a guide open in another window, and I have some shame for that, but I spent maybe two hours of play time stuck on various puzzles, and that just isn't my idea of a good time. One unintuitive puzzle would be an anomily, but more than three is more like poor design.\n\nThe Visual are, well, lopsided. from the stills and the promotional art, you might thing that the game looks pretty good. in action though, the animation is really basic, with a minimum number of frames used to convey movement, and a limited number of facial expressions. Voice acting is also decent overall, with few standout performances for better or for worse.\n\nAnd the story.... well, the writing has some pretty good moments, but on the whole it still often fails to entertain. I will still give the game credit for the writing of Rufus, the MC. A lot of games try to go for a "scoundrel" type of main character, who's somehow a rebel who doesn't play by the rules, but also has a heart of gold, but here they bring the contradiction in that type of hero to it's logical conclusion: Because he acts like typical adventure game character, the other charcters see Rufus as a useless, kleptomaniac, harebrained and unpleasant person, while he sees himself as "too good" to live among them. I would say his defining character moment is when he has an arguement with his ex-girlfriend (who still houses and feeds him) to get the key to her first aid kit, from which he takes some tranquilizer which he uses to  come back, drug her and steal her stuff. Having Rufus be a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is what's important for him to have any real character developement.\n\nAs for the side characters, some get laughs, and some get groans, and some are simple plot devices. Unfortunately, the latter category includes the series female lead, Goal (seriously?) who is the cornerstone of the plot for the whole game, yet doesn't say anything meaningful to make you invested in her.\n\nAll in all, Deponia is only recommended to the fans of this particular genre, and especially hard puzzles. For the uninitiated, the game can be frustrating.","June 14, 2015","false","8.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

In all the technical forms it's a decent point-and-click adventure, but it just fails in every aspect story-wise.\n\nYou play an extremely unlikeable character, which I suppose you can write off for the sake of "you always play a good guy, be bad for once" kind of thinking. The humour is crude and cringeworthy, e.g. you drug your Nagging Sexist Trope Ex-Girlfriend and innocent cats, while the game tries to play it off as humouristic. What made me grind me teeth most of all was the Really Just A Man In A Dress Trope trans woman at the Town Hall. Ha ha. High quality humour, am I right? I absolutely love laughing at people who are already dying at such a high rate. Ha ha ha. Ha.\n\nOnly to top off all of that with Ms. Goal; a mostly (in a way) absent main character who is a prize you're essentially fighting for. She is literally nothing but a Goal. An empty character that you are trying to conquer. This game had the potential to be pretty good and enjoyable, but at every twist and turn it opts in on gross writing. Even if you ignore the crude and lazy "humour", the story still remains flatter than an open bottle of coke you left in your fridge for 2 weeks. Disappointing. I don't understand why this game is so loved by many.","June 12, 2015","false","3.0"," 36 of 70 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","36","70","3","1"

While I have played point-n-click games previously, it was back when I was in elementary school before I received the original (brick) GameBoy. The settings and graphics were unique while the animation and voice-acting were better than expected.\n\nWhile I personally could care less about Rufus' (Protagonist/Main Character) attitude and personality, I will admit that this game did have me laughing at some points due to the pitfalls he encountered. Yes, his comebacks are terrible and oft a pun, but the storyline kept me interested enough to continue playing to see how things panned out.\n\nThe first playthrough took about eight to nine hours to complete. The second one was quicker though challenging since I enabled "Droggeljug" effect (turn off your speech sound lest you go nuts from hearing it so much) and had to guess often as to which response I was clicking on.\n\nAll-in-all, would I recommend Deponia?

He does show character growth through the game, but it's only realized in the ending. Maybe. Most of the game he is just really a jerk in a way that's obivously meant to be over the top and slap stick, but wears out its welcome pretty quickly. I am going to try the sequel - I am  hopeful that the main character does improve.\n\nI would NOT recommend this game for someone trying out adventure games for the first time, or trying them again after a time away. It's not that this is a bad game - it's very solid in many aspects - but that main character is going to be very off-putting to some people.","June 30, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Droggeljug!)\n\n+ The adventure lasted me about two or three days of gameplay.\n\n+/- The puzzles are doable and somewhat "easy" at first, but as the game progresses the puzzles do get more difficult and all around brain aching, though still enjoyable (most of the time).\n\n+/- The music is catchy but somewhat repetitive.\n\n+/- Conversations are not always helpful, but most always funny and add laughable moments and many, many references.\n\n+/- Locations vary, at some you stay for what feels like the longest time and there is a lot to explore, others are small and frustrating because there's not much to do in them and yet you get stuck in them in what feels like forever.\n\n+/- Characters are rather boring and go through NO development what so ever. Rufus stays stupid, Toni stays angry, Wenzel stays annoying &  Goal is just boobs on legs.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and will recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good point click adventure, though not for the full price.

The captions have some spelling errors, the voice acting occasionally falls flat, and the puzzles both halt the game's pacing, and sometimes serve to frustrate the player. Not many times, mind you, but there are a few that will make you ask, "Really?"\n\nSo, why do I like the game? Well, I love adventure games, and Deponia is a nice throwback to the 90s halcyon days. Even the lead character, Rufus, feels like Guybrush Threepwood (Monkey Island). Actually, he feels more like a mix of Futurama's Fry and Bender, if that makes any sense.\n\nOf course, Deponia fans know what Rufus is really like: Herpes. Or, should I say, "a cooler version of herpes."\n\nThe trilogy goes on sale fairly often, so I'd say wait for a deal and scoop up all three.

It has its share of tedious puzzles but most of them are good and makes sense (not a la Discworld). The story is good enough although very linear (we can argue a story is always linear :p ) in my opinion. We are far from games or stories such as the Longest Journey or Monkey Island.\n\nThe recommended inventory system using the mouse wheel is extremely good and works very well, you can also hit the space bar at anytime to highlight every clickable objects in an area and the hand drawn graphics are really fantastic.\n\nI noticed a few bugs here and there, some of the clickable objects would eventually become non-clickable, and sometimes, the dialogue options are sometime off screen (probably not optimized for my resolution ?). The dialogues are well written and the actors did a great work in my opinion but the sound is not normalized very well making it sometime an inaudible mess.\n\nFinally, I want to mention that Rufus (the hero) goofiness only worked halfway for me. He is very one dimensional and his lines became very repetitive quickly. Some other characters such as Toni, Kuvac's mayor or Lotti are just more interesting making the world of Deponia a very believable one.\n\nIf you can go through all the above, then yes, I think you will like Deponia.","April 29, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(just my opinion)\n\nA fantastic game with a unique cast of characters and beautifully drawn sceneries. The story itself, beneath the cartoonish appearance, was actually quite intriguing and compelling at times, though admittedly hindered by tedious game pacing (a good example being spending easily 30+ minutes simply making a espresso.). Playing while reading a walkthrough is probably a good idea unless you intend to be in it for the long haul.\n\nThe voice acting I particularly enjoyed; I did notice it did not always sync (particularly in the earlier parts of the game), something which bothered me- but it was nonetheless enjoyable to listen to the voiced dialogue anyways. Even for "supporting" characters I found the voice acting to be rather spot-on.\n\nContent-wise the game seemed rather sparse, but it was consistently enjoyable from beginning to end.","September 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So how does Deponia measure up?\n\nTo begin with I very much like the art style. It's got 2D fully animated characters with some pretty nice painted backgrounds. Everything's easy to move around and interact with. Thankfully you can double click to instant-move to a location.\n\nMusic is serviceable. I like to think of it as elevator music. It's there, and you notice it, but it won't stick, may irritate after a while, and you'd probably rather listen to your own music.\n\nThe story is all right. The main character is perhaps a little too genuinely self-centered, but he gets better... somewhat... I think...\n\nThe game's humor falls a bit on the flat side, which is a shame. I don't think I had a laugh out loud moment, just some grins here and there. I was willing to ignore it though, in order to find out what happens next. I admit I'm more than curious as to what is going on with Elysian physiology, but that wasn't answered in the first game, so I guess I'll have to play through the next (two?).\n\nNow for the meat and potatoes of the game - the puzzles. This is where I feel the game was lacking. There are several areas where you are just bombarded with random items you pick up, and very poor clues as to where to go or what to do. Ordinarily I do my best to avoid guides, but I ended up using one for this game. It didn't even feel rewarding for the stuff I DID manage to figure out on my own.\n\nI guess I'd rate this game a 7/10.

Deponia is probably one of the wittiest throwbacks to the Point and Click genre in a while. As Rufus, the man who gives Harry Dresden a run for Biggest Snarker in Fiction, you enter a bleak yet gorgeously drawn landscape of junk, amazing characters, and complete d-bags who plot the very destruction of mankind. As generic as it sounds, Deponia manages to remain a fresh experience in light of what most people would dismiss as an over the top MI rip-off. The puzzles are cleverly planned as hints come in the most subtle of dialogue options. The animations are well suited to the setting, giving a comic feel to the bleak planet of Deponia.

As a disclaimer I should say that I haven't finished this game and probably won't come back. The fact of the matter is, the game is just too difficult for me to finish. However, other than that, I actually really like what I've seen of the game, and I don't think a high difficulty alone should be enough to not recommend it. Just know that it's only for "hardcore" point-and-click players.\n\nPros:\n+Decent humor that made me chuckle\n+Nice art, if you like the cartoony style\n+Even though it looks like a game for kids, it's actually targeting older players (hence the difficulty)\n+Lots of quirky characters and dialogue\n+Interesting story\n\nMixed:\n+/-Difficulty wise, this is the Dark Souls of point-and-click games.\n\nCons:\n-I had a bug where the game was too zoomed in and didn't fit the screen. Googling this revealed I could fix this by editing a config file, but occasionally the game would auto-edit the config file back and I would have to change it again. I was playing the Linux version of the game.\n\nIn a way, I'm not qualified to write this review, since I haven't finished the game and therefore haven't seen the end of the story. I also can't speak for the length of the game, although I do already have 10 hours in it, and it feels like I'm not even halfway. Bottom line, I definitely like this game, but it's hard as balls, and you are going to end up tearing your hair out. It got so bad that I ended up trying to brute force solutions by making every single humanly possible combination of inventory items. But I'm sure there are people who are either better at this type of game than me or just like the challenge. For those people, this is the game for you.","December 23, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When i completed it I felt sad bc i had grown attached to the character known as Rufus.

The puzzles are really engaging and deviously clever and you really have to sit there and think about how to get the right outcome because it will take you a while to figure out the puzzles. One thing that i didnt like is when you have the right items but when you go to click on the object for the item, Rufus will say some phrase that just gets suuper annoying and you are left saying, ITS RIGHT THERE, WHY ARE YOU NOT USING THE ITEM IN YOUR INVENTORY ON IT?!!

So it's no wonder protagonist Rufus wants to escape the literal pile of trash. Too bad he's an obnoxious, egocentric idiot who can barely do anything right, other than perhaps make things blow up in faces...\n\nA not-entirely-likeable definitely-not-hero for a protagonist is a classic ingredient for adventure gold, and Daedalic followed other parts of time-honored recipes, too. Puzzles from trivial to head-scratchers (the way some of those don't really have particularly good hints for them may be the game's one Achilles heel), a graphics style that fits the comedic tone of the game and is executed well, plus some nifty little tricks that make playing eassier (like quick-warping to sscreen exits).\n\nIf you think you live in a dump and have it rough, you ain't seen nothing yet and totally need to treat yourself to the Deponia experience. Ideally, look for a package deal that includes the sequels - even though this is a full-length adventure, it's really rather open-ended.","December 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't hate him, but he could shut up sometimes, he keeps talking and talking every time you click anything, not alternative short lines when you click a second time, like in every other point 'n' click game.\n- The story is unfinished, the ending was really disappointing. And not just for the story, but also because it was rushed and anticlimactic, even the setting was depressing and dull. I already knew there are like 5 or 6 other games, but I thought at least the first one would have a satisfactory ending.\n- Every new scene throws too much stuff at you, it's confusing to have to visit like 5 different rooms filled with new stuff when you don't even have a clear idea of your objective. That's bad design and could be done better, just look at other games like Broken Sword or even Monkey Island, much better in that sense.\n- BUGS. This wasn't a problem until I got to the end of the game, where it kept crashing and I had to click like 3 or 4 times on a item in the inventory to select it. I ended up playing in windowed mode and it seemed to solve the crashing.\n\n\nDespite the annoying things I recommend the game, it's fun and the story is interesting, but keep in mind it is NOT finished, so get it on sale and then decide if you want to play the other games.\n","October 1, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And while you can skip over it, kind of, it's not as easy to skip as in come other games.\n\nThe main character walks slowly.  Seriously slowly.  I assume that was meant to be part of his laid-back character but, again, by the end of the game, it gets to be annoying.  There are cuts to different places that you can use but still, he needs to walk some places.  Slowly.\n\nI had a few technical issues.

Excuse me but I need to save my eyes from getting more damage from broken visuals. Graphic looks like to be a hand drawn - my preference really. Sometimes comical style game is alot better than advanced looking AAAs.\n\nGame is a point and click genre - one of my favorite type to do casually in between dota matches or doing serious AAA titles like jumpscare Dead Space series. Game's full with satirical humor that brings lots of facepalm moment. It's not bad, though, in fact I quite enjoy the story and the humor.\n\nBeing a point and click, gameplay isn't that complicated. Although yes, this is more expansive than The Walking Dead - despite some elements are the same - but the 'puzzles' are a bit more tedious and ridiculous (helloooooooooo why do I have to capture a hiding fork????). And somewhat frustrating if you're really clueless on what to do. But eh, again, it's pretty much fine since we have walkthrough or videos in all around internet. No big deal.\n\nOverall, to my surprise and initial negative view on the game, this is a pretty much ok title.

So it's no wonder protagonist Rufus wants to escape the literal pile of trash. Too bad he's an obnoxious, egocentric idiot who can barely do anything right, other than perhaps make things blow up in faces...\n\nA not-entirely-likeable definitely-not-hero for a protagonist is a classic ingredient for adventure gold, and Daedalic followed other parts of time-honored recipes, too. Puzzles from trivial to head-scratchers (the way some of those don't really have particularly good hints for them may be the game's one Achilles heel), a graphics style that fits the comedic tone of the game and is executed well, plus some nifty little tricks that make playing eassier (like quick-warping to sscreen exits).\n\nIf you think you live in a dump and have it rough, you ain't seen nothing yet and totally need to treat yourself to the Deponia experience. Ideally, look for a package deal that includes the sequels - even though this is a full-length adventure, it's really rather open-ended.","December 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has its share of tedious puzzles but most of them are good and makes sense (not a la Discworld). The story is good enough although very linear (we can argue a story is always linear :p ) in my opinion. We are far from games or stories such as the Longest Journey or Monkey Island.\n\nThe recommended inventory system using the mouse wheel is extremely good and works very well, you can also hit the space bar at anytime to highlight every clickable objects in an area and the hand drawn graphics are really fantastic.\n\nI noticed a few bugs here and there, some of the clickable objects would eventually become non-clickable, and sometimes, the dialogue options are sometime off screen (probably not optimized for my resolution ?). The dialogues are well written and the actors did a great work in my opinion but the sound is not normalized very well making it sometime an inaudible mess.\n\nFinally, I want to mention that Rufus (the hero) goofiness only worked halfway for me. He is very one dimensional and his lines became very repetitive quickly. Some other characters such as Toni, Kuvac's mayor or Lotti are just more interesting making the world of Deponia a very believable one.\n\nIf you can go through all the above, then yes, I think you will like Deponia.","April 29, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If it's going for 20$ as usual... maybe only if you're really into point-and-click games, and have tried other ones. It's a solid enough buy nonetheless. (just my opinion)\n\nA fantastic game with a unique cast of characters and beautifully drawn sceneries. The story itself, beneath the cartoonish appearance, was actually quite intriguing and compelling at times, though admittedly hindered by tedious game pacing (a good example being spending easily 30+ minutes simply making a espresso.). Playing while reading a walkthrough is probably a good idea unless you intend to be in it for the long haul.\n\nThe voice acting I particularly enjoyed; I did notice it did not always sync (particularly in the earlier parts of the game), something which bothered me- but it was nonetheless enjoyable to listen to the voiced dialogue anyways. Even for "supporting" characters I found the voice acting to be rather spot-on.\n\nContent-wise the game seemed rather sparse, but it was consistently enjoyable from beginning to end.","September 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On his way point&click and puzzles happen.\n\nThe puzzles for progress are mostly solvable without the use of a guide, though I did have to look up a few things so I would not have to use every item in my inventory with every useable spot.\n\nAll the achievements are gettable on first playthrough if you go full tryhard and read a guide all the time. If you're slightly less tryhard you may want to remember to save your game every once in a while so you don't have to go through entire chapters to get that one last thing you need. One achievement seemed only achievable through downloading a savefile (check forums), at least it wouldn't work for me the proper way and seemed a common problem.\n\nDefinitely recommended, at least if purchased on sale, and I will play the other games in the series (when they go on sale).\n\nMy one nuisance with this game was after doubleclicking to auto-go to next place, Rufus would take a few seconds to stroll slowly into the screen before I could doubleclick move to next place. Really annoying if you're not sure what you're supposed to do where and check every place because walkthroughs are for uncool people.\n\nArt, sound & voices all good, music is pretty cool, even Rufus thinks so as one of his idle moves is air-guitaring to the currently played music.","May 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is full of that. The story line is what kept me playing, but in the end I was a bit disapointed. How quickly they managed to wrap up the end. I was left feeling alittle empty.

The pacing definitely is a bit off, and I completely agree about Kuvaq: They gave you the impression that it’s “just one more puzzle and then we can escape” the whole time, and that is kind of frustrating.\n\nWhat I absolutely can’t understand is that story, dialogue, animation and humour are being criticised. Those are the strong points of the game that actually make it one of the best classical adventure games I’ve played in a long time. The cutscenes are top notch and beautiful to look at, the characters are quirky and funny and just thinking of the scenes with the post robot going crazy on bubble wrap or the doctor “transforming” into a police officer makes me chuckle.\n\nThe story was also misinterpreted, I think. Rufus actually is a pretty selfish guy, and you can’t possibly describe his relationship to Goal a romance. He treats her horribly and in the beginning it’s basically pure lust that drives him. Seeing how he slowly starts (!) to change is what made his character interesting.\nAnd concerning Rufus’ father, I’d say that it’s just not true that this plotline gets dropped. Just look at the ending and the characters involved… the cliffhanger ending ties everything together.\n\nOh well. One last thing we agree on: This was merely an overture, the real adventure is just getting started. But personally, I’m very excited about that.\n\nBless you, Droggeljug!","December 21, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When i completed it I felt sad bc i had grown attached to the character known as Rufus. Sure he is kind of a horrible person, but the levels of sass from him and from the other characters make the humor that much more unexpected. The puzzles are really engaging and deviously clever and you really have to sit there and think about how to get the right outcome because it will take you a while to figure out the puzzles. One thing that i didnt like is when you have the right items but when you go to click on the object for the item, Rufus will say some phrase that just gets suuper annoying and you are left saying, ITS RIGHT THERE, WHY ARE YOU NOT USING THE ITEM IN YOUR INVENTORY ON IT?!! Some of the outcomes really blew my mind because i was like, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, THATS AWFUL!!! but, it was so so funny!

So it's no wonder protagonist Rufus wants to escape the literal pile of trash. Too bad he's an obnoxious, egocentric idiot who can barely do anything right, other than perhaps make things blow up in faces...\n\nA not-entirely-likeable definitely-not-hero for a protagonist is a classic ingredient for adventure gold, and Daedalic followed other parts of time-honored recipes, too. Puzzles from trivial to head-scratchers (the way some of those don't really have particularly good hints for them may be the game's one Achilles heel), a graphics style that fits the comedic tone of the game and is executed well, plus some nifty little tricks that make playing eassier (like quick-warping to sscreen exits).\n\nIf you think you live in a dump and have it rough, you ain't seen nothing yet and totally need to treat yourself to the Deponia experience. Ideally, look for a package deal that includes the sequels - even though this is a full-length adventure, it's really rather open-ended.","December 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really did enjoy the game through the end! And the ending is kinda a cliff hanger which makes me want to play the 2 remaining Deponia game! A must buy game\n\n\n10/10 Droggeljug!\n\n\n\n\nI'm not really into "point and click" games. But this game caught my interest.\n\nI havent finished the game, but this is what i can tell you so far.\n\nThe game has a good sense of humor. Dialogues are fun to listen to which will keep you going through it instead of skipping them. When it comes to characters based from my observation, they well describe the protagonist (Rufus) characteristics very well with dialogues (well because beside point and click, its a text/dialogue game). As you go deep to the world of Deponia, talking to people and do puzzles, you will learn who Rufus is and the other supportive characters, that every which one of them contributes to the story of the game.\n\nAlso the Puzzles, this game have puzzles scattered through out the game which needed to be solved to advance in the story of the game. It involves logic skills, on what items to be used or combined to make other things works, and etc. But sometimes things isn't really possible and out of the boundary of logic or realism but is supported by dialogues stating the FUNNY reason why.\n\nI'm totally happy with this game and looking forward to play Chaos in Deponia and Good-bye Deponia.\n\nAnother gem in the rough.\n\nP.S.

Wonderful artwork and music as always. Difficult puzzles but nothing out of the unexpected if you have played any games from Daedalic.\n\nAt the beginning, the plot may seem a bit confusing since the setting does not get explained further on into the story. It's kind of hard to grasp the concept of Deponia and Elysium until later of the story. The first half of the game may seem a bit boring but the story is amazing if you could hold onto it until the very end.\n\nWhat I do find interesting is that the protagonist is not your usual all-mighty or pure-hearted wonderful person. Rufus is an a-hole that does not have a job and nor does he appreciate his ex's help. Unfortunately the story does not tell into too much of Rufus past and explain why he may have became like that.

The art work is very good, the humor tongue-in-cheek, and the voice-acting good.  Best of all, the puzzles are neither too hard (mostly - there were a few I needed guides for) nor too easy.  My only real gripe with the game is the protagonist, Rufus:  he's a jerk of the first order.  If there were more character growth in him as the game progressed, I'd have been happier.  But, it's just sort of irritating to have him constantly do really wrong things at every turn.  As for the value of the game, I spent about 17.5 hours on it (100% Achievements).  So, the current list price (about $20) might be considered a tad high.  If you find it on sale, I'd say go for it.","April 20, 2015","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well if so then this is the game for you.\n\nHelp poor Rufus make his dream a reality and escape the junk ridden world of Deponia and make it all the way to the lofty heights of Elysium a floating city high above. And along the way meet a few new friends and enemies to boot. The story is pretty good and full of jokes and gags. I loved the writing and thought it was very well done. The characters are great too, each adding to the overall zaniness.\n\nDeponia is a point a click game and as such the gameplay is pretty standard for the genre. The puzzles are not overly challenging but you may well be stumped a few times on the journey but each and every time you figure it out you feel pretty darn good. Clicking on everything that seems interesting to find all the needed objects and combining items together to overcome every obstacle can be very satisfying.\n\nThe game looks great; the art style is very unique and cartoony. Every set piece, character and item all fits nicely into the decaying world in which the game takes place. I loved exploring people’s homes and seeing what was used to build such wacky places. The game runs great, but as mentioned it’s a cartoon so there isn’t much the computer needs to generate. The game sounds great too; the music is fun and catchy. The sound effects are pretty comical and fit well in the title and every character is very well acted. I thought they all worked well together.\n\nAlthough not ground breaking or particularly long it is a thoroughly enjoyable title from start to finish. I had great fun with it. At full price it’s a little steep but that being said if you like point and click or love the way the game looks or the comedy then go ahead and dive in. For the rest of us I’d wait for a sale, but it’s worth a look and will give you a few laughs.\n\nHave fun ^_^","December 10, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From relentless abuse (from verbal to theft) of his Ex-Girlfriend to just blowing some people's houses up so you can take their place in a line, the Protaganist treats everything with egomanical contempt.  You're genuinely meant to find this behavior funny, but this game just doesn't work without something redeeming to latch onto.  At the end of the day, you're assisting a throughly unlikable person do generally unpleasent things, for 'humor'.  As to those reviews, I was hoping to find that he'd build towards that epifany moment and start to show some undercurrent of a likable person.  The counterpoint that makes putting up the rest funny, or at least bearable.\n\nUnfortuantly, that doesn't ever seem to happen.

If you like adventure games and goofy narratives, then look no further. It should be a pretty easy game to enjoy for most fans of the genre.\n\nThe crazy characters and zany game-world combined with the pleasing art style and soundscape make Deponia charming and atmospheric. This alluring ambiance is definitely the backbone of the game.  And as everything else falls into place, the overall presentation of the game just exudes an aura of “enjoyability” that is hard to defy.\n\nInterestingly, the music and sound effects really play a much larger than usual role in the establishment of the ambiance. Relatedly, even the voice-acting in this game is not only well above the standard for the genre, but also objectively well performed. The end result shows how these elements can really help elevate the overall presentation of a game when they’re handled with care.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes: it is pretty standard for the genre. The puzzles are decently challenging and mostly fair; although some of the solutions don’t really make sense in terms of real-world thinking. You must remember to think in terms of the wacky logic of the game-world when solving puzzles. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating because it is hard to think like that. I suppose that if you get truly flabbergasted, you could always check a guide. Regardless of how you make it past the confusing parts, the rest of the presentation of the game is well worth experiencing.\n\nSo if you are a fan of point-and-click games, Deponia should be a good bet for you.  You definitely should beware of the outside-the-box (inside-the-game) logic, but in my opinion, it is one of the features of the game that makes it unique and worth playing.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","7.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I just can't get past how juvenile and bigoted the humour is. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it's trying to be ironic in the way of South Park by being absolutely horrible for comedic effect and to draw attention to how stupid these tropes/stereotypes/etc sound.\n\nBut the problem with Deponia trying to do that?

Hell, the main female character is CALLED Goal.  *eyeroll*  And the driving force for Rufus is to win her.\n\nAs well as this, Rufus constantly tells us that cleaning is a woman's role (specifically his ex Toni) and that "girly things" are beneath  him.  There's also a trans woman played as a joke ("ha ha look at the big man in a dress"  Yeah, no, not actually funny.)\n\nClearly this is all meant to be funny, and to endear Rufus to us as a "charming rogue".  A clue, it doesn't, he isn't.  He's a creeper, and the way he acts towards the unconcious/brain damaged Goal is creepy, gross, bordering on rapey.  His friend Wendel is also nasty.    The whole game has a greasy vibe.\n\nIt's a real shame, because technically it's not a bad game.  The movement is a bit slow and clunky, and it can be frustrating to get from one point to another,  but otherwise it does okay.  I would have been interested to play similar games if the whole thing didn't leave me feeling like I needed a shower.  As it is, don't bother.  Spend your money on a game that gives its female characters some agency, and its male characters some redeeming character traits.\n\nSo very glad I got this on sale, not worth it.","July 3, 2014","false","3.8"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

My biggest issue with the entire series is the underlying racism and sexism that it presents throughout the three Deponia games. It is fairly disturbing encountering a puzzle where you need to sell the only black character in the series into slavery, because she could best mimic an organ grinder's monkey, for instance. More disturbing is that the designers saw this as the "out of the box, yet still obvious solution". Similarly, the whole mechanic in the second game where the female protagonist's personality is split into its three core components of "sporty" "baby" and "stuck up" is emblematic of the kinds of criticisms for the endemic sexism that the gaming community has been receiving in the media of late.","October 27, 2014","false","6.8"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","4"

Ok, I google-it, found solution and continue on... for next 5 min, until I got stuck AGAIN! And after looking up on google for solution once more, I figured out system how this game works; enter area, play pixel hunting to find all clickable items so that you can collect them, then try out all items from inventory on all noncollectable items in that room, and if that doesn't work, then try to combine all items in your inventory one with another till you get new item. When you craft new item, try him out with everything in room, and then with everything in your inventory (because sometimes you have to combine more items to get something useful)... And if after all of that, you didn't do anything that will progress story further on, go to next area and repeat procedure. And you have to do all of that due to twisted and borderline insane logic behind all puzzles in this game, so there is very little things that will be logical at first (or ever).\nSo, does that sound like fun? For me it didn't... So I grabbed first walk-trough I found online, and finished game with it, and that makes me sad because characters (except main character), visuals, humor, animation and atmosphere are wonderful... Shame.\n\nAnd I really can't say that I liked main character in this game (he is borderline sociopath); maybe they intended to do that, but It just make me dislike him in general, and If I don't like main character, I tend to like game less (this is personal preference, so take that that in consideration). And there are some questionable moral agendas in this game regarding females....\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this game, due to insane puzzles that barely make any sense, and they reduce game to tedious clicking and trying out everything on everything until you make something new.\nScore: 4/10","October 11, 2014","false","5.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","6"

In that regard, Deponia is exactly what it advertises. The chunky, eccentric designs of characters and backgrounds really brings this game to life.\n\nAnd that's where the praise ends.\n\nThe big issue here is the writing, and it commits what is, to me, the greatest sin. It's trying to be funny. The jokes come at you on a regular basis. But I did not laugh once in my entire playthrough. Perhaps it's because of the mean nature of much of the humor, or it's a style that just doesn't carry over in translation, but most of the time the characters just seemed unlikable and mean-spirited.\n\nMy thought is that if you don't get laughs, stop it. Just stop it. Tell a story, be earnest in your delivery, drop all the affected attempts at hilarity. Maybe then they could have spent more time on the puzzles, which range from arbitrary to insulting.\n\nThere's a puzzle where you literally have to make an association between the house a person lives in and what their hat is, because three people all have headgear that looks like their occupation. It's that sort of backwards engineered idiot puzzle that makes people give up on adventure games. It has to be logical, sensible but not obvious, or the player will just give up.\n\nThis is the sort of series I'd rather view through one of those "Let's Play" Youtube series, but preferrably with the sound off.","December 8, 2013","false","6.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Bringing a clean pair of socks seems easy - I found a blue and a yellow sock, but Rufus wanted a matching pair. Okay... Rufus says they're dirty, so let's try washing them in boiling water, which results in the two socks coming out as ONE green sock. I had to check a walkthrough to find out that there's another green sock completely hidden under Rufus' pillow... did I mention that the game is set on a garbage planet, but the few items that you can actually interact with aren't highlighted? (edit: apparently there's a button you can press to highlight items you can interact with... quality UI design!)\n\nOne of the other four items you need to pack is Rufus' toothbrush, which comes alive and runs and hides because of how filthy Rufus' teeth have been on the rare times he's brushed them. Okay, I can live with the idea of a sentient toothbrush, heck as a kid I even used to watch a cartoon with that exact premise. So how would you think that an adventure game would have you lure out an abused toothbrush? Maybe by tempting it with nice teeth to brush, such as by somehow convincing another character (with superior dental hygiene) to smile near the toothbrush? Nope, you catch it with a mousetrap... with a pea for bait. What?! And you find that mousetrap in a "closet" which just looks like part of the wall (did I mention how visually messy the garbage planet setting is?). The game implies that you need something to pry the closet door open, and the required tool turns out to be a TOILET PLUNGER.\n\nI think that was when I gave up on the game.","April 9","false","4.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","4"

I mean, this game does have neat visuals. And sometimes it is funny. The puzzles are moderate in obscurity and difficulty.\n\nOn the other hand the main character (Rufus) is the most obnoxious, arrogant, sexist and stubborn main character I have ever seen. It was very hard playing as him and hear him make simple, often unfunny and unnecessary comments. And the way he talks about women... He despises the first one even though she (god knows why) literally provides the roof above his head, and the other one he treats as if she were his property. Besides that, the game is riddled with dirty humour and a story that really makes no sense and gives no explanation.\n\nI would have loved it if as the game progressed, Rufus evolved and became humbler and reasonable.

Once you get past the screenshots, there are no redeeming qualities to the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/214340/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Deponia is a traditional point–and-click (P&C) adventure game which revolves around the protagonist trying to escape from Deponia and ends up saving a mysterious princess. Boasting a charming setting supported by beautifully drawn backgrounds, solid voice acting  and an interesting soundtrack, at its core it is plagued by one of the most insufferable casts and puzzles seen in an adventure game in years.\n\nIf the aim of the game was to represent the most insufferable protagonist, something which is fundamentally a backbone of the genre, then it passed with flying colours. Rufus, the protagonist, is quintessentially the pretentious and brainless (at times) jerk every individual should respectfully hate and gives little reason for any sympathy throughout most of the story, even when his act of saving the princess is noble to an extent. Not only is the protagonist ultimately unlikeable, but almost every single support character faces the same setback: being painfully unmemorable, unfunny or annoying.\n\nThe humour in Deponia is by and large hit-and-miss. There are a few genuine moments which spark a giggle such as a robot’s guilty obsession with popping bubble-wraps or a transvestite’s fake womanly voice (the best it can get), but these are overshadowed by the blatant misogynistic remarks and uninspiring jokes by poorly written characters.\n\nThe puzzles are not great either. They start off fairly easy but eventually end up suffering from a typical syndrome in this genre -- illogicality. Because of this a guide must be acquired, otherwise too much time will be frustratingly spent figuring out what to do next, and there are a few moments where you will ask yourself how were you supposed to know that or why that particular action was required. The game does not give too many hints when it comes to solving its relatively tiresome puzzles.\n\nAll of the things mentioned above slowly turn a potentially decent storyline at best into a dreary one. Even now, personally I am not completely sold on the whole damsel in distress approach the story takes when Rufus meets the princess, who spends mostly the entire game unconscious from a fall caused by no one else but Rufus earlier in the game. Regardless, there is also a sense of not much engagement in the story either, all thanks to poor writing. After a few hours sank into the game, everything starts to be a big fat chore.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it is shocking to realise that after almost two years since launch a particular game-breaking glitch in a puzzle, which was also encountered by others (albeit not all), is still present in the game. This glitch stops a particular cutscene to play, preventing any possibility of continuing the game just when you were so close to the end. After some research, a way to overcome this unforgiveable misfortunate is to get access of a save file from someone else who owns the game and got passed this point. At the time of writing this review, I still do not know how the game actually ends. Moreover, reported by others as well is the awful framerate even for high-end computers which can inexplicably drop to as low as 10FPS even at the lowest settings. Deponia is a game which should not require a lot of resources to run smoothly considering it looks like a 2D game done in Flash, and this implies poor coding and optimization.  Lastly, the animations can be a bit clunky at times but passable.\n\nConclusively, Deponia is kind of a mess, much like its planet. Poor writing, unlikeable characters, illogical puzzles and unfixed glitches simply make it a chore or potentially unplayable and degrade anything interesting the story has to offer.  Its visual charm might be its only selling point for anyone curious about Deponia (mainly the reason I got it), but its flaws in almost everything that is supposed to make a top-notch adventure P&C sadly suck out any enjoyment Deponia could offer to an avid, yet old-school, adventure fan like myself. I cannot recommend this game to any adventure fanatic expecting an overall quality on par to Monkey Island, Gabriel Knight, Broken Sword and other classics. Instead, Deponia should also take an example from a recent modern game like The Book Of Unwritten Tales.\n\nLastly, if you can actually ignore all its flaws, then it is passable at best. But I would be in awe by how you could ignore such obvious flaws.","July 7, 2014","false","8.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

If you've played any of the old LucasArts or Sierra adventure games from the 90's, you'll feel right at home with Deponia.

It's a perfect balance of logic and wackiness.\n\nThe story and characters are also well done, though it took a little bit for the main character, Rufus, to grow on me (he's obnoxious and grating at first). Since this is part 1 of a trilogy, the ending will leave you hanging and wanting more. However, don't let that fool you into thinking it cuts short.

"Deponia" is the first game in the Deponia trilogy, which includes "Deponia", "Chaos on Deponia", and "Goodbye Deponia".

While it doesn't completely fall short, it does enough wrong to not get my vote.\n\nPros:\n-Art style is really polished.\n-Music (especially intro) is surprisingly good.\n-Length is about what point-and-click adventures should be.\n-The idea of calling a trilogy from the begining is a great idea.\n\nCons:\n-I need my point-and-click adventures to be more or less logic driven. What I mean is that the items I try to use to solve the problem should make some sort of sense (even if it is quite tangential). This game suffers very badly from matching up logic to solve problems. Alot of the time it ends up being random clicking that gets you through. This is not very satisfying.\n-There is some sort of language barrier as some of the jokes are questionable lol. I find it funny but I would be willing to bet that the humor/script was written for another culture (I am located in North America).\n\nI also played the second game in the trilogy, and will not be visiting the third. Not a complete waste of time, but there are better games out there (plus I payed the full 20$ asking price).","September 22, 2014","false","11.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

And, then it just throws it all out the window while screaming in lunacy because "Oh look at me, funny jokes amIright?". It starts out great (As long as you can tolerate the completely illogical puzzles designed by someone who apparently belongs in Arkham Asylum), but by the second half you start noticing how the gears start grinding into a halt and slowly you are left with a drag. A drag that still carries on for HOURS before you get to the end.\n\nAnd then, the ending. Why please, developers, would you kindly come to my home and kick me in the teeth too? I'm all for "open-ended" or leaving stuff sort ofopen for a second part. What I find despicable is actually setting up the end of the game to be...  well, not the end. At all. Period. The end of the game is simply not the end. If you want to "play it to the end" prepare to waddle through the three games.\n\nAnd believe me, it does NOT get any better.","October 18, 2015","false","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has some flaws thats common in this genre though with stupid design choices that forces you to listen over some of the dialogue you just heard over and over if you dont do the right thing both in some conversations and puzzles. for example the 2-3 harder puzzles in the game would have environments where there would be some really annoying looping sounds which makes it really frustrating to focus on the puzzle. The games humour is a bit hit & miss but overall on the positive side.\n\nWarning: This game on the other hand atleast the Steam version on the other hand is extremely bugged though atleast on Windows 7. There was tons of errors where the mouse wouldnt register actions at hotspots, also some places easpecially in the 2nd half and onwards in the game there are looping sound bugs which is especially frustrating when trying to solve a puzzle i had to skip one of em because i didnt find a fix for the sound. Some of the later parts a restart or a reloading of a save file would fix the sound loop at times or leaving a area and go back. Since the game originates from a german company theres also some bugs where the subtitles will be shown in german and i even got spanish voices at 1 point(!).\n\nI wont recommend buying the Steam version if you really want this game, the GOG.com version is far better compatible and doesnt seem to have as many bugs overall.\n\nRating: 6/10\n","November 12, 2013","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character has a load of personality, and the story has this "Elysium" feel to it, but with a lot more charisma than that movie ever could have accomplished. My only minor complaint with the game is I wish the voices and sounds weren't so compressed. The game's visuals are so gorgeous, that hearing the grainy voices and midi type sound effects really throws me off into this sort of uncanny valley effect.\n\nBut yeah, it's good.

The story moves forward in a very jerky way with 30 second cutscenes of story followed by long, tedious bouts of point-and-click puzzle solving full of very contrived quests which are barely related to the story. (For example: To advance the story by one small increment, you've got to collect these six things. Oh, and each one will have some asinine obstacle blocking your ability to get it.) By the end of each of these game segments I was positively starved for some kind of progress in the story and on the verge of quitting. The story is interesting, but it moves at a snail's pace. It's super-annoying to play for an hour without getting so much as a crumb of story progress. This made the game feel long and dull to me.\n-I found several of the puzzles to be confusing rather than challenging. In a couple of cases I got the solution through random trial and error before actually understanding what the puzzle was I was supposed to be solving.\n-The story is completely unresolved, and all you get in the end is a "to be continued" ending.","November 7, 2015","false","9.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

As some people have mentioned, the puzzles were harder than many other contemporary adventure games, but they were far from impossible and roughly on-par with the old classics.  The only positive thing I can say about the gameplay is that the solutions to the puzzles were actually amusing, and require you to behave like the horrible person the protagonist is trying to be.\n\nMaybe I'll take a deep breath and try again soon.","November 18, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

To be honest, I have no idea why.\n\nStill Daedalic is very productive company and while some teams like Pendulo are just vanished in time and others like WadjetEye are just too old-school for modern common player there are plenty of adventure games from german devs.\n\nBut Deponia definitely isn't one of the best.\n\nAnd it is not becase of many reasons:\n* you know, when you put your game into some irrational setting (just like scrapyard-city in the middle of the nowhere), you can afford any kind of "logic" you even may come up with. So you can force players to be wounded by chile pepper or hold with you unconsious parrot almost all the time and tell them that, guys, we are in the cartoon after all, but it is not something of a good taste and it is not mark of good game designer work\n* another problem is that game breaks its own rules. You need to use fork to take out socks from boiled water but you don't haveto have one to obtain sponge from same place\n* humor is german-specific and here it is SO german-specific\n* main character deserves terrible death - he is ugliest main persona since... I don't know. Since original sin\n* there are plenty of recorded phrases but quantity definitely does not transform into quality. Different interactions can have same reaction from protagonist. Rufus is very talkable one, but his blabla-ing is as annoying as he is. Prepare to listen silly stories about every your hot-spot click. Unfortunately there is no much useful information in them\n\nSo I'd like to recommend to play any other adventure, even from Daedalic. Why don't you choose A New Beginning for example?\n\nAnd, dear Daedalic, could you please deal with animation? While overall graphic style is just great characters' speech with 2 drawn frames per sentence can frighten expierenced screamer-lovers.\n","February 28","false","5.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","1"

I had lots and LOTS of AFK moments to cool down JUST BECAUSE of the MC. I'd rather play a total villain than this sad excuse for an anti-hero.\nI even turned off the audio because I hated listening to his dialogues, and yes, I also skipped through all.\n\nNext, the NPCs.\nSeriously, they are just as bad... except for 2 who were ridiculously harassed by the MC. I actually like these 2 and wonder, if the character designers are actually capable of creating these 2 great characters, then why is the MC such a crap??????\nYou have anti-heroes, and you have jerks. I don't see any of the first in this game.\n\nPlot was OK. The world setting reminded me of the Japanese manga GUNM : Battle Angel Alita.\n\nGraphics are good. A good reminiscence of Monkey Island and Gabriel Knight (the 2D animation versions).\n\nSoundtrack.... no idea. I was so irritated by the MC's dialogue etc then I turned off the audio completely except when I needed it to solve puzzles. Even then I didn't register it into mind.\n\nPuzzle.\nThe puzzles are FRUSTRATING and does not make sense. Yes, it's a fantasy world which isn't logical in the first place, but  unfortunately for puzzles, you do need logic. Fantasy world or not.\nThe order does not make sense. I know what to do, and IMO it doesn't effect the game whatsoever if we mix up the orders anyway. But nooooooo..... we miss a step, we can't move on.\n\nI purchased a LOT of Daedalic games in a shopping binge because I was desperate for a good point-click game.\nPlayed 3, finished 2, and not even thinking about finishing the 3rd despite my anal-ness.\nNot even thinking about starting the other ones, and will re-fund if possible.\nIf re-fund not possible, I might play the remaining games just to humor the money I spent, which is NOT happening anytime soon.\n\nIf you're an avid collector of point-click games no matter what review, then go ahead and give this a try, though I do recommend... HIGHLY recommend that you purchase this only on a big sale.\n\nIf you're looking for a good gaming time, move along.

His life goal is to escape from Deponia so the first what you do is another attempt to get there which goes not totally wrong. Instead, you bring "Goal" (a girl from Elysium) to Deponia and totally fall in love with her. But... she's unconscious.

He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the clouds.

Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness.\n\nHelp Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven.

''Deponia'' is a game developed and pubished by Daedalic Entertainment.\n\nPreface!\nDue to this game being ''story driven'', I am not going to go into mush detail or spoil anything major of the Story.\n\nThe story centers around Rufus: a young, sarcastic, bold, lying, selfish man who wants to leave the junk town of Kovaq - a town Rufus has known for so long - and look for his, not-so known, father. Rufus believes his father abandoned him for the floating city of Elysium when Rufus was very young.\n\nAnd so, Rufus makes it his ultimate destiny to go to Elysium; to prove his own father that Rufus can go to Elysium.\n\nDuring Rufus Journey, he ends up meeting people and they end up helping him on his travel.\n\nThe tone of the story is comedy mixed with seriousness. About 95% of the game is comedy while the small 5% is seriousness. I can't say in which part the game gets serious.\n\nThe ending of the game, in a way, touched my heart. I can't say  in detail of what happened in the ending, but it got to do with all Rufus had done during his Jouney.\n\n\nI like Deponias' animation. The animation is hand drawn. The animation suits well with the comedic tone of the game.\n\n\nDeponia is a hard point-and-click game and is a lot more harder than ''The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav''.\nItems do not ''highlight'' when you hover over them with something else.\n\nThere is no quest log... so... you are probably going to wander aimlessly around in the game and be like ''uhmm... what am I suppose do again?''.\n\nI recommend this game to people who wants a challengine Point-and-click game.\nDeponia gets an 8/10.","January 10, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a colorful little world and a nice addition to a faded genre, but it displays some telltale signs of why the genre has faded. You'll hit at least a handful of moments where the game becomes less about figuring out clever little puzzles and more about trying every different thing on every other thing until something works. Also, the voice acting is unfortunately pretty terrible. so much so, that you might even consider muting it so you don't have to hear the same lines repeated over and over again as you progress through dialogue trees. The game took me about 10 hours to complete, but I was ready for it to be over after about 6.\n\nThis is first in a trilogy. If you like point-and-click, it will entertain. But I'd recommend trying this one out before pulling the trigger on the complete Deponia series.","June 19, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay I never found tedious or boring, and there are no tiny hotspots that you just can't quite click that make some other point-and-click games so frustrating. The voice acting, music, and especially the art are all very well done.

''Deponia'' is a game developed and pubished by Daedalic Entertainment.\n\nPreface!\nDue to this game being ''story driven'', I am not going to go into mush detail or spoil anything major of the Story.\n\nThe story centers around Rufus: a young, sarcastic, bold, lying, selfish man who wants to leave the junk town of Kovaq - a town Rufus has known for so long - and look for his, not-so known, father. Rufus believes his father abandoned him for the floating city of Elysium when Rufus was very young.\n\nAnd so, Rufus makes it his ultimate destiny to go to Elysium; to prove his own father that Rufus can go to Elysium.\n\nDuring Rufus Journey, he ends up meeting people and they end up helping him on his travel.\n\nThe tone of the story is comedy mixed with seriousness. About 95% of the game is comedy while the small 5% is seriousness. I can't say in which part the game gets serious.\n\nThe ending of the game, in a way, touched my heart. I can't say  in detail of what happened in the ending, but it got to do with all Rufus had done during his Jouney.\n\n\nI like Deponias' animation. The animation is hand drawn. The animation suits well with the comedic tone of the game.\n\n\nDeponia is a hard point-and-click game and is a lot more harder than ''The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav''.\nItems do not ''highlight'' when you hover over them with something else.\n\nThere is no quest log... so... you are probably going to wander aimlessly around in the game and be like ''uhmm... what am I suppose do again?''.\n\nI recommend this game to people who wants a challengine Point-and-click game.\nDeponia gets an 8/10.","January 10, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsboring/recommended/214340/","mrsboring","Annika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsboring/","91 products in account","I've never been a fan of point-and-click games, I picked up Deponia since "uh-it's-cheap-I*ll-give-it-a-go" and then kind of forgot about it for months. Until recently, when I decided to sit down and actually see what it's all about. I instantly fell inlove with the atmosphere, I love the graphic scenery and the dump that is Kuvaq, the little village on Deponia. Rufus is the kind of guy that himself claims to be master of everything, but as far as others are concerned, he's master of disaster. Still, he manages to assemble the most peculiar things in his inventory - the very first struggle I had was "how the heck do I get a hold of that TOOTHBRUSH????" - it takes a good amount of thinking before getting used to the whole "pick up everything you can and if you can't use it instantly, try to combine it with something else in the inventory". Needless to say, I don't play puzzle games on a daily basis but I do have a tendency to explore everything in one area before proceeding to the next - which is basically what you want to do in this game too. Otherwise, it's easy to miss picking up something or miss an important clue given from some of the characters while speaking to them.\n\nThe minigame puzzles aren't obvious on how they should be solved, and even if patiently listening through a whole conversation with clues both once and twice, I had my fair share of problems when trying to solve them. Nonetheless, they are amusing and once succeeded, you'll probably feel a bit "ha-HA! There ya go!" - until you encounter the next one..\n\nAs for the story, it's pretty straightforward. Rufus desperatly wants to leave Deponia and will do anything in order for that to happen - when encountering the beautiful Elysian girl Goal he sees his new opportunity rising - he manages to get her into trouble but from his point of view that's excellent news, now he can help her and claim a reward for doing so - to get off Deponia! The road to success isn't all straight and narrow though, but bumpy and grindy - with loads of obstacles along the way.\n\nI like the characters, Rufus especially - his well-meaning intentions aren't always apparent, though. I like the story, it has all elements in it - a bit of action, love, humor, betrayal, villains and of course the old conscience acting up - "what's best for not me alone, but for everybody?". To me, the game is exactly as long as it has to be, in the end it actually feels like "Oh, come on already, aren't we through yet?" *but* it also left me with a feeling of "Now I want to play the next part of this trilogy, I want to know what happens next!". I understand those who thinks the game is quite short, but to me it was sufficent.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game is the tedious multiple choices you have to go through in order to obtain certain items. It's okay when playing on normal mode but when unlocking Droggeljug mode (after finishing the game) they don't make sense anymore. Even if I instantly replayed the game in Droggeljug mode, I couldn't remember how to obtain a certain item from Hannek and it left me extremely frustrated.\n\nI didn't play through the whole game in Droggeljug mode to get the achievement for doing so, I had a saving quite close to the end and played from there on (even then, it was a bit tedious as it's quite much conversations happening near the end) - when every option in multiple choices is replaced with DROGGELJUG, you need to remember which number of the options is the right one - and if the question is branched into several pieces, you can easily lose your temper.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freakish_light/recommended/214340/","freakish_light","Prosthetic Conscience","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freakish_light/","485 products in account","Deponia is a classic point-and-click adventure game in the style of the classic LucasArts adventure games of time long past.  It's a futuristic-type tale that takes place on, you guessed it, Deponia, a toxic world of trash that the upper crust left behind a long time ago to live on the floating city of Elysium.  Rufus, the protagonist, has had enough of living on Deponia, and is actively trying to reach Elysium by any means necessary.  There have already been a few failed attempts by the time the game starts, but this new one is entirely different.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nBeautiful hand-drawn animation.  Especially beautiful in the cutscenes where they bring in some CG to really bring it to life.\nFaithful, true to its roots adventure game\nWonderful voice acting\nIs genuinely funny most of the way through.  It can be hit-and-miss, but it's more hits than misses\nTHE BAD:\nA lot of little translation issues that, I think, could just have been solved by one good editing pass from a native speaker\nMostly unlikeable characters, with a few exceptions.  They're the exception and not the rule, though\nWeird attitudes toward women in general\nIt's a faithful adventure game throwback.  Serious case of adventure game logic.\nTL;DR If you like a good, classic adventure game and don't mind a little bit of jank, it's a good example of one and is decently funny to boot.  If a lot of minor issues with language, character, and writing will get in the way of you enjoying this game, I can't really recommend it that much.  Personally, I would think that I would be in the second camp, and I spend a lot of time kind of tearing at it for its myriad faults, but I'm ultimately not sorry I played this game.  If you can pick it up for like $5, I'd say go for it.  It's really pretty.\n\nIf you want to read more of my thoughts on it, I'll go into some more detail.\n\nThe game was developed by Daedalic Entertainment, based out of Germany, and it is immediately obvious that this game wasn't originally written in English.  The lyrics of the singing interludes by the chorus-type character have been cruelly shoved into some kind of rough rhyming scheme, one that I am sure plays a lot better in German.  The subtitles of the translation are also littered with grammatical errors (at one point the subtitles read "motive" where the spoken text correctly reads the line as "motif"), which is a real shame to see because I don't think that hiring a decent editor - one that has a firm grasp of the English language - would be that difficult.  Some of the lines don't play exactly correctly, either, as the voice actors place the wrong emphasis on the wrong word at points.  These are lines which could be read differently in context and it would be a producer or director's job to ensure that they read correctly according to the situation.  In short, the dialogue is a little janky.  Not enough to ruin the experience, but it's there, and if you're as annoying about grammar as I am then it'll bother you too.\n\nWhich isn't to say that the VO in the game is bad.  They actually get some decent actors, including Alix Wilton Regan of Mass Effect 3, and more recently Dragon Age: Inquisition fame, and they turn out a great performance.  With what they're given.\n\nThere isn't a lot to like about the main characters in Deponia.  Rufus, your protagonist, is kind of a dirtbag.  He gleefully smashes his way through everything in sight trying to reach his goal (and his Goal; the Elysian girl he accidentally knocks out of the sky at the beginning of the game is literally named Goal this game is not subtle at all) and he just runs roughshod over everyone while proclaiming how brilliant and compassionate he is.  I'll admit, some of his lines are genuinely funny, but over the course of the game I just felt like I was getting hit over the head by how much of a real jerk this guy was.  Even when you, the player, try to choose a dialogue option that's not completely terrible, the person you're talking to basically disregards it and you get railroaded into something awful happening.  And I can understand why it's written that way, because Rufus has some big ol' glaring flaws that he needs to work through for redemption, but in the end I just felt like it was a little much.\n\nThe game also has some weird attitudes regarding women.  The receptionist at Town Hall is obviously a man in drag, complete with the transition between super deep voice and high squeaky girl voice that's played for laughs.  In one scene the men of the town all bid to be the one to take the beautiful girl home and "care for her."  Goal herself spends most of the game passed out and is only an object that Rufus has to carry from point A to point B and call his girlfriend without even talking to her.    I don't like the story as much as I could have, for sure.\n\nDeponia is a classically styled adventure game.  Which means you have a gigantic inventory, you pick up everything that isn't nailed down, combine every item with everything else trying to get it to work, and then use every item on every interactable object to try and make the game go.  In an effort to make the game challenging it also has a bad case of adventure game logic, where you have to put things together in a way that doesn't necessarily make sense just to solve the puzzle.  Not only that, in the second major portion of the game you get about four or five different distinct objectives, with no way to track them and no idea where to start.  My advice: walk around, pick everything up, talk to everybody, click on everything.  A lot of progress is gated behind dialogue options too.\n\nIf there's one thing I don't have a complaint about, though, it's the graphics.  Everything is fully rendered in a gorgeous hand-drawn art style and there are a lot of little details worked into everything that make it a joy to look at.  They even drew idle animations for Rufus that are pretty fun.  Of course, in the rare instance where an animation doesn't have enough frames it can look a little weird, but that's a pretty minor issue.  The cutscenes are all that and then some, as they incorporate CGI for some of the set pieces to really make them pop out of the screen, to wonderful effect.  You can watch any of these in the Bonus section at any time and they were well worth it.\n\nUltimately, I would say that the game is worth it, especially if you enjoyed games like The Secret of Monkey Island, Loom, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango... I'd name others than purely LucasArts games but they are just not coming to me right now.  Maybe get it on sale if you're on the fence about it.  I don't know if it's worth full price, honestly.","December 1, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Deponia is the tale of Rufus, the son of the man who founded Rufus's hometown of Kuvaq and subsequently disappeared, and his attempts to escape the junk-strewn planet of Deponia. During one of his infamous "perfect" plans, he runs into a girl from the romanticized, junk-free world of Elysium, nearby.\n\nThe two become wrapped in each other's quests, for better or for worse. Rufus is stuck with Goal, because she's his only ticket out of this dump, and Goal is stuck with Rufus because, well, she's unconscious, and she doesn't really have any say in the matter. Plus he's the person with the closest thing to her best interests at heart, between the town of Kuvaq, who wish to keep her as a trophy resident, and the Organon who seemingly have their own agenda.\n\nRufus is not the most selfless hero. In fact, he's rather vain and self-centered. He manages to pull it off and remain endearing, however - at least to the audience. His neighbors in Kuvaq are painfully tired of his absent-minded and often quite dangerous (to Rufus, and everyone else in a several mile radius) plans and experiments. In a way, maybe I find Rufus endearing because he reminds me so much of, well, me. He's lazy, but dreams big, and feels he deserves to be the one to make it simply because he wants it more.\n\nDeponia's a silly game, the kind where great bodily harm is often cartoonishly shrugged off when it's not important to the plot. It made me laugh quite a few times, and most of the characters are well-written and well-voiced. The Organon bug me, with their loud, crackly, sort-of-digitized voices, but most of the others sound alright to downright enjoyable. The music is a perfect fit, evoking the rattling and banging of garbage, while still remaining pleasant to listen to. I'm quite fond of the bar theme in particular, to the point where I would sometimes stop in at the place even after I had no business left there, simply to listen for awhile. The world is beautifully drawn, and most importantly, interesting. There are surprises everywhere, and the world itself is rather unusual, and nicely characterized as you go about your journey.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, without ever seeming unfair. You do have kind of an unusual amount of "gather cleaning supplies and clean this thing off" puzzles, but then this IS a planet covered in discarded scrap and refuse, so it's at least justified. On the whole, Deponia's puzzles and style feel to me like a proper evolution of the classic Lucasarts SCUMM adventures. The sense of humor, however, is unique, and I love it. It really feels like Daedalic had fun writing and designing this game, and I'm glad, because I had fun playing it.\n\nIt's not the longest adventure game, but it's long enough (I clocked about 11 hours of quality adventuring on my playthrough), and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment in the Deponia trilogy.\n\nAnd that folk-singer narrator guy ruled!\n\n"HUZZAH, HE'S OFF NOW, GOODBYE!"","May 31, 2013","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game pads a bit with dialogue, but they make up for it with decent art style.","December 7, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsboring/recommended/214340/","mrsboring","Annika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsboring/","91 products in account","I've never been a fan of point-and-click games, I picked up Deponia since "uh-it's-cheap-I*ll-give-it-a-go" and then kind of forgot about it for months. Until recently, when I decided to sit down and actually see what it's all about. I instantly fell inlove with the atmosphere, I love the graphic scenery and the dump that is Kuvaq, the little village on Deponia. Rufus is the kind of guy that himself claims to be master of everything, but as far as others are concerned, he's master of disaster. Still, he manages to assemble the most peculiar things in his inventory - the very first struggle I had was "how the heck do I get a hold of that TOOTHBRUSH????" - it takes a good amount of thinking before getting used to the whole "pick up everything you can and if you can't use it instantly, try to combine it with something else in the inventory". Needless to say, I don't play puzzle games on a daily basis but I do have a tendency to explore everything in one area before proceeding to the next - which is basically what you want to do in this game too. Otherwise, it's easy to miss picking up something or miss an important clue given from some of the characters while speaking to them.\n\nThe minigame puzzles aren't obvious on how they should be solved, and even if patiently listening through a whole conversation with clues both once and twice, I had my fair share of problems when trying to solve them. Nonetheless, they are amusing and once succeeded, you'll probably feel a bit "ha-HA! There ya go!" - until you encounter the next one..\n\nAs for the story, it's pretty straightforward. Rufus desperatly wants to leave Deponia and will do anything in order for that to happen - when encountering the beautiful Elysian girl Goal he sees his new opportunity rising - he manages to get her into trouble but from his point of view that's excellent news, now he can help her and claim a reward for doing so - to get off Deponia! The road to success isn't all straight and narrow though, but bumpy and grindy - with loads of obstacles along the way.\n\nI like the characters, Rufus especially - his well-meaning intentions aren't always apparent, though. I like the story, it has all elements in it - a bit of action, love, humor, betrayal, villains and of course the old conscience acting up - "what's best for not me alone, but for everybody?". To me, the game is exactly as long as it has to be, in the end it actually feels like "Oh, come on already, aren't we through yet?" *but* it also left me with a feeling of "Now I want to play the next part of this trilogy, I want to know what happens next!". I understand those who thinks the game is quite short, but to me it was sufficent.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game is the tedious multiple choices you have to go through in order to obtain certain items. It's okay when playing on normal mode but when unlocking Droggeljug mode (after finishing the game) they don't make sense anymore. Even if I instantly replayed the game in Droggeljug mode, I couldn't remember how to obtain a certain item from Hannek and it left me extremely frustrated.\n\nI didn't play through the whole game in Droggeljug mode to get the achievement for doing so, I had a saving quite close to the end and played from there on (even then, it was a bit tedious as it's quite much conversations happening near the end) - when every option in multiple choices is replaced with DROGGELJUG, you need to remember which number of the options is the right one - and if the question is branched into several pieces, you can easily lose your temper. I had to mute the game because I got tired of hearing "Droggeljug" constantly :P\n\nI recommend the game if you like humorous point-and-click games with catchy soundtrack, clever puzzles, wacky characters and a good story. To each their own, if you don't like those things, don't buy the game.","September 15, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminded me a lot of Pajama Sam, a favorite classic PC game of mine. It's more adult based, of course, in comparison to Pajama Sam. Between the snarky comments, adult-related hints and crude comedy, there's the point and click along with the story line. The main character, Rufus, who you play, is the core of most of the comments, and much of the comedy. There's a few parts I don't agree with, like unnessary speech options that don't do anything or cause any different outcome. (Like rude, mean comments won't let you progress. It's a trial and error sort of thing, until you find the right speech option which sometimes can be conflicting with another positive comment.) It has a nice story, but many of the puzzles aren't so obvious like 'go here, do this, for this thing that you need for this 'quest' '. The game gives you a singular hint, and leaves you to it. Much of the gameplay can end up being running around in circles, trying to figure out what you're meant to be doing. Despite this, I still recommend the game for the story and comedy. I would rate the difficulty at 'moderate'. If you're good at puzzle, and point and click games, you'll probably love this game.","September 1, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the 2D animation of this game, as well as the horizontal AND vertical movement that existed.\n\nThe humor in this game was really funny, and well done, and the cinematics were great. I found the length of this game to be just right, and the puzzles hard, but not hard enough that I had to resort to a guide.\n\nThe only downfall to this game is the price.

I'd say this is a very approachable game that anyone can play and enjoy. The puzzles are tricky but fair, and require a lot of thinking outside the box, which is exactly what they should. I especially love how the dialogue gives hints towards what you need to do with a particular puzzle. Deponia is quirky and funny, and if you love Monkey Island you'll love this. The language is stronger than in LucasArts' adventure games, but infrequent and still on the mild side.\n\nA few bits where Deponia could use improvement: the subtitles are occasionally mispelled, the voice acting sounds forced or awkward occasionally, and I've run into a few glitches, although nothing game-breaking.\n\n9/10, highly recommended.","October 9, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes I know what to do to solve the puzzle but the game forces me to do it in a certain illogical way. F.e. when gathering ingredients for a drink that is to be mixed in a machine it forces me to mingle them in a separate container first. Or sometimes there is not enough feedback what a certain action does.\n\nAlso big parts of the game play in the same village. Finally the game ends too much with a hint for a sequel, which I do not appreciate as a serious business model that respects gamers (at least adventures aren't too expensive these days).\n\nThat and the above puzzle flaws give the game an unpolished character.

I like the main character for being a self-absorbed jerk. It's nice not play a goodie-two-shoes for a change and I love all the sarcasm and hatred he encounters when speaking with others and how he is a derp and is often oblivious to it. I like how even when he does realize it, it doesn't stop/affect him.\n\nThis may be a spoiler but I have to say that: In the end of the game, I honestly did feel sorry for him. I mean, we don't know why he is exactly the way he is to begin with. His father left him behind, he is probably emotionally scarred. His life on Deponia doesn't work out. He knows (or at least thinks) that his dad made it to Elysium so he wants to go too. It's not like I'd enjoy living on a smelly planet either you know. Probably the fact he thinks he will leave Deponia soon, causes him not to want to put in any effort on his life or bonds on Deponia, and rather put in all his efforts into finally get Elysium. (And perhaps seeing his dad again) although it's said that his dad was apparently selfish too so whatever.\n\nI mean I am fine with him being selfish, at least he is up front about it. In the end, every person is selfish or at least at times but they try to hide it. :P Rufus could have played himself off as not selfish and simply wanting to help Goal the entire way, and reached his actual goal in the end, but instead he was up front about his intentions in the end and also came clean which came from the heart. I can appreciate this characer for that simply because even if he may seem a jerk, at least he stays true to himself. There are plenty of people who seem to do something for another but secretly only do it for a selfish motive, no? So if you hate Rufus please go do some self-reflection. LOL\n\nAlbeit I felt sorry for Toni for having to deal with him the way he is though, I still think she is rather stupid for continueing to allow Rufus to stay in her home. I mean, does she still love him or something? If someone would live in my house and did that stuff I'd kick them out mercilessly.\n\nDidn't really understand the charm of Goal at all, she seemed like some kind of robotic person, reminded me of Chobits (it's an anime) which I guess is nice in a sense but she was most of the time just asleep so we didn't get to know her personality at all unfortunately.\n\nThe game's puzzles were fun and combining items in your inventory was as well, although I at times couldn't figure out what to do after trying out tons of ways without any result. Thankfully there are walkthroughs on the internet but I really wished that hadn't been necesarry. The puzzles are all logical, yes, but sometimes there just isn't enough hinting towards what you could do or objects that you can use aren't really obvious, I've had several times where I moved my mouse past an item I could have picked up but it did not show it at the time.\n\nThis still didn't get in the way of me appreciating the comical aspects, settings, and character interactions in this game, so much in fact, that I recommend it to anyone who has a more dark sense of humor and doesn't get offended easily by jokes that revolve around degradation, or a characters whose considered a selfish jerk in general. :P","January 8, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story ended up being more expansive than I expected at the start, and the quirky character Rufus was really relatable as I helped him towards the goal of Elysium.\n\nThis game can get really frustrating, because after you figure out most puzzles it doesn't end well for Rufus. After I'd made Rufus' rocket and hit the ship from Elysium, I had to watch him simply fall back to Deponia and continue droning on about escaping with Goal (enough to nearly make me quit the game).\n\nOverall, Rufus is a good character with a bunch of puns and a snappy attitude. He doesn't appreciate his friends as much as he should, so most of what happens really seems to be up to his karma. I love the art style and puzzles (although they can be terribly hard), and the music is impossible to get out of your head.","March 19, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were some parts of the game that were genuinely funny, which was the goal of the developer of this comedy-based adventure game. There were some puzzles that were really fun and challenging. Unfortunately, there are some major problems in this game that made me consider abandoning it at several points. Some of the puzzles try to be cute and absurd rather than logical, which make them hard to solve other than trial and error. There are some puzzles where the cue to the player is not obvious enough. There are also parts of the game where it is not clear what you are supposed to do next. For example, in many adventure games if you talk to characters in the game, they will tend to point you toward your next task. The characters in Deponia will tell you tons of jokes and wierd stories (I clicked through a lot of it), but 90% of the dialog has nothing to do with helping you finish the game. There are some out-and-out bugs, including a minigame that was flat broken. I used a walk-through more for this game than any other I have ever played (that includes Myst, Riven, Siberia I/II, Machinarium, The Longest Journey, etc). The hero of the story was a little too detestable to be funny. The artwork, style, and creativity were all there for this to be an excellent game, but somehow the developers did not learn from other great games of this genre. The result is a disappointment.","January 12, 2014","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to all the fans of games like this.\nThe story isn't very exciting, but it is interesting. From time to time you will be frustrated because the things didn't go as planned even though you tried so hard with a puzzle or an annoying conversation. The main character, Rufus, will annoy you to no end with his ego tripping and, well, stupidity. You will find yourself yelling at him or mentally high-fiving him. Other characters are interesting and have stories to tell you and are very helpful. And of course, there's a love interest. The puzzles are mostly fun, although some of them you will gladly skip, which you can. If you are like me and don't have internet access often, you will be glad to know that your achievements will still be saved. Graphically-wise, the game is gorgeous, the comicbook-y style goes well with the humour-filled conversation. Voice acting is also very good.\n\nAll in all, a very good point-and-click adventure that will make you happy and angry at the same time.","January 12, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I ended up looking through a walkthrough more with this game that any other I've played.\n\nSure, it has humour and an amusing story, but it was more annoying that anything. While I'd be interested to find out where the story goes with the other three, I'm kinda glad I didn't buy them all at once.\n\nWhile the voice acting was good, the sound was often a little all over the place.

This means I can recommend the game, with the caveat of checking current special offers (vs The Complete Journey). Leaving the original review below since the bait-and-switch still DID occur.]\n\nGood game BUT a word of warning:\n\nDeponia and it's sequels are since september 2014 presumably abandonware. Instead of patching the remaining bugs of the separate games the developer/publisher Daedalic decided to release an all-in-one title called Deponia: The Complete Journey. It's a completely new separate title, not a 'pack' containing the previous games, so there is no way to upgrade from the standalone titles. It also does not create giftable versions of the titles you already own.\n\nIf you are new to the game and want to buy and play Deponia (which is a terrific and fun Point-and-Click) get The Complete Journey.\n\nPersonally I think this move is blatantly unfriendly to early adopters and existing customers and would probably not buy anything from Daedalic again, let alone this new all-in-one version.","October 26, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It's something fresh to me since I've hardly play games which contain much humor in it as this one does have. The artwork through the game also was appealing to me since I am a fan of good ingame art and graphics.\n\nWhat I disliked about it was how some of the puzzles were a bit funky and you pretty much had to think outside the box just to solve it. The main character annoyed the fricks out of me. His personality during the first part of the game was fine at first, it was easy to handle. But as the game progresses you either grow to hate it or become immune to it. I personally started to get annoyed with his dialogue and ended up skipping parts because of it.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you have the biggest patience with puzzle games especially weird once then this is the game for you.

Deponia is the tale of Rufus, the son of the man who founded Rufus's hometown of Kuvaq and subsequently disappeared, and his attempts to escape the junk-strewn planet of Deponia. During one of his infamous "perfect" plans, he runs into a girl from the romanticized, junk-free world of Elysium, nearby.\n\nThe two become wrapped in each other's quests, for better or for worse. Rufus is stuck with Goal, because she's his only ticket out of this dump, and Goal is stuck with Rufus because, well, she's unconscious, and she doesn't really have any say in the matter. Plus he's the person with the closest thing to her best interests at heart, between the town of Kuvaq, who wish to keep her as a trophy resident, and the Organon who seemingly have their own agenda.\n\nRufus is not the most selfless hero. In fact, he's rather vain and self-centered. He manages to pull it off and remain endearing, however - at least to the audience. His neighbors in Kuvaq are painfully tired of his absent-minded and often quite dangerous (to Rufus, and everyone else in a several mile radius) plans and experiments. In a way, maybe I find Rufus endearing because he reminds me so much of, well, me. He's lazy, but dreams big, and feels he deserves to be the one to make it simply because he wants it more.\n\nDeponia's a silly game, the kind where great bodily harm is often cartoonishly shrugged off when it's not important to the plot. It made me laugh quite a few times, and most of the characters are well-written and well-voiced. The Organon bug me, with their loud, crackly, sort-of-digitized voices, but most of the others sound alright to downright enjoyable. The music is a perfect fit, evoking the rattling and banging of garbage, while still remaining pleasant to listen to. I'm quite fond of the bar theme in particular, to the point where I would sometimes stop in at the place even after I had no business left there, simply to listen for awhile. The world is beautifully drawn, and most importantly, interesting. There are surprises everywhere, and the world itself is rather unusual, and nicely characterized as you go about your journey.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, without ever seeming unfair. You do have kind of an unusual amount of "gather cleaning supplies and clean this thing off" puzzles, but then this IS a planet covered in discarded scrap and refuse, so it's at least justified. On the whole, Deponia's puzzles and style feel to me like a proper evolution of the classic Lucasarts SCUMM adventures. The sense of humor, however, is unique, and I love it. It really feels like Daedalic had fun writing and designing this game, and I'm glad, because I had fun playing it.\n\nIt's not the longest adventure game, but it's long enough (I clocked about 11 hours of quality adventuring on my playthrough), and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment in the Deponia trilogy.\n\nAnd that folk-singer narrator guy ruled!\n\n"HUZZAH, HE'S OFF NOW, GOODBYE!"","May 31, 2013","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Challenging puzzles, cartoony 2D-graphics, no action elemements and a good humorous story.\n\nThe best aspect of the game is probably the creative andsometimes quite challenging puzzles. In some adventure games the solution to a puzzle is almost immediately obvious because there are so few possible things to try. In Deponia trial and error is not a quick and easy approach, since there are many objects and lots of things to interact with. In particular in the first part of the game the puzzles require a bit of out of the box thinking without being unfair. Puzzles are also fairly varied and always feel like a natural part of the game rather than tacked on. My only complaint in this department is that the very end of the game is a bit anticlimactic in terms of puzzle difficulty.\n\nThe story is humorous and entertaining with unique character. The humour doesn't always work, but there are moments of brilliance, and it worked often enough to keep me entertained throughout. The ending is a bit disappointing but it does leave things at an appropriate starting point for the sequel.\n\nThe cartoony graphics are entirely appropriate given the general tone of the game and are high quality and quite distinctive. Characters each have their own unique appearance and do not look generic at all like they do in too many games.\n\nVoice acting is above average but not exceeptional. The music has a unique style that is very appropriate given the particular setting and is quite appealing too.\n\nAll in all this is a highly recommended adventure game if you like pure point and click adventures with challenging puzzles and a healthy dose of humour.","February 2, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style, humor, and even the characters are very reminiscent of CoMI, which is a good thing.\n\nThe only downside: it's kind of short.

The people live in trash on top of mountains of trash making a living from trash. But for a brash, lazy, young Rufus, he wanted more. So in his latest hair-brained scheme to escape to Elesium, he saves a a damsel in distress from a militant group and finds himself mixed in a conspiracy that will affect everyone on Deponia. The story is a good bit of comedy in the vein of Lucas Arts "The Curse of Monkey Island" with memorable characters and involving plot twists. The world in the story is also very imaginative and filled with a lot of potetial for exploration. A+\nGraphics- Those who are familiar with "The Curse of Monkey Island" may see a lot of similarities in art style. It does show that many of the developers and artist were fans of Lucas Arts. But dispite similarities, this game is a whole new beast and completely original in character design and world creation and is every well done. The cutscenes are also very well done and is like looking at a cartoon television show. A\nSound- The voice acting in this game is spot on in terms of delivery, though the lip-sync can be terribly off which was a little bit destracting, but not unforgivable. As for the music... I LOVE THE MUSIC! There is a very good mix of ballads, a touch of hip-hop and just fun altogether. A+\nGameplay- Simple, straight forward point and click interface with combining items for more items. If you've played old school adventure games before then it is very familiar territory. There is also a fair amount of challenges and puzzles that will keep you puzzled but if your stuck, there is an option to skip it. B\nOverall- A fantasic throw back for fans of old style P.O.C. games with a fantastic story, great characters and music that should not be missed. Highly recomended.

Only problem i had was a few of the puzzles were really difficult and some of the puzzle mechanics weren't  explained well enough to easily understand  Ended up with my head in an online guide. This game was definately worth playing through though got it for $5 and it was well worth it. Can't wait till Chaos in Deponia goes on sale skipped it on sale for $10 and regret it now :P.","January 24, 2013","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd recommend just watching it being played on youtube cuz that's much more fun.","December 2, 2012","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However its the VERY rare acts of begrudging kindness that cause him real problems. Well worth the price, check it out!","April 29, 2013","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or so I thought.\nDeponia is quick and amusing, I did "cheat" at parts when some puzzles were not obvious to me. Definitely recommend this game (especially if it's on sale). I'm looking forward to playing the next two. :)","November 30, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty funny and the puzzles are a bit more intuitive than some games of this sort can be.  If you kind of miss the old Lucas Arts adventure games, this will be an adequate (if imperfect) addition to your collection.  The game pads a bit with dialogue, but they make up for it with decent art style.","December 7, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While not 100% up to par with a great Lucasarts Point and Click, this gets the job done and scratches that itch quite well.  The artwork is beautiful.  The music is great.  The only thing is that the game can have some weird responsiveness from time to time and it's not always as smooth as you'd like.  I have the second one, but haven't played it yet.  I plan on buying the third.  Great story... a fun play, for sure.","December 8, 2013","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly there is alot of charm to the game. The atmosphere and environments are actually quite nice. The animation quality is great, but I am sorry to say that I would have to give this one a pass. I played a couple hours in, and hey maybe it gets better. I really wanted to love this game, but seriously, the solutions are so ridiculous. My best way to describe it would be the whole duck and rope solution in the train station from the game "The Longest Journey", except that almost every one you do will feel like that.","December 9, 2013","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It made me so happy to finally play a point click action adventure game again after what feels like ages! Seriously, when was the last time I played an actual great point click adventure game? King's quest 7? Leisure Suit Larry love for sale? I dunno, it's certainly been a while though.\n\nThis game is brilliant, 2d point click adventure animation at it's finest! I love the characters, the rude somewhat selfish Rufus as the main character who is a real &^% hole (But has a certain reason behind his actions later in the series), Goal the beautiful inteliigent girl of your dreams who is just out of reach, Toni the hot ex girlfriend you secretly wish you were still with and a wacky assortment of city residents who all seem to think your a loser and need to just vanish off the face of the planet.\nYour mission is to find a way off deponia and reach a utopia of sorts known as Elysium, where it is known to be a clean beautiful land full of happiness and what not...unlike Deponia in which you start from, litterally a landfill of a world composed of junk on top of junk for miles to see. There are tons of animations way more than any point click adventure I have ever seen and I actually ponder quite a bit as to how long it took the developers to create these games. Either they had a large team or this took quite some time.\n\nThis game is so impressive, I really hope more people give it a try and keep it alive for years to come.\n","December 20, 2013","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
