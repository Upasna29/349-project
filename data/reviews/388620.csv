Unfortunately, you do need those clues, and in my case, I missed one, and the ensuing death threw me back more than an hour of gaming. If it hadn't been for that, playing on the medium dififculty I'd have called the game suffciently challenging to be motivating, but I'm not exactly eager to replay all of that (even though the levels have been re-generated).\n\nThere's also a maze mode you can play, where you have limited resources and limited information because you're on a mega-level that you can only see parts of at a time (unlike story mode), which makes it quite tough.\n\nDo I recommend this? Well, I do like the concept, and if someone had told me not to engage a boss I didn't know how to beat (and to consult a walk-through if in doubt), I'd still be playing. There's really nothing else wrong with it, and especially considering its price, I can't really thumb it down. So, recommended.","December 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/388620/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","Despite the description, DungeonUp isn't really a roguelike, because that would imply that it's an RPG at all. It's actually a puzzle game in the guise of an RPG, in the same vein as the free indie game Tower of the Sorcerer or the DSiWare game Crystal Adventure. It's... better than Crystal Adventure, for sure, though I've never played Tower of the Sorcerer to compare it to that.\n\nThe puzzle elements are a bit simplistic - basically, fighting monsters is completely deterministic, and you can tell what the results of any fight will be before you get into it, in terms of how much damage you'll suffer, so you just need to figure out what order is the best for fighting things, what to put off fighting until you're stronger and can defeat it without taking damage, et cetera. It also sometimes can be a little grindy, when you're going back to wipe up all of the monsters you skipped fighting earlier now that you can defeat them without taking damage.\n\nIts claim to being a roguelike is the "maze mode," which randomly generates a dungeon of the appropriate tier for you. Unfortunately, I found these very difficult (except when the game basically gives you a free win, which it also does sometimes...) and not very fun, as you'll spend a lot of time wandering in circles trying to find a way to get stuff without fighting (m)any enemies or using (m)any keys.\n\nWhile this doesn't sound very positive, I dunno. I still had a bunch of fun with the main game and some of the bonus dungeons on the Workshop - there's a dungeon builder, though most of the available scenarios worth playing were created by the developer as well - and spent 8 hours playing a game that goes for $5 at full price. Some of that was frustrating, and you should stay away from trying to bash your face on the additional scenarios if they seem to be nonworking or terribly-designed, but it's still an amusing short game.","November 29, 2015","true","9.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

The run-of-the-mill Rogue-like aspects of it are there, the way you move around, the monsters, the upgrades, but added to that is a cleverly made multi-level puzzle involving not only getting past the monsters, but also getting the right keys you need to open the right doors to get the right upgrades so you have enough health to kill the monsters.\n\nIt feels like it gets the balance right, and with the added well-made puzzle, you don't just wander aimlessly through it.\n\nThe game can be played at three different difficulty levels, the easiest even allowing for the most basic kind of key to be automatically generated for you 60 seconds after you run out, which is fine if you want to play it as a more relaxing game.\n\nLike many other games of the genre, the damage you take attacking a specific monster is fixed depending on your attack and defense ratings, and as they increase, you will gradually have monsters that you take zero damage killing, and before they're high enough, there are monsters that will always kill you, no matter what.\n\nThe pixel art styling is nice, which is not something I'd say of all pixel-art games, and the music and sound effects also have a nice 8-bit feel to them without rubbing it in your face too much.\n\nIn conclusion: this may finally be a game like this that actually gets everything right.","December 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Very fun... But at the current state it's a "little" broken so I can't recommend it. There are some bugs (especially one) that ruined the game experience for me. The problem with soulstones. They are required to buy any item from NPC and to revive you if you die (if you are out of stones you need to start the game from the beginning). You obtain them by killing a boss monsters. However they seems to save even if you restart the game. So... If you restart the game and start from thee beginning: you will still have the soulstones you collected before. It's pretty weird and gives you huge advantage because you can buy items from NPC even at freshly restarted game. Somehow without even having any soulstone I used it (I just pressed the soulstone icon with number of 0)... It worked... But my soulstone amount went from 0 to -1. I clicked few times again and I'm at -4 now. Restarting the game don't help at all and now I can't purchase items from NPC. There are some more bugs (posted in the community hub and aren't fixed for months) but this one is worst and actually break the game.\n\n\nPROS:\n+very fun and enjoyable dungeon crawler (especially for your coffee break),\n+map editor (and steam workshop so you can share your maps with other people),\n+story mode,\n+maze mode,\n+pretty long (and maps are randomly generated!)...\n\nCONS:\n-...but the random generated maps looks like they are totally random generated and sometimes they are just weird (for example you have the door that requires a key but there is second way without any door or even monster guarding the entrance),\n-BUGS! (and developers actually doesn't seems to care at all - atleast in Community Hub)\n\n\nI could easily recommend the game but these bugs doesn't allow me to...","April 26","false","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I can't imagine myself playing any longer though, and I can't recommend it for its full price, but it gave me some nostalgic vibes due to its original, albeit rough concept and execution. There is something that makes you strive towards the completion, but there isn't much new to see here after you beat it. Sure, you can go for some ridiculous achievements which I have no idea how to do (in fact, beating the story mode is tricky in itself, you gotta do some unobvious stuff or scratch your head when you fail by pressing the wrong button some time ago), and there is Maze Mode, which is even more randomized than the story line, not to mention surprising inclusion of Steam Workshop support for such a tiny game. Well, I didn't do any of this stuff for more than 15 minutes at best. All things considered, if you like the trailer and screenshots - that's what you'll get if you buy it. A cute little puzzle-ish RPG-ish thingy.","May 4","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, this one somehow i feel like i can play & enjoy it. It's could be because of map editor, or skipable battles (when you're attacking enemy, you can press space in order to skip damage calculations) most of the time at least. Still, it's a nice thing that you can do that, one more thing would be nice, skipable text. Since most players might wanna read text it's could be done the same way as damage calculation, you could click space to read more or hold space for let's say 5 seconds to skip the whole thing. This game is worth it's money! Even thought i brought it during the sale, i think this game is worth it 4.99 price tag. That is, if you enjoy playing this type of games. Even if you don't, once it is on sale try it, since i never enjoyed this type of games in the past either. Good luck! Oh, and one more thing before i finish this review. There is player made maps, you can play them if you want to. Or create your own maps. P.s sorry for my bad english grammar if it was.

It's got depth, but by no means would I call it deep.  The puzzle elements are simple but rewarding.  The procedurally generated levels can be difficult, but that also keeps the game from getting overly repetitive.  After a playthrouh or two, you can use Soulstones to find creative ways around certain challenges.\n\nThe game certainly has its flaws, but well worth the price.  If it's on sale, buy it and try it.
