I have spent hour playing that game. The races are unique, every race has their own special units, that make your gamepley different everytime you play another race. The campaign is awesome. I have heard that there is problem running that game on Windows 7, though I have managed to start it.\nPlease try this:\n\n1. In the Steam game library, right click the game\n2. Select "Properties"\n3. Select the "Local Files" tab\n4. Click "Verify integrity of game cache"\n\nThis has been known to easily fix the "Failed to find steam" error. If the issue persists then it is recommended you try these steps:\n\n1. Open the Start Menu, right click "Computer", and select "Properties".\n2. From the column on the left of the new panel, select "Advanced System Settings".\n3. From the new dialogue, press "Environment Variables..." (at the bottom of the "Advanced" panel, just above "OK", "Cancel", and "Apply").\n4. In the top half of the newly opened dialogue (User variables) if there is:\na - no existing entry for PATH, use "New..." to add it (Variable Name: PATH, Variable Value: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam -- i.e. wherever you have Steam installed).\nb - already an entry for PATH, use "Edit..." to add ;C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam (or wherever your Steam is installed) at the end of the existing value. (Note the semi-colon to separate the value that was already there from the new bit with the Steam path.)\n5. Press "OK"\n6. Log off and log on again. You should now be able to run the Steam titles without problems.\nIf you have further issues I suggest you contact Steam Support as there may be issues with your Steam Client.\n\nAfter that the game will start, but it can be really slow ( about 1 FPS), try than setting at highest possible graphic settings and check box called 'User Direct3D'. It starts on fullscrean, but it is slightly smaller than your whole monitor, so it should allow you to run it and enjoy that great game!","December 8, 2014","true","0.2"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","1"

To call it a "Heroes Clone" would be inaccurate at best. You can level up your heroes, yes, but you also level up your units. Instead of producing hordes of units, your leveling up one unit, making keeping them alive more important.

Plays rather simply with squad formations mixed in with map exploration. The combat system differs from other entries of the genre and might either hit strongly or miss depending on the audience. There is a degree of repetitiveness into carrying your squad through every mission but your leader will carry over from mission to mission and will attain godlike strenght. Very memorable units and very strong story. The overland map does not look very well but once you get used to it it has the decency to be effective in displaying what you need to know and the style is still appropriate to the setting. The combat and zoomed in sequences look very good still in my humble opinion.\n\nThis game will run well on any machine except for a slow mouse cursor bug that can be fixed.

The difference is that this is more RPG progression focused, you'll take a single hero over many missions and, instead of army stacks each, individual soldiers in your hero's party gather XP and go through several "evolutions".\n\nA problem for me was that sound broke and I couldn't get it back, which is a shame because it's pretty good and adds to the experience. Unfortunatelly this doesn't seem uncommon and I think alt tabbing out of the game is what broke it for me.","September 24, 2014","true","129.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players send parties of fantasy heroes around the overworld to kill monsters, get loot, and conquer enemy towns. As you play through the campaign, you can continue to level up one specific hero, and I found myself having this one hero single-handedly slaughtering armies. It's tough to level up other parties since there aren't many weak enemies. The game's a little slow-paced, but building up your party and winning with it is fun. It definitely has some depth. If you like it, it can keep you busy for a long time.\n\nThe tutorial was not good, but the game is ultimately not that tough to figure out.\n\nThe game's art is very well-done for being entirely 2D. The music works. The plot is boring, at least for the human campaign (haven't made it to the others yet). A warning: it doesn't play well with modern systems, but I got it to work eventually.\n\nFor strategy fans (maybe RPG fans too), I think the game's worth buying.","October 19, 2011","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The turn based battle-system is simple and visually pleasing. The story diaglogue messages will contain the occasional typo, but what are you gonna do? Character artwork is excellent (especially Empire), and the music is superbly done - that is to say, you barely notice its effect, until you turn it off.\n\nI had a problem getting this to work initially, too. When it was "running", I went into the Task Manager, and changed the process properties directly to run in compatibility mode (WinXP SP3). I also run it without the steam overlay, but I don't know if that matters.\n\nMy biggest gripe about this game (and it's a pretty big one) is every game is either part of the saga, or a pre-designed quest. There's no "rock-em-sock-em" mode where you pick a faction and just play.

Set resolution to 800x600 - when setting any other resolution, game wouldn't start.\nCheck "Use 3D" "Stretch to full-screen" and "Compatibility mode". Other settings do not affect game start or performance. Click on "Save" at the bottom of window.\nSecondly, DO NOT change seetings in "Discipl2.exe" as this will just screw up game start. DO NOT set compatibility mode or "Run this program as Administrator" in here. Let the Configuration editor do all the work.\n\nThis is how i managed to start the game after half an hour of trial and error. This setting worked for me but it doesn't mean it will work for you. You may start the game with this settings but game might be choppy, laggy. If that happens, Alt+Tab and start Task manager. Click on "More details" if it isn't already on, and go to details tab, select "Dicipl2.exe", right click on it and set affinity to a single core. No matter how many cores do you have, leave only one checked! This is how i fixed choppy performance in SimCity 4. Since it's not lagging on my machine i can't confirm this will work, but it's another option that you can try.\n\nIn the end i would close by thanking Microsoft for making this new Win8 platform verry complicated for most(or all) older and newer games.\n\nGame is definitivelly recommended by me if you like games like Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty.","February 13, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A timeless classic who's art and production values are present in every facet of the game. From the lavish gothic UI and richly detailed character art and units the game is very beautiful. The art style has always made the Disciples series stand out. Gorgeous illustrated Unit portraits complement the nicely detailed maps, models and UI.\n\nWhen Disciples II originally launched it didn't garner the sort of appreciation it deserves. It became a bit of a cult classic and had improved on nearly every aspect of its forebear Disciples: Sacred Lands.\n\nI remember my first experience with the game was the demo I received through PC Gamer. I was hooked and drawn into its dark world. Its fantasy atmosphere was just that good. I loved that demo so much that when I saw Disciples II:Dark Prophecy and its two expansions were released in the "Fantasy 6 pack" I had to pick it up.\n\nDisciples II represents the very best of turn based strategy games and is right up there with the likes of Fire Emblem.","May 18, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's great variety between the races and each has their own campaign, with each faction having a distinct style. The combat is unique and feels like Ogre Battle but this is also one of it's biggest problems; similarly to Ogre Battle, if all of your units in a party die, they are gone forever. Your favorite hero and his units will transfer between missions so this means if one of your super-units dies you can potentially throw the campaign. The terrain control mechanic is a great visual representation of your area control but I find it downplayed in many missions because of a turn limit or boss rush. Hero customization is diverse and has more options than HoMM but they are slower to level up. Although it has aged poorly, this is a great HoMM alternative that is worth checking out if you're a fan of strategy games.","December 13, 2012","true","26.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The hero gains levels and you choose between different options to improve and keeping most of the items you find during the game, letting you customize your hero. There is the risk in the game that if you lose most of your leveled units your new unleveled units won't be able to defeat anything.

I mean, sometimes it works, but it's really hard to achieve. I've tried to play it on two PCs and a netbook, but it looks always the same - compatibility mode, disabling nearly everything in configuration setup and playing in 1024p can give you a CHANCE TO PLAY, if you are patient enough. So overall: 2/10.\n\nI noticed that it is the problem with many older games.

Since the end of the war against Mortis' Undead legions the Dwarves have become more determined than ever to recover their lost Runic knowledge. Little do they know that they will soon face an enemy more dangerous than any Undead abomination...\nThe Mountain Clans are dwarves who live in mountain caves and possess runic powers, given to them by their god Wotan and rudimentary technology like steam engines and explosives. The Clans were allied to the Empire during the First Great War and still maintain a friendly relationship with the humans. The giants consider the dwarves to be their cousins and are willing to aid them in defending the mountains. The dwarven capital is guarded by Vithar, who sits at Wotan's right hand.\n\n\nDisciples II: Gallean's Return	2005	Gallean's Return contains the first two expansion packs, Servants of the Dark and Guardians of the Light precombined. This means that all the content of the base Dark Prophecy game is included as well.\n\n\n\nDisciples II: Servants of the Dark	2003	Contains:\nThe original campaigns of 7 missions for the Undead Hordes and Legion of the Damned from Dark Prophecy\nTwo new mini campaigns of 3 missions (one for each race) that continue the storyline and start off with a high level of difficulty. A hero saved at the end of an original campaign may be imported for use in the mini campaign. If the player does not have a saved hero, several have been included with the game.\nSeveral other new minor features are included as well, such as new special characters, interface improvements, AI improvements and new maps.\nServants of the Dark does not combine with the base Dark Prophecy game. When installed on a computer that already has Guardians of the Light installed it and Servants of the Dark are combined to form "Gallean's Return" which offers all the content of the base Dark Prophecy game in addition to the 4 extra mini campaigns as part of a single install. Gallean's Return was later sold separately.\n\nDisciples II: Guardians of the Light	2003	Released at the same time and the counterpart to Servants of the Dark, Guardians of the Light contains the original campaigns for the Mountain Clans and Empire as well as two new mini campaigns of 3 missions each, in a similar fashion to Servants of the Dark.\n\n\nDisciples II: Dark Prophecy	January 4, 2002	The base game contains 4 campaigns of 7 missions each for the Empire, Mountain Clans, Undead Hordes and Legion of the Damned.\n\n\nOriginally posted by Stranger_X:\nHi!

To top this all off, only one faction (2 if you count the elves) get healers, so the end result is moving your stack of dwarves/demons/undead out of the base, blowing up some random crap, and going back to base to heal.  If you are playing with harder AI you will receive the privilege of getting pummeled with map spells which the AI can drop all day every day but you are limited by resources.  You take your one hero through each level and only the hero, meaning the first part of every level is releveling up the support peons.\n\nGame design suffers too, with such gems as:\n-units who can stunlock the entire enemy party!\n-the final boss who can stunlock your entire team AND deal damage while doing it!\n-front-line units who are immune to weapons, with the drawback, that, um....\n-each faction does only one type of elemental damage (save the dwarves) meaning that if you ever run into say, a dragon while playing as the devils, you're totally screwed.\n\nI want to like this game, but the gameplay just doesn't justify it.","May 27, 2014","false","77.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I know for a fact that there are way better things I could be doing.  I also know that what I'm eating has next to no meaningfull nutritional content. They don't even taste especially good, and I'm getting bored and frustrated and only eating out of habit.  So why the hell am I still eating?!\n\nWell, the game does look pretty, in that early-Rennaissance-variant Grimdark(TM) way. It also offers reasonably steady advancement in power, and a few head-scratching tactical challenges.\n\nMostly, though, it comes down to grinding, hoarding and (save) scumming. Grinding: learn to recognize the fights your troops can survive and still gain meaningful XP from, keep hitting as fast as you safely can till your dudes gain a few levels and a commensurate capacity to curb-stomp anything other than the final battle (troop upgrade levels determine any fight that hasn't been pre-determined by magic or thief spam: a difference of one level guarantees the higher-tier army will win, two or more guarantees a massacre.)  Hoarding: get mines and mana nodes. Money is necessary for Grinding, since the buildings needed to upgrade your troops get hella expensive at tiers 4 and 5, while mana powers the spells that tilt combats. Use as little mana and money as needed to keep your troops alive and upgrading, then when the map's big bad comes into view burn it to guarantee a win. Cast every spell you can, twice if you can, send mobs of Thieves to soften up fortified armies, send disposable heroes leading quick-firing ranged units, you get the idea. Scumming occurs when those first two don't work, or are derailed by unforseen circumstances, which becomes more common as you climb the difficulty levels. The couple of different auto-save functions make this slightly less irritating.\n\nThe end result is a game where fights can largely be predicted in advance (no tactical genius can offset spell bombardment or superior forces), and strategy between fights is largely a matter of trial and error. You can let it eat up a ton of time, or you could go play something more interesting.\n\n(Yes, I know this review sounds like a three-hundred-pound couch potato telling his kids to exercise.

Meanwhile the Clans, recovering from their near-destruction, begin to reunite their tribes. They have received divine instructions and now seek to uncover an ancient ritual that will let them communicate with their god, Wotan.\n\nDisciples II: Servants of the Dark is a stand-alone expansion that brings you into the never-ending quest for supremacy as either the Undead Hordes or the Legions of the Damned.\n\nOn the dark side, the Legions of the Damned enact a plan to spread Bethrezen’s plague across Nevendaar. They sense the threat brought about by the rebirth of the Elven god and will stop at nothing to steal this power for their own purposes. Perhaps most pivotal to the conflict, however, is Mortis and her army of Undead Hordes. After all, the rebirth of her husband Gallean was her doing. He had rejected her for what she had become, a twisted, heartless beast.

However, the game is by far one of the most unbalanced and least enjoyable games I have ever played.\nAnyone who has ever played the Might and Magic series will certainly be familiar with a high level of difficulty, but in that series a thorough grasp of the game mechanics combined with  a few false starts as you acquaint yourself with the lay of land will ultimately allow you to complete the missions. To take another example, the excellent Age of Wonders series (my personal benchmark for strategy/rpg excellence) is often said to be punishing, but the fact is once you learn all the game's tools, it's a rich and highly rewarding experience and there's no reason why you can't complete missions in fine fashion.\nDisciples 2, on the other hand, is simply an exercise in masochism. Yes, the missions can be completed, but not without an excessive and highly frustrating amount of bloodletting, dying, reviving, etc., as from the start you will find that EVERY enemy on the map is stronger than you. Nor does it get better, as your character's progression -- should you be fortunate enough to carry one from one mission to the next -- is minimal at best and hardly matters compared to the strength of the monsters. Buffers offer only the most marginal of enhancements to your troops' stats, costly spells bestow laughable gains (10 fire damage to 300 HP monsters, oh boy), and hard-won battles are rewarded by the most modest and least consequential of loot drops.\nIt's only been from sheer stubbornness that I've persisted to the second mission (halfway through and looking bleak, overpowered beasts everywhere), but frankly, aside from the so-so graphics and music, this game offers precious little in the way of enjoyment.","March 20, 2014","false","16.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","3"

The primary difference is in the combat.\n\nAs in Ogre Battle, combat takes place between squads that meet up on the map. Rather than stacks of creatures, each member of a squad is a single creature with a health bar. A number of rules dictate the squad composition: A squad has a limited number of slots, a large creatures may take up multiple slots, some units can only attack from the front row, others from both. To this end it's greatly engaging experimenting with squad composition and placement, building countersquads, attrition squads, and so on.

I am happy to see someone here addressed the config issues.  Wish I had looked at that before.  I spent an hour figuring it out.  It's hard to find the game install folder.  I would say to search your whole drive for 'disciple.ini.'  Then go to that folder and run the configuration exe.  You can set 'use direct 3D' to on.  I think that is the key.  It worked for me, and I can now launch it from steam or the shortcut.  Don't mess with the actual ini file.  The config exe will modify it for you.\n\nI actually played this game quite a lot before buying it on steam.  It is a lot of fun, and the Gallean Gold package has a ton of content.  The biggest drawback of this game is that the AI is really really slow.  Every time you click 'end turn,' be prepared to wait about a minute for the AI to take its turn.  If you can stand that, it is really fun and addictive.\n\nThere are a ton of pros.  Interesting tech tree, challenging battles, rewarding items, replayability if you want to try different heroes and different lords, good spell options, decent story.  The balance in this version is good.  The original version had some issues with spell stacking and overpowered items.  They really did an excellent job with the balance in this (final) version.  I have never done multiplayer, but at least, it is available.  If you have a really really patient friend, you could always take them on.\n\nSo this is a definite buy.

What caused me to responde so much about this game is its atmosphere: its high fantasy, decadent design, the beautiful beautiful isometric landscapes, the sombre, solemn music, the epic quality of the story.\nI recall the sheer pleasure in immersing myself in this dark world where there are no good sides and everything is permeated by this sort of gritty grandeur.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is very similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic titles, with a decisively steeper difficulty curve. Resource management is particularly tricky in this one, especially once you get to play the biggest maps. The different factions are all very well characterised not only in terms of design and contextualization, but also in gameplay. Every single one of them plays different strategies best: the Legion of the Damned has excellent nukers and favours brief fights, the Undead Hordes deploys excellent crowd control, the Empire thrives in longer fights combining sustain and utility, etc.\nAlso their power spikes - provided by mainly by unlocking units and spells - happen at different times for each faction, providing added layer of complexity to the gameplay. To know when and why invest to accelerate towards said power spikes is absolutely key if you want to play the highest difficulty level - definitely the most rewarding.\n\nAdded perk: an excellent scenario editor. I had the time of my life crafting from scratch epic campaigns for my brother and friends using its gorgeous graphics and the dumb-proof interface.

I'm running Win7 64-bit, and after a bit of digging through the discussions, the game works now.\n\nThe rough jest of getting it to work is....\nSet compatibility to Win XP service pack 2 for both the game and the configuration tool (you'll have to go to the actual .exe files in your steam directory).\nDisable the intro video from the configuration screen\nAlso enable Direct3D, Stretch to Full Screen, and Compatibility Mode from the configuration screen\nDisable the Steam overlay (right click the game title from your list, hit properties, and uncheck the box that allows that annoying shift-tab menu that pops up everytime you play a game)\n\nLast thing I did was...\nOpen up control panel\nClick on system\nClick on advanced system settings\nClick Environment Variables\nClick on path, then click edit (path is likely already highlighted, so you might just have to click edit only)\nAdd (remove the quotations) ";%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam" to the end of whatever is there\n\nAfter following all of those steps, the game runs perfectly for me now. I have yet to encounter a single crash.\n\nTHE GAME ITSELF\n\nI like it. I like it a lot. I'm a big fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic games (well, everything before 5 that is. All the games after that were just disappointing). Good music, the world map still looks very good, despite the game being old. Combat is simple, yet there's subtle tactics to it. An attacking party isn't always the best defending party for your cities. Learn to mix and match the units to achieve your goals.\n\nI paid $1.55 CAD for this game, and I'm playing it far more right now, than games that I spent $20 (also on sale) on.
