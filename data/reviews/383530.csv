Its easy to pick up and tons of fun with 4 players. Once you learn to use the physics to bounce off walls you become much better at manuvering. the retro feels nice without being to much. best played with alteast three players, two can last a little long. mayhem and destruction for everyone. will be playing with friends alot more","August 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The multiplayer part is bad too because it's lacking basic functions like a serverbrowser... the game is just not finished; it's a demo for something that might be a cool multiplayer game...","January 17","false","0.1"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Visually, I dig what what I've seen.  But...\n\nAnd there's a lot but...\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, in this day and age, it's unforgivable to release any PC game like this without either a single player versus some sort of A.I. mode OR online multiplayer support for the intended experience.  The local co-op-only support found in this game reeks of hobbyist game maker software, rendering the game completely worthless for 99% of the intended gaming audience.  Really, who the Hell plays and enjoys local co-op?  Anyone?  I know four-year-olds who despise it.  Unless I'm playing a turn-based retro coin-op like Defender or Pac Man, gimme my own effin' screen:  I'm a big boy now wearing big boy pants ... so get your grimey mitts off my stuff.\n\nThis glaring lack of online multiplayer support  is literally gamebreaking, so don't bother even trying it unless you get it through a tacked-on/add-on in a bundle deal.  If online multiplayer support is added someday, I might update this review accordingly.  I want to like this game.  I can see the potential it has if updated with either a single-player vs. A.I. campaign or with proper online multiplayer support to take advantage of the Steam community - but without those features this game has no value.  Zilch.\n\nThe soundtrack is good.  The Devs. should bundle the soundtrack seperately and sell it for a buck or two, then use the proceeds to update the game accordingly.\n\nAVOID.","July 23, 2015","false","2.8"," 16 of 81 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","16","81","0","11"

I got this from a bundle awhile back, and just now getting to it.  Yes, classic games are still cool to play.  However, in this day of age, games should not be local only, it should have online or AI option.  I am unable to play, as I do not have controllers, nor do I have a second person I can play games with.","April 12","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The two stick controls are the worst I've seen for a long time. There are no instructions of any substance and i get that were creating things in the other players screen but other than that wouldn't have the foggiest of what to do. It's like multiple people playing the same game at different times on the same screen. Plus it looks like one of those unity demos someone has brewed up on a weekend as a pet project and sounds like has added some royalty free track to the background ... Could be good but fails to reach its potential.","April 22","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
