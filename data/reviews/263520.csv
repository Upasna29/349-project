They're the kind of games I'm always on the hunt for, and the games from my youth that I miss the most.\n\nI bought Enola on a whim because it was described as a psychological horror, and I have to say, Enola delivers; the story is intricate and full of moral grey areas which slowly unfold as you explore the environment, the puzzles are well designed and remind me of old school point-and-clicks or classic survival horror games, and the atmosphere is just tense enough to keep you on edge all the way through, even the pacing is executed beautifully.\n\nEnola may not be an action packed game with all the bells and whistles of mainstream titles, but it has a slight retro charm (in all the best ways) which brings me back to playing my favorite horror titles as a kid. For an indie game, and clocking in at over six hours of gameplay, it is well worth the price point. If you're a fan of retro horror point-and-clicks or psychological horror titles, you will love this. If Silent Hill 2 and Gone Home had an indie child, it would be this game.","November 23, 2014","true","9.2"," 49 of 63 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","49","63","0","0"

But anyone who wants to compare this game to Gone Home, Dear Esther, Myst, Silent Hill ... I think that's missing the point. Heck, I could add Alan Wake to the list for the 42 lamps (like the pages) to collect, and for the heavy flashlight usage. But I won't.\n\nThis is primarily an exploration game, yes, but it features a dark plot with a load of sensitive issues that are nonetheless, somehow, managed with enough care that you can tell the devs mean well even as the villains DON'T.\n\nThere is a lot of intentional ambiguity regarding the past tragedies in the two characters' lives. You play as Enola, and you eventually learn about her past in straightforward detail. But it seems Angelica has a far more strange, and unique, history of tragedies. The game constantly makes reference to her "problem," but is it only the visible problem on the surface? Or is there more?\n\nAbsolutely worth playing.

This game, Enola, takes the narrative to whole new level. I wouldn't call it just a story though, nor just a mystery, or even just horror game either. It is a look at what happens when evil propagates in those who are the victims of evil. And it does it beautifully. I have found myself thinking about the meaning behind this game (and how often have I done that? Not a lot I can assure you) ever since I began playing it yesterday. It reminds me of a very good novel with twists, turns, interpretations and perceptions playing into how one sees the game. The graphics and art are magnificent. and more creepy than I am able to put into words. I felt like I was wandering the halls of a mad inventers haunted house much of the time. My only grip with the game is the difficulty I had opening doors at times BUT that might be my computer mouse as I think it might be glitching out on me. All in all this game deserves a look if you enjoy horror, good stories, and mystery. To say more might ruin it.

Enola is one of those games that isn't going to be remembered for it's graphics, or framerate, or anything really game related. Enola is a psychological horror game (to me at least so far) that's all about exploring the darkness of the mind of your girlfriend, Angelica, and discovering what the mind does to you after a series of terrible events. Without giving t much aware, Angelica went through some pretty godawful things in her past, and it's haunted her to this day, so far that she descends into madness, and you, Enola, have to take a step into that madness to save the woman you love.  Now, off the bat, this game doesn't look as good most, and the sound isn't great, but for what the game is going for in terms of: creating a world that makes no sense and isn't for the weak of willed, or stomachs. The game throws you into creepy mannequin ladies, an eerie island, and cryptic clues scattered everywhere as to what's going on. From what I've played through so far, it's an interesting game with a lot of interesting ideas, even if it could look better. The controls are a bit stiff, but my experience so far has been a great build-up to whatever resolution lies as the end of this mystery. If you want a dark but interesting thriller kind of game, I reccommend this so far. I don't know if this will be my final opinion though,  so I can't completely confirm it yet, but so far it's be enjoyable enough to reccommend to others!","November 6, 2014","true","4.0"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

I mean even with the brightness all the way up, it's impossible to see where you're going in some parts. That wouldn't have been a deal breaker, but it means that navigating to the next part of the game becomes virtually impossible. We simply could not find our way no matter how much we looked around.\n\nEnola seemed okay at first, with a decent atmosphere and a curious story. But aside from the inability to see, the puzzles Enola offers up are extremely simple, rendering that part of the game a bit boring. It's an exploration game that's too dark to properly explore, and a puzzle game with no challenge, and that's not a mix I can recommend.","June 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Get over it, boys and girls!  Are we seriously at a stage in human development where art forms purporting to work in the "horror" genre need to wear kid gloves?  For ♥♥♥♥'s sake.  GROW UP.  On to the next non-controversy, then...\n\nYes, this is basically just a "walking simulator", with a couple of tricky puzzles, a bit of timing-based "trap" avoidance, a couple of enemies to outrun or hide from, and a tiny bit of "combat" governed by quick-time button mashing.  So why I am about to give it a pretty decent review?  'Cause within these confines, and given its obvious low-budget/"indie" credentials, IT'S REALLY GOOD.  It's moody, atmospheric, interesting, and even has a couple of decent "jump scares" for added measure.  Is it going to frighten the bejesus out of you more than, say, Outlast?  No.  Not on an immediate, "superficial" level, certainly.  Is it going to completely change/"shatter" your world?  Probably not, unless you're one of the big babies I alluded to in the first paragraph of this review.  It's a game, it's a short game, but it's a GOOD game.  Not earth-shattering...but good.  Solid.  Well worth playing.  Possibly not worth the full asking price of $14.99, so you may want to wait for a sale.  But if you want a genuinely intriguing - if largely derivative - "indie" horror game with a bit of a story, you can do a heck of a lot worse than this.  Plus, as an added bonus, it has LESBIANS, if that's the kind of thing that floats your boat (though it's not quite as good as Gone Home, just for the record, and the end "boss battle" is just straight-up ♥♥♥♥ing LUDICROUS).\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","June 7, 2015","true","7.2"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","35","60","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/263520/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Enola is a game developed by The Domaginarium, and puts you into the shoes of Enola, the lover of Angelica, right before you go through an emotional, twisted, dark vortex. You will have to take on the projected world of Angelica as you learn what has happened to her, throughout her life, and what twists and pitfalls have shape her life to what it is today. This is not a game for the weak of heart, and this is definitely a game that deals with mature subjects.\n\nGraphically I have to say that this game is about on par for the first person horror/thriller type of game. You will find yourself in a monastery, a house, a bar, and other locations, all of them created out of Angelica's fears, nightmares, and emotional roller coaster. I do have to say that even though the graphics didn't blow me away, there was something about those moments of catching stuff out of the corner of your eye that will definitely keep you on high alert.\n\nMost of the sounds in the game are ambient sounds, or those of things you definitely need to be careful around. One that seemed  to catch me off guard a couple of times was the sound of the spinning blade that happened to be in a wall, right around the next corner. There are times of music, but its in the background, and definitely comes off with a creepy vibe. Sounds are both your friend and most definitely one of the things you will dread to hear as you go through the game.\n\nThe controls are pretty straight forward. You are going to be using the WASD setup to move, the mouse to move the camera, and of course the left mouse button for interactions.\n\nAlright so I had no idea what I was going to get myself into when I started this game. There was a moment of this should be interest, its someone's nightmare. What I didn't know is that this person is probably the most scarred individual that I have ever had to deal with. This is a game a layers, and throughout the entire thing you are peeling away layer after layer, what you find is more knowledge about your girlfriend/lover, but you also find out how messed up and tragic her life has been. There are definitely some VERY dark topics that are brought up through the game, so you better be secure in dealing with uncomfortable situations or topics that befall a girl as she is growing up.\n\nOne of the things I liked and disliked about this game is that it definitely gave you that slightly open world feel to it. Sure there was a world with boundaries, but there was definitely also the ability to go explore it all if you want to before really advancing the story. That being said, this philosophy also seems to apply to the areas that are meant to further the story. There is a lot of stuff that you might miss, small objects on the floor or seen if only you looked at  a slightly different angle in order to advance the story. Too many times I found myself going in big circles in an area trying to desperately find that one thing that I missed, or perhaps more than one thing, that will help me move on with the game. I understand that this is supposed to be suspenseful, and scary, but it became a bit too agitating at certain moments when the items required for a solutions were a little too well tucked away.\n\nThere are a couple of bugs too that might get to you, if you are not careful, but the developer has been really good about releasing new patches out to clean up the bugs as they solve them. That is not to say that this is a buggy game, its just when you find a bug its kind of hard not to notice.\n\nOh and here's the biggest thing that I found frustrating about the game. I don't think the developer knew where to put in checkpoints in the game, so they are bunched together in very random places. There was a series of three of them, where I was literally walking down a couple of halls, no outside action ever occurring. Then in the next segment of the game, in a place that they would be useful in case you forget about the spinning blade at the next corner, it would be nice to have so that I didn't have to do the 5 minutes leading up to that one part.\n\nSo here's the deal, if you are willing to get lost in a game, and have the patience to find your way out especially when the answer is 100% clear, you will enjoy getting creeped out by this game. I'm not going to lie this game is definitely rough around the edges, but there was something about it that made me want to come back to it. I'm think it was the tragic story of the lover, and a sense of "god it can't get much worse for this girl, can it?" So with that let me deal out a score, and that score is going to be a 7.1 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","23","38","0","0"

Steer clear from it. This will probably trigger your past moments. I know there are people in this world who are victims of such things, and playing this made it feel so real. I'm not kidding.\n\nRight. Now onto the review.\n\nEnola is a psychological story about your girlfriend named Angelica. You play as Enola, and yes you're a girl, and I'm talking about the girl on girl lesbian love, not best friend love. About Angelica...let's just say she did not have a pleasant past.\n\nGraphics:\nI love the detail of the objects and stages in the game. The only problem, however, are the human figures you come across. They were kinda weird and didn't sync right. I find that the areas get more disturbing in Nightmare Mode than Normal Mode. It's not gorey based or anything, but has some blood in it and pictures that will easily burn into your brain. Other than that, the areas of the game give it more of a vintage style with a hint of steampunk.\n\nVoice Acting:\nThe voice acting is pretty good. Whoever did Angelica's voice did a great job, especially when it comes to expressing her sorrow and anger. Astrid's voice sounds a bit weird...like an evil teenage high school student-type voice. Enola's voice acting was okay, except at the beginning of the ending, it sounded like she just recited her lines. However, her crying and screaming were good. Finally, "The Monster's" voice acting was spot-on perfect. The guy really put himself in the game there, acted like a monster for sure. Out of all the voice actors, I'd pick him to be the best.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game has a small, yet simple inventory system. It counts the lamps you come across during the game, as they reveal a little extra at the end of the good ending. As for the difficulty curve, it's more of a "spike up" at certain times, as a few times you'll feel so stumped that you may have to search or check for guides for help.\n\nIn the game, you come across choices of murdering certain people, which will affect the ending. The game as a save feature, where you interact with Music Boxes to save. There is a battle system. Randomly, you come across shadowy figures and you must click the mouse and mash the W,A,S,D keys to defend yourself.\n\nWith the recent update, it has two modes: Normal and Nightmare. Nightmare mode is like a small expansion pack with increase difficulty and to collect crystals, which will reveal Angelica's and Enola's moments together. Collecting crystals will affect the ending as well.\n\nThe problem I have with this game is the constant bugs. So far, there is only one gamebreaking bug and one bug that is fixable using the console. Otherwise, most bugs are either aesthetic and/or annoyances that can kill you. Luckily, the game gives you plenty of moments to save. The developer is also active in assisting players to this day (and even assisted me with my guides for the game :D ), which I must give props for. The console is also enabled to help combat the bugs as well or to speed through the game.\n\nStory:\nThe story focuses on Enola and Angelica. As I said, Angelica did not have a pleasant past so start to feel here. You play as Enola, her girlfriend. One day, she just disappears, and suddenly you're in a strange world. As you play through the story, you understand Angelica's traumatic past, her parents, and how she met Enola. You come across letters that communicate with you and lamps that reveal Angelica's parent's past and some facts about Enola. I could reveal more, but I think the first paragraph at the beginning of the review will give you an idea of what it is like.\n\nOverall:\nRegardless of the many bugs and some strange stuff with the graphics, Enola is an indie horror game that shines. What makes the game awesome is the immersive story and great voice acting that makes you feel for the characters in the story. Most horror enthusiasts think that it takes blood, gore, and disfigured people to make you scared. However, Enola apparently knows which strings to pull to make you feel disturbed, sad, and even scared without the above.\n\nPros:\n-Great horror story.\n-Unique characters.\n-Pretty good graphics.\n-Great voice acting.\n\nCons:\n-Buggy at certain points of the game, but you can still play through without coming across them.\n-Some weirdness in graphics related to human models.\n-Increase of difficulty at certain points of the game.","April 23","true","51.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/recommended/263520/","Hi7ch","Hitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/","307 products in account","Enola is touted as being, and I quote, a psychological adventure game that delves into the inherent darkness of love, death and revenge. Other reviewers claim the game to be both challenging, dark and emotional. Those reviews and this one prove one thing, everything is subjective and opinions are like ♥♥♥-holes, in that we all have one. For those of you who trust my opinion and find it lining up with your own I will bring my recommendation for this game to the very front of this review to save you the kind of time I lost whilst desperately trying to enjoy the experience that is Enola. Do not buy this game, even when it inevitably comes on a sale, do not buy this terrible game. If my recommendation is not enough, or you just wish to read more about my experience and the incredibly small amount of good in Enola, then please read on.\n\nEnola is a game of two halves. One half is a walking game as you explore the mind of the protagonist and the woman she seeks to help. The other half is filled with puzzles reminiscent of my 90s point and click days. The problem is that neither half has gameplay, something I personally enjoy in my video games. Now some will say that this is not your average video game, it is the joyous thing called an ‘experience’ and to a point they would be correct but sadly the developers decided to add gameplay to this ‘experience’ and what they added is nothing short of dull, tedious and instantly forgettable. If Enola was truly an ‘experience’ and did away with the puzzle sections and the, so called, jump-scares then the game would be getting a different review from this writer but it did not and so this is what you get.\n\nLet’s deal with the first half and the majority of what you will be doing whilst playing Enola, walking. You meander around the world of your in-game lovers mind made real, Angelica. It is a dark and sombre place, filled with what would be if seen in your own real life, macabre and tortuous set pieces, fragments of a disturbed and abused mind. It is not a pretty place to be in more ways than one. As I wandered around this world I could easily see how this could have been a scary, tense place filled with shadows and voices haunting you at every corner and around ever pillar. Sadly this never happens because it seems the devs simply do not have the skills required to create the world they wanted to and this is a shame. It is not just the level of graphics in the game, though the Unreal 3 engine is capable of so much more, because whilst graphics do not make a game they do help when it comes to atmosphere. Neither is it the audio, indeed there are various sections where the audio kicks in perfectly and actually throws a couple of chills the players way and the voice acting is extremely good and a cut above everything else. No, the problem lies in direction and game design. The parts are there but they mostly come off as amateur and underfunded and in a game whose sole purpose is to place you in dark and tense moments of horror they fail miserably and make those odd five minutes of genuine fear a weak and uninspired mess. In my humble opinion, Enola needs to lose much of it’s walking and exploration and gain more set pieces with a concentrated focus on tight and tense moments.\n\nSadly the second half of the game is no better, the puzzle section. Be warned, there are some spoilers ahead should you choose to purchase this game despite my warnings.\n\nPuzzles are like Marmite in that some love them and some loathe them. I admit that I am in the latter camp unless they form an actual part of the game and are not, as they often are, just thrown in to spread the game out regardless of game style or relation to the main story. Unfortunately the puzzles in Enola are merely there in an attempt to add some kind of game to the meandering of the first half. At least one puzzle did actually fit with the narrative, one based around Hours, Weeks and Days but again the lack of direction shows and the answer is given to you directly at the side of said puzzle. It became less a puzzle and more a “oh, I read this for the answer without doing anything”. In short it became instantly redundant. Other puzzles include moving various dials, pressing various buttons and generally doing nothing that has not been done before in a million previous and equally painful games. One particular ‘mind bender’ that bothered me the most was a room filled with numbers and a small clue chalked on the floor where you get to pick two numbered buttons from several available. As it turned out you had to choose the prime numbers despite nothing ever being mentioned that Angelica was a Math nerd or that she had any interest in Math whatsoever. It was just random. It was as if the developers pulled the puzzle out of thin air, which I am fairly sure they did. It did not fit, barely any of the puzzles fit with the narrative and those few that do are so easy they may as well not exist at all.\n\nI played the game on the new Nightmare mode which supposedly gives you more revelations about a traumatic past, new areas to explore and three new endings. This at least shows that the developer is seemingly continuing to expand and improve the game though I cannot say exactly how much content this adds because I only ever played this new mode and I cannot tell you if the ending was good, bad or which one I ended up with because I never finished the game. Over four hours in and I simply gave up. I tried, I really did, but after four hours of wandering, doing pointless puzzles and going over the same area three to four times in a vain effort to find the next chapter of my experience I found that I simply no longer cared what happened to the protagonist, her lover or any other party in the game. Yes, I did at some small point experience remorse for what these girls had been put through and I get that Angelica was sent on a rampage of torture and death after experiencing her pain and others but it was not enough to keep me caring past the faults of the game. I, like her, just wanted it to end but unlike poor Angelica I could simply turn it off, un-install it and with luck never venture back into her Universe.\n\nSo, we end up back to my own personal recommendation for this game. Should you buy it? Whilst I do understand that this may be a first game for the Devs and it is probably a learning experience that with luck they will take in and gain from I simply cannot suggest to anyone to purchase Enola. It drips with ideas and it does have around twenty minutes of actual tense moments in the four plus hours I played but this game is not worth actual money. In my opinion the game should be free and used heavily as a learning tool and then maybe a few more games down the line they can come up with something worth both your time and your hard earned cash. As it stands, if you want jump-scares, if you want tension, if you want a story that drags you to its conclusion, buy something else.

While playing, I thought how fitting the "Shadow of Memories" graphics would have been for this game.\n\nDream come true though! This game wins my heart for bringing a female character into horror - even with selectable costumes! Fantastic!\n\nBut that's exactly where my next point of criticism comes in. I read about the problems that made this game go for first-person camera in the community hub, but I wish it wasn't.\nWhy would I need a pretty character and costumes if I can only look in one mirror throughout the whole game? I feel like this choice is my biggest issue with "Enola".\nSome moments truly felt like typical Silent Hill camera opportunities. Maybe the mix between chase cam and fixed perspective like in Silent Hill 3 would have been perfect.\n\nThe story itself is really interesting and unfolds itself after only a couple of minutes. I liked the ideas and the risk of it all. I actually ran through most parts of this game, just because I was scared that something would happen. The melancholic and dark mood really makes it worth playing. There are some really annoying, tough parts in it, but that's how games should be from time to time.\n\nI hope that the team will continue to work on Enola so it can keep up with the big names here on Steam. It has all that it takes to be a horror hit!","March 9, 2015","true","4.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","2"

I quite enjoy this game. It very much feels like playing the exploration parts of a Silent Hill game. There are few or no monsters early on and while you can die, usually exploring is rewarded instead of punished. The game uses a save point system, which I don't particularly like but there are enough of them and they are easy to find (due to a sound clue in the game).\nThe puzzles aren't too difficult but sometimes require some thought. Things like the movemtn, controls, and clipping could be more polished. The story itself is interesting and sometimes disturbing though I'm still waiting to be hooked by the main character.\nYou basicallly spend the game following your girlfriend through a nightmare about her past.\n\nDisclosure: I received a copy of the game for free via #gamesmatter on twitter.","November 1, 2014","true","1.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It looked like a good horror game from all the previews and images.\n\nI'll start with the good. The atmosphere is good, makes you think anything can jump out at you at any moment. It's a pretty game too. Control mechanics are simple, mouse to examine/use, shift to sprint, etc.\n\nNow for the bad. Mouse sensitivity is crazy fast and there's no way you can adjust it. Brightness settings really doesn't make anything brighter, just adds a white sheen to everything. There are notes that are supposed to explain the story/help you solve puzzles, but they're extremely vague. One of the puzzles was terrible because once you tried and failed, you were immediately killed with no warning and the only way to solve it was through trial and error at least 10 or more times.  The game is also apparently not very long because I tried to look up a guide to the puzzle described above and all I could ever find was half hour video guides. The story would've been good if it hadn't been so spread out and worded so vaguely.\n\nOverall, I would honestly not recommend this game to anyone.","January 31","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play as Enola, a woman who is searching  through what seems to be her girlfriend, Angelica's subconcious. Along the way you learn of some very disturbing and terrible events in Angelica's life that caused her to get locked away in her own thoughts.\n\nWhen the game tells you that some parts of the game are disturbing and cruel, they aren't talking about small blood splatters. There is torture, nudity, and plenty of examples of the darker side of human sexuality which add more depth to the game than triggering content.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are rather clever, changing up the style and raising the stakes with each completion. If you like to think outside the box, this game will fit with your style of thinking. Some puzzles are as simple as "put this on that thing" or "press these three buttons", and other take a bit more though using subtle clues in notes and in the world itself.\n\nI did only play the basic game and didn't attempt nightmare mode, so your experience could possibly change completely if you attempt to conquer that beast. It was a twisted ride that i'm glad I got off, but could see myself coming back to in the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P70Zwbi7YdU&index=1&list=PL02MF-8t55wPOClvQaRHL-jbD7hWGdNOX","November 8, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awesam/recommended/263520/","awesam","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awesam/","2093 products in account","Story:\nAbsorbing and cleverly written, vague enough at times that it makes you think. As expected for the genre, the subject matter is quite saddening and grotesque. And it is better not to tell anything more about it, because the more you know the less of an experience it will be to play.\n\nGraphics:\nAtmospheric and somewhat surreal in design, the game has some style. But technically it's a mixed bag. Some lightning effects and 3D models look really nice, but there are quite a few low resolution textures and some low polygon 3D models. It is not quite what you would expect from a game running on Unreal Engine. The few cut-scenes that are in the game are somewhat awkwardly animated.\n\nSound and Music:\nGreat sound design overall, music and ambient sounds are varied and well done. The voice acting is good and particularly the performance later in the game is great. The voice acting in the early part of the game might appear a bit "weird", but there is a reason for it without spoiling the story.\n\nGameplay:\nEnola is a first person story centric adventure game. Most of the game you are exploring the environment, unraveling the story, finding items, solving puzzles, avoiding traps and with a few action events thrown in. Basically imagine a mix between Gone Home and Amnesia from a gameplay perspective.\n\nSome of the puzzles were a bit too obscure and difficult to figure out, a common problem with many adventure games. But after some feedback the developer has changed some of the puzzles to make  them easier, more logical or include more hints.\n\nTechnicalities:\nThere were some game breaking bugs on launch, but the issues were quickly adressed and fixed, so make sure to verify your game cache to have the latest build. The developer has been very active on the forums and open for feedback, and is working on adding more content, trading cards and achievements. Some minor issues remain as time of writing, like the awkward crouch mechanics and glitches with the sound/brightness volume suddenly resetting.\n\nConclusion:\nThis was the very first crowd funded game I decided to back about 2 years ago. It has been interesting to see how this project developed from a concept to a full game. It's a shame the game did not get more funding because it would have improved the production values.\n\nAs is the game will certainly appeal to a specific niche of gamers. The story, atmosphere and sounds are the main selling points. Enola is surprisingly long for an indie adventure game (depends mostly on how good you are at solving puzzles), and the developer is working on adding more endings and content so there will be even more replay value. My steam timer says 22 hours, but in reality I estimate it took about 15-17 hours (playing through the first time, not counting time the game was paused, or that I had to replay parts because of the early launch issues).\n\nVerdict:\nThere will certainly be polarizing opinions about this game. Mainly because Enole has little action, and lacks technical polish. But if you can look past the issues, then I would recommend this to everyone that likes horror themed adventures.","September 27, 2014","true","33.2"," 18 of 57 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","18","57","0","0"

The gameplay is boring and don't give the player any sense of purpose or direction. I didn't managed to find any enemy,","March 14","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How do you make an effort to make a game with an elaborate story, interesting concept and then obviously not thoroughly test your trap puzzles. I get something being hard, but when just touching a column (without it crushing you, or touching the spikes) kills you and you make timing extemely tight and critical AND you can't precisely guage (due to first-person) your character's location or exact height... thanks for wasting my time to even get into this game, and then putting in a portion that I would have to carefully study your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programming/design (nothing to do with skill), just to get past one point...","April 29","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean, not the fact your girlfriend was ♥♥♥♥♥ and brutally beaten, but the story takes this game to a whole new level. Being able to personally relate to the story also makes it much more enjoyable. Gameplay was amazing. Nice mix of a dark atmosphere, spooky music and jump scares. But besides a story rich game it has the rep to be bug rich. I have never come across any bugs playing this game ssooooo there's that. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone.","April 28","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I can give props for the plot, I'm not interested in stomaching the actual meat of the game to find it. I've played it only a little less than an hour at this point, but its production value traps any depth it might have in the realm of the Lifetime Original Movie. I honestly believe that this game should never have been sold; free download perhaps. I would have just stuck it on an HDD and never released it at all.\n","June 5","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
