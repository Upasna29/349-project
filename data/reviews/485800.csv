"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AaronToaster/recommended/485800/","AaronToaster","NevetCS | Boosted","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AaronToaster/","40 products in account","TLDR:\nThis is an OK game/visual novel about a group of individuals with some goal (it isn\'t too clear) after a war that happened 600 or so years prior. It involves runes and stuff of the sort. To my knowledge, it has some choice but I don\'t think it has much of an outcome on the story as of now. It\'s free and doesn\'t take long to read, so it isn\'t like you are wasting several hours on a half-decent story. The art design is pretty good and the music is repetitive. No settings can be changed. Overal score: 6.5/10\n\nPros:\n+Free\n+Only takes ~30 to 40 minutes to read (I dunno, I was writing this review while reading it.)\n+Great art style\n+Pokes fun at itself (i.e. explains a character even though he was called an \"insignificant bookworm\". The game then says that it\'s just \"setting up the stage\". Two of the characters are narrators, so they have an excuse to break the fourth wall.)\n+Fairly detailed\n+Credits actually look kinda cool\n\nNeutral:\n=Some choice- however it is obvious which one is the better because it either has not effect, a +1, or a -1 right next to the option.\n=Mediocre soundtrack- its just the same few chords being looped.\n=Some terms may be difficult for younger audiences to understand.\n=The story is okay, but it doesn\'t really resonate.\n=The story explains circumstances at awkward times.\n=There are times when it seems like a choice should be made but no option appears. However, in other times a choice can be made that doesn\'t really need to be there.\n=Convenient changes in plot are convenient. Characters conviently claim nothing is wrong while others conveniently say that something is wrong. The story conveniently ends on a plot twist.\n\nCons:\n-No way to change settings- so you are locked in a window with music that you can\'t really adjust. However, the window can be changed size by dragging the corners, but if not done correctly, the images will be stretched awkwardly.\n-People have rectangular monitors. Don\'t use square images and a square window when making a game.\n-Dialog is iffy- it isn\'t the most believable but I guess it sort of fits the \"time frame\" or \"style\" that the developers were going for.\n-Displays the actions for the characters as -(action)-. For example, it would appear as -Clears his throat-. It may get meshed together with what they are saying and it may become confusing.\n-If you missed some text, it is impossible to go back to it if you did not save beforehand.\n-Once you start skipping text, stopping it is a bit buggy. I misclicked it in the settings menu and ended up missing out potential key parts of the story.","May 31","true","0.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

I do enjoy a wide variety of game types, and have far more hours of game time in general than I'll ever admit to my wife (most of it pre-dating Steam). So, since I cannot review this game against its genre, I'll review it for the experience overall.\n\nThe long and the short, I'd give it a 3/5, considering that it is a first release and a trial run for the developer.\n\nI won't lay out any spoilers about the story itself, but I will talk a bit about the game content. If you want to be fully surprised by what's to come in this story, stop reading now, go play first, then come back.\n\n\nThe Story - 3/5\nThe story itself was interesting. There was nothing very original in the concepts laid out, but it was still a fun read. In this Part One, as the developer already told us in the release video, we only get a taste for what is to come. It could have used an editor with strong written English skills to fix the punctuation and grammar in several places, but there is nothing so broken as to be unreadable or not understood.\n\nArt Work - 5/5\nThe character and background artwork are both wonderfully done. I'm not sure what more I can say about that, I really enjoyed them!\n\nSoundtrack - 4/5\nI think there were three tracks throughout the whole: a common background, a battle track, and a suspenseful track for the cliffhanger. For the length of the overall story I thought this played out nicely. The only thing I didn't care for was the transition between. It was fairly jarring to me moving from the common track to either of the others. The suspenseful track could have been a bit longer. I read at the pace of the text cursor for the most part, and the track had just turned its first loop as I was finishing up reading the last bit of text. If it lasted five to ten seconds longer it would have lined up with the text. A small thing, but it did jump out at me.\n\nMechanics - 2/5\nThe mechanics are very limited. Having only played through once I honestly don't know what function they served. I will play through at least once more choosing different options to see how it changes the story, if at all. Since the developer said this is only a taste of what's to come I'm currently chalking this up to "future use", where the choices you make now will impact the story later down the road (thinking Chrono Trigger trial). Also, having the effect of the choice listed right there on the choice seems odd. Again though I'm new to this genre, maybe that's a norm? The only thing I can compare to is the same mechanic employed in some D&D RPGs, where the choice affects your alignment and NPC response, and part of the game is figuring out which choices to make when. Anyway, starting to ramble... In summary, I found the single limited mechanic to be unnecessary.\n\nConfiguration - 2/5\nVery little in the way of configuration. All forms and dialogs had default icons, and dialogs felt "out of the box", not skinned/incorporated. Very rough/alpha feel, but again I think that's what this was intended to be in the developer's grand scheme. First release, feeling out their future a bit. Would still be nice to see some cleanup in a patch. For a story game I would expect immersion is key from start to finish, so incorporating all of the small elements is mundane, but would make a significant difference. Also, should go for a widescreen aspect ratio, not square. I say this again for the same of immersion. If I can't fill up my screen I'm being distracted by what else is going on.\n\n\nI hope that was useful to you. I think this was my first review on Steam as well, so if you've time/inclination please give me feedback on the review.","June 1","true","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
