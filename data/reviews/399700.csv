The developer states on the page that the game is "at its core, a critique of the modern world and of the perverting nature of a consumer, profit-obsessed society". I'm not sure how capturing a photograph of a kid who is masturbating and posting the resulting photograph around the school does anything like that, but that is what the first portion of the game is focused on. To achieve this goal you must trick people, lie, and steal. These actions continue to follow your character as you progress through the game. Your character is angry at the world for a handicap of sight where he can see only shades of grey. He doesn't seem to learn anything through the course of the game and delights in arguing with people and belittling opinions who doesn't agree with or understand. When he isn't making any progress with a love interest he resorts to lying to her and he is willing to frame a co-worker to make his lies come true.\n\nLeaving the content aside, the execution is underwhelming. There are no sound assets in the game. The music, which loops constantly, is very nicely played piano music. While I can appreciate the music, the lack of sound assets makes it difficult to immerse yourself in the game. Many of the scenes are extremely constrained. There are no decent indications of what you can interact with, you have to wave the cursor around to find them. The dialog with other characters can be extremely contrived and you are left replaying them over and over in an attempt to finally get the correct sequence to progress. I had to redo one interaction at least 20 times to get through it to get a necessary item so I could move on. That is terrible game design for a narrative-driven adventure game and completely destroys the immersion of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game, but I will finish it for curiosities sake.","May 13","false","2.9"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Costinux/recommended/399700/","Costinux","Crusty Nuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Costinux/","1007 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Sylvain Seccia for providing the key for review purposes.\nIn this game you get to see the world through a kid whose name is Désiré. He can't see any colors because of the disability that he has. With that in mind, he's always sad and confused as everyone makes fun of his handicap. It starts with him being twelve years old and develops around him growing up and letting you see how he changes his beliefs as the time passes. But wait, this game is not only a sad one, it has a lot of funny and twisted moments.\nYou've been warned, the game will play with your heart a lot!\nWhile playing, I have to tell you that I've found myself in this character so many times. I've had the same problems, the same confusions... The fact that this game exists, it warms my heart. I'm really proud I've had the chance to play this game and I will always remember it.\n\nPros- The puzzles in the game are a bit challenging, as you have to think logical about what you need to do next.\n- I love the fact that in this game you can have access to another game through Désiré's computer, how should this be called? Gameception! Did you get it!? No?... Well, let's move on.\n- A save system which let's you save at any time in the game.\n- The awesome piano music will hold you company the entire game.\n- The artwork is very detailed. You can see how the developers put a lot of hard work in it.\n- A great animation. Every character in the game has his own 'gesturing', which will make you laugh most of the times.\n- The game has 5-8 hours of fun, depression and craziness.\n- A complex story which develops around you (with many twisted moments!).\n- A lot of characters to talk to. And I mean... A LOT!\n- You have the chance to seduce your senpai!\n\nCons- Doesn't have support for Achievements, Trading Cards and Steam Cloud.\n- Has a few typos here and there.\n- Only the cutscene from the beginning of the game has voices in it, which is a kinda bummer for me, I've really loved the hard work which they've put in the trailer. If the game updates with voices over, I'm sure as hell that I'm going to replay every last bit of it again.\n\nConclusionWhile the game doesn't have any sound assets in it, it does a great job at capturing your attention. The story of the game is one that deserves praises, as you can see how the character changes and develops while the story progresses. You get to remember how was being a kid feel like, how confusing it was to start knowing what's like to have feelings for a person, what you're gonna do impress her... Or just how annoying it was to be bullied in school. I'm recommending this game because it's a realistic piece of art that we need in our life.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

This game attempts to deliver that question in a serious but gentle way. Desire represents the dilemma all human beings face. In this game that dilemma is the human condition itself....loneliness,rejection,justice and forgiveness. Desire weaves these themes marvelously throughout. The music soundtrack was brilliant. I was mesmerised by it. Some of the themes in the game are decades ahead of where most people are at the present time.","May 24","true","9.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the game delves into every aspect of human sexuality and morality, even some aspects that could be considered taboo or perversions, with remarkable candor. At its core, the story is about Désiré's desire to see the world around him in color as the boy was born with achromatopsia and can only see in shades of gray. He views his condition as a disability that stands in the way of what he wants to accomplish in life and this affects how he interacts with the people around him and the choices he ultimately makes. The story reminds me a lot of Oliver Sacks' and Robert Wasserman's "The Case of the Colorblind Painter" in how depressed Désiré becomes but ultimately comes to terms with his state in life.\n\nThe gameplay consists of inventory-based puzzles and is sometimes linear to a fault with progression tied to specific dialog triggers. At the time I played, there were still quite a few game ending bugs. Navigation is done through point-and-click, there is no voice narration aside from the beginning and there are only four save game slots. There are also a few unfair puzzles, such as random sports trivia and a "feminist ideology" session which can become quickly annoying as it is based on trial and error logic and not actual clues found in the game. The art and music are very good, but the imagery and dialog can be quite shocking at times (nowhere near Fran Bow level, but still disturbing).","May 24","true","8.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The lack of color may make the game seem dull at a first glance, but it matches well with the colorblind character. This game has some informative facts in it, as well as some adult themes. It mentions nudity, masturbation, homosexual subjects, pedophiles(give or take), and some other topics. If you are sensitive to any of them or these wouldn't be suitable for you, then I would not recommend it.\n\nI like some of the character development and the scenery for places are lovely. The opening to the game doesn't really have a connection to the rest of 1993, and the game skips a lot of years to bring you to different settings with different characters. I was often confused with where the new characters came from, how Desire got where he is, what the purpose is of doing everything, etc. etc. At least, this is how felt after 2003. So, things may not make much sense while playing through.\n\nThis game DOES have creativity and the storyline isn't as cliche. I question Desire's character development as well as why the ending is so important to understand it all. I'll play through to reach it and figure out why, but I'd rather have sense of what's going on so I won't lose interest. The playthrough tends to be aggravating at some points because of the lack of walkthroughs and guides. Hopefully, this won't be an issue if the game reaches more popularity.\n\nBut this is definitely a recommendation. Very good point-and-click styled game.","May 28","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989132185/recommended/399700/","76561197989132185","trash","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989132185/","390 products in account","There is an interesting dialectic between comedy and tragedy. Often their content is the same, in the sense that they refer to the same absurdity. They differ, though, in how we deal with them, perhaps due to a matter of proximity and intensity. The closer a tragic event get to us, and with its increasing severity, one loses the comedic quality. Then we have the sequential comedy-tragedy process, whereby you start with comedy and end up with tragedy once the severity of the situation is recognized. A silly gesture can be laughed at, until the circumstance reveals a person in pain, the inauguration of going into conniption, or immense sadness. The case is rarely clear cut. And it is ironically rarely black and white, life is not prone to contradistinction or a true dialectic between negative and positive, it lives through nuance.\n\nDésiré is indeed a somewhat poetic game. It characterizes itself through achromatism and occasional spurts of poetry and life-lessons. In this universe achromatopsia is not a physiological or anatomical fact, but an ephemeral affliction that can be cured with mere Will. And this is the protagonist's purpose, to combat the scale of gray interlaced in our societal structures. To question norms and to belittle authority through provocation and sexual deviancy and otiose contrarianism.\n\nAt what point would we recommend we stop for a moment of introspection, to interrogate ourselves regarding whether or not we are, through our questioning of norms and desperate fight against the gray, do not in the same light distort what we'd otherwise genuinely consider ourselves. Does not the unwillingness to conform, while its intention being to expand the confines of our freedom, in the same lines posit restrictions on it. As we avoid or strive towards new ways of attaining freedom, or fight the supposed inhibitors of our freedom (the patriarchy, the capitalist scum, etc, etc), do we not abolish our genuine selves, our wills and actual dreams, and put our behavior in strictures akin to those we oppose?\n\nWe do think about it, and even if we do not, we feel it. For some it creates a world of contrast, a world that can be partitioned up into good constriction and bad constriction, where the difference lie only in what could vaguely and sloppily be called your emotional inclination. And this game runs its mouth on a thin line in between it all. One part of heavy critique is met with dismissive clichés, while others are met with futile argumentation for the sake of progression at some points, at others to deliver a message to the player.\n\nThe player assume the role of a pessimist, a sort of helpless cynic, and through him, in his interaction with the other characters, we are met with a confusing mix of messages. As is stated on the store page, the game is in part meant to be a critique. But can we claim that this critique is valid? That it is insightful? Or even that it is clear enough to calcify into something tangible? Despite having given my full attention to every piece of dialog I cannot claim that I understand the game's position. But it is also unclear as to whether this was the point or not.\n\nMoralizing is indeed simple when no position is claimed for yourself. Because all the emotional garbage that is reified through religion and ideology is easy to pick on, even the cynical point of view, even the Marxist-economical materialist point of view. Is the game trying to claim that this is the problem of society? Emotional bias is in the heart of stupidity and ideological engagement, and in its expressiveness it opens up vulnerability, it braces for the deluge of ridicule by its own volition.\n\nThe cynical disengage from discourse, as a hatred from the sideline, is fairly useless, even if it sometimes elucidates the stupidity of those that try, of those who scramble for dabs of color. And this demarcates the behavioral trait of cowardice. And this Désiré expresses with clarity in its final moments. Which was appreciated, but jarringly at odds with the game's over all position and attitude. Perhaps with a bit more time, with a character arch that was given more flesh, this would not have felt jarring in the way that it did. Then again, what jolts one out of achromatism might be something radical, something done with swiftness of a dot warped into a line (“Run lines, never plot a point! Speed turns the point into a line!”); I would not know. Désiré does, in any case, mingle with the idea, one among many.\n\nFor what this game succeeds in is provocation. I'm sure a person that identifies more with the particular ideologies or their antithesis would surely find some problems in this game. It plays with Internet-culture and their presuppositions, and make their clichéd reiterations into dialog-options. This urges me to put forth a following saying, if it at all pertains to anyone I am unsure, but still: once you've witnessed your position in argument about X be made into dialog tree, you can with a fair amount of certainty assume that it is clichéd, far from well-informed and most likely lacking in vital nuance. Even more so if your point of view can be made into a low level puzzle in a not very difficult point-and-click adventure game. This refers to a moment in the game where you engaged in discussion with a character in order to gain their trust in order to X, Y and Z, as these games usually present themselves.\n\nThis leads us nicely into the gameplay. There is a logic to games like this. Tool-objects have to more or less creatively be seen as efficacious objects. Point-and-click games live in a teleological world. This might not be true for all of them, but Désiré often had a very clear approach to this teleology. The scenes were not cluttered with irrelevant items for the current purposes, but still had the satisfaction of revelation once the dots were connected, once the correlation was spotted. Every item or circumstance, with a few exceptions, adumbrated their solution well, at times ham-fisted, at others with a slight delay, causing the satisfaction of intrasubjective discovery. Unfortunately there were a few moments where I assume the game wasn't working as intended, where the solution was X, and despite me doing X multiple times, was not registered by the game until a seemingly random amount of tries where the scene played out itself. At most this was 10-15 minutes, I believe, where I was stuck and where I started to feel frustrated with the experience. Other than that, it ran smoothly with a decent amount of satisfaction.\n\nAt moments I almost wished for a highlight around pertinent items, but as mentioned above, it was not cluttered enough to really need it, and might have just been my general sense of impatience. Désiré was in fact simply enough drawn fairly simply, in the vein of something like Edna & Harvey but with its own uniqueness. Every character was unique and memorable enough to make the links between them in the puzzle solving overt, in the same way the items were. This was, in part, I want to claim, due to the way they were designed and drawn. This is even more of a feat considering the black and white aesthetic. But in reality it also leads to there being a lack of things to say about the general tonality and atmosphere of the visual impression I have of this game. It had some nice “camera angles” and compositional elements that were pretty. Moreover, as stated above, the colorlessness has its place, and takes a central role in both the game's story and theme. For a 5-6 hour long game, the question “at what price?” is irrelevant. And once could ask themselves if color would add much in terms of the total experience. It is doubtful.","May 10","true","5.4"," 43 of 84 people (51%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","51","43","84","18","5"

All the issues and problems that people often choose to ignore or forget. It is a game that I highly recommend despite it being repulsive at times. The ending is beautiful and completes a full circle and will leave the player slack-jawed at the craziness of Désiré’s life.\n\nBullied and ostracized, Désiré’s 12 year old way of dealing with his anger is to ‘get back’ at his school bully by taking a picture of the poor kid fapping to a poster of a naked woman that Désiré stole from his dad’s lab. He then prints 50 copies of it using an access card that he obtained by trading illegal porn (and by illegal, I mean underage) with his school priest. The porn he got from his psychiatrist who is supposed to be helping with his social anxiety problems. It escalated very quickly.\n\nBy now, you’re probably wondering who in their right minds would play such a game because it clearly touches are multiple taboo and uncomfortable topics.\n\nDésiré takes on a stoic approach of “this is reality, this ♥♥♥♥ is happening in real life and people actually suffer through this.” The amount of social issues that Désiré touches on could fill a library: Child abuse, mental health, bullying, gender equality, homosexuality, sexual deviance, social anxiety, breakups, even casually brushes over bestiality. It does not glorify these issues but the rather presents them in a way that is perhaps even more shocking. It is realistic.\n\nRead full review on theSebie: http://www.thesebie.com/2016/05/13/review-desire/","May 14","true","7.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"
