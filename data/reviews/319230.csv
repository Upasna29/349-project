The voice acting sounds stilted and forced. The text parser is bad, much worse than the original. With the price of this remake you'd think they would have fewer issues and improved more than just the graphics. Not at all worth the price, even at the 50% off I paid for it.\n\nIf you reallly want it, wait for an 80% off sale. That would be close to the actual value of this game.","December 29, 2014","false","3.5"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","64","73","5","6"

Ok. Nice shiny graphics. Then a horse cart comes along. Its graphics look too CGI, too clean-and-shiny, like the early days of 3D modelling. Think the 7th Guest and Myst1. This is a 2014 game? Maybe if they'd done animated 2D instead of all the wasted effort on the overly clean 3D backdrops? I dunno.\n\nI talk to people in the streets. Badly edited cuts. Again like it was "one-take, we'll edit the pauses out of it in post".\nThis is King's Quest 5 levels of bad voice acting. Are the people supposed to sound like non-native speakers? One of them did sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger, which was pretty awesome.\n\nIt feels like a bad fan remake, except it costs money.\n\nWorth < $5. Possibly $1?","March 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","20","28","2","2"

The voice acting is really dull and liveless. The graphics lack detail. The animations are choppy and ridden with glitches. Overall this game does not do the 80's original justice at all. In fact I recommend playing the original over this one because it still is the better, much more polished game despite its age.","October 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

You'd be better off downloading and emulating the original, because at least that came from old-school Sierra programmers who knew what the hell they were doing.\n\nI really, *really* regret paying money for this game.  Actually, I kind of feel bad that I played this game without getting paid to do so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicr/recommended/319230/","cosmicr","cosmicr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicr/","411 products in account","I was excited when I first heard about this. I was a huge fan of the original Sierra AGI GoldRush from the 80's.\n\nWhen I saw screenshots, I was surprised they looked unfinished and ordinary, but thought, well I'll give it a chance.\n\nWell they weren't unfinished. They were the final images. This game is terrible. There is virtually no improvement from the original. The graphics are truly abysmal.\n\nRemember the game Little Big Adventure(Twinsen's Adventure)? It was released in 1994, 6 years after Gold Rush. The games are nothing alike, however LBA had fantastic graphics for the time. Although, the backdrops had no lighting and were rather static, the characters were rendered in real time, as opposed to pre-rendered sprites.\n\nThis game, had it come out in 1994,  21 years ago, would have been lauded as equally good as LBA. This game has pre-rendered backgrounds, but I'm not sure what graphics package was used to make them. They have zero lighting, and the texture-mapping on objects appears to be flat and unrealistic. The characters and other animated parts are ALL pre-rendered sprites. It is almost impossible to believe that this game came out in 2015.\n\nThe trees look like they're straight from the default settings on a tree generator program, or some stock 3d library tree that's been duplicated throughout. There are so many 'curved' objects in which you can see the facets on the object. These are pre-rendered facets. Why? Haven't they heard of bump mapping, or normal mapping? Or, since it's pre-rendered why not just turn the detail up and leave the renderer on overnight?\n\nThere has been little artistic license taken to improve on the original screens. I am sure the artist(s) have put in at least a little effort into the graphics for this game, but surely at one point someone stepped back and realised how terrible it looks. I really can't understand how, looking at the credits, a team of over 20 people never once thought "is this really an improvement over the original game?"\n\nThe game itself is rather buggy, and counter-intuitive. The voice acting is robotic and stale. I don't have anything nice to say about this game.\n\nIf you're after some nostalgic Sierra adventures, take a look at some of the games made with AGS, such as Heroine's Quest or the AGDI Kings Quest remakes.","September 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","25","45","4","2"

It is a quick game if you've played the original and have a vague recollection of the puzzle solutions, though I suppose the game play is extended if you opt to replay the game taking the 3 different routes to head to California. The graphics are very nice, though I did have to lower the resolution as the screen would flicker. It took a little while to get used to the point and click interface-- if you hold down the mouse button even a moment too long your character will "look" instead of "walk". In a few areas pointer placement is VERY particular when trying to change screens. What I loved, though, was that a double click automatically skipped you to the next screen. If you are a fan of the old sierra games or adventure gaming in general, you will enjoy this. If you are teetering between the original and the anniversary, definitely spring for the anniversary. The graphics really did improve the game.","November 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 19 of 48 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","19","48","3","0"
