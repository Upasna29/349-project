It have a simple mechanic, but with some interesting ideas and challenging platforming.\nIt's a little story about a guy with some curious friends, who had to travel through the dangerous and unfriendly world to find a way to build a new home.\n\nI have really enjoyed playing this game on ipad and it was pleasure to play again on a big screen. It was fun to explore this world, solve puzzles and help Nub. Thanks for that little wonderful adventure. :)\n\nIf you like metroidvania games like Knytt, Cave Story, Momodora - you just have to play Nub's Adventure!\n\nP.S. Also highly recommend to play another nice retro game by IMakeGames - Rico â€“ A Tale Of Two Brothers. It's not metroidvania, but really good solid platformer.","October 12, 2015","true","5.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

The sense of wonder and wander when you're playing is pretty magical. You play as Nubs, a creature that just lives by himself in his house on a cliff. Shortly after coming home, your house is robbed and burned to the ground and you're sent flying off a cliff.  Nubs' Adventure is a game about rebuilding what was lost by collecting diamonds throughout the world to rebuild your home.\n\nThe world is not linear, and you're going to constantly be teleporting around the world to access parts of the world that were previously unavailable. The entire game is fantastic, from its short and fun boss fights to its great platforming. For such a cheap price, you can't go wrong picking up Nubs' Adventure!","October 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There are no weapon upgrades, double jump or other upgrades. It is straight exploration, find the keys and gems type of game. There is a lot of backtracking to open doors once you find the key or symbol needed.\n\nIt is slower paced, with some action but most of the enemies don't pose much of a threat.\n\nIt saves your progress at the numerous checkpoints and every time you switch areas. There are a few sequences that could have used an extra checkpoint but overall there were enough. There are also a couple of places where you go through a long sequence of moving things around, opening doors, etc. then something pops up and kills you and you have to repeat it.\n\nThere are 3 or 4 boss fights. One of them was too random and luck-based, too easy to unavoidably get hit and quite frustrating (unless there is a trick to it I didn't notice), but the others were fine and moderately challenging.\n\nI finished in 8.3 hours. It was well worth the price, in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 13, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I would say that it is in the better half of platformers that have been released on Steam.\n\nThe game controls well and has some good level design. The artwork is nice and the story is not bad. The game isn't particularly original though since I don't remember any unique mechanics in the game.\n\nThe only big problem I had with the game was the amount of backtracking. Metroidvania games generally have a lot of backtracking but there was more backtracking in Nubs' Adventure than I was expecting. This may annoy some people but fans of Metroidvania games probably won't have an issue with it.\n\nThe game took me around seven hours to complete with quite a bit of that being backtracking. I would say that Nubs' Adventure is moderately difficult.\n\nIf you are looking for a solid platformer, I think you could do a lot worse than Nubs' Adventure.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 14, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a very present sense of identity.  Contols are generally pretty good, graphics are vibrant and stylish, the music is very relaxing and well-done.  The story is a nice change of pace from the hack'n'slash or shoot-everything-that-moves tropes, and goes a long way to set a serene atmosphere.\n\nI've noticed some use the term metroidvania to descsribe this title... I'm not sure I agree with that.  It does have pregression to new areas by backtracking through older areas but the progression is through found keys and flipped switches rather than new abilities/mechanics not previously avaiable.  Maybe nit-picky on my part, and I don't mean it as a mark against the game.  The exploration is rather fun and the levels are interestingly designed.  The primary means of progression is through finding and collecting crystals, and it may take several re-visits to a given area to find them all... some areas have hidden entrances from later parts of the game and others are simply well hidden.\n\nI noticed some reviewers have complained about the worm sections.  The worm controls like the supersheep in worms.  It is constantly moving forward and the player turns it left or right.  But it moves through the ground and assumes a parabolic trajectory out of the ground.  Some of the objectives while controlling the worm are out of the ground and require somewhat precise arcs.  I actually enjoyed these parts, as it was an interesting change of pace, and occasionally rather challenging.\n\nI didn't particularly like the last boss fight.  I found myself dying a lot due to the a rubber-band kind of effect with how the player moves in the fight sequence and unclear boundaries to the arena, and found it difficult to time my attacks due to the how the player's weapon functions.  However, in the end (and after probably 30+ deaths), I did make it through.\n\nIn the end, I rather enjoyed the game and would love to see more from this developer.  This is exactly the kind of game I think of when I think of indies.  It is designed with a lot of love and heart, and this shows through when playing the game.","December 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
