One of the few games that I ended up getting super addicted.  The game is basically Heroes of Might and Magic except a bit more tactical on the combat side.  When this game popped up on Steam, I knew I had to buy this game out of pure nostalgia.  While I still have the original disc, I wanted this version to play on Steam.  To this day, I still rate this game pretty high.  If you don't mind the game being wide screen and the graphics to be a bit grainy, get this game especially if you like strategy games.","December 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","46","49","0","0"

I have way over 500+ hours spent on this outside Steam. Though MoM has more depth with the spells and different dimensions what LoM brings you is a world that feels more alive with a main powerfull antagonist for that ultimate last battle, monster denizens that at higher levels are unique hard challanges with great rewards, you will come to cherish all your heroes because there is no ressurection and they really make the difference in battle, the espionage system is very fun with taking of hostages, stealth, diplomacy has lots of options but can be exploited, interesting city management based on Fame and Followers, magic research that requires hard work in order to get powerfull enough sorcerors to research at optimal rates, terraforming that can change world into your domain and give you a tremendous edge and Real Time Tactical Combat that is way more intense than the normal 4x Fantasy turn based system. To make replayability interesting after defeating the main antagonist you can play as him and really set terror into the world of Urak.\n\nAdditonally the soundtrack, voice acting and scenarios are also wonderfull. This game is an integral part of my childhood like many other great games but this is a game I still revisit once every two or three years and lose myself in the world of Urak.\n\nIf you have the friends I also highly recommend playing it multiplayer, it is a very cozy and competitive.\n\nUrak is Mine!","December 20, 2015","true","10.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","34","39","2","8"

Once you have chosen you will appear on the main game map where you can see various buildings and places to interact with, where you will find monsters to defeat, giving you the ability to summon creatures to aid you, hire more troops that can gain experience with you, wizard towars research new spells, towns where you can direct the locals to work in certain industries to increase your income of the various resources in the game (fame, gems, ale, etc), so you can support larger and better armies, and also other heroes to aid you in your quest.\n\nYou can also find a number of artifacts which give many different bonuses to your heroes (or not as some you will find will only be useful for classes/elements you can't currently recruit). You can conquer the town/temple of other elements which will allow you to hire more heroes of that element to aid you in your quest.\n\nThe one area I always found weakest in the game is the combat - it is played in pausable real time (one of the main ways it differs from early Heroes of Might and Magic titles), and while okay it largely reduces to just everyone attacking each other in a big blob (apart from the missile/spell casters). It never felt very strategic or interesting, and I always tend to autocalc whenever I can get away with it, as you end up having a lot of fights during a campaign.\n\nOverall this is a fun title, if very old and creaky, but it does guide you along a bit at the start of the game, although there isn't a huge amount of hand holding here unlike most modern titles. The user interface is okay if a bit cryptic, but it flows fairly well if you are willing to work with it, so overall I would recommend even to people new to it if the overall theme interests them, and the feel and flow of the game are different enough to HoMaM that fans of that series will probably like it, as it is different enough to not feel like an older and harder to use entry in that series, while still being in the same ballpark in terms of overall gameplay.","December 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

I was 12 then and I still think the gfx are pretty good. That was the main reason why I shelled out $40 at the time, not knowing that it would end up being one of my favorite games of all times for other reasons too. Namely the excellent soundtrack, 3D world map that makes for interesting exploration (even though originally there was only 1 map in the game), immersive diplomacy, good thief abilities for spying on or stealing from the enemy (also it's fun decimating weaker enemies with just 1 thief as they can "hide in the shadows") and a ton of spells that I never even got around to trying most of. Many artifacts to find for the champions, although it's often annoying to not be able to use them as they are often faith dependent. The combat system is clunky and somewhat tedious but basically strategic with missile units and mages usually doing most of the damage. It is often simple to trick the computer by having it chase one of your melee units around while you fire on them with missiles, and the enemy doesn't evade well if at all. I suppose you could have an army of mostly melee units, but you'd better find the best ones in the game because most of them are pretty weak. The redeeming aspect of battles is the rpg-like element of experience points that levels most units (not all) up to 5, and champions much higher.\n\nI always preferred playing as the Life faith, and it may be the easiest one to start with as they have the best missile units (archers) in the game. A tip would be to free your great temple as soon as possible (before the first 7th day) in order to start gaining followers for gathering resources and creating new units. New followers arrive to your empire every 7 days, depending on how much "Fame" you have gained.\n\nI really hope they fix the "Pegasus bug" as I have already run across 3 of these level 8 creatures and it takes an entire army with my best champions to take one down, usually losing a couple units in the process. Not neccesarily a bad thing as it adds challenge, but I really don't think a level 2 hamlet is supposed to spawn this creature.\n\nI really really hope they make a Lords of Magic II, or at least an HD update for this game!","December 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

You're done seeking. You're done looking for the dragon you've been chasing since 2001. This game is it. It's the ultimate piece of art that belongs next to Dwarf Fortress and Pablo Picasso's wooden sculptures in the Modern Art Museum. Here we have a RPG strategy with RTS elements staring us in the face, and it has been staring us in the face since 1996. The DOOM players overlooked it and the Diablo players were so blinded by Blizzard's genius that Lords of Magic was thrown to the wayside, never looked upon again until now.\n\nHere we have one of the greatest video games in the past hundred years. A true diamond in the rough in which all visions of modernity have built upon and supposedly improved upon but they fall short of its greatness.\n\nGive it a try.

It is a mix of strategy and RPG - you create armies that explore the world map, collecting resources, traversing dungeons and fighting neutral monsters/enemy factions to level up.\n\nThe game takes place in the high fantasy realm of Urak. Balkoth, the loyal discple of Golgoth, the god of Death, has gone on a rampage throughoutt the world, ravaging the kingdoms of the other seven faiths - Life, Order, Chaos, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. You pick one of the seven mentioned faiths and choose what role your Lord will be - Warrior, Thief or Mage.\n\nWhen you enter the world, you will discover that you only have your Lord and a small army accompanying him/her. Every faith starts off in a weakened state, except for death and the faith "opposite" to yours (for example, Order's opposite is Chaos). Your first objective is to explore the area around your faith's capital, fighting neutral enemies and gaining strength. Once you are strong enough, you will need to take your faith's "Great Temple", which has been overrun with monsters. After you do that, your capital will swear fealty to you, and you will begin your quest to kill Balkoth.\n\nEach faith has its own unique units, and they all have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, Life has some of the best ranged units in the game, with strong magical flying units. However, they have weaker melee units. Fire has units with very high attack, but low defense, and many of their units have low movement points.\n\nThe game does have some flaws, however. Combat has a tendency to be a bit clunky at times. The learning curve for the game, in my opinion, is very high. Finally, computer players will act oddly. For starters, they will often split their armies into tiny, easily defeatable groups. Secondly, there's diplomacy - the AI doesn't understand what a fair bargain is. Playing as Air, I once had Order ask me to give them my Air Drake (the legendary creature for Air) in exchange for a hound (an Order scouting unit). When I declined, my relations with them DROPPED because they were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with me.\n\nAll in all, I find this to be a very enjoyable game, albeit with a few flaws. It is a solid 8/10.","December 11, 2015","true","19.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Its 8 Faiths, 4 to the elements and 4 to to the AEther constructs. The main protagonist is balkoth of the Death faith. Most each faith also has its own race but multiple faiths have humans, elves and giants to name a few. The main game consist of a sprawling map of land divided into 8 kingdoms with numerous neutral castles, fortresses, villages and simple caves to conquer for XP and resources. In addition each faith has a whole library of spells unique to them. While mages are considered the most valuable hero unit they are often times rivaled and eclipsed by there warrior and stealth counterparts. There are some slight balancing issues but over all the game is true to the balance expected of the units they represent.

I remember trying my hardest to win and when I won for the first time I remember jumping up in my chair shouting, "I won!" Fun fact, I did that in a rolling chair, and I advise none of you to do that....lesson learned, but doesn't matter. I won!\n\nAnyways, now that it is on steam I had to pick it up and play it again...oh where did the hours go?\n\nThis is a game that I highly reccomend. Do not let the dated graphics fool you, this is a great game for those that understand the differences this game brings.\n\nThat said allow me to explain what makes this game different from other strategy games.\n\nFirst off, you pick a leader type - warrior, mage, or thief(ranged/stealth unit) and then your goal is to first liberate your faith's great temple. Once you do that your people build a stronghold in your capital and followers join your cause. You use these followers to work for you to produce resources in capital city, upgrade buildings or build new ones (at a conquered village) or join your army. You then adventure accross the map encountering other places to explore for treasure and loot and eventually find other faiths that you can either fight or parley with, but your ultimate goal is to kill the lord of death. This is not easy as he no pushover.\n\nHowever, you can unite the other faiths in the land to serve you against the lord of death. If you liberate the great temple of another faith they will join you. Another feature I have to mention is that your champions, (the warrior, mage, and thief) can use their xp to train new troops. This means if you have, for example, a high level warrior you can leave them in a barracks and every turn it will share its knowledge with new recruits, and if the champion has enough experience to fully train new troops you can then train brand new soldiers to start at max level. Not only does this mean in late game you do not have to worry about leveling up all your troops, but if your warrior shared enough knowledge at the barracks to train up future warriors to start at lvl 7, it makes loosing that warrior in battle less of a loss because you do not have to get another one fresh at level 1. It is a great system.\n\nAll in all, the game runs very well still on my windows 8 os. There is major framerate loss and slowing down when the map is zoomed all the way out.\n\nSound and music still sounds beautiful and the gameplay is still great.\n\nFor the current price you are getting a lot of content. There are eight playable faiths, that each play very differently with different units and spells, and advantages. This is a game where I would not say there are weak factions/faiths. They are all really powerful in their own right. For example it is said if you enrage the worshippers of water you better travel by land or air... The water faiths has the best ships and can summon serpants and krakens, but lack extremly powerful land units. The fire faith on the other hand has some really powerful and destructive magic spells, but....well lets just say their naval ships suck...like a lot. That is what I got to love about the game, every faith you can play as has an amazing pick of advantages, but all come with a huge negative you have to overcome and work around.\n\nThere are only a few large maps to play on, but don't worry, it is kind of like a football game or a game of league of legands. You can keep playing on the same map and it is still be fun. Honestly, having played the game so much as a kid and a lot lately I am still, just now, letting myself finially try another map that came with the game. These maps are large. If you do desire more maps don't worry. A map editor is also included and you get to play the legends of Urak which allows you to pick a faith and go on a legendary adventure. These change the rules of the game and make it more like an rpg adventure as opposed to grand strategy. These are story-rich with a fair bit of voice acting and videos.\nAgain, a wealth of content and replayablity for the price.\n\nFurthermore the higher difficulty settings still feel fair. I have played my last several games at the hardest difficulty setting and I feel and enjoy that wonderful sense of challange while having never felt like the enemy is cheating. This isn't a game that just simply has the enemy cheating, but rather makes them play smarter. As a vetern of this game every smart move the enemy made, or the amount of resources and units they had seemed, to me, easy to understand how they achieved that. It is wonderful when a game makes the higher difficulties fun without having the AI cheat. Again, every massive army of the enemy or amount of area they control has never felt unreasonable to me, as a veteran, and I could tell myself how they were able to achieve that. It is hard, but a fair hard if that makes any sense.\n\nIn closing, this was and still is, one of my favorite strategy games and I am so pleased to see it brought to steam where it will once again work on my pc. I love it and couldn't reccomend it more. If you are okay with the differences this game has that I described, give it a go. It holds up really well for a game released many years ago.","January 22","true","14.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's been years now and you're just as I remember you; ugly, brutal, and awesome.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Excellent blend of real time strategy, tactics rpg, and good old 4X empire building. If you like Civilization, Total War, or X-COM, this should float your boat.\n\n+ The soundtrack is as classy and ambient as anything. You won't exactly be humming the tunes, but it's immersive and enchanting all the same and never makes you want to turn it off.\n\n+ Each faction feels unique in some way with different strengths and weaknesses, but you're never really locked in to the faction you choose in the begining. Taking over villages and great temples gets you access to buldings, units, and abilities from other factions and you can mix and match them to suit your own strategy.\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is locked into a really low resolution and would benefit from an HD release like Age of Empires 2 did.\n\n- There's not so much a learning curve as there is a learning cliff that you must hurl yourself off of and build your wings before you hit the ground. You will lose your first few games and to people who only started playing games after 2001 or so, that may be a tad frustrating. This is a very old school game with a less than helpful tutorial system in the form of in-game pop-ups so the only way to learn how to play is by actually playing.\n\nOverall, Lords of Magic is worth your time if you don't mind the low resolution and have a lot of patience. This game is not pretty and it is not easy, but it is fun and that's what should count.","February 10","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is truly not very good.\n\nProblems with this game pop up at the very beginning, when you are selecting a type of Lord to rule your people.  This Lord takes the form of a powerful hero, but sadly not all are created equal.  As a matter of fact some are completely unviable, such as Fire and Air Warrior Lords.  These two in particular have such long parrying animations that if they become engaged with three or more enemies (which will happen often) they will spend all their time stuck in the parrying animation and be unable to strike back.  This results in their eventual death, regardless of how feeble the enemy is.\n\nCombat itself is awkward, and usually quite boring.  The most exciting combat comes when you take a lone thief lord and spend the fight stealthing around to gradually kill off all your opponents.  Otherwise you can expect a slug-fest that will eventually resolve itself with little input needed from the player aside from perhaps sending your melee fighters to a choke point.  Note that managing units is generally unnecessary, as many Lords are sufficient to carry the game solo until the final battle.\n\nThere are cities which you can manage to a very shallow degree.  There are other "Lords", though they provide little challenge.  Most of the game revolves around delving into enemy infested lairs to gain valuable experience for the final confrontation with the Death Lord.  It is only at this point you will actually need an army, since the Death Lord uses an instant kill attack which has several charges.  You must keep your Lord away (death of your Lord is an instant game over unless you have recruited other Lords by freeing their temples before they were able to) and send an army in his stead... rather dissappointing for the climax.  I'd prefer being able to have my Lord lead my army for the final battle.\n\nThere are a few special scenarios you can play based on old legends, such as King Arthur or Beowulf.  These tend to be irritating rather than enjoyable, and ask you to jump through silly hoops to complete them.\n\nAvoid this one.  It is nothing short of infuriating by today's standards.","April 4","false","2.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","2"

Lords of Magic is a turn based strategy game that has an interesting mix of real time strategy for the battle environment.  There are 8 Faiths (ie races) in the game, and you pick to play as lord of one of them.  At the start, your main objective is to stop the Lord of Death as he seeks to subjugate (or just destroy) all else that will not obey him.  You can choose to be that of the Elves of Life with essentially the best archer units, or perhaps those of Order who are essentially the heroes of Arthurian legends, or any other Faith.\n\nI've liked this game a lot because of how you can work with the other Faiths.  Say you're leading Life and liberate the Great Temple of Water (each Faith has one), they'll agree to join you (provided you're still on good relations) and their Lord will be come your heir.  So you essentially have two "lives" to work with while building up both regions.  You can still trade for resources, units, or research in other games but I always found that kind of alliance interesting about this game.\n\nThe RTS battles are more fun for me than the mass army battles.  In this game your army has a max of 12 "units" in 3 squads.  Each squad is composed of a hero/champion/unique unit and 3 generic units (footman, archer, calvary, scout, or summoned creature) and you can mix and match these as you like.  In battle, instead of having a host of units to macromanage you only have that small squad to micromanage long set paths in the various maps (some are open areas while others have corridors to bottleneck).  I've found that to be far more engaging.\n\nThe research aspect is only about the spells you have at your disposal.  If you don't use mages at all, then you actually don't even need to worry about the research (which is composed entirely of having a few mages in a building and waiting the number of turns needed based on the levels of the mages).\n\nThe other interesting part of this title (that they fortunately included) is the Legends of Urak quest pack.  Ever wanted to play out the story of King Arthur?  They have one for that.  What about Beowulf?  They have one for that too.  There are a couple other legends you play out the story off and it's adapted to the units and systems they have ingame which puts an interesting twist to it.\n\nI'll definitely be putting more time into this now othat I have it again.  Who knows...maybe I'll crush everything as Balkoth as I unlocked him with a bit of a speedrun I developed (check my guide if you're interested).  Or perhaps I'll slowplay it again as Life like I did when I first played the game.  Then again, playing out as King Arthur would be fun again too.  I remember that took me awhile, but perhaps I can do it quicker this time too.\n\nI realize this is a long review/diatribe but if you're a fan of simplistic land management blended with squad based real time strategy combat then I think this would be a title for you!\n\nEDIT: The only bad thing I guess is that they didn't add an ability to play windowed, or work in the Steam overlay.  It plays just like it did when I first enjoyed it though...so there is that. ;)","December 27, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Capitol, where you trade resources and put your followers to work.\n2. Wizard building- you get to train mage heros and typically magic units.\n3.Wizard tower- Here you can place mages to research spells.\n4. Thief building- Here you can train thief heroes and ranged units.\n5, Warrior building- Here you can train warrior heroes and similar units.\n6. Faction type building *IMPORTANT*- Capturing this will give you control of your capitol, increase your benefit in trading and let you assign followers. After capturing this, you will receive followers every 7 turns.  This building also lets you build another building next to it with various effects across factions.  This also lets you build one legendary unit.\n\nHere are your resources\n1. Fame\n2. Ale\n3. Followers -Important if you want to train a unit instead of hiring a mercenary/ used to produce resources at capitol\n4. Crystals - Important for healing units, in the capitol, click on the temple to do so.\n5. Gold\n\nThere are a bunch of random places you can travel to on the map.  This can be anywhere from a hut, to a brewery, to a crystal place, to a mine and much more.\nUsually a level 2 Brewery will provide 2 ale/turn, lv 3 brewery 3 ale/turn so long as you control it.\n\nThe goal is to kill balkoth or rule the world, whichever you decide.\nYou get to make allies and trade buildings/units/rescources\n\nYou level up your units, they can die permanently. You get relics that you can equipt on heroes. IF YOUR STARTING HERO DIES YOU LOSE.\n\nCons-\nIt's an old game, the graphics are terrible.\nIt crashes every now and then so save often!\n\nConclusion-\nIt's a very good game, alot of fun, definitely made in a time where the gameplay was more important than the visuals itself. Although the game does tend to crash and that does destroy the immersion.. The gameplay is far superior and helps shed a blind eye towards it.  For $2.50/ $5.00 Its totally worth it.  I would totally reccomend this game any day regardless of its cons.\n\nI'm too tired to keep writing/reviewing.  Just buy the game and enjoy :) I'll update this eventually.","January 18","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does a very good job of explaining things as you go too. Strategy and management of resources and followers is key, but is simple and straightforward. One aspect I loved about this is that the amount of followers you gain is influenced by how much  positive Fame your actions have brought, and how many monuments you liberated from faithless Marauders. You can try to barter with other Faiths. The Thief champions can stealth, try to steal from other parties, spy on other Faiths, or even kidnap and interrogate other champions, Mages can research spells, and experienced champions can even “instruct” newly produced units so that they start out at a higher level… There's just sooo many things I could list but this review is already getting too long. :)","February 9","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
