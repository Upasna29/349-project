"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/406720/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","IntroductionWho remembers (or has played) the Death To Spies series? I think few of us do. That might just be the reason why development for the third game in this series was halted a few years ago. Fortunately, Maximum Games still saw enough potential in the game to pick it up and finish development eventually, hence the reason why it’s now a spiritual successor called Alekhine’s Gun.\n\nGameplayThe game’s name refers to a famous chess move and – like chess – the developers state that you have to anticipate your opponent’s moves here as well.  We all know that this is usually the case for stealth games but does it really apply to Alekhine’s Gun? To be perfectly honest, no, it does not. Except for a few moments maybe. As always I’ll do my best to try and go through all of the (im)perfections during the next few paragraphs.\n\nAnyone who has ever played or seen Hitman should know what to expect here. The goal is to silently complete your objectives, but you can also choose to take the more action oriented road, or use a combination of the two.\nBefore you start a mission you’re given the objectives and then you can select which weapons and items you would like to bring. You can take up to 6 things with you, and you can unlock some of these items later on with the points you have earned during your earlier missions. There aren’t a whole lot of different weapons but more than enough to get the job done.\nYou can also use weapons and items found in the levels themselves, although I was disappointed to see that this was kept to a minimum. There’s very little stuff to take and use. This in turn makes it less fun to explore and/or replay the levels and even if you find things to use it usually still isn’t clear what you have to do with it exactly. I found this to be quite disappointing, but I guess it’s just a personal preference.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642855650\nYour character can also use Focus, which lights up items that can be interacted with as well as which characters are looking your way or are suspicious of you. At times helpful, especially in locations that are packed with characters, but most of the times plain useless. I also still have no idea how and when it refills.\nA different meter also fills once you’re being suspected and when it has filled up enemies will swarm in. Most of the times. Sometimes they just won’t take action...\n\nWhich brings us to the AI. Since the game’s title refers to ‘anticipation of opponent’s moves’ this part should be (near-)perfect, right? Well, wrong, but I think I made that already clear in the last paragraph. Sure, sometimes it works, but most of the time they’ll react in the most unrealistic way possible. I once threw a knife at an officer sitting in a mess hall – with at least eight characters sitting around him – and all they did was check to see if he was dead, stand there for a couple of minutes and then carry on with dinner. Ten minutes later the guy was still lying face down in his soup and people were acting like nothing happened. This happened in many different scenarios, too, and even though it doesn’t make the game unplayable it does detract from the experience it’s trying to aim for: realism.\n\nThere are 11 levels in total and you start with a rather generic, boring World War II flashback mission. I think this was actually a terrible choice for a first level because it’s something that has been done to death. I personally think it would’ve been better if they had found a way to introduce it later on.\nThe levels complement the story, in a way, but except for a handful of them they just don’t make for very interesting locations. Most of the levels are dull, uninspired and sometimes even too large/complex (like the aircraft carrier).\nDepending on your playstyle each level can usually take anywhere between 30 (action) to 60 (stealth) minutes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642855696\nBut the game doesn’t seem to be made with shooting in mind. Don’t get me wrong; it works, but most of the locations have so many enemies walking around that you usually don’t stand a chance unless you’re well prepared and save often. It just feels a bit like an afterthought.\n\nSince Steam reviews still have a character limit I will go through some of the bugs/glitches in one sentence now. Here we go: map markers showing the wrong floor, crashes in general, heart rate sound bugging out and a spotty cover system.\nApologies for this, I wish this was different and I could be more thorough.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe audio is yet another department in which the game suffers. The voice acting is terrible and lacks any authentic emotion. Most of the men sound almost the same, with the exception being your own character who has a bit of a Russian accent. I had a hard time keeping up who’s who, especially during the animated black and white cutscenes.\nAlso, gunshots just sound hollow and lack power. The rest of the sounds suffice, though, and the music, while minimalist, is generally speaking fairly good.\n\nVisually it isn’t breathtaking. There are a ton of other games that have better graphics than this game but it isn’t ugly by any means. Sometimes it just lacks that extra bit of detail, though. I also wish there were more (smaller) objects located in the levels. They feel rather empty at times.\nThe upside to this is that the engine can handle large levels without breaking a sweat and performance never once dips, even with everything maxed out. Most of you should be able to run this without any issues since the game isn’t all that demanding. But the game does crash from time to time, without good reason. During my sessions I had the game crash at least 6-7 times. So make sure that you save often.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=642855673\nLength/Replay ValueI already mentioned this during my ‘Gameplay’ paragraph so I’ll go through it again really quick: there are 11 levels and if you play it as an assassin it will take you about 12+ hours I think. This doesn’t include reloading save games, by the way, which will happen frequently. Or the fact that you can try to tackle levels differently. In any case; overall it has plenty of content.\n\nConclusionThe fact that Alekhine’s Gun releases around the same time as the new Hitman game might not have been the smartest move. But if you’re looking for a budget version of the Hitman games then this game could definitely be worth your time.\nIs it a great stealth game? No, not in any way. But it is a decent one. I’ve played plenty of titles that were worse than this. Just don’t expect greatness and you shall not be disappointed.\nAs for the question if it’s worth the money? Yes, but not for the current asking price; I suggest waiting for it to drop to around €15/$15 or less before even considering picking it up.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Large levels\n+ Multiple ways to complete objectives\n+ Variety in objectives\n\nMixed:\n+/- Visuals are okay-ish but the engine can handle large levels easily\n+/- But despite them being large the levels are mostly plain boring\n\nCons:\n- AI occasionally acts unrealistically\n- Voice acting and gun sounds\n- Action at times feels like an afterthought\n- Crashes and some bugs/glitches\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 6.1 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nIf you have any kind of feedback - positive or negative - please feel free to leave a comment (in case of negative feedback please try to keep it constructive).

Whistling, poison, accident systems and weapon loadouts are still a feature from the first two games, as is a hard mode wherein only nonlethal and choke cord takeouts will allow disguises.\nAs well, the levels at times start to feel repetitive, unlike the last game. I'm not sure whether this is an issue with the pacing, the difficulty curve or the amount of levels.\n\nWhile the game is buggy at the current time (one day since release), it actually has everything level design wise mapped out to a very strong form of solidity.\n\nBest ratings are acquired by not knocking anyone out, save those absolutely necessary cases, and killing targets purely through the use of scripted and well hidden and executed accidents.\nThere's an extreme difficulty dedicated purely to not using disguises, where lethality is far more forgiven.\n\nIf you're new enough to social stealth to think that after this long since Blood Money and only Absolution to tide us over there isn't room for 2 stealth games with disguise basis in them, you should probably play more stealth games.\nThis is at the very least a buy on sale for the fact that it ends up being a solid (not great, but certainly not bad either) game in the otherwise neglected disguise based sub-genre of stealth games.","March 12","true","50.0"," 76 of 100 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","76","100","3","12"

You will regret it. You will.\n\nAlekhine's Gun shown promise and an idea that, if executed well, could have been a serious competition for the Hitman released as of today [11th of March]. Could have. But it's not, since Alekhine's Gun is everything but well executed game, or at least an average game.\n\nStory follows you, Semyon Strogov (later Semyon Alekhine), Russian agent working for CIA in the middle of Cold War conspirations all around the Europe, USA and Cuba. And while the story shows promise as well, it's boring and unispiring in every way imaginable, since characters are far from being interesting while questionable and blatant dialoques takes place right in front of you. The good thing are between-missions cut-scenes offering a nice looking slideshow-style pictures with noir atmosphere. But that's it.\n\nAnd the gameplay goes even further. If you've played both Death to Spies game and (at least) Hitman: Blood Money, try to combine those game in your head and you pretty much get what Alekhine's Gun is. And while some of you might think it's a million-dollar idea, then it's not. Alekhine's Gun is struggling with everything, from level design (short and linear missions, not interesting locations, reusing assets; library in Level 3's hotel is the EXCACT COPY of one of the hotel's libraries in Death to Spies) to game design (you can't prone, most of the guns are pointless, most of the disguises are even more pointless, you can't hide yourself in closet and all you need to play this game is more or less a knife, which is insta-kill to everyone before they can even react - and you can throw it), techical direction (game feels old and outdated with audiovisualization like that from Hitman: Blood Money, which is 2006) and even the AI is more or less non existent. They can't even climb the ladder. The gun play is boring and dull, the AI kills the stealth part and you won't probably care less for the story. And while lockpicking mini-game is nice (altough it's just a little better version of lockpicking from Death to Spies series) it's obviously not enough. This game is bad. I'm sorry to say that, but it's terrible. And the price they are asking for is simply put a crime.\n\nStay away from this game and don't even try it, because the first level is actually not that bad and it will most probably take you more than two hours (after which you can't refund) to find out that this game is not worth even 5€. Save yourselves from this disaster. This game is NO from me.","March 11","false","5.3"," 112 of 179 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","112","179","9","7"

Graphics fall somewhat behind latest greatest and full reviews will be harsh due to price point. If it keeps this pace, worth 20-30 imo. Level design is a star and left room for experimentation. Story is mostly presented through noir styled cutscenes with the occasional event happening throughout missions. Performance is good and offered 4k+ support, though for some a FOV slider would be welcomed. No problems with gamepad or keyboard controls and both could be remapped. Range of difficulty modes to suit everyone, along with the ability the save anywhere. Few odd game crashes and some dodgy animations take away from an otherwise enjoyable stealth action game.

(it does need to be specified, because all positive reviews are by definition paid, amirite?)\n\nDisclaimer 2: my actual playtime is about +5 hours, since those were played offline, with a debugging .exe provided by the developer to fix my "input device" error.\n\nDisclaimer 3: Steam's being a ♥♥♥♥♥ with its word limit, had to place Introduction below as a comment.\n\nPlot & Gameplay\nPlot\n\nThe protagonist, Semyon Strogov (also the protagonist of previous DtS games), is involved in a conspiracy that threatens to lead both USSR and US into a nuclear conflict. Assuming the identity of "Agent Alekhine" (named after world famous chess player Alexander Alekhine) and partnering up with his American colleagues, he must assassinate members of a global conspiracy and stop the world from escalating into World War Three.\n\nNote: plot's mostly represented through the cutscenes, but we'll talk about them later.\n\nGameplay\n\nShort story - gameplay-wise it's pretty much Hitman Blood Money... released 9 years after Hitman Blood Money.\n\nLong story - you have several approaches in how to eliminate your target. Most maps have about 2 or 3 oppurtunities to stage an accident kill, but nothing stops you from choking the target with a garrotte yourself or simply pop a bullet in their head with a silenced pistol. Levels are not new HITMAN-big, but somewhere around Blood Money-big.\n\nYou can also obtain various disguises in order to gain access to various restricted areas thorough the level. On "Hard" difficulty, though, you're only allowed to take disguises from enemies only if they were killed using a garrotte or dazed with chloroform, which adds a certain level of challenge. On "Saboteur" difficulty, however, you're not allowed to change disguises at all, for those seeking extra thrills.\n\nThere is also a nice variety of weapons included, ranging from various 50x-era firearms like MP40, MP44, Kar93, Mauser, to tranq gun, Thompson SMG, Colt 1911 etc etc. Some you can find by taking them from fallen enemies, some you can unlock in your start-up menu using Reputation Points (RP). You can also modify some of your weapons using same RP, like attaching a suppressor to your Mosin, making it a silenced sniper weapon, or double the amount of ammo for your pistol, stuff like that. You're not always forced to use firearms, but if you want to go guns blazing or go full Hitman with silenced pistol only - go ahead, the choice is yours.\n\nYour playstyle will be represented by rating you get at the end of your mission. The ratings take into account how often you've been spotted, how many non-target enemies have you killed, your accuracy and your speed. The higher your rating - the more RP you earn.\n\nNote: once you've unlocked a certain weapon with RP, you can use it to replay already completed mission with it, as all completed missions can be replayed from Main Menu under New Game.\n\nIt might seem all fine and dandy, but you might think "If the game's so good, why all major gaming media gave it such a low score?" Well, it's because  they're paid cucks  it's not a FANTASTIC game, it sure has its flaws. More on them below:\n\nPros & Cons\nPros\nGameplay aesthetic: since game draws so much attention by being "heetmun ripoff", who said that it's a bad thing? A disguise-based social stealth game is already very niche genre, the more the merrier I think. It feels familiar, so you won't get lost here if you've played any Hitman game: you have a map, a target wandering a certain area of said map, several routes to get close to your target, and ways to eliminate it. Meanwhile, random people do their stuff around the map, maid's cleaning up, waiter serves tables, bartender serves drinks, chef cooks something, etc etc.\nYou're not forced to take a single specific route (in most cases, at least) to complete your objective, and it's nice.\n\nVariety: while the game might not be as varied as previous Death to Spies, it's not all linear corridors either, sometimes requiring a second playthrough just to learn a new route or a new way to dispose of your target.  The rating system also provides certain replayability, getting "Ghost" or "Wolfhound" on most levels requires a strategy and patience. Levels themselves range from Nazi bases and secret military installations, to civilian places like a biker club, hotel, chinese private club, mafia mansion etc.\n\nMusic: it's nice when there's "some" music. First 4 Hitman games had a wonderful OST, then Absolution... well, we don't talk about Absolution. It had a generic action'y score, so nothing special. Alekhine's Gun also has unique tracks for each of its levels, with stealth and action phases. They're not annoying, and are actually quite fitting.\n\nAtmosphere: noir 1960x-story, comics-like cutscenes, Mafia II-escque locations. It does make up a nice feeling.\nCons\nGraphics: the game looks like an early 360 title canned in 2010 and released in 2016 (which, to be honest, it is)\nThat doesn't really bother me, but you probably should be aware that there is no eye candy in this game\n\n(Temporary) Crashes: the game crashes somewhat randomly, under any circumstances, be it saving the game, running down the hallway or simply standing. They may occur twice within 20 mins of play time, once in 6 hours, or it might not crash at all, which could be a problem if you're carelessly playing without saving the game (like me). However, the developer says that they're working on a fix for it, and once it's released, I'll mark this section of review off.\n\n(Subjective) AI: This one's a bit difficult to explain, since some people claim the AI is "nonexistent"  "literally unplayable 0\10" . I'd describe it as "forgiving". In come cases, you should've been instantly spotted, your disguise blown and alarm blasting though the map, but ocassional guard might simply scratch his chin looking at you and walk away. It's hard to describe what's so bad with it, since for the most part it's somewhat competent: they're not allowing you to enter restricted areas, they sound the alarm when you do something outrageous (like start picking the lock or carry a body), they patrol the areas, in other words, do things that an AI in such game would do. It's the little moments when you feel you should've failed, but AI simply overlooked this detail. Hopefully, this is a subject to change in the future, along with crashes. But even if it's not on devs' roadmap, you can always play on "Hard" or "Saboteur", since on Hard the AI's reaction time is decreased (they react to your actions faster) and Saboteur disallows you to change your suit.\n\nCutscenes: don't get me wrong, I dig the comic-book'esque style, but DEAR GOD THE VOICE ACTING. If secondary characters at least try to perform, Semyon's VA only makes me want to hang myself. That said, NPCs' phrases are fine ("Restricted area, sir", "You're not allowed here", "Show your papers" etc), but the sound quality of all in-game VO is lacking, like it was recorded in an office instead of a proper studio.\nConclusion\nAfter all said and done, you might think that I'm painting the game better than it actually is.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut in my opinion Alekhine's Gun is not as bad as others make it look. It sure is not without some rough edges, but as long as you're willing to overlook some of its shortcomings, and don't expect AAA quality from it (don't even compare it to new HITMAN, it's closer to Blood Money) you're in for some enjoyable time.\n\nRating: 7.4","March 17","true","13.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","7"

The DTS games were very hard and I liked it that way. AG is a lot easier than them. Unlike the DTS games there are no guards who are highly suspicious of you. Even the reds on instinct mode are comparable to yellow NPCs in DTS. There are no longer any AI who will raise the alarm on sight on you. If you just walk quickly you can evade the majority of guards.\n\nThere does seem to be a variety of ways to complete each mission. Mission 4 (Chinatown) was particularly good. I've found each mission takes around 50 mins (not including reloading on save games which happens frequently!)\n\nI've had three random CTDs so far and there was graphical glitch with the elevator doors in the Hotel mission but otherwise this game is fine with regards to bugs.

They made the game Death to Spies (outdated now though) so are not just a hitman clone.\n\nI watched ample videos on it the past few months before release too, so could tell it was a solid stealth game with various paths and strategy but also has limitations and is rough around the edges in some regards. It has decent replay value since you have a few methods to accomplish missions, although some aspects are linear.\n\nI believe its priced well too at $30-40 on PC.

I think most of us can at least appreciate it.\nWhen i got into the game i could easily walk into the building i had to be in with incredible ease, i don't even recall using a disguise to do so.\nWhen in the building i quickly picked up a soldier uniform from a guy i stabbed. This was the lowest ranking soldier in the complex.\n\nLike in hitman and the death to spies titles, there are higher ranking troops/officers who will eventually see through your disguise if you let them eyeball you long enough.\nHowever, it won't stop you from casually walking or even running through restricted areas, because the detection is so slow that you can casually waltz your way past anyone that should cause you trouble.\nThis could be countered by ramping up the difficulty, maybe, but the biggest problem is the AI.\n\nWhen i found my high ranking officer (i was playing stoned, mind you) i decided to just walk up behind him and stab him in the back in a hallway. There were 2 other guards there but they weren't currently facing me. I stabbed the officer, took his disguise and was ready to walk away.\nOnly then i noticed at least 1 guard was facing my direction, while the other one had his back to me and the dead guy although he was standing next to us. The other one was at the other end of the hallway, about 15-20meters away from me at best. He simply didn't recognise the stripped corpse on the ground despite facing us.\n\nDeciding to test how broken the AI was i proceeded to backstab the guy next to the corpse (still not noticing anything), i dropped him and the other guy on the hallway was still chilling. So i walk up behind him and stab him too.\nAt this point i realise it's awful easy to get away with stuff undetected, so i run through the building and sabotage one thing and assassinate another officer in similar manners.\n\nNot once did i get close to getting caught even though i was killing nazi's left and right near their buddies without waiting for an oppurtunity to strike or luring them out first.\n\nIn other words; you won't be feeling the need to get all strategic and clever, because you can just easily sneak up behind people (even when not completely isolated) and just shank them in the back. The knife animation is very quick as well.\n\nOops, quick edit! I forgot to mention that the knife doesn't have to be used in a backstab manner, you can also stab people from the front or whatever direction you please\n\n\nThen finally the graphics and sound\nThe game looks a lot like the old death to spies titles, you can basically expect hitman blood money's graphics but with some kind of odd shadowy/bloomy effects everywhere, it doesn't look bad and graphics definitely don't make the game, but the levels look rather bland and lifeless. Also people hardly fit in with the environment, they're easily spottable beacons because of the shadow effects on their characters and they really stand out.\nUnlike in death to spies i did not feel like i was potentially always in danger and in an enemy zone.\n\nThe sound is pretty meh, the voice acting sounds like it's done by a 20-year old something developer who decided he could put on a grainy voice for the narraration, which sounds incredibly forced.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nThe game feels too easy to exploit and instead of disguising and poisoning your way through the levels you can easily run through them and shank everyone with minimal disguise while not getting detected.\nThe graphics and sounds aren't candy to your eyes or ears so unless you want a revamped (but simplified and glitchier) version of death to spies then this might be for you.\n\nI refunded the game since i do not consider this game worthy of 35,99 (full price being 39,99), it feels and plays a lot like a "wanna be AAA indie game". I am definitely considering a repurchase when issues have been fixed at a later date, but in it's current state the game is rather mediocre for such price.\n(My suggested price would be around 20/25 bucks at max).","March 12","false","0.5"," 38 of 71 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","38","71","3","4"

If you'd like to read our full review, you can find it on our main site here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/alekhines-gun-overview-and-review/\n\nAlekhine's Gun is a fairly low budget stealth based game inspired by the Hitman franchise with some slight inspiration from classic Splinter Cell as well. Originally meant to be Death to Spies 3, Alekhine's Gun follows a KGB agent named Semyon Strogov on various missions through 11 locations as he combats various enemy factions ranging from the the mob to Nazi forces.\n\nThe game is widely open ended and each level offers numerous ways to complete each mission. You can choose to go in guns blazing or you can choose to take the stealthy approach. You can also choose to disguise yourself as enemy troops and make your way past enemy checkpoints with ease as long as you don't attract attention to yourself.\n\nThe level design is pretty good and I enjoyed playing them, I died numerous times in the beginning due to being rusty at stealth games but once I got the hang of things again it became much easier to take out opponents and complete objectives.\n\nThe game may not have high production qualities like the games that it's inspired by but if you're looking for a new, Hitman-esque game to play then Alekhine's Gun is worth looking into as long as you can get past the poor voice over quality and weak cutscenes. Gameplay wise it's quite fun.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read our summary (and the full review) folks, until next time, happy gaming!\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!\n\nOur Gameplay Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5dzxKi8dUQ","March 22","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When I bought this game, I didn't know it was Death to Spies 3 (essentially).  I remember early on thinking, "Huh, my character looks familiar ... and they sure ripped off Death to Spies a lot ..."  I had to check, and sure enough, this is the pheonix from the ashes of a failed attempt to make Death to Spies 3.\n\nIf you've tried Death to Spies and you like it, then this game is probably worth buying.  Though, a couple words of advise; save often AND IN DIFFERENT SLOTS because I have had saved games go corrupt.  This game crashes on a fairly regular basis, and while they claim to be working on it, I still randomly get crashes.  And there's no windowed mode, so if that's a deal breaker for you -- well, consider yourself warned.\n\nThis game is NOT the caliber of Hitman.  It's not gloriously and beautifuly rendered, but it's not ugly.  And I'll be honest, I can't tell you what the story's about -- I tried to follow it, but lost it in the midst of cutscenes.  That doesn't really matter, anyway, it's an excuse to sneak, explore, and find creative ways to end people that someone's assuring us are bad.

I haven't tried the new Hitman yet, but this game is a welcome "sequel" to Blood Money. Like in the rest of the Death to Spies series, you are a russian agent who has to kill targets, retrieve information, etc.\n\nI think the developers improved on every aspect of their series and this game is quite well made, albeit a bit glitchy. But so far I have not encountered a game breaking glitch.\n\nIf you like the old Hitman titles, this is definitely a game for you. And at half the pricetag of the new Hitman, it is quite a bargain.\n\nI compile a small list of differences compared to Hitman Blood Money (imo the so far best Hitman title):\n\n- Picking locks is a mini game, in which you need to match ur picks to the locks. This is quite a nice addition, imo, as you can be very fast if you are good, but you can never really calculate how long you will need.\n\n- The levels are often more sneaky than in Hitman. Although they massively improved this from the old titles, where it was almost impossible to finish anything without heavy sneaking, there are still quite a few situations where you cannot just simply don the right suit and go through everything.\n\n- The setting is in WW2 and later apparently in post-war America. I personally do not like military settings so much for such games, as you feel less inclined to be in and out without being noticed. But there are also plenty of levels in non-military areas (2nd lvl is in a Hotel in Switzerland, e.g.).\n\n- It does seem that there are less ways to complete missions as opposed to Hitman, but that might also still improve and ofc I have not played this game long enough to really say that.\n\n\nOverall, I can definitely recommend this game. It is a lot of fun and hopefully gets even better.\n\nUpdate: I just finished the game (playtime approximately 9 hrs) and while I still recommend it, only few levels are really nice. Most of the levels suffer from the same problem I have with the other games in the Death to Spies series: The areas are huge, yet there is not too much to do and most people are armed and looking for you. This means that in the later levels, even in disguise, you cannot pause a lot, because someone will get suspicious. Moreover, many levels are more like mazes than actual free spaces, so there is not much planning involved. The game, unfortunately, is rather linear with very few designed approaches to finish a mission. As I said, I still recommend it for fans of the genre, but don't expect something great.","March 16","true","8.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The demo is old but enough to try the game. Search "Alekhine's Gun GAME DEMO" on google if you are interested to try the demo.\n\nYeah, I know, game websites don't gave good critrics to this game but I guess it's mainly because they treat it as a AAA game when it's in fact a indy game (in-game credits only list four main programmers for the PC version, which is a pretty low number).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/recommended/406720/","yij","Yij","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/","391 products in account","Summary\n\nIf you’ve played any Hitman games before, you know the score. Sneaking slowly, pacifying patrols, donning disguises, assassinating antagonists and finally evasive extractions.\n\nSadly, Alekhine’s Gun is a clunky and buggy half-arsed imitation. Awful controls, mediocre stealth, boring level design, wonky AI, poor animations and subpar visuals.\n\nHaving said that, Alekhine’s Gun is far from a terrible game and if you’re partial to janky titles, then there is some fun to be had, just wait for it to be patched. For everyone else though, nothing to see here. 4/10\n\nA pure Hitman rip-off\nThe game is such a carbon copy of Hitman, it completely lacks any sense of uniqueness and personality. One assassination even recreates an exact series of events seen in Hitman: Blood Money. A little bit of originality, please!\n\nNow there’s nothing wrong with attempting to imitate another title… if you can make it into something able to stand on its own two feet.\n\nThe question is, is Alkehine’s Gun a trained professional disguised as Agent 47, or is he just a kid in a cosplay outfit?\n\nGraphics\nDefinitely looks like it hails from over a decade ago, with passable environments and stiffly animated NPCs that not only all look the same, males tend to sport chunky proportions that resemble a goblin hiding in human clothes. There are some graphical oddities like distracting shadow LODs and glow in the dark NPCs, but at least you’re treated to a smooth 60fps experience throughout.\n\nThe cut scenes in the game are all done in mostly still painted images coupled with voice overs and sound effects – a very novel idea, sadly let down by just being very poor quality and seriously dragging on for way longer than I could comfortably stand. Skip, skip, skip.\n\nMusic and Sound\nThe soundtrack is surprisingly decent and works brilliantly, with each level showcasing its own theme. Very well done and certainly puts you in a stealthy mood! However once ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and you need to start blasting fools, the overly loud battle music kicks in and is downright awful to listen to. Do yourself a favour and swap the “alarm.ogg” track for something else, or disable the music altogether (note: cutscenes are mute if the music is turned off).\n\nSound effects are low quality and generic (I swear some of them are from Call of Duty). Whilst guns sound very loud, the sound of fists meeting face comes off more like someone fapping underneath the bedsheets. Again, do yourself a favour and replace those sounds however you see fit.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from barely passable to fairly poor, with intimidating security guards sounding like camp photographers (“That’s restricted, hellooo?”) and NPCs conversing in open locations sounding like they’re speaking inside a locked bathroom.\n\nOpen levels? Not quite\nSince the game can’t keep its mouth shut about how open and non-linear it is, I’m here to tell you that’s not entirely correct.\n\nThe maps are big but there’s a lot of inaccessible space, overly long corridors and empty rooms that serve no purpose whatsoever. Level design is also extremely inconsistent, with some rooms completely devoid of light switches, or being able to scale one waist high obstacle but not another. Plus why am I finding poison and sleeping pills in a random office and not say, a medical cabinet or a bathroom?\n\nAs for non-linear, sure, you can assassinate targets in a variety of ways, but since all they do is walk between 2 rooms within a tiny radius repeating about 3 different activities, the best you can do is spiking their drinks, sabotage equipment, or just plain garrotte/shoot them in the head. The game never gives you an option to utilise any creative surprises to interrupt their schedules or expose their Achilles heel.\n\nDespite the disappointing level design, you’ll be offered a brilliant variety of maps to explore, ranging from a claustrophobic castle occupied by Nazis to a stinking rich mansion all the way in sunny Cuba.\n\n♥♥♥♥ Poor Controls\nI really can’t get my head round the controls in this game, as they seemed design intentionally to ♥♥♥♥ people off.\n\nThe F key is for picking up bodies and dropping them again, and also to hide them in containers, instead of one of the use keys like most gamers would expect. Not a big problem, bit a little unexpected.\n\nYou use the E key to open a door, but if it’s locked, you need to use the Spacebar to lockpick it. Why not use 1 button for both like most games would? But wait, it gets better: both keys constantly swap with each other during the game!!\n\nOne time, the E key is used for vaulting over obstacles, but other times it’s the Spacebar instead! Why??? Keep it consistent, so I’m not hammering the spacebar trying to hop over a wall, only to get shot to ♥♥♥♥ because the game decided to troll me by requiring the E key instead. Stop reversing the controls, it’s annoying!\n\nThe aiming is particularly troublesome as it just feels really off, but that’s not all. Despite RMB being labelled as the aim button, it only works when you’re behind cover. Attempt to use it when you’re standing normally, your character will holster his weapon and start punching thin air, which just feels so wrong. Furthermore, to use the scope on your rifle, you need to use the mouse wheel, NOT the aim button!\n\nSeriously - who the ♥♥♥♥ designed these controls, a schizophrenic???\n\nOther problems\nInstincts Mode *groan* is necessary for gameplay as it not only highlights enemies; it highlights areas on the ground you can blend in with, because you can’t just sit in any old chair or guard any wall, only very specific ones. Come on, us hardcore players don’t want to utilise kiddie-mode, but let us know which chair the protagonist is allergic to!\n\nYou can takedown people silently, but this requires a near-full Instincts metre to perform. What, does this expert spy suddenly forget how to pull off a basic chokehold once this metre runs out?? ♥♥♥♥ off!\n\nThe AI works for the most part, but is heavily flawed. NPCs seem to have a personal space problem as if you dare stand within 5 metres of them, they’ll instantly drop everything to stop and stare at you (even when they’re dying of poison) unless you give them a very wide berth.\n\nSometimes if you get spotted in a restricted area, leave then sneak back in without being spotted, your alertness metre goes up. Other times, a guard will escort you away, only to ignore you should you charge straight back in again. Also on some occasions, a single shot can bring an army of goons on your heels, whereas other times guards will ignore a shootout happening right around the corner from them.\n\nLastly the game crashes a fair number of times, which is fairly offputting, though midly offset by being able to save willy-nilly.\n\nConclusion\nDespite the overwhelming number of problems, I still enjoyed my experience with the game. It’s more open than your average action game and you can replay levels using different playstyles and upgradable equipment. Yet, I simply cannot recommend this title: thanks to the severe lack of polish, awful controls and subjective game design, I don’t believe the average player can tolerate this mess.\n\nBut before I go about tightening the noose around this game’s neck, bear with me for a moment. Alekhine’s Gun shows good potential. Not only is the game moddable, if Maximum Games can fix the glitches and refine the gameplay a little, then this would be a great budget contender for the Hitman throne.\n\nWith already a patch released and rumours flying around of a soon to be released level editor, Alekhine’s Gun is a title you should keep your eye on. I know I will.","March 28","false","10.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Players are more likely to be familiar with its most popular games, the Hitman series. Players are a secret agent, tasked with exploring large levels and accomplishing some task, usually an assassination. The appeal of these games is the feeling of being a wolf in sheep's clothing, as one dons disguises to infiltrate diverse areas like mansions, nightclubs, or military compounds. There is a puzzle element in place, as players are encouraged to observe and experiment to find the ways to dispose of their targets in the most silent or theatrical way possible, all while escaping detection.\n\nTechnically, the game looks dated, but still pleasant enough, and runs quite fast. I had two crashes over about 10 hours of gameplay. Controls are smooth and responsive.\n\nIn the past Death to Spies games, there was a stronger stealth element, with the ability to creep and crawl through foliage through its often massive levels. Those abilities are gone now, and what remains is much more akin to the usually excellent Hitman games.\n\nFor the first five levels of this game, I thought the developers had pulled it off. Levels were varied, with many ways to approach my objectives. The only major failing of them was that they lacked atmosphere that makes the hitman games so good: large crowds, snippets of dialogue, and a great reaction to some of your most spectacular hits. Here, though, even when a man is violently electrocuted, there is usually only a subdued reaction. Still, the gameplay was solid.\n\nThen, about halfway through, the quality takes a nosedive. The levels all take on a military theme, buildings are designed nonsensically, and my options were much more limited. Many of the environments are completely indoors in an endless procession of similar looking corridors. An aircraft carrier, for example, is depicted as a confusing maze of rusting walls, with no seeming logic to their layout.\n\nSuddenly, every little flaw felt glaring-- a lockpicking game that's too slow, enemy patrols that take forever to move, only to give you just a few seconds to unlock a door (never enough time) or complete some other task, and an AI that is at once stupid and at the same time too observant. They think almost nothing of seeing a man sneaking up behind them with a garrote and missing his grab, yet their eyes remain glued on you constantly, making for a frustrating dance as you constantly run in and out of their sight.\n\nThis would have been a cautious recommendation if you had asked me half way through, but unfortunately I cannot recommend Alekhine's Gun.","March 30","false","15.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You cant really talk to NPC's. you can only interact with a limited number of items and these are always set places instead of globally available objects. This compounds with the low graphical fidelity even on max settings... makes the game feel less like a 2016 release, and more like a 2012 release.\n\nthe options and performance is great though - the only glaring flaws are that the game apparently has no Windowed or full screen windowed modes which boggles my mind and that the V-Sync has some weird mouse smoothing / acceleration. i run the game at 300FPS so it also sort of makes me sad there is no Ultra-HD Texture pack or something similar.\n\nI do recommend watching the full video review - as that illustrates the games strength and weaknesses much better than a few paragraphs can.\n","March 11","true","23.0"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","20","42","3","0"

While yes, the game has elements of the series and Hitman Blood Money, i couldn't have expected a worse remake.\n\nFirstly, stealth is far too simple, sneaking into the castle really couldnt have been simpler due to the god awful AI, i wouldnt have even needed a disguise. I stabbed the target in plain view of several other guards, who overlooked it, like you would a drunk man throwing up on the street, he walked on by and said "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" as he is scripted to say when officers approach them.\n\nSecondly, the maps feel somewhat reused. or at least recycled, but this isnt a great issue. I only managed to reach the third map however, due to the game crashing.\n\nWhile this wouldnt normally be an issue, this is how i discovered that the game does NOT HAVE AN AUTO SAVE FEATURE! nor does it have a mission select, meaning my only way forward was to replay the levels. Which also wouldnt have been a problem, but the already recycled maps mean that, to someone who has already seen them before, hold no replayability value.\n\nGunplay is also more tedious than it is fun, youre forever stuck in an aiming stance and felt largely clunky to use, and therefore make gunfights avoidable by convenience rather than survivability.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: A rather poor remake of the Death to Spies series thats trying to be Hitman: Absolution rather than a good stealth/spy game","March 16","false","1.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

This game stands very well all on it's own, and is actually a fantastic game. From what I understand, it is essentially Death to Spies 3, which is almost certainly not a bad thing at all. The graphics are actually pretty good and the sounds work very well to bring together an immersive experience. Adding to the immersion is the ability to go about each mission in any way you choose. This means you can accomplish the tasks in any order and way you like (as long as you do not get caught!). The way you go about your missions can even have an effect on later missions and the way they shape up, giving the game a high replayability factor as well. It can also be quite a bit of fun trying to find out where to hide bodies without being seen!\n\nPositives:\n+ Immersive world, you'll analyze each level carefully\n+ Excellent storyline, especially for an action game I refused to skip any cutscenes, they played out so well it was like a movie\n+ RPG-Style points system makes your Assassin somewhat customizable\n\nNegatives:\n- There are ways to game the Stealth system\n- A lot of Trial & Error gameplay, which can be frustrating for some\n\n\nEven for this gamer, who isnt a fan of most Stealth games, I found this to be a VERY engaging, immersive and fun game. The ability to go about each mission in any way you choose is fantastic, you'll find yourself changing strategies on the fly often. You'll adapt like a true hitman.\n\nVerdict:\n\n8/10\nI absolutely love it, even as a Stealth/Action game (which are NOT my strong points!). This honestly can be put up there to stand WITH the Hitman series, not as a clone/knockoff. It is sincerely worth every penny. This has the best of Action, Stealth and a really super-solid storyline that is movie-worthy to go along with it.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n","March 11","true","4.8"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","13","32","2","0"

Furthermore the story seemed average and didn't catch much of my attention. The mission info at the beginning was also apalling, I found several grammatical errors right off the bat! The sentences seemed rushed and not reviewed. Choosing my weapons I also noticed that many of them were similar to Hitman, such as the fiber wire used to choke enemies. The tutorial did not show me how to do actions in real time; it just quickly showed some text bubbles before I began the game. So I was thrust into this 2000-graphics looking game, and I don't like to hate on graphics but the pictures on the steam page are very misleading. This does in fact look like a PS2 game, which it shouldn't unless it was intentional (which I'm guessing it wasn't) The maps were bland, I was lost for a while trying to figure out what to do, the AI response is horrible; they get suspicious when you just walk past them but once I tried to kill a guard three times, the suspicion meter did not even show. I got caught when I wasn't supposed to, and I ran into a room where I should have been safe and out of sight, except that five soldiers came barging in with their guns. I was on Normal difficulty. The game also crashed after 20 minutes of gameplay. There was no incentive to continue as well. I admire that they are trying to do a game similar to Hitman, but this just doesn't cut it, especially with a $30 price tag.\nOh and also when I died I had to start the whole game over again, because there were no autosaves and there was no communication recieved that I had to save just in case.\n\nBasically\n-Grammar Issues\n-Bland Atmosphere\n-No incentive to continue\n-AI is not well programmed\n-Story is meh\n-Art style at beginning is not as well-drawn as it should have been\n-TOO similar to Hitman, doesn't introduce anything exciting or new\n-No autosaves\n\nIt's ultimately your choice, but you can click my video to see how the game runs and how the AI reacts.","March 11","false","0.7"," 27 of 83 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","27","83","2","10"
