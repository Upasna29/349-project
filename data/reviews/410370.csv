Its like a cross between space invaders, arkanoid and tetris. It's a hectic and fast paced arcade game with puzzley elements. Ha! it's bloody hard to describe, you'll just have to play it.\nAlso, the soundtrack is AMAZING!","February 27","true","10.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/410370/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","My mother was the one that introduced me to video games. I can remember playing games for as long as I can remember being alive. It started with the Atari and moved onto the Commodore 64, the Apple IIe and other computing dinosaurs of the early to mid 1980’s. I was addicted to playing games before I was old enough to really know what I was doing in them. It’s stayed with me throughout my entire life. I remember games such as Jumpman, Toy Bizarre, the original release of Tetris and pretty much the entire list of games that  RETREAM list in their Steam description. And to think that I have my mother to thank for this addiction that has stayed with me throughout my entire life. Thus, you’ll understand when I say this that RETREAM have given me yet another reason to wish that she was still alive. I wish that she had have seen and played Huenison. It’s the exact type of game that I can see her getting her inner geek on and playing until all hours of the morning. We would have shared an enormous appreciation for this game.\n\nBefore I was granted an opportunity to review this game my contact at RETREAM, the lead and perhaps only developer, a lovely person by the name of Simone Bevilacqua, made just one request. He asked that I take a deep look at his game rather than just a short shallow look at their game.  He claimed that although it appears to be just a simple arcade game that there are a lot of interconnected facets that produce a complex product and that this is simply unable to be seen on a ‘shallow play’. Personally, I think that Simone was selling his game short to me. Certainly the game starts easily enough and one may first think that it’s just another Tetris clone with a couple of simple mechanical changes – and perhaps this is what he were implying – but one needn’t be a brain surgeon to gain an almost immediate understanding that the game is so very much more than that. In that fact I believe that the game does possess the type of beauty and soul that is lacking in many of today’s pick up and throw away games.\n\nThankfully the Steam Description, below, does a very good job of explaining the soul and concept of the game. You do shoot at falling bricks with a cannon that is capable of shooting multiple different colors. You must hit each brick with the right colored cannon fire. If you do not then the brick will not clear. But the game is deeper than that. Some of the falling bricks have different powers. For example, some you must hit multiple times, some change color each time you hit them until you’ve cycled through the entire color range, others you have to hit four or five times before it’s power has weakened to disappear and of course there are power ups when you kill the brick they will turn white and magic happens when you destroy your next block. If you don’t get to the blocks in time they will add a line at the bottom of the screen while if you miss a shot the dreaded zapper line at the top lowers a row. In the latter’s respect it feels like Tetris on steroids.\n\nYou need to consider the total sum of every component of the game to truly appreciate Huenison. Thankfully there is a very thorough demo of the game available on the Steam store page. I definitely would recommend playing the demo if you’re on the fence with this game. I can only describe it and praise the game so much but actually playing the game will have you forking out the fiver needed to purchase the game at full price. And at that five dollar mark I would tell you that it is an absolute bargain. It’s one of those games that possesses the quality of addiction that you literally could spend countless hours playing this game.\n\nThe graphics and the chiptune music capture the very essence of what video games were like thirty years ago. However, they also help transform what could be deemed to be a very niche product – a game that only appeals to those of us who were alive to enjoy 1980’s gaming – to a presentable status to a modern audience who should be able to appreciate the vast quality that the classic style gameplay contains. You’re not going to find anything that looks, feels and sounds as genuinely classic as what Huenison does without it actually being a true classic. In that regard it is perfect.\n\nMum, I wish you were alive. You would have loved Huenison and I hope that Steamified’s readers will too. It’s one of the most outstanding indie games that I have had the privilege of not only playing but featuring on Steamified this year.\n\nSteamified Score: 8.5/10 – Powerfully addictive. A greatly appreciated reminder of the types of games that defined my childhood. A game with a beautiful soul.\n\nFor more details on how to be successful within the game I invite you to take a moment to read the developer’s fantastic Tips ‘n’ Tricks post that he contributed to the game’s discussion boards. You can find the thread here. In all honesty as much as I can write about the game within the time that I have played it – I’m presently at over three hours and would love to spend significantly more with it but that will not be possible in the time that I have before posting this feature – there are just far too many nuances in the nine game modes for me to write much more effectively about the game.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It demands your full attention and quick decision making and of course quick reflexes! The gameplay is hectic at first but once you figure out various strategies Huenison comes alive and all of a sudden you feel like Neo in The Matrix :-)\n\nUs AmigaOS4.1 users have been fortunate enough to enjoy this great game for over a year now and now Steam fans get to join in on the fun! Put the volume up high & enjoy the old school tunes!","March 3","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
