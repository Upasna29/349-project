Great mix of adventure+point and click.\nGameplay Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ga-ECY-Pzo\nPlaying as Maya Anderson, you travel to a mental institution in some attempt to help patients who have all recently gone 'insane'. That's where the fun begins. Stepping inside each patients subconscious by using your hypnosis powers will take you to a crazy world filled with objects related to thoughts of that person.\n\nOne of the first things you will notice inside these worlds are 'phobias'. Running into these enemies loads a battle scene where you must work cells along pathways to take majority control of the 'nodes', interesting blend and adds almost rpg-like elements. Further along you uncover missing pieces of the memory that will present you with 'puzzles', much more adventure-like in nature, generally involving simple combinations of items. Completing these tasks is the primary form of game progression.\n\nThe lovely artstyle and themes of each world alone make Hypnosis standout, while making you want to continue playing. Couple that with a well read fully voiced story and decent price, we have a winner. Cheers. :)","January 29, 2015","true","2.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","32","41","0","1"

Remember that movie The Cell, with Jennifer Lopez?  Me either, but anyway.  You play as a mental health professional, well, actually a hypnotist.  A mental health professional the same way a chiropractor is a doctor, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe same can be said in the game, as you have the ability to enter peoples minds and wander about the disjointed dreamscapes of their brainlands.  Neither reality nor fantasy, these bizarre dioramas are both creepy and lovely, bringing to mind other games such as Sanitarium or The Cat Lady.  As you wander these areas that would make Freud think twice about just what a cigar really is, you solve mysteries like Scooby Doo, and do battle with nefarious Fig Men of Imagination.  If you enjoy surrealsim, then don't Dali, check this game out.","February 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","24","29","12","0"

I hate giving bad reviews but even ignoring the borderline-offensive stereotypes and extremely hammy dialogue - the puzzles themselves are super simple. I felt like I was playing a kids game!  The story was also pretty much non-sensical as well.  Some of the art was nice... so it has that going for it lol","February 14, 2015","false","4.8"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","30","41","2","0"

In fact, this game is basically Psychonauts but not tedious and with a strange eastern european charm. (Not jank. Charm. Never crashed on me, never buggy, nothing awkwardly translated.)\n\nIf you want a surrealist adventure game that begins with a missing persons case and turns into "the internet is a metaphor for the universe itself", you're in the right place. Look at my flashlight.","August 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undeadredhead/recommended/343430/","undeadredhead","UndeadRedhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undeadredhead/","43 products in account","Hypnosis is the B Movie Cult Classic of point and click games that you never knew you wanted, until it fell into your lap for $5 and you were just like....ok?\n\nIt is simple, satisfying and gloriously strange.\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly good, while the constant shift in level theme/art style provides much entertainment. The story starts with simple mystery, and then cannonballs into an intergalactic psych romp full of cartoonish twists and turns. I am still trying to figure out whether the game is intentionally funny, or unintentionally so, but either way, just like Ed Wood's B-Movie Classic, Plan-9 From Outer Space, this game features all your favourite celebrities (without their permission) and allows you to DIVE INTO THEIR DREAMS through the POWER OF HYPNOSISSSSSS. [note: therefore it is nothing really much like that movie I mentioned at all]\n\nSeriously, Grace Jones, Einstein, Richard Branson, That Dude From The Big Bang Theory...the gang's all here and they're just begging for your cleavage-aided psychiatric assistance.\n\nSOME may say that the puzzles are too simple and easily solved, but to them I say NAY. My main grievance with Point & Click games is that they always feature that one frustrating puzzle, which you can never solve so you cannot continue playing. And that makes me feel kind of stupid. Hypnosis features puzzles which are as easily solved as an 8 year old's homework, so they're great for your self esteem. And, just like your favourite elementary school teacher, the game gives you GOLD STARS for completing puzzle battles (also good for the self esteem). But the real prize is watching this weird, weird story unfold.\n\nAfter completing the game and witnessing that truly epic ending, I can only recommend it as the best, terrible game I've ever played and would highly recommend it for anyone with a good sense of humour and a spare 5 bucks.\n\n\nNow for my few critiques:\n\n1. Unsure of why the main character needs to be randomly sexy and have a standby boob-adjusting animation. I would like to point out, that as a psychiatric professional, I would consider her low-cut outfit inappropriate for the workplace. Don't even get me started on those ones from the store O_O\n\n2. Continuing the above theme - Do Maya and Dr Blanche understand the concept of patient-doctor boundaries? *spoiler alert* Hiring your patients, hypnotising them against their will, getting all up in their brain and then telling them how to live their lives - pretty sure that's a breach of like all of the psychiatric rules.","April 12","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The puzzles are fairly simple, but they fit the gameplay perfectly. The overall impressions are highly positive with the undeniably pleasant aftertaste.","March 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orphansforsale/recommended/343430/","orphansforsale","shut up dont look at me","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orphansforsale/","17 products in account","This game has a lot of replay value. It's the first game I played on steam and I still go back to it often to try and fill out all the achievements. The little strategic goblin battle things get increasingly more difficult and it can be frustrating  trying to play through them, but they're definitely possible and they force you to think outside of the box which is p cool. It's ok if you skip though a few of them the first time around, because you'll defintely want to go back and replay it. Nice, easy play for when you're looking to waste time.","February 16, 2015","true","16.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

I really wouldn't recommend the game for just the story-line, though.  While funny, the main gameplay is simply too easy to be too much fun.  The reason I recommend the game is for the "tower defense-esque" mini game, which you can go back and play after you are done with the main campaign (sort of like getting 3 stars on each level for Angry Birds). There are quite a number of levels to attempt to master, and I found this very satisfying.\n\n","May 9, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I found this to be the most fun part of the game, as every consciousness is unique and can be fun to explore. And despite the fact that the characters are rather bland, it is fun to get to know their inner thoughts better.\n\nYou battle so called ''phobias'' in an easy battlesystem, don't go looking for a challenge here.\nThe main storyline is actually less interesting than the characters.. I found it to be rather dissapointing.\nHowever the game is enjoyable and very easy to play through, it only took me about 5 hours (and this is even when you use all of your ''talking'' options and exploring options). So i wouldn't buy it for more than 5.\n\nAnd, as an official psychologist, i have to say that every psychological aspect of this game is complete nonsense... really, what a load of crap..\n\nBut in all, an enjoyable game to play if you don't want to think too hard and just have fun for a few hours!","May 9, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
