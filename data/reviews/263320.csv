The downloadable market is flooded with games that emulate everything from 16-bit RPGs to 2d platformers. Kickstarter has brought us updates and sequels to the games we grew up on and some of the key titles that defined the childhoods of 90's gamers have received HD re-releases. While some games simply play the nostalgia card to give us the warm fuzzy feelings that get us to open our wallets faster than an inebriated middle aged man at a strip joint, others use nostalgia as a vehicle for humor and personality. Saturday morning RPG falls into the latter category.\n\nFollowing an interesting episodic structure, Saturday Morning RPG places players in the role of Marty, an average teenager who is given a magic trapper keeper by a power glove clad figure called The Wizard in order to face off with Commander Hood. It waste's no time conjuring images of Fred Savage and a certain band of real American Heroes. Each episode plays out like an episode of your favorite 1980's cartoon with some sort of malicious force attempting to carry out a destructive plan and your Hero's journey to thwart their efforts. The episodic structure is actually quite interesting, your level and inventory carries over between episodes and players can go back to previous episodes to uncover missed items and sidequests. Also there are a couple minor cases where something that your character does in one episode carries over in another. The narrative elements are minimalistic but some characters carry over between episodes creating a bit of continuity. The problem is that characters have very little personality, they instead lean too heavily on what they are supposed to reference. Players who are unfamiliar with the source material used to create these characters will find little interest in them and some of the jokes centered around some of these characters read like overused memes.\n\nUnlike most RPGs, Saturday Morning RPG doesn't dwell too much on it's narrative and in instead a bit more focused on combat and it managed to offer a surprisingly robust system for a small budget title. Aside from sharing an acronym with Super Mario RPG, Saturday Morning RPG borrows heavily from the timing based combat system in Mario's first role playing outing. Timing button presses during attacks yields greater damage and timing a button press at the last second can help players avoid major damage. Almost every special attack has some sort of mini game that requires a bit of skill and dexterity to make the most of. In addition, turns can be sacrificed in order to charge Marty up, giving him a damage multiplier. The charge function can be used in one of three ways, the first and most effective requires players to rapidly press buttons to build the multiplier, another requires timed button presses to make the most of the multiplier's potential and finally there is a charge function that requires no interaction but yields the smallest multiplier. Being able to dish out five times the damage in a single turn makes it well worth foregoing an action. Additionally, there are dozens of items and up to five can be equipped--each giving Marty a new special attack. Their abilities recall the abilities that Final Fantasy's Blue Mages are capable of learning and provide a mix of offensive and defensive skills.\n\nThe final piece of the combat puzzle comes in the form of stickers and covers for Marty's magic trapper keeper. The cover can be swapped out for a stat buff and up to five scratch and sniff stickers can adorn the front. At the onset of each battle, a fixed period of time is allotted for players to scratch each one of these stickers. Doing so can further buff Marty's stats or debuff your foes. The catch is that the more rewarding the buff or debuff, the more time it takes to scratch the sticker so finding the most beneficial combination of stickers that you can feasibly and consistently activate before each battle adds an appreciable degree of strategy.\n\nThe problem with this whole system is two fold, the first of which is that fact that it can make the game exhausting to play. Starting each and every battle furiously smashing our analog stick back and forth to scratch stickers then mashing the A button like a coked out woodpecker in order to gain the highest multiplier become taxing. It should be noted that Saturday Morning RPG was originally designed with phones and tablets in mind so some control input issues are not surprising. The other, more serious problem however is that the game is simply too easy. Anyone who is reasonably quick and has respectable timing will breeze through the game largely unopposed. It is completely feasible to build a multiplier in one turn and knock a boss out with your second action. There is one fight however that is an appreciable test of your skills and ability to strategize to be uncovered.\n\nRounding out the trip down memory lane, Saturday Morning RPG features a hodgepodge of graphical elements to recall games of the past. Characters are composed of 16 bit style sprites but inhabit a 3d world recalling the look of Paper Mario. The environments are rendered in simple 3D with a cartoonish aesthetic. Unfortunately the environments can appear too simplistic at times with blocky geometry and flat textures. Being a mobile device port, it's not surprising that the tech isn't up to scratch but a little more spit and polish for the PC release could have really given Saturday Morning RPG an invigorating style. Audio is generally strong however with a soundtrack composed by Vince DiCola of Rocky IV fame and Kenny Meriedeth.\n\nSaturday Morning RPG a solid and enjoyable game for those familiar with the pop culture of the 1980's and early 1990's but gamers unfamiliar with the bag from which it pulls it's gags are less likely to be tickled by it's appeal to nostalgia. Even so, the robust combat system and episodic gameplay make it really enjoyable to play and if you feel so inclined, replay. It's just unfortunate that players who want a bit of a challenge have to dig for secret boss fights to find it and that your favorite input device may fall victim to the harsh stick waggleing and button mashing required to play. Even still with a budget price, four complete episodes to enjoy and a fifth and sixth on the way, the good exceeds the bad and if you are of the right temperament, you may even find the experience totally righteous.","February 24, 2014","true","12.2"," 70 of 85 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","70","85","0","5"

Those were the good old days- when CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX all had Saturday Morning blocks of cartoons.\n\nYou get to play as Marty, a guy who watches too many of these old cartoons.  His goal is to stop the forces of evil from taking over the world- and to stop them by using as many 80s pop-culture references as he can cram in his Trapper Keeper.  You can attach scratch-and-sniff stickers to your binder to give you special powers and increased stats when you scratch them, but let's face it- Marty's no Lion-O when it comes to battle.  Relying on physical attacks just won't get you anywhere- instead, you can rely on those same pop-culture shoutouts, like giant plastic playsets (like G.I. Joe's old giant carriers) and rainbow-striped zebras, and obvious knockoffs of Care Bears to do damage.\n\nIf you remember the late 80s, you'll love all the shoutouts to cartoons that anyone born after the early 90s will never get the references to- if you were born later, you'll love the game for its playstyle- it's easy to pick up, fun to play, and it won't run you that much.  There are four episodes currently- if you count the overly short and played-up-for-cheesiness Christmas Special, and I'd like to see a fifth, if they ever decide to make one- or a sequel.","October 5, 2014","true","4.7"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","46","53","3","0"

If you grew up in that era you'll find this game hilariously entertaining.  If you're too young to remember those decades, you'll probably miss all the parodies and references (you've been warned).  The episodic storyline and witty dialogue are the highlights here.\n\nThe gameplay is fun too.  It's a turn-based combat system that requires input (timed button presses, QTEs) throughout each battle.  There is a lot going on during combat, even a pre-combat buff/de-buff minigame, which can seem a little over-complicated at first.  It may take a few battles to become comfortable with the game mechanics.  Also, the difficulty can be scaled in several different ways so it's flexible for any skill level.\n\nThe only problem I had is that the pre-battle minigame is hell on your analog stick.  Luckily you can just use the mouse then grab your controller for the rest of the battle.\n\nSaturday Morning RPG is a great game; a real hidden gem.

It is a love letter to 80s cartoons, full of nostalgia.\n\nIt feels incredibly unique for a RPG with a style all its own. You get a trapper keeper that you can put stickers on it for buffs. Well a chance at buffs. You can put 5 stickers on the trapper keeper, but when a battle starts, you have a certain amount of time to scratch the stickers for buffs in battle. The battles are incredibly simple, yet take far too long. You have powers, none of which feels powerful. Each power has a limited amount of uses per battle, but it replenishes after each battle. The battle has a timeline. Depending on what attack you're going to use determines where you are on the timeline. Certain attacks are quicker, such as using the pencil put you first. When a battle starts, the enemy always goes first. No matter how many times the game bluntly tells you 'sneak attack,' they'll always attack first. It feels like a glitch. Most abilities have button timings to do more damage.\n\nBecause your abilities and attacks do little damage, you have the ability to 'charge your battery' which will become a damage multiplier for your next ability or attack. You can keep charging until its 9.9x. You have a variety of ways to charge the battery, either by spamming a button to charge it, being accurate on a slide bar or just picking a default 2.8x. I got tired of button mashing, so I just always selected the default 2.8x.\n\nYou can get more abilities by finding them or purchasing them in vending machines. You have to do something with the gold you collect. Like the stickers, you can only have 5 abilities equipped at once, but that's enough. I made it through the entire game without buying an extra ability. I would visit the vending machines, see everything laid out and there wouldn't be any descriptions. Sure I could buy the abilities and equip them to see what they did, but my first episode abilities were good enough to take me through the entirety of the game.\n\nMost of the abilities and attacks all have a timing to them. I never really liked timing based attacks, because you quickly get the hang of it and exploit it. That's probably why other RPGs just use random chance. However, the powers can only be used X amount of times in battle. After each battle you're fully recharged. HP, MP, powers and everything. You never get any other characters, its just you against Cobra soldiers, He Man lizard men and Transformer robots.\n\nYou can block / dodge attacks by pushing a button at the right time, but even though it tells you that you defended, it sometimes damages you more than an undefended attack. I'm not sure if that's a bug. The timing with some things seems off where I know that I've missed a perfect time window, but it still counted as perfect. It is also odd hearing a boss laugh about how you fool energy attacks only make me stronger, right after I energy attack him, right before he dies after saying that. It is also odd that I can get a 'sneak attack' on an enemy where it bluntly tells me sneak attack, yet the enemies get to go first. You'll see the enemies on the map, so there are no random battles. Enemies don't respawn, so you can't really grind. The enemies and battlers aren't varied enough and eventually just feel like a chore. Another cluster of 3 soldiers, another pair of red transformers. Even moving into episode 3, you'll still find the same soldiers from episode 2.\n\nIf you die, then you just restart the battle or from the last checkpoint. That keeps you playing with no real consequence for losing. To top that off, there is an arrow that bluntly points you in the direction of your current quest. You will beat this game if you keep playing.\n\nThe overhead map uses 2D sprites on a 3D map... yep. You heart that right. The 2D 16 bit sprites on a 3D map with millions of colors. It just looks out of place. The sprites aren't that impressive, but the 3D has a good look to it. It makes me think this game was rushed or cheap. They could have done 3D modeled characters, because the entire world is 3D modeled, but nothing is animated outside of the 2D sprites.\n\nThe game has four 'episodes' and they're pretty quick within 40 - 50 minutes each. There is usually one puzzle per dungeon / episode. The puzzles show some interesting stuff and real thought put into them. If only there could have been more to keep me engaged. The final episode was a disappointment and just felt quick with no challenge, the final boss was a sad pushover.\n\nThe game takes a brief 3 hours or so to complete it. There are side quests, an endless battle mode and an arena mode. I just can't justify the $7 for this game when it wasn't fun. I've played other games that I really enjoyed that last only 3 hours, but this isn't one of them.\n\nThis game just seems rushed and shallow. More like a set of awful mini games disguised as a RPG. Battles are extremely repetitive and you feel very underpowered. You'll button mash far too much to buff yourself so you can actually damage enemies. Each attack takes way too long due to attack animations and killing animations. It also feels pretty linear even if episode 2 opens up into a less linear area, which is entirely inside of a school.\n\nAvoid this game.","April 9, 2014","false","3.7"," 82 of 130 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","82","130","0","2"

While I wasn't an 80s kid so I was never the biggest G.I. Joe or Transformer fan, I do know a lot about the pop culture of the time and I'm a huge fan of films from the decade.The real draw here was the game's battle system to me. I'm a huge Super Mario RPG fan, and this game draws inspiration from the series that follow it up: Paper Mario. It's also been used in Costume Quest (which the game is more similar to in design), and will even be in the upcoming South Park: The Stick of Truth. So as a fan of the genre, I felt it was nesscary to toss down the cash on it.\n\nAnd I enjoyed it. The game isn't the best RPG I've ever played (of all time...ever), but it's the writing, humor, and references that made me want to keep playing. Now, I've heard people saying this is a short game. Well, not really. You aren't going to beat this game quickly unless you skip all the side-quests and head straight from point A to point B. I don't suggest this. You'll miss out on a lot of a fun events, like when you find a Mogwai-esque creature and have the choice to feed it and get it wet before giving it back to Phoebe Cates herself. There IS a point around the third episode where the battles started to feel repetitive, but that soon went away as I found myself smashing Transformers with a freakin' axe. Not everyone is going to like it, but there are enough options in battle to keep situations fresh if need be. Better healing options (I didn't find a single GREAT healing item in my run) and more PCs (or a Paper Mario-esque helper) would have spiced up the battles, but if you're a fan of this type of battle system then you'll enjoy it.\n\nYou'll spend almost 5 hours with the first four episodes of Saturday Morning RPG. Another five more if you go back for achievements or try a hand at the other game modes. And for $7, it's in a good price range where a blind buy isn't risky if you're a fan of the genre and have just a little knowledge of the 80s. It's not the best RPG of all time, but it's a great indie effort and I'm always happy to see more of these.\n\n(7/10)\n\nRecommended If You Like:\n\nPaper Mario\nCostume Quest\n80s movies, cartoon, and general pop culture","January 30, 2014","true","4.8"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","32","44","0","0"

The game has some crazy achievements, such as fighitng 1,000 and even up to 5,000 battles, based on an initial idea of 20 episodes. Since it didn't do well, they had to limit their ambitions to six episodes, hopefully with a fine tuning of the achievements in the future.\n\nBut why is all this necessary? The game has everyone a gamer would be looking for. A series of episodes with a simple story, with tons of nostalgic references for one thing. I mean the main character is a guy named Marty, who rides a hoverboard, and gets his powers from a mysterious man known as The Wizard. The retro graphics are a joy to behold, the music is killer, and the gameplay is a very solid Paper Mario/Super Mario RPG type of thing, with button presses for better defense and better attacks.\n\nNot to mention your magic spells use everyday objects, from cookies and paper airplanes, to swords and baseball bats, up to toy aircraft carriers and transformer-like figurines. Hell even your notebook plays a part in the game as depending on the cover and the stickers you can enact various bonuses before each battle.\n\nAs it stands at this time there are four episodes, with total time of about 10 hours to get through all of them. There is an arena mode against two semi-tough bosses, and endless battle challenges based around each chapter. You can get the grindy achievements I mentioned earlier legitimately, but my first run through the game got me less then even 100 battles, not counting everything else. Still if you want to, the game is a pleasure to play, and with the huge episode 5 coming early next year, there's no time like the present to get in and get ready for it.\n\nSuper totally awesomely retro-nostalgia recommendation.","December 12, 2015","true","11.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It's a tribute to GI Joe, Transformers, every John Waters movie, Back to the Future, and of course the bygone Saturday morning cartoon lineups.  Pretty much every other pixel-graphics game out there uses them not for nostalgia, but because they're cheap and easy.  At least in this game the graphics actually complement the theme.  The badge system and equipment scheme familiar to many RPGs is cleverly turned into "stickers," and items stashed into a magical Trapper Keeper-style notebook.  Righteous.  There are a good bit of side quests to explore.  Some of the weapon animations are absurdly funny, and you earn steam achievements for trying out different things during combat.  Which, by the way, is a well designed mix of strategy and button mashing.  The four main story quests are on the easy side, but the arena and endless-wave battle modes are challenging.  Completionists will likely want to replay all the levels to get everything.  I'm looking forward to episode 5.  Recommended for turn-based RPG fans of any age and, definitely for every 80s kid.","January 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It touts the throwback to the 80's pretty heavily and it delivers without being just one name drop after another.

It triggers a lot of nostalgia, and I am really enjoying it. It doesn't just throw things at you from the 1980s, the entire writing style is done like cartoons were done back then. The first episode actually has your girlfriend captured by the villian so he can force her to marry him. It's goofy and absurd with little bits of gameplay thrown in.\n\n\nThat said, if you take all of that away... This is not a great game. The controls are really not well explained and you have to figure out how to use each new attack all on your own through trial and error. The menu system is not very well designed, and before you can even adjust your graphics settings you have to start a new game. Maybe this is intentional, since most games you played back then required you read everything from the instruction book. Or if you rented the game and it didn't have one, you'd have to figure it all out yourself.\n\n\nI still recommend this game because in spite of the gameplay issues, I'm enjoying it.

So, obvious bias aside, I will try to review this the same way that I review other games: by aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe main aesthetics this appeals to are Sensory, Fantasy, Narrative and Discovery. Challenge is also there depending on how you set the difficulty in game and how much you are concerned with acheivements. There's also a huge nostalgia factor for anyone that grew up in the 80's or 90's.\n\nFor those who like 80's music (pop/rock and video game/cartoon soundtracks) you will really enjoy the soundtrack that Vince DiCola and Kenny Meriedeth have composed.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like Super Mario RPG(and Paper Mario Series), Earthbound(Mother Series), Pokemon, Final Fantasy (Particularly 1-9), Costume Quest, or other JRPGs you should give Saturday Morning RPG a try. Also I suggest it to fans of 80's and 90's music and pop culture. If you enjoy humorous games (like Double Fine games) this is worth checking out. If you are on the fence and can't decide if you would like it you can try the full first episode for free if you have a tablet.","January 30, 2014","true","2.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game takes place in a boys dream where he explores the world on his skate board and fights off enemies to save the girl.  The script is deliberately cliche and has lots of vague references from the era.  For me the big let down was the combat, it just wasn't fun.  The attacks consist of either quicktime events with on screen button prompts or timing a button press with a cursor moving along a meter.  The player can also charge up for bigger attacks but this mechanic is another event requiring a button press timed against a meter.

The combat system could be deeper, but it's adequate to make the battles exciting and often challenging.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the writing. The authors managed to combine some of the best storytelling elements of early RPG's with mid-1980s' cartoon serials. Like it's inspirations, the game's stories are funny yet also morally sincere. The snarky irony of 1990-current storytelling is conspicuous by its absence.\n\nHighly recommended. It's not necessary at all to have lived through the mid-1980s to enjoy this game.

This was one for me. It is a very casual JRPG game oozing with 80's nostalgia. It features very unique abilities such as a 3 1/2 inch disk slap to the face or a care bear stare. Pair that with active defending and a couple other surprises during combat makes it quite enjoyable.\n\nThe game is broken up in to 4 current (5th to be released later TBD free of charge) episodes. Each features a different story line and location. The first episode was about 30-40 minutes and the second was about 2 hours taking my time.\n\nThe gem with this game is best equated to the book, "Ready Player One" where the nostalgia drives the story. For someone my age (31) or older, you will love the references from times past (ie: stay off the adult BBS's or The Wizard with a Power Glove).\n\nDo yourself a favor and pick up this game. It's the price of a value meal and will provide you with quite a bit of entertainment, just don't take it as a hardcore JRPG, because that would be doing it all wrong.","January 31, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Also each episode you pretty much have free reign of the maps once you pass certain story parts and i'd say each episode is about 1-2 hours if you do most of the battles and quests.\n\nLastly what puts this game on top is the insane amount of references to 80's, 90's movies, tv-shows, and other pop culture.  While i love Obsidian(the developer) and have no love for South Park and that soon to be released RPG may end up being good, but somehow i think this gem is already better, and only ♥♥♥♥♥ have the gall to charge $60 out the gate for a comedy/non 3d RPG.   I would say this game is worth full price though definately don't hesitate if it goes on sale","February 1, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(I played this game with a Xbox controller so for the sake of this review I will using the Xbox buttons).\nThe combat in this game is turn based like your average olden days RPG, however it has timing aspect to it. This includes pressing A at the right time to block enemies attack so they deal less damage to you, doing small mini games in some of your spells and starting every battle spinning your joystick to get buffs that you choose beforehand in your little notepad. Some of the powers include spawning rainbows out of you to attack your enemies, playing simon says to kill the enemies and I would go over all of them but I feel as if I would be spoiling it for you if I did.\nThe story is broken up into 4 episodes (soon to be 5) where our hero, marty is trying to save the world from Commander Hood while trying to gain the affection of his crush, now that may sound cliché but trust me, this story is anything but cliché, It is incredibly enjoyable to watch play out and obviously you have dem sweet sweet side missions during the episodes which I found myself laughing at on multiple occasions.\nOh you finished the game you say, well you can also replay old episodes with your now stronger character whom you can also take into arena mode to fight stronger versions of enemies, also an endless battle mode where you choose an episode and fight endless waves of enemies from that part of the game, and of course you have leaderboards so you can show all your friends just how much better than them you are.\nThe only thing I dislike is the length of each of the episodes if you were to ignore all the side missions you could finish the first 2 episodes in around an hour or two, however if you are playing an RPG and not doing side missions and exploring, Then you are doing RPGs wrong, oh and you also get XP for exploring which is great.\nI would recommend this game to all my friends hense why I am writing this review, so buy it today :D","September 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, even if you did not grow up in the 80's I think you will enjoy this game as long as you like a good old school RPGs.\n\nPros:\n\n- great dialogue that will make you chuckle, even if you don't get all the references it is relatable enough for anyone to get a laugh out of the characters in this game.\n\n-fun turn based combat- think super mario RPG, if you never played that shame on you, you really should, but basically it is turn based but with timed button presses.  Different moves you do bring up different mini games that require timing to inflict max damage.  Also when enemies attack you, timed button presses reduce the damage dealt, the better your timing the less damage they inflict.\n\n- lots of cool items to collect, the weapons in this game are varied and funny and range from ordinary stuff like baseball bats to some bizzare things like simon says and fruit stripes gum.\n\n-free DLC coming in the future, 4 episodes right now and the game will probably take you roughly 4-5 hours to finish if you do most of the side quests (you will want to, as they are generally worth a chuckle), the developer has confirmed episode 5 is coming soon which will be free, any future episodes will also be free.\n\n-epsiodic layout gives the game a nice feel, each level is large enough on its own and riddled with secrets and side quests and the episodic nature of the game means you don't have to worry about doing any boring backtracking which is all too common in RPG's\n\ncons\n\n-linear character development, not a huge con but if your into branching paths and stuff like that you won't get it here, you quickly learn that magic is the best, you will pour your stats into that and wreak havoc with your flying laser discs and karate kid headbands.\n\nOverall if you are into turn based rpg's with fun combat system and a funny story you will like this.  It is not an epic game, and it does not take itself seriously, but it is fun and you will laugh while you play it, and IMO that is what video games are all about.","August 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In the battles there are button pushes that require timing.  So it is a bit more active, but it makes it fun too.\n\nThis game is chock full of 1980's parodies.  It's a light hearted affair, which made me think it would be too easy.  That is not  the case, while it isn't a die a lot game it is somewhat challenging.  Enough that it will make you want to pay attention to the buffs you choose.  I felt it was a nice balance and fun if you know the 80's.\n\nI installed it on my Ubuntu system and it worked no problem.  I did have issues with my brand 360 controller and my logitech one as well.  It involves a quick button push equaling a hundred pushes which could be used to cheat.  Every battle begins with a certain action known to destroy analog sticks anyway.  So I decided keyboard was the way to go, and it worked well for the game.\n\nThe price is low because the game is short,  I got halfway through in 4 hours.

The art styles don't match; you have a 3D world with clearly 2D pixelated characters, and the two don't mix well. Almost need to go high resolution 2D art to work well here.\n\n2. Having to waggle the thumb stick every fight gets annoying very quickly. Just let those stats be static and always on so we don't have to do this.\n\n3. Sneak attacks don't give any actual sneak bonus; even if you get one, the enemy is likely to attack first.\n\nI'm going to spend some more time with it, but early on it feels good as an RPG.","February 3","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm also not a big fan of how the main character looks either but whatever, could of added a life jacket to his wardrobe. :P\n\nEither way, it plays like Super Mario RPG so if you're old enough to be familiar with that game then you know what to expect.. a timed attack and defense system basically. Trial and error is required to get the timing down, so don't expect to be a pro right off the get go as encounters with new enemies is like learning how to play all over again.\n\nThe Dragon Ball Z power up system is a bit of an oddity and almost a necessity so don't neglect your magic stat.\n\nBe warned that the game is indeed unfinished and the last couple episodes have yet to be patched in... so don't go too hog wild maxing your character out as there will be no experience for you to gain when those episodes get released.\n\nOverall it's a decent game for the money spent. It's a good nostalgia trip and fun in stints.

I love it.\n\nWithin the first day I bought it, I spent 4 hours that night playing it. All the nostalgic references really tie into this game better than any game I have seen to this day. All the little jokes in the game and the sarcastic expressions have not failed to make me smile.\n\nTo describe the game is very difficult and as someone who is "new" to "gaming" it is quite a task. It is very much an RPG where there is turn-based fighting implemented within the game aswell as many little "sweets" that just make the game. Mini-games and side missions are everywhere and turn the 3-4 hour long story gameplay into something a lot more.\n\nThe game play in itself is like nothing I have experienced before and as someone who usually avoids RPGs, this is by far one of my favourite games, without a doubt. You can play with a keyboard or pretty much any console controller with full compatibility (even though I have destroyed the palm of my right hand through one of the many mini-games by violently moving the joystick on my Xbox 360 controller but hey, it's worth it).\n\nAfter having bought it for myself, I have bought it and recommended it to all my friends as I truly believe the good guys at Mighty Rabbit Studios deserve every single penny they get, as they continue to update the game. There are currently 4 episodes but soon to be 5 which was exciting to see developers of the game continuing to love their "baby", as they put it. So even when you think it's all over, there is even more!\n\nOverall, I would say that is an amazing game, with amazing developers and your money would be very well spent buying this game and then later recommending it to others who may be unsure about the game aswell as your friends and even family! Buy it and enjoy hours of endless fun!","September 4, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The best feature of this game in my opinion is that it is divided into episodes. Each episode has a self-contained story arc, and allows you to replay sections of the game you enjoy, whiel ignoring ones you don't. I would like to see a similar mechanic in more mainstream games.\nThe gameplay itself is very simple, and involves powering up, and mashing buttons. However, some attacks have amusing animations, such as the BB gun(you'll shoot your eye out, lol). Also, there is only one playable character, Marty.\nAll in all, This game is worth the six bucks just for the humor.

Some of the things that come to mind are:\n\nI was alive for the 80s.\n\nThe combat seems really simplistic at first, being turn-based with occasional minigames.  But it gets more interesting as you get more and varied items and try to figure out what they do, eventually developing a sort of fighting style around favored items.  It was a little easy sometimes, but by no means mindless.  Though I had a bit of an advantage--using a keyboard makes the button-mashing bits a lot easier.\n\nAt the end of a chapter it tells you whether you missed anything  (exploration, fights, items, &c) so you actually have a goal in going back to replay things other than "more XP".  Opt-out-able level-scaling means that it's not easy unless you want it to be.\n\nThere were a couple puzzle elements but they're more of a short break than a main component.\n\nThe script is humorous and slightly cheesy.  But so were 80s cartoons.\n\nI had a cannot-play-the-game-at-all level bug.  The devs fixed it within days.\n\nThe game has four episodes now--apparently they're planning a fifth and sixth for free.\n\nOne thing I really wish they had was a better explanation of the stat system.  Or really any explanation at all.  I've mostly gotten through by just guessing at what the numbers affect.\n\nThere's an arena mode and an endless mode, but I haven't played much of either yet.","March 20, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was drawn into a fight very frequently and could barely navigate my way around with so many enemies. It is a great way to grind for XP, if you're wanting that kind of action. Although I didn't happen to be in existence during the 80's, I did understand most of the references made throughout my experience in Saturday Morning RPG. If you frequent the Internet and know just a little bit about pop culture, you should be fine.\n\nThe references, packaged with the game's humor and absurd writing, is where Saturday Morning RPG really shines. I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect the game and that alone could serve as the basis for my recommendation of the game. The game's combat does get repetitive, very quickly in my case, but I still managed to enjoy myself despite this. There are plenty of side quests available, adding a great deal of content to the game. The game wouldn't take that long to beat by itself, so the side quests really add value to the game as a whole.\n\nThe game's graphics were nothing too fantastic. In fact, it looks like the graphics originated from a mobile game. Most of the graphics are sprite-based, so can't really complain there. The graphics blended both 2D and 3D objects into one, large 3D environment. It took a little getting used to, haven't played a game with this style in a while, but it wasn't anything to complain about.\n\nSaturday Morning RPG is a great effort, I really enjoyed my time with it and look forward to completing it in the near future.

Two big reasons why:\n\nthe first crime is Saturday Morning RPG is obviously imitating 90's jRPGs. While it gets the walking around the world part right, the jRPG style battles are god awful. I get the designers' decision to make the process involved with timed button presses, but they went overboard. Almost every attack relies on button mashing or QTEs. Worse is your character is so freaking weak your basic and special attacks hardly do anything to enemies so the battles drag needlessly. To be fair, there is a charge move that multiplies the damage your next attack does. Unfortunately charge is so OP I find myself relying almost entirely on it just to effectively damage normal enemies. And, of course, the charge move that gives you the best bonus is the one that involves hammering on a single button. REALLY annoying. The combat is easily bad enough that it ruins the game.\n\nthe second crime is the soundtrack is not included with the game or offered as a download. The music was co-composed by Vince DiCola. If you don't know who that is, he composed the instrumental tracks for the Transformers The Movie (also the awesome montage medley in Rocky IV which undeservely won a razzie) so Saturday Morning RPG has the exact same super cheesy 80's synth sound and its a perfect fit for the game and its theme. The OST is wonderful. I'm actually really ticked I can't listen to it!\n\nAside from these 2 issues, Saturday Morning RPG does everything else correctly. It crams as many sly references to 80's and early 90's Americana (including a Fruit Stripe reference) into its cliched cartoony plots that seem heavily biased towards Transformers and GI Joe (not complaining). Nostalgia is a big part of the enjoyment if you're old enough to pick up on most of it. The writing is actually good. There's a lot of awfully odd and amusing flavor text sprinkled thorughout. In fact, most of the references in the game are amusingly cornball nonsense. If it weren't for the game's awful combat system, I'd fully endorse the $7 asking price, but that awful combat system is like 1/2 the game and sucks a lot of the enjoyment out of it.","November 4, 2014","false","2.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

More of a humorous RPG/adventure than a traditional (indie) RPG. Humorous adventure games that have references and jokes in them don't usually interest me, but yeah. I gotta say the battle system is pretty good but the user interface is terrible.\n\nThe game becomes tedious after episode 3 in my opinion because the many enemies take too long to kill - the achievements require you to kill insane  amounts of enemies. The game takes about 10 hours to complete (I was afk so it took me a bit longer) and about 70+ hours to get 100% achievements.. the achievements not being worth it, if you ask me.\n\nOf course, you can always rush the episodes and make the game last much less by not doing sidequests.\n\nI'd give it a 8/10 - it's certainly not for everyone. If Defender's Quest made me a clicker, this one made me a button smasher.","February 12, 2014","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was somewhat disappointed.  The 80's references are jumbled and make no sense (why would the Cobra analog exist in a He-Man inspired locale?)  Many of the weapons are just plain useless and you basically have to "power up" all the time to be effective in overly simplistic combat.  The game world itself is overly simplistic and basically just involves wandering around from fight to fight until a boss battle.  ...And the soundtrack isn't very good and only vaguely reminiscent of Vince DiCola's other work.  Did I mention that the transforming sound effect from Transformers is literally somebody making "whoosh whoosh whoosh" sounds with their mouth into a microphone?  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the quality of other indie games I've played, but this one doesn't live up to the hype.","February 23, 2014","false","2.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Admittedly I am the exact target audience for this game - I grew up in the 80s and still remember sneaking downstairs waaaaaayyyy too early on Saturday mornings to watch Voltron, Dungeons & Dragons, Josie & the ♥♥♥♥♥cats, etc. and nearly dying of  excitement the year we finally got an original Nintendo. Everything from the music, to the quests, to the NPC dialog perfectly captures both my real and imaginary life from that time period - I love it.\nSpeaking somewhat less subjectively. The episodes are short - for me that's a bonus. Each one took me 45-80 minutes for the first run through, and that was fully exploring. But that is perfect if you don't have a lot of time and want to feel like you're accomplishing something in a gaming session. Also, there is some replay value, as you get to keep all your new shinies when you replay a level, so you can experience the satisfaction of instantly obliterating a baddie that gave you trouble the first time around. But I can see how a short game would be unsatisfying to some players. But don't say it's not worth the $$. It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.\nAlso the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.\nNo the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember?\nThat said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only "Ugg, this is unbearable" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please "risk" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game. The psychological benefits of just the first 15 minutes alone are probably greater than your last 5 therapy session.*\n\n*I'm not mocking therapy or people who need it! I'm in therapy! I'm just saying laughing and feeling good is good,","January 7, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this little gem for under $3 on a Steam sale, but it's well worth it even at the full price!  The game has spot on controls, great graphics, non-stop laughs, and a fun factor through the roof!  Even if you aren't a child of the 80s, this is an amazing ride not to be missed!\n\nUPDATE:  7/21/14\n\nI finally completed Saturday Morning RPG, clocking  in at just over 10 hours.  The game is so good that this seemed a tad short.  However, looking at its Steam page, there will be a 5th episode released as a free update!\n\nSo what do I think of Saturday Morning RPG now?  This is THE BEST RPG I've played just behind the Mass Effect Trilogy, and Oblivion, which are my number 1 & 2 favorites respectively!  That's saying quite a bit since I play a lot of RPG's.  I'd have to say this is even better than Might and Magic III, Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Final Fantasy 7&10, Super Mario RPG, and Costume Quest!\n\nI have to say, this game is completely worth it at full price!  Don't wait for a sale!  GO BUY THIS NOW!!!","July 14, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay has a classic JRPG feel, but still does its own thing. It's turn based, with timed attacks (and defenses). There's enough complexity to make strategy more than just selecting the same attack every time. You can select several stickers, that give combat buffs (or to your enemies, debuffs), as well as your special attacks in the form of items. These are balanced in terms of speed, power, accuracy, as well as price. One item might do massive damage, but be costly, or take a long time to be used once selected, or maybe not always hit. A big part of the strategy is selecting the best prefight equipment.\n\nThe episodes are decent length, about an hour or so, depending on how much you like to explore and do side quests. What I really appreciated was the lack of artificial extension. The game doesn't have you backtrack, or wander around to find where you need to go. Objectives are clear, and you can always tell where you need to go by arrows on screen. It keeps the game moving quickly if you want to rush, but you're also free to explore, talk to characters, and just enjoy the environments.\n\nWhile it's fun enough as an RPG, the overall atmosphere is the main draw. It lives and breathes nostalgia for the 80s (and early 90s), and anyone who spent their childhood watching Transformers, or playing with GIJoe will have an extra appreciation for it. Though, even if you weren't a kid in the US during the 80s/early 90s, you can still appreciate it.\n\nThe nostalgia isn't forced, or bled dry. It's just there, so the game feels like it's of the era, rather than just looking back at it. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the humor is subtle. In short, the game has charm.\n\nMy only complaint would be the lack of length. It doesn't have 100+ hours of gameplay... probably more like 10-20 until you get bored (I clocked in about 16 hours, when counting replaying the episodes, and trying out the arenas). Still, those will be pretty fun 10-20 hours.","July 6, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main character Marty has a vivid dream about the super villain Hood as he kidnaps the hero's love interest. Equipped with a magical notebook, he gets from a spontaneously appearing wizard, Marty makes his way into the enemy main base. And so begins the first episode of SMRPG.\n\nGameplay\n\nSMRPG features the very classical RPG Systems. Top down view while travelling through the overworld, doing some quest and turn based battles when engaging an enemy in the overworld. If you don't know what a RPG is, well, you missed quite a lot of video game culture. If a battle get started you switchSaturday Morning RPG 01 to a battle screen. During the course of the game you only have Marty as playable character, so goodbye party formations. The enemy side can consist of up to three opponents with varying color scheme. Luckily the devs got every scheme unique looks and features. Your different actions in the battle consists of a normal punch, a power up move and the various tools and toys you collect in your adventure. You get stuff like a floppy disk, a transformer, or even the power of a share bear. All with varying stats and effects. For some of them you need to beat a little mini game to unlock ist full power, but nothing really difficult. The power up action is a neat little feature. You have a damage multiplier in the lower left corner, that you can increase with every action. You have three possible options for that, two of them are mini games where you either need to press the button multiple times, or in the right moment, and an option where it happens automatically. You lose a round by doing that, but you get a multiplier increase of three or four points each time, so the pay of is quite nice.\n\nStory (Spoiler Warning)\n\nThis game is a living 80s reference. The main character Marty travels on\na hoverboard (Who can guess his last name?), transformers, Share Bears, and a villain who comes back every week with a new idea to take over the world. The game currently consists of four episodes. The first is a dream episode, Saturday Morning RPG 02where Marty gets ist power and rescues the girl of his dreams. Sadly it's only a dream and this girl is still together with the greatest jerk in school, bet, hey, at least he can keep his new powers and in the next episode he can use them against this giant death laser his arch-villain commander hood has hidden under his school and ruins the bake sale with it. With the third episode you see a little change in style, because this time you have nothing better to do than fighting giant evil transformers. And saving the city dam on that way. In episode four the devs proudly presents you the christmas special episode, where you need to save christmas and bring back all the stolen presents. (guess who did that) In the end of the episode you even see a nice surprise.\n\nFuture\n\nCurrently only four of once 20 planned episodes are in the game. The problem was that this game was first made for iOS and didn't really well there. But since it's on steam now the sales are much better and the good guy devs promised to bring out new episodes FOR FREE. Episode 5 and 6 are even in production right now. And that'S good, because there are some loose ends from a few side quests i really want to know how that's going to end.\n\nConclusion\n\nPro:\n- Classical old school RPG\n- many 80s references\n- Entertaining story\nCon:\n- low content at the moment\nYou have a nice looking game on your hand here. If you take your time to do all side quest you can get around 5 to 10 hours of fun out of it, depending if replaying some episodes, which some side quests and the achievements encourage. The battle system works flawlessly, the story is good and there a lot stuff to collect to keep you occupied. But see for yourself, theres nothing that can go wrong with it. And if still have concerns wait for a steam sale. A 75% Off will definitely convince you to buy it.\n\n\nFor more Reviews visit my Blog at: http://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/","July 31, 2014","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Saturday Morning RPG has a sort of Paper Mario or The Stick of Truth feel because the combat system is turn based with a lot of interaction and quicktime events. The game's response is very good, so the fights always feel like you're doing what you intend to.\n\nThe visuals are nostalgically pixelated, so if you like that kind of graphic you'll enjoy the look of this game. The music is incredible, that's probably my favourite part of this game. Every song and theme is composed very well in addition to the audio quality being fantastic.\n\nThe story has a very "Saturday morning TV show" feel to it, which makes sense considering the title of this game. I enjoyed it for the most part, especially all the references to other videos games, movies, and TV shows, but some of the dialogue gets a bit full of itself sometimes. Some NPCs will tell you their stories if you give them a chance, but that just adds a wholeness to the game in some regards.\n\nIf the developers make any DLC for this game, like new episodes, I would definitely play them. I had a lot of fun with this game.","November 11, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is pretty fun, and there seems to be a lot of modes that I haven't gotten involved in. However, it starts off for me as a full screen, super zoomed in, flashy game. Its better in a window about a 1/4 of my monitor space. It feels like it was designed to be played on a phone instead of at 1080p. However, if you don't like QTE in your RPGs, be warned that there is a lot of button mashing, button matching, and button blocking required.

If you already know this kind of game is your thing, get it. It takes the funnest element from, Super Mario RPG, and flies it around like you wouldn't believe. The turn-based combat system allows for adding extra punch to your attack, and extra toughness to your defense by using anything from a simple push of the button at the right moment, to playing Pong from Atari to bounce a ball at opponents for a few hits. They really went crazy with it. I like an RPG that can force me into a bit of cardio for that bit of extra power. The story is simple, and still entertaining. I like all of the, 'I see what you did there,' moments as well. Anyway, the bottom line is t hat this game is a refreshing satire on all of the 80's era cartoons and games, with a little bit of 90's thrown in to boot, and it's well done. The graphics of course aren't anything special, but quite frankly my dears, I don't give a damn. It all just fits together well.","July 5, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay has a classic JRPG feel, but still does its own thing. It's turn based, with timed attacks (and defenses). There's enough complexity to make strategy more than just selecting the same attack every time. You can select several stickers, that give combat buffs (or to your enemies, debuffs), as well as your special attacks in the form of items. These are balanced in terms of speed, power, accuracy, as well as price. One item might do massive damage, but be costly, or take a long time to be used once selected, or maybe not always hit. A big part of the strategy is selecting the best prefight equipment.\n\nThe episodes are decent length, about an hour or so, depending on how much you like to explore and do side quests. What I really appreciated was the lack of artificial extension. The game doesn't have you backtrack, or wander around to find where you need to go. Objectives are clear, and you can always tell where you need to go by arrows on screen. It keeps the game moving quickly if you want to rush, but you're also free to explore, talk to characters, and just enjoy the environments.\n\nWhile it's fun enough as an RPG, the overall atmosphere is the main draw. It lives and breathes nostalgia for the 80s (and early 90s), and anyone who spent their childhood watching Transformers, or playing with GIJoe will have an extra appreciation for it. Though, even if you weren't a kid in the US during the 80s/early 90s, you can still appreciate it.\n\nThe nostalgia isn't forced, or bled dry. It's just there, so the game feels like it's of the era, rather than just looking back at it. It's challenging, but not frustrating, and the humor is subtle. In short, the game has charm.\n\nMy only complaint would be the lack of length. It doesn't have 100+ hours of gameplay... probably more like 10-20 until you get bored (I clocked in about 16 hours, when counting replaying the episodes, and trying out the arenas). Still, those will be pretty fun 10-20 hours.","July 6, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Admittedly I am the exact target audience for this game - I grew up in the 80s and still remember sneaking downstairs waaaaaayyyy too early on Saturday mornings to watch Voltron, Dungeons & Dragons, Josie & the ♥♥♥♥♥cats, etc. and nearly dying of  excitement the year we finally got an original Nintendo. Everything from the music, to the quests, to the NPC dialog perfectly captures both my real and imaginary life from that time period - I love it.\nSpeaking somewhat less subjectively. The episodes are short - for me that's a bonus. Each one took me 45-80 minutes for the first run through, and that was fully exploring. But that is perfect if you don't have a lot of time and want to feel like you're accomplishing something in a gaming session. Also, there is some replay value, as you get to keep all your new shinies when you replay a level, so you can experience the satisfaction of instantly obliterating a baddie that gave you trouble the first time around. But I can see how a short game would be unsatisfying to some players. But don't say it's not worth the $$. It's like, $1.50 now, and even if you pay the full $6.99 that is around $1 per hour of fun at most. If you're willing to pay even $5 for a matinee movie, you can't complain this game isn't worth it.\nAlso the battles, turn based, can be a little repetative - especially in the beginning. But once I had a few more weapons/defensive options/buffs I had a lot of fun playing around with various combinations.\nNo the graphics aren't up to Witcher 3 standard. Or 2. or 1.  Or...   80s remember?\nThat said, if you've ever seen the Transformers cartoons and thought only "Ugg, this is unbearable" or can't stand music from before 1998 then maybe this game isn't for you. But anyone who had to sit through a D.A.R.E program, or rushed home aftrer school, hoping not to miss the Transformers OP please, please "risk" $1.50 (or whatever!) on this game. The psychological benefits of just the first 15 minutes alone are probably greater than your last 5 therapy session.*\n\n*I'm not mocking therapy or people who need it! I'm in therapy!

The game is so full of quotes and referencies you are bound to get -at least up to a certain extent- and to feel a bit old and nostalgic with some self-awarness of the time passing by. It's a melting pot of crossed pop referencies that blend up into a school canteen soup: lines and expressions are accurate enough to get you into the mood just by themselves (I'm not a native english speaker but somehow they bring me back to the ones I once was used to), the tools you'll use are a trip in a yardsale, the end battle screenshot are shiny as they should, the music is nothing short than a Journey, the "cinematics", the main and the side plots are a collection of action films memories. It's not a gem of crazy humor in itself but mostly in the eyes of the player who picture himself and his childhood through the eyeglass of an older person.\nMoreover you can enjoy a pre-battle and in-battle tactical system that it's easy enough to get but gives you a decent rate of improvent and learning. Basically, you have to combine power-ups and buffers and the tools you use in battle, so the options are vary and not repetitive and suit the rpg concept of the game. To add more flavour (said by a very clumsy guy) the developers put into a certain number of minigames, mostly to trigger weapon and tools side effects and to charge up your attacks (I'm not using a mouse and I'm regretting it). Last but not least it's cheap. This is not a lifetime game experience but it actually gets, in a rather honest way, it's primal goal: to help you sail through a lazy saturday morning when you are in vein of a time back flip.","April 27, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is clear from playing the game that it is in a league of it's own. The graphics work well for the type of game that it is - a homage to the 1980's and early 90's culture. I bought this game and didn't know what to expect. What I found was a well-made, thoughtful but fun and light game that may become my game of the year. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. It was very rewarding to play this game - it was FUN. It was a feel-good experience and I just hope there is more of this game. DLC? Count me in DAY ONE!\n\nEDIT: UPDATE - August 23, 2015 - I've started playing the game again to get achievements and complete levels. Doing that really takes the gameplay to a new level and increases the challenge. Playing the game fully takes a game that was a "quick playthrough" and turns it into a full gaming experience.\n\nReturning to the game after playing it once gives new perspective. The game is STILL fun, enjoyable and well made. I would still highly recommend it to others.\n\nEDIT: UPDATE - August 25, 2015 - This game has been due for an update for the past two years. EPISODE 5 was due two years ago, but has been pushed to "summer 2015" as per the games Steam page selling the games soundtrack. It's 2015 and there is no update yet. This is important because this game has achievements and one of them is "complete 5 episodes" - and you can't do this with the current 4 episodes that are released.\n\nAs much as I love this game, other players need to know that there is an UPDATE DELAY that impacts the ability to play the game and makes 100% completion impossible.  I have posted twice on the facebook group of Saturday Morning RPG but there is no word from the developer. I will update this as needes.","July 9, 2014","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well this game leans towards the former with a very funny plot running through the game which will keep you entertained throughout the game. However, it does encompass a lot of depth in it's combat system with a meter that can be charged manually to increse your attacks power and different attacks that are able to be bought or picked up, making not only the story gripping but the gameplay too. The graphics are not stunning but the pixel art on a fully rendered background makes it easy to figure out what's what and the colour scheme is usually pleasing to the eye, not being too flashy or too bland.

The music is incredible, that's probably my favourite part of this game. Every song and theme is composed very well in addition to the audio quality being fantastic.\n\nThe story has a very "Saturday morning TV show" feel to it, which makes sense considering the title of this game. I enjoyed it for the most part, especially all the references to other videos games, movies, and TV shows, but some of the dialogue gets a bit full of itself sometimes. Some NPCs will tell you their stories if you give them a chance, but that just adds a wholeness to the game in some regards.\n\nIf the developers make any DLC for this game, like new episodes, I would definitely play them.
