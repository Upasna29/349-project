The developer's hard work has finally paid off and the game will finally get the recognition it deserves.\n\nTennis Elbow 2013 offers gameplay unlike any other tennis game; it's an amazing simulation that is realistic, fluid, challenging, and most importantly, fun. It will take a bit getting used to at first as the game is not forgiving when it comes to placement and timing of shots. However, once you get the hang of it, hitting clean winners becomes so overwhelmingly satisfying.\n\nThe game comes with a LOT of character customization similar to RPGs by allowing you to choose your character's playstyle and increase your stats/effectiveness in various aspects such as: forehand, backhand, serving, volley, etc.\n\nMods are also an option which greatly enhances the quality of the game. The addition of newer and cleaner 2D/3D courts as well as player models, swing animations, sound effects, clothing, and rackets allow you to customize the game the way you want it to look and play.\n\nThe most common complaint that I would expect to hear from people viewing the trailers are the quality of the graphics. Though it may not be up to par to the other tennis games out there, the game play is what compensates for it. As mentioned before, you can install mods that makes the game more visually appealing. If you can look past this flaw, I can reassure that you will love the actual game play.\n\nTennis Elbow 2013 is a MUST for tennis fans.\n\n10/10","March 13, 2015","true","19.9"," 73 of 90 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","73","90","4","1"

It supports warmup, practice, campaign, and multiplayer modes, via double or single matches.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Tennis Elbow 2013 is fast and fluid, but the controls may leave you scratching your head at first. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to not hit the ball straight to the center of the court before figuring out there's a default shot that is performed even if you don't take one. So not only did the default kb+m controls not seem to allow me to take actual shots, but when using a controller, I was under the impression the shoulder buttons would, but they did not. Then I tried using the face buttons, and everything changed.\n\nSo in TE13, in order to get the ball where you want it, you have to move to get to it, move correctly to take the correct type of shot, and also move to aim the shot once you start to take it. If that sounds like a lot to deal with in a split second, then you are correct, but it is so much fun getting it right and the amount of precision with which you can crush your enemies with once you lock it down.\n\nAs stated earlier, there are a variety of gamemodes. The AI is quite competent, featuring various levels of difficulty as you ascend the ranks. If it does particularly well or poorly against you, you can opt for higher or lower difficulties. The scoring is...well, like tennis, and the hitboxes for the racket are good. There is an RPG factor here with the extensive character customization present, where you can even select your character's preferred playstyle.\n\nI should also briefly mention that the animations are actually pretty nice, and there are quite a few. I don't care for the backpedaling animation, though. At any rate, it is a game that isn't especially fun to learn, is fun to play, and is very fun to learn to do well and play well with.\n\nGraphics\nSo you're not going to see the shadows and leaves falling off of trees. There will be no sunshafts or lens flares. You won't see much lighting at all, actually. You won't see everything fluttering slightly in the breeze. The character models even, are pretty poor. The physical build isn't too awfully bad, but the lack of lighting and shading and quality textures especially stands out on them, and the UI...the UI is straight out of the 80s.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad exactly (excluding the UI,) everything is functional and represents what it is supposed to. They just aren't good. In any way. They would be bad if you consider anything not having good or amazing graphics bad, but in the end, this is a game about playing tennis. Even more, it's a simulation focused on tennis. You don't need flashy effects when you hit the ball, or cinematic angles distracting you. You just need to see yourself, your opponent, and the ball going between you two.\n\nAudio\nThe audio quality in Tennis Elbow 2013 is a bit low. There won't be any unrealistic uproar of a crowd 10 times bigger than any crowd ever present, nor any exaggerated effects involving fire and lazers when you hurl your ball 10 meters into the ground creating a crater amidst an explosion. What you get is simple sounds that are there when they are supposed to be. They are realistic in that sense. Hit a ball with a racket, you hear a ball being hit with a racket. On the other hand, the recording quality and the sounds themselves could be much better, but again I must stress that this is a sports sim and not a walking simulator meant to immerse you in deep story and compelling visuals and audio.\n\nConclusion\nSo, it gets one component majorly right, and two others, sometimes very important ones, very wrong. "What gives?" you might say, "since when is getting just one thing right good enough?" Well, I will tell you. It's enough when it is this damn fun to experience, however, I should also point out that the game is very capable of being modded, and many people have created packs featuring better/different sounds, player models, animations, courts, etc.\n\nWhat you will get if you purchase this game is a very real feeling of playing actual tennis. In that regard, the game is nearly perfect. So in conclusion:\n\nI recommend Tennis Elbow 2013 for any enthusiast, at full price.\n\nIf you just "like tennis" like me, I still think it is worth full price, but you might consider a sale.\n\nIf you're just interested in getting a competitive or realistic experience, or grabbing any sim that exists, but don't especially love or even like tennis, I would recommend it still, but on sale.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 12, 2015","true","4.2"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","48","62","0","7"

There is a high level of complexity and it is not a simple three or four button game. There are button combinations which makes you do specific shots and player positioning actually matters in this game, which is something you wouldn't see too much in a game like 'Virtua Tennis 4' where you just hold a single button and you playing automatically positions him/herself perfectly to the ball.\n\nThankfully, the files are easily moddable which means that it is possible to bring in tennis superstars if you wish and change other things like tournament settings.\n\nI would only recommend this game if you are a big tennis fan and want a complex tennis simulator where you want to be able to have full control of your shots and player, and to also be challenged.","July 15, 2015","true","114.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reemasqooraf/recommended/346470/","reemasqooraf","reemasqooraf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reemasqooraf/","12 products in account","First off, yes, the graphics aren't very good. Sometimes the players move a bit awkwardly and the overall look of the game (UI in particular) is quite dated. Seeing this initially turned me off from the game, but it seemed like people really enjoyed its accurate gameplay. I had previously played Virtua Tennis 3 on the PS3 and later purchased and enjoyed Top Spin 4 because it was less arcade-y. But Tennis Elbow 13 blows both out of the water in terms of precise gameplay that really simulates tennis.\n\nThere are a number of things about it that I really like, but the most notable is the realism when it comes to unforced errors. In most other tennis games, it's either impossible to make an unforced error (other than double faulting) or it's ridiculously difficult and will only happen after your player is extremely tired. This means that you can paint the lines on basically every shot without any risk involved. In this game, you have to precisely aim your shot and if you aim too close to the line, you may miss. If you're in an awkward position when you do it, there's a much bigger circle of uncertainty around your aimed shot, so you can easily miss if you go for too much.\n\nSome people might have issues with the lack of licensed players, but I personally find the obvious knock-offs absolutely hilarious. Riccardo Fidirir, Nenad Djakavec, and Ruben Nodol will never fail to make me laugh. (Plus, I think there may be mods that you can download to make these accurate)\n\nThere's also a ton of granularity when it comes to skill customization and opponent level (4 levels, 10 sublevels per level). Overall, I would really recommend this game to people who want a true tennis sim. The graphics don't really bother you after a bit because the gameplay is so good and immersive (the satisfaction of struggling to beat an opponent, but then succeeding 4-6 7-6(4) 7-6(5) is fantastic). However, if you want a more arcade-y game with great graphics, Virtua Tennis is probably the way to go.\n\n\n\nFor anyone who is planning on getting this game, I really recommend using a gamepad. I personally use a PS3 controller connected to my Macbook via Bluetooth and have mapped the D-pad for movement, the X button for topspin, the square button for slice, the circle button for an accelerated shot, and the triangle button for a defensive lob. I find that it works very well. (Normally, I prefer to use the analog stick for movement, but you also use the movement input for shot aiming, which requires a lot of precision. Thus, I use the D-pad, which I got used to pretty quickly)","December 23, 2015","true","9.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Yet it absolutely nails it as far as gameplay is concerned. I've been playing tennis games since the C64 and can confidently say that Tennis Elbow 2013 is the best one I've ever played. Games are realistic. Players frequently hit the ball out, double fault, hit the net and miss easy shots. It just feels right. It's not perfect but it is a huge step forward from the arcade style tennis games that've appeared in the last few years.\n\nI struggled for the first 2 or 3 hours and lost every match. At first I could hardly even win a point, never mind a game or set. Stick with it for a few hours and the controls will start to feel comfortable. Download the demo from the dev's web site, stick with it for a few hours and that should tell you if you want to buy the game.\n\nWhat else...I'd recommend that you download one of the mods if you want to offline play a fairly realistic pro career. They contain real tournaments, players and venues. You can start off as a 17 year old and progress through the ranks as the years pass. Right now I'm ranked number 992 of the world and have just won my second qualifying match in a tournament. If I win the next match then I'll actually get to play in an actual first round of a tournament. So yeah, starting off at the bottom isn't glamorous but it is immersive and satisfying.\n\nRecommended!\n\nedit: I've put a lot more hours into the game now and am really happy with it. Once you install one of the mods the visuals get a decent boost and the offline career mode is fantastic fun. A top class tennis game, even if it doesn't look like it at first glance.","June 6, 2015","true","28.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

If you played Virtua Tennis 4, and expect something simliar I must disappoint you  -  the difference is graphics is huge.\n\nHowever, in terms of pure gameplay, I think that Tennis Elbow can defend itself. Matches are quite realistic, and you can choose from a quite wide arsenal of shots. The game offers a variety of options, altering the match diffculty from easy ones (with shot indicators), to more realistic ones. You can participate in tour, creating your player (or choosing one of existing ones), slowly building up your position in rankings, and improving your skills.

Well, Tennis Elbow 2013 does just that with flying colors!  From the player and court graphics, the controls (with a controller it's obviously easier), tournaments, tennis skills, stat tracking and evolving your player all are accomplished and well done in my opinion and I'm sure you'll agree if you like tennis.  As far as the game play goes, it's not in the slightest convoluted to control your character and it's easy to learn, yet takes a long while to master it.  That goes a long way in replayability as does the online play and tournaments.  The play is smooth and never laggy and it's seriously the BEST tennis simulator I've ever played and I have been playing tennis games since the NES days!  It has everything a tennis game player would want and more!  It's well worth the price of the game and it's a damn great game they put together for us to enjoy!\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10","September 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Some might find that odd, considering the UI and game visuals seem a bit dated. I didn't say it was the prettiest. It isn't, but it's also not terrible, either. The core gameplay is what makes this the best tennis game I have played.\n\nThe controls are excellent. They take a little getting used to and become second nature after a bit of practice. The available strikes in the game can be mapped to your preference. They are as follows:\n\no Normal Strike\no Short Strike\no Top Spin\no Slice\no Drop Shot\no Defensive Lob\no Acceleration\no Short Acceleration\no Aggressive Lob\no Safe Strike\n\nThe game also supports modding and has a strong community that have been modding the various iterations of the game over the years. Several mods add all the real players, statistics, animations, sounds, courts, etc. They also update the UI visuals, which is a nice touch. At this time, there are two major mod packages which seem to have most of the 'best of the best' mods from the community in a nice tidy package:\n\no Sam's Patch - solo World Tour play with all the real pro players (visuals, stats, animations, courts, scoreboards, etc).\no ITST - online play with all the real pro players (visuals, stats, animations, courts, scoreboards, etc).\n\nThis is strictly tennis. You won't be knocking down bowling pins in mini games for example (not that there's anything wrong with that). You will either be playing quick matches, trying your hand at an extensive career mode, or playing against others online.\n\nIf you really like tennis, this game is a no-brainer. If you are very casual, I would suggest that you download the 14-day demo that is provided on the developer's website. It even lets you play online. This should be more than enough time to see if it suits you.\n\n","March 30, 2015","true","57.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Don't let my Steam playtime fool you. I've owned and enjoyed this game since way back in 2011 (from the previous incarnations - and free udates to 2013) and must have hundreds of hours logged playing this. No idea but it would be a lot of hours.\n\nSo what it doesn't look like Virtua Tennis. It's the gameplay that counts. Years ago I'd given up trying to find a decent tennis game that accurately portrayed rallies and wasn't a simple move and hit the ball console kiddie playing toy. Then I googled about and found this. Not only was the actual gameplay superb but in addition there is a role-playing element where you can improve over time the stats of your player in career mode.\n\nTo some of the new players that think they have wasted their money with this game: well yes graphically it's not amazing and the gameplay may be hard at first, but perservere and you will be richly rewarded with an amazing Tennis game that will keep you going for years. This is one of the few games I've ever played that I consistently come back to. It's been a permanent fixture in my gaming since I started with it 4 years ago. There is no other game that I can say the same thing about.\n\nTo the few people that have given this a thumbs down after only playing 2 hours or less they need to take a good internal look at what they are looking for in a game. Have they been brought up on photorealistic graphics over gameplay? That is sad for them, because if they don't perservere a little with this game they are not only cheating themselves out of the money they paid for it but also the incredible game this will open up into if they just show a bit of patience. Once you improve at the game, your character improves, you won't give a hoot about the graphics. No 3d photo realistic graphics could possibly play this type of ball realism. it would have to be done 2d like this for it to work in my opinion.\n\nAlso, if you don't like the fact that the tournaments are not licenced etc - there are 2 very good large mods out there that alter this game considerably. Go look for them. They're easy to find and install.\n\nI recommend this game 10/10. But on the other hand, if you would rather play some childish console button bashing no skill involved garbage with pretty graphics like the big studios produce - stay  away from this. This game doesn't want you anyhow.","March 28, 2015","true","36.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have been playing tennis games since the early 90s and have been suffering from the lack of good games of that specific genre. Sadly, this game has not helped.\n\n- I do not care much about graphics but they are just ugly. Animations make me feel like it's 1994 again\n- I have never played a game with such annoying audio. The sounds are of low quality, do not fit and break the game\n- ugly UI & akward controls\n\nIf this would be open source, it would be an ok game. Demanding 20 Euro for this utter piece of software is just outrageous. I really tried to like it, but this game is just no fun","March 13, 2015","false","0.1"," 53 of 187 people (28%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","28","53","187","19","12"

I love tennis, and I'll play the 1999 version of Virtua tennis on my Dreamcast before I will even consider this piece of garbage again..\n\nThere isn't really anything good to say about this game, so let's start with the bad.\n\nThe graphincs are comparable to an emulated Nintendo 64. That woudln't be a bad thing if the game was made 20 years ago. The music, the color, the everything is like the game came straight out of 1992. The mechanics of the game are gay as hell, you'd simply have to play it to see why. This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on steam and it is so bad, I'm considering revoking the purchase through my credit card and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing my Steam account all together.\n\n\nOK, so I was a bit drunk when I wrote this review so I went back to try the game out today. My initial review was unfair. Today, I'm going to give this game a 2 out of 10 simply for the fact that it does not require Uplay.","March 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 15 of 122 people (12%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","12","15","122","12","5"
