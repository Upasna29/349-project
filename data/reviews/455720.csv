I can tell you there is nothing clever about it.\n\nAs far as I can tell there are only two mini-games at the start, and a 'training' zone. One game where you throw balls at boxes.... That's it. And second game where balls of four colors fall from a portal a few feet above you, and you use your hands to push them slightly as they fall down, towards the four corners of the arena of the same color.\n\nThe throwing game is fun for about 10 seconds - then I realized that there is absolutely no depth beyond that. The second game is too chaotic to even tell what is going on, and I didn't find it to be fun at all. From the trailer, it looks like there are additional games which I assume are unlocked, but I didn't see any indication of how to do so, and based on the quality of the first two games, I'm not interested in seeing what else is in store.\n\nThis feels like test project that a developer would make in a week, to start exploring how to make actual VR games. There is no way I could recommend purchasing this - even if it was $1. The current price of $15 is insane to me.","May 18","false","0.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

E.g. one level will have you dropping balls off a cliff and use the jagged sides to bounce them towards targets that move periodically, another level will have you defending a wall from large balls (you lose points if they hit the wall) by deflecting them w/ balls into floating boxes while simultaneously having you throw balls at the floating boxes.\n\nThe basic goal is to get as many balls to the right location and rack up them points to save the dolphins to unlock more levels. It's challenging (I only hit the 2nd tier of points on 1 level so far), but always fun.\n\nGreat fun w/ an even greater soundtrack, plus a little social commentary on the side.","May 19","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The music and sound effects were on point for each level! The degree of difficulty was challenging but attainable in order to unlock new levels.  I especially liked the level Take 2, I probably played it 15 times to get a perfect score.  I really enjoyed discovering different strategies on how to get better scores on each level.  If you are competetive like me, this game will not dissapoint!","May 21","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Just watch some gameplay to see if you fit in that market.\n\nIf I had spent 2 bucks on this, I would've totally been okay with it.\n\nHonestly, save your money till you can get this on a steam sale.\n\nOn a closing note: This game feels like a s****y version of Peggle...","May 19","false","1.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"
