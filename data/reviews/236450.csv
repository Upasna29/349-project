All the game modes are time based so you could have a 5 or 10min run at a score, or have a specific challenge like how many ghosts you can eat in one go or how quickly you can collect a certain number of fruits. There is a ton of maps and PAC-MAN themes you can unlock too, although I wish the classic theme was unlocked by default.\n\nIt feels like an authentic PAC-MAN game; it has all the sound effects you would expect, good soundtrack and responsive controls. You need those responsive controls as it gets really fast when you survive longer! To make it more forgiving, you do have bombs and a slow motion "bullet time" effect giving you an extra split-second to make the right move. Even with these tools at your disposal there still an excellent challenge for your reflexes; Online leaderboards as well to challenge your friends :)\n\nOne thing that could definitely have been left out is the Facebook medals to earn in-game; this should not be part of the games' achievements! At most it should be an option for those who want to use FB, not required to get all the in-game achievements nor plaster the icons with a 'Share' tag till you do share it!\n\nFacebook farce aside, the game itself is a great trip down memory lane introducing a modern twist to the PAC-MAN legacy.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","April 5, 2014","true","3.9"," 166 of 174 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","166","174","0","0"

No words can describe how much I enjoyed it. If it's on sale, it's a steal and you should be arrested for buying masterpeices at such low prices.\n\nBefore I begin to explain myself why I highly encourage you to buy the game, I would love to say that I am a huge Pac-man fan. I grew up playing Pac-man acardes since I lived in a small neighbhorhood with an acarde not to far from my house. Walking to school, I would spend 25 cents to play Pac-man. So, to play a modern Pac man game that does everything exactly right and BETTER just brightens my heart.\n\nThis game simply does everything right, and if you love pac-man as much as I do, you will quickly agree that this is your favorite purchase.\n\nTo begin with, the music is fantastic. Reentrance( DLC song) is probably my Video Game music of my Year almost beating DuckTales's legendary "The Moon". It's very techno-ish. I am not usually a fan of this type of music, BUT surprising, I instantly fell in love with it. It does its job right of making you feel very intense as your heart beat raises as the game rapidly gets FASTER. It's freaken intense and the music overall just enchances the experience. MUSIC DONE RIGHT.\n\nThe game offers the original calm relaxing game we all know love in stunning beatiful visuals. There are servals skins and colors to pick from! From 2D outlines to fully 3D. There even Dig Dug! Just look at the screenshots! They're the perfect colors and visuals for this game. There is simply no complains about the graphics. HOWEVER, there is no resolution settings, and I believe it runs at 720p.\n\nIn addition, Championship Edition DX+ is able to convert a unviserally claimed game, which is played for calming and relax, into this instantly fast, suspenseful, intense game that is can be VERY addicting. This is where the game shinies the most. Besides the usual collecting orbs and trying to get high scores, now they included a rate of speed, bombs, and slow down feature. Being honest I hated them. I felt that it made the game too easy. BUT, as soon as the game blasted to 40 speed of rate, the game completely changed as I grateful for the new features. Now, when you're close to a ghost, the game slows down, so the player is allow to make better decisions on where to move next. In addition, if you're about to die due to being trap, you can use the bomb feature to destroy all the ghost. I try as much as possible to avoid the bomb, but I still enjoy using it as it can be a lifesaver to achiveing a higher score. Overall, if you love fast gameplay, you will love this game. At 50, the game went soo fast that my eyes couldn't catch up. However, I eventually got used to it.\n\nMy favorite feature is the Free mode where the player is allowed to set a time limit. It's basically like a time attack and your goal is to see how many points can you can obtain. I am a college student who has been dying to find a game where I can pick up for 10mins and return to homework. I've even played it on campus as many commented saying its "pac-man on acid" or "What is this sonic?".\n\nOverall, there are a TON of gamemodes. I could explain them all, but its just something a player has to try on their own.\n\nTo conclude, I'm glad to see a new Pac-man game isn't just clone of the original with HD fancy graphics. To those who would rather play it on a TV Pac-man console or on a flashgame, I'd like to mention that the game introduces so many new features and visuals elements that it entirelly changes everything, and you'll get a FAR better experience than playing it on a flashgame on TV console.\n\nI can see a TON of effort put into the game, and it simply stands out. This is by far the best Pac-Man game you can buy on a console or PC.","June 29, 2014","true","10.5"," 110 of 121 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","110","121","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/recommended/236450/","CinemaFromage","CinemaFromage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CinemaFromage/","614 products in account","Pac-Man Championship DX+ is a hell of package.  It’s super stylish.  There’s a bunch of different art styles for the different maps.   Some are glossy and 3D, some are pixelated and retro.  All of this is layered on top of a great soundtrack of electronic dance type music that really helps you to zero in and focus.  It’s a bit trance-like to be honest! (Oh hey, that’s probably trance music, isn’t it)\n\nThen, you get to the game play modes.  This is where the true hook lies.  Much like it’s grand father from the 80’s, the game play is simple.  each map has a series of challenges, score attacks, time attacks and ghost combo’s.  Some last five minutes, some last ten, while some are just a matter of ‘collect X many apples’ to complete.  All of the modes are straight forward on what the want you to accomplish and soon, you’ll find yourself revisiting the maps over and over just to out-do your previous score.\n\nDX+ does have a scoreboard where you compare yourself to your friends scores on steam.  This is another carrot to keep you going back to improve. The only real beef I have with this one is that the scoreboard functions are pretty clunky.  It’s not always clear on how best to compare your scores, but the game itself is so addicting, you’ll keep on playing regardless if you’re frustrated without competing.\n\nMan, I love this game.","July 9, 2014","true","6.3"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","2"

Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ takes Pac back to his roots with single screen arcade levels. The controls are simple, up, left, down and right to make Pac-Man move through different labyrinths, eating pellets and dodging ghosts. When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, the hunters become the hunted and Pac-Man will eat the ghosts to death! Think about that logic!\n\nBut that's how the classic game played, and while there isn't much difference between then and now, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ has different 'challenges' that you select and play. Mostly time trials that have you eating enough fruit to complete the objective after eating enough pellets to make the fruit appear. You'll also have score attacks that put you in a level for 5 or 10 minutes to get the highest score you can. There is even a ghost chain mode that will have you seeing how many ghosts you can eat before a power pellet wears off. Each challenge needs to be unlocked and for the most part they're all easy, but a lot of quick fun.\n\nThe game now has 'inactive' ghosts that stand in gaps. They don't move, they're just there, until Pac-Man sets them off, but they don't just chase him. Instead they wait for another ghost to float by and then join a ghost chain. These chains get longer and longer as a sort of centipede. Its visually impressive and adds a new dynamic of just having a long string of enemies to avoid. When you get a power pellet, it feels satisfying to eat fifty ghosts. These ghosts can also have pellets and power pellets in them, so to advance through the game, you need to eat the ghosts. It is a nice twist.\n\nThat's not the only twist, you don't clear an entire level like the original Pac-Man. The game makes lines of pellets after you eat each fruit. It might seem easy to just follow the lines, but the challenge comes from Pac-Man moving so fast and ghosts being everywhere. The maps will even get altered to block out paths or make new paths. With every complete line you eat, a piece of fruit will appear along with the next line and more 'inactive' ghosts. So it feels like there is always something changing and happening. Even the level changes colors.\n\nEach of the game's 10 or so unlockable levels are a vibrant array of neon colors, but before you start each challenge, you can change each level's look. From old school pixelated Pac-Man to new school and even the lego block look from previous games. You can change the sprites too. Its a nice dynamic that can keep the game looking fresh. There is also plenty of DLC to buy that changes sprites and level graphics. The background music sounds great and the fast paced beat matches the arcade action.\n\nThere is even a new gameplay mechanic of ghost clearing bombs. When you use a bomb it sends all active ghosts to their penalty box in the middle of the screen. These bombs are helpful when you get pinched by two ghosts, but to to some people bombs might feel like cheating even if they decrease your scoring rate temporarily.\n\nThe game is fast paced. Eating ghosts will make the game go faster. Higher difficulties will make the game start out faster. It creates a need for fast paced reflexes, while still being forgiving, because if you are headed for a ghost, the game will slow down to give you time enough to dodge it. It is very helpful and feels forgiving.\n\nIf its too easy for you, there are three difficulties, each give you fewer and fewer bombs and lives along with amping up the game speed. If you lose a life, it simply sends the active ghosts to their penalty box, but you get to continue on after a brief delay.\n\nThis is what Pac-Man should have been all along. Just upgrading and tweaking the original classic. Well worth $10 for any arcade lover, but get it at a discount, especially since the game has so much DLC to purchase.","September 23, 2014","true","3.7"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","1"

The developers at Namco, instead of asking themselves how to make Pac-Man look and sound better, poured their energy into figuring out how to make the game more fun. This isn't just a modernized or tweaked version of the old arcade game - it is a completely new game. It tosses aside the old notion that a game's objective needs to be about survival and focuses entirely on competitive scoring. Reviewers who complained about the near-colision slowdown and bombs must not have really thought it through, because those elements provide a complexity to the playing stretegy that is absolutely essential.

FUN BUT VERY DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY THAN THE GOOD OLD PAC-MAN\n\nThe game is rather fun and there is a good incentive to replay for  high-scores especially if some of your friends have it too as the leaderboards are well done. On sale it's a decent offer.\n\nHowever overall I find the gameplay much more bland than the good old vintage Mrs PacMan. PacMan set an early milestone in computer AI, with very simple rules, and small variations for each ghost gave them each a distinct personality. It required patience and skills to regroup the 4 ghosts before eating the energy pills and ate the 4 ghosts for max score. Moreover the levels design required some thought and planning to finish them without being killed.\n\nIn contrast in this Championship DX+ edition, all ghosts have the same algorithmn, moreover they are quite dumb and don't actually chase you, they merely follow you mindlessly, in effectyour goal is too move close to sleeping ghosts, and they will automatically add them to the ghost train that follow you. Until you get a energy pill for mass slaughter combos. Early on this is rather fun, but in the end it is rather repetitive, it relies heavily on memorizing patterns, and executing them quicker as the game speed increase, and it definitely lack the strategic elements of Mrs Pac-Man.\n\nFinally the game have a "bullet time" kind of slow-down when ghosts come close to you and you also have bombs to send back all ghosts at once to the prison, which make the game very easy, and you actually don't get kill very often\n\nThe game speed varies from 1 to 50, however when above 40, I had some issue with my controller, as Pac-Man move too fast to allow you to execute complex sequences of turns, resulting in many wrong turns.\n\nSome achievements require a Facebook account, this really s**k.\n\nWith all the extra bells and whistles in this edition, Its a shame that they didn't include the original simple gameplay, as it wouldn't have required a lot of additional programming.\n\nIn the end I disagree that this is the "best" Pac-Man edition, it feels too much a different game.","July 14, 2014","false","9.1"," 54 of 89 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","54","89","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/recommended/236450/","dracosummoner","dracosummoner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracosummoner/","180 products in account",""I've ~played~ Pac-Man," I thought upon a friend's recommendation, "and I've seen what it has to offer."  That was then.\n\n'Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+' (it's a good thing you play as a giant mouth) is one of the strongest and most ridiculously well crafted revivals of a classic I've ever seen, never mind that the older versions really aren't my cup of tea.  Even though the series predates much of the gaming industry, this entry feels like it belongs in the modern era, and the improvements it makes to the time-honored formula are an absolute delight.\n\nThe rules are the same as they were--navigate a maze, eat dots and fruit for points, avoid the ghosts chasing you, and snag giant pills so you can turn your enemies into an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Then come the more interesting decisions--the mazes don't completely fill up with dots, and the lines the game feeds you like an ever-tantalizing carrot often take on the shape of patterns designed to lead you a certain way.  Remember how the original game had only a few ghosts?  Here, part of the point is to run by ghosts sleeping in nooks and crannies, which gets more and more of them chasing you until your legion pursuers stretch themselves in a string so long that there becomes a real danger of you being trapped in an area where the string's head chases you while the tail won't let you escape.  Think of the old game Snake, except you're the prey.\n\nPac-Man has a new trick up his proverbial sleeve as well--he has a limited supply of bombs that essentially send the ghosts back to their starting point, leaving him unscathed.  If you're a purist and you don't want to use these, that's perfectly understandable, and the game will make special note of your bravery (especially if you still don't die).  This ties into the game's commendable approach to difficulty: while "beginner" and harder difficulties exist, much of their distinction lies in the speed of the game, which goes up or down depending on the player's performance.  If a bomb is used or if Pac-Man dies, the game smartly assumes the player is having trouble and scales its speed slightly down.  This way, newcomers and inexperienced players can enjoy this title without it being as inaccessible as the Garden of Eden, while experts and thrill-seekers can satisfy their little hearts with challenges that really are their own reward.  Likewise, the power pills that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts (don't type "power pill" into a search engine, which I learned the hard way) now have a visible time meter at the top of the screen, so you don't have to guess how long they'll last.  This leads to incredibly polished sections where the game will basically hand you a free pill and lead you down a prescribed path such that the power pill wears off a fraction of a second before you careen into an otherwise hapless ghost who receives the grace of God at the last possible moment, forcing you as the player to either change direction quickly, use a bomb, or die.\n\nMaybe I have Pac-Man Fever™ from saying "just one more level" five too many times when it's 1:30 in the morning and I really should be getting some sleep, but even though this game never tries to shoehorn in a needless story or out-of-place powerups, it still shows itself to be provocative in its own way, whether Pac-Man is frantically leading the increasingly irritable rainbow hordes on the way to the Promised Pill (Numbers 14:1-25) or finally reaching said pill, turning back around, and mowing down his powerless aggressors one by two by ten, with Sam Fisher's steely determination, a fervor that would make Call of Duty cry, and enough bonus points to keep the leaderboard lovers and achievement hounds coming back again and again.\n\nEven if the game only contained the one map, mode, and visual skin I've tried (along with the time trials), it would still be a compelling and amazing package well worthy of attention, but I find it both fascinating and disturbing that this already remarkable game has plenty of content I haven't even touched.  I have no idea whether this excellent tribute to everyone's favorite pizza-shaped scourge of the undying takes place in some weird, multicolored extraplanar labyrinth where you're really Cthulhu alternately fleeing and devouring the vengeful souls of the slain, but either way, a series I couldn't recommend has given me an installment I can't recommend enough (cf. Tomb Raider), and that is as much praise as I could imagine a game deserving.  This addictive and bounteous wonder comes across like Pac-Man with F-Zero GX's pacing, and the music does an admirable job of playing the part, especially when the epic crescendo at the end of a high-speed Score Attack round makes me feel like I've just gotten off a roller coaster.\n\nOnce you go Pac, you don't go back.","September 27, 2014","true","11.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/236450/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Do you love eating dots, dodging ghosts and completing challenges in x time whilst listening to crazy music and looking at flashy visuals? Then this game is for you! However, even though it still has it’s problems I can still recommend this to you and here is why:\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Awesome Highscores that just work (This is one of the best Highscores I’ve seen as you can easily scroll through the different levels, modes, friends, see where your score and even watch anyone in the scores replay if the mode allows it)\n♦ Decent Music (Fits the game and isn’t annoying)\n♦ Nice Visuals/Graphics (Courses, Skins etc look really well made)\n♦ Awesome amount of replayable content (Even though the game is easy to 100% all Steam Achievements, it still has a nice number of Game Modes and Courses to play through. Also even if you finish all modes on every course, you can still try and beat your own scores, your friends scores or even try to become number one in the world... Which adds a hell of a lot of game play to the game)\n♦ Easy to get 100% of Achievements (If you just focus on the achievements you can probably get 100% in 2 hours)\n♦ Right Price (Reasonable price, especially when this game goes on sale more often than any other game on Steam, so if it’s too much atm, pick it up on sale)\n♦ Keyboard Controls just work (I don’t own a controller)\n♦ Very Relaxing (This game is really easy to pick up and put down. Therefore if you need to relax, have a few spare minutes and want to play a game or even are waiting for something this game is really good to pass the time or relax as you can just start and stop whenever)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ The Course titled “Free” isn’t entirely a free play mode (It does give you 99 lives and bombs, but the mode is still timed, which in my opinion it shouldn’t be).\n♦ The Course titled “Free” doesn’t show your highscore anywhere (This is annoying if you want to beat your old Free Course scores).\n♦ No Classic Mode (This is annoying as every mode is timed, there is no way to play the courses like the classic style Pac-Man with lives, no bombs and no time. There should be at least one classic Pac-Man mode).\n♦ Comparison with friends (Should only list and show friends who own and have played the game, not everyone on my friends list)\n♦ Too much DLC (This is a personal preference but having to buy skins and music for a Steam Game ruins the whole PC gaming experience and makes it more of a mobile game for me. DLC should be playable content that adds content to increase gameplay time to the game which is why I think the level DLC is reasonable. However, having to pay for skins/music does not add content to increase gameplay time and shouldn’t be an unlockable and not a purchasable in my opinion)\n♦ Has ingame Medals which seems pointless as they should be Achievements (In-game Medals seem redundant and should just be converted to Steam Achievements)\n♦ Game doesn’t give you classic Pac-Man Skin by default and tries to make you share things on Facebook to unlock it (Apparently you can just cancel the share screen once it comes up, but still the fact that the Devs try to make you Facebook Share in a Steam Game shouldn’t be a thing)\n♦ Ghosts seem the same difficulty in Beginner, Medium and Expert (This is annoying as the only difference in difficulty is the speed. In each difficulty the ghosts should increase in hardness, however it seems as though in each difficulty all the ghosts do is follow you. Even when you are in eat ghost mode, the ghosts still follow you. This shouldn’t be case as in eat mode, the ghosts should indeed run away from you which isn’t the case making it way too easy. Also in harder difficulty modes such as Expert, the ghosts should take the quickest path to try to reach Pac-Man and kill him, not just follow him)\n\nSide-Note:\nThis is not original Pac-Man and don’t buy it expecting it to be. It’s more an easy do x in x time game to unlock the next do x in x time etc. No way does it let you play Classic Pac-Man which sucks as I think personally they could’ve easily added a Classic Pac-Man Mode.\n\nOverall, even though there are lots of cons with the game, I still recommend if you like Pac-Man in any form to pick up a copy when it’s on sale as you will get decent hours out of it if you are into highscore competitiveness and are a person who strives to be better than their friends and must be number one. Also, even though the game isn’t very challenging, it 100% works and there are no major errors. Likewise, I’d also recommend picking this up if you want another game to easily 100%.","November 11, 2015","true","5.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

Unlike the original game, each playthrough is timed in CE DX+ which makes chasing high-scores a frantic race of sorts. From watching gameplay videos it might appear to be overwhelmingly fast at times, but it's actually quite manageable and easy to get into once you learn the maze layouts and ghost movement patterns. It has this great flow to it that makes getting into a groove such a sublime and satisfying experience. The music is uptempo, catchy, and completely on the money as well. Just a perfect soundtrack for this kind of game. I had no issues with the controls either; always responsive, never felt any lag.\n\nI do have a couple gripes with Pac-Man CE DX+. It only runs at 720p which makes the image on a 1080p monitor a little blurry, but it's not nearly as bad as I would've expected. Everything moving as quickly as it does helps negate this issue for the most part. The bigger issue, though, is the overall menu/scoreboard/options interface. It feels archaic, clunky, and is more of a hassle to deal with than it has any right to be. Also, it should be mentioned how lousy the Steam demo for this game is. It's a single track that lasts for about 2 minutes and then fades out before the pace begins to pick up, making it nearly impossible to get a feel for the game prior to purchasing. It's better than nothing, but that isn't saying much.\n\nOverall, Pac-Man CE DX+ is a delight to play. The Pac-Man series has never really interested or hooked me all that much in the past, but this remake was an entirely different story. Between the extensive track and BGM selections (especially if you opt for the AYCE Edition, which I definitely recommend) and frenzied gameplay that lends itself well to 20-30 minute bursts, this is a game that I can see myself going back to time and time again.","September 22, 2014","true","5.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Namco brings us all of our fond childhood memories back whilst making the game feel new and refreshed.\nPAC-MAN DX+ is essentially the same PAC-MAN game you played years and years ago with a lot more re-playability and added content/features. For those who have never played a PAC-MAN game you play as PAC-MAN, a yellow blob with a mouth, trying to eat as many pellets/dots as possible before being caught and eaten by the ghosts who patrol the level and chase you down.\nThere are multiple different stages in Pac-Man DX+ and each different stage has a different difficulty and layout and well as multiple modes that can be unlocked as you progress. You'll start with basic time trials where you must collect 3 fruits within the time limit and once you complete these you'll open both new maps to play on and new challenges for your current map.\nThere are various different ways to play from Score Attack where you must compile as many points as you can before your time is up, to Ghost Combo where you must eat as many ghosts in a row as possible, to time trials where your goal is to clear a specific amount of pellets within a time limit.\n\nIn the main game modes rather than aimlessly collecting as many pellets as possible your aim this time to to clear the screen of all of the pellets to spawn a bonus fruit. When collected this fruit will increase the speed you move at (increasing overall difficulty) and spawn the next group of pellets.\nThe pellets are spawned into a formation for easy collection and are often surrounded by ghosts who will only wake up once you pass them and then they will begin to chase you down. Keeping true to the original Pac-Man you can still kill these enemies when you collect a super pellet as this will turn all the little ghosties on the level blue allowing you to eat them for lots of delicious points.\nWhilst collecting pellets you'll also find yourself coming across a few bomb powerups that, in exchange for losing a few levels of speed, will allow you to activate at any time to remove the line of ghosts following you. Though these will be sent to the respawn point to immediately respawn it can save you the trouble of being caught out and having to respawn yourself.\n\nThe greatest part of Pac-Man is the freedom to change the design of your level (aesthetically) along with yours and the ghosts skin and the background music. It stops the game from feeling repetitive because combined with the vast choices of maps, you'll have the choice of looking and hearing different things. Though this is DLC and I am rather anti-DLC I feel the prices are reasonable for what you get and I managed to snag mine all on sale.\n\nThe only thing I feel is missing from Pac-Man DX+ is some form of online or local multiplayer. Games like this would greatly benefit from this, alas, no signs of it yet. Also the achievements are pretty basic and they can be 100%ed rather quickly which is a shame because the potential for challenging achievements was obvious. Neither of these actually detract from the game though, they are just things I would have liked to seen implemented myself.\n\nTo put it simply, any fan of Pac-Man should own this game. There are hours of added fun and content whilst still offering the original Pac-Man experience for those who desire it. I grabbed the entire All You Can Eat Pack on sale but honestly it's one of those games that truly is worth every penny, even without a discount.","May 5","true","2.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Pac Man has always been one of my absolute favorite arcade style game. My friend bought me this game as my first actual game on Steam, and I was ecstatic to play all the different levels in order to earn the achievements.\n\nPac Man Champion Edition DX+ gives you even more than what you will remember about the classic version of this game. Over the years of playing Pac Man, the graphics on this Championship Edition really impressed me! There are so many bright and vibrant colors, with number different skin styles of boards you can play. There are also 8 different mazes that you can choose from to play on. These mazes include Championship II, Highway (introducing warp zones), Junction (more intersections and double the warp zones), Spiral (use of loop paths), Manhattan, Dungeon (use of tight small paths), Championship I (original map), Half (maze cut in half),  and Free (allowing custom rules).\n\nSomething else that is newly introduced to this game is the idea of “sleeping ghosts” that will idle inside of the maze.  When Pac-Man passes one of these idling ghosts, they will awake and begin to chase Pac-Man around the board.  Once Pac-Man eats one of the larger pellets, you will be able to turn around and eat these ghosts. With each ghost your Pac-Man consumes, he will increase the speed in which he travels around the board, sometimes making tight or sudden turns difficult. (This is where the ability to change the difficulty level for newer players comes in handy) Another useful tool to use, especially when Pac-Man is sprinting across the board with little to no control on your part, is the use of bombs. When you are starting to get overwhelmed with the number of ghosts following you, or the speed Pac-Man is traveling, you can just drop a bomb and it sends all of the ghosts that were following you back to their holding pen for a few extra seconds, before they return to your tail. It is important to also keep in mind that the use of these bombs will decrease your traveling speed as well as your score multiplier.\n\nOne last feature that I really enjoyed is that the game gives you the ability to compare your leaderboard scores with the scores of your friends that also own the game. You can compare scores, achievements, and play time with anyone in your friends list that also owns the game.","January 9","true","10.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

A friend had gifted me this game, but I simply set it aside. I now regret not playing it back then. I just thought, well, I played PAC MAN before. What could this game possibly offer? Turns out, this Championship Edition is still the PAC MAN that everyone loves, but with some adjustments...and I absolutely love it.\n\nStory:Umm...there's this guy called "Pac-Man". He's trying to eat all these dots while being stalked by ghosts.\n\nGameplay:Oh man, I did not expect this game to be so much fun. It is still the "you have to collect all the dots and avoid ghosts, but like I said "with some adjustments". A new mechanic is a bomb that Pac-Mac can use to clear ghosts within range. In the original Pac-Man, you pretty much committed suicide if ghosts came at you with no place to escape.\n\nAnother neat feature for newbies like me is that there is a slow motion effect when you are about to make a mistake. In Metal Gear Solid V, time would slow down if you were detected to give the player a "second chance". Same idea here.\n\nThere are modes such as time trial and 5 & 10 minute modes for you to play. There are also a lot of boards to choose from if you want a different layout to play on.\n\nThere are leaderboards to see how MLG you are against other people in the world.\n\nWhen you eat ghosts, it feels extremely satisfying to clear a whole row of them :)\n\nSound:Sound effects still stay faithful to the original. Pac-Man eating dots and the sounds ghosts make are still the same. The soundtrack is something you will love if you are an Electronic person. (Pac Rainbow has got to be my favorite to get my adrenaline going).\n\nIs it worth $10?:I'd recommend grabbing it when it's on sale. There's even a demo you can download to give the game a try.\nIt might take you around 2-3 hours to complete all the achievements. Even then, there are still lots of board to play on so you can still have some fun. From what I see, the DLCs add some extra boards, skins, and soundtracks.","May 27","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Boy, did I regret that decision. Fixed camera angles and a difficulty that went up and down like a whack-a-mole's hammer ruined the game and I tossed it out the 3rd floor window. Funny thing is, that game came with additional versions of past Pacman games but I felt at an extreme disadvantage when it came to survival, whether you were to jump or not.\n\nRed about this game and I realised I have been missing that drive to complete a game 100%. It either needed to be an extremely specific genre and game (Arkham Series) or something I could do in a week or so (Shadow Of Mordor). There was no feeling of replayability and a strive to perfection, like say, Wipeout HD. I now know that I am starving for arcade games like Burnout and this one.\n\nA constant need to get better at this is ever present due to the ranking method. I have only completed Championship II with an S ranking and this has taken me a considerable time. It is extremely addictive to figure out the nooks and crannies of every course and trying to maximize your score by eating up a long chain of ghosts is the best way of saying ♥♥♥♥ you to these guys. It is revenge, pure and simple but as sweet as it is, it also has to be planned out. The patterns of the dots and the fruits appearing is something that has to be memorized for successful progression, not to mention that the game speeds up to ridiculous proportions. And if you get stuck, try watching someone else's replay, it's always helpful.\n\nIt's arcade, it's addictive for perfectionists and colorful as hell, something that's been missing from today's market. If it weren't for my army tour, I would have clocked 50+ hours already cause I am dying to finish this and get me GW: Dimensions.","December 1, 2014","true","34.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/236450/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","I remember as a kid putting my first quarter in to play Pac Man in a dark and noisy arcade and feeling a sense of panic as the ghosts chased me around the maze, and delight when I was able to finally eat the power pellet that let me get my revenge on them.  Does this live up to the name?  Well.... no not really.\n\nIt feels like it has more in common with the game of "snake" for your cell phone than it does with Pac Man.  In this game, you start in a mostly empty maze with a couple of sleeping ghost sentries guarding the maze.  As you pass by these sleeping ghosts, they wake up and start chasing you.    As you clear dots from the maze, a fruit reward will open up and more ghost sentries and more dots appear in another part of the maze.\n\nThe only thing that stands in your way of a humongous score is a time limit (5 minutes to start) and a set of lives you probably won't lose (unless you're a 5 year old). As you eat, you slowly pick up speed, going faster and faster until you die (which slows you down a bit and wastes some of your time).  If you feel threatened with death, well you've got a bomb that will clear the ghosts out of the way and send them back to the "home base" to give you a little breathing room, but this also slows you down a bit (but not as much as a death would).\n\nYou continue clearing the dots and fruit with a long string of ghosts (growing ever longer as you continue) chasing you RIGHT BEHIND.  At no time do these guys break off to try to surround you or leave to wander the maze on their own (at least not at first).\n\nEventually you're given a power pellet to eat and now you get to turn around and eat the ghots that were chasing you...and again, they pretty much keep going straight for you anyway so it's not hard at all. Additionally, some of these ghosts contain extra bombs or power pellets so you can keep that chain a goin' for as long as possible.\n\nAlso, it seems like the game doesn't want you to die, because if you should find yourself running head first into a pile of enemy ghosts somehow, the game speed suddenly slows to "bullet time" allowing you to reverse your direction and get the Pac out of there, or maybe you can see it's merely going to be a close call and you can continue.  Maybe this effect is lessened as you go up in levels?  It doesn't seem to change between novice to expert mode.\n\nEventually though the difficulty does sorta ramp up a bit, and in later levels you get some ghosts wandering the maze, some ghosts trying to head you off at the pass, etc.  Up until that point it doesn't really feel like Pac Man, and considering that you'll still have several lives and bombs at this point, there's no fear or thrills to be had.\n\nThere are all sorts of special game modes for each level including: 5 minute time attack, 10 minute time attack, and ghost combo (how many you can eat in a row) to name a few, and each level has a theme around the dot patterns, like spirals, highways or whatever.\n\nIf you're a social media junkie, it also integrates with facebook so that you can tell all your friends about how you cleared a level without losing any lives OR using any bombs; basically you get to share your achievements to facebook (I'm sure your friends will be thrilled).\n\nLastly, if you're a big Namco fan, you'll find there's a bunch of in-game skins for the characters so that you can play as dig dug, or change the look from classic pac man to a more neon looking pac man, to the "PacMania" style 3D Pac Man.  Sadly Namco doesn't believe you should be able to mod the game and they removed the ability to do so in a recent patch.\n\nSo to recap, the main focus in this game is to eat dots in a pattern while growing a long "tail" of pursuing ghosts so that you can eventually eat them all in rapid succession for mega big bonuses, and to move as fast as possible so that you can amass the highest score before the time runs out.  It's not EXACTLY like "Snake" but it does have a lot of similarities.  Sorta like if Snake, Pac Man and a puzzle game got scrambled up into one game.\n\nIt's not classic Pac Man but it's still fun enough to play.","December 26, 2013","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Infinite replay value, truley. I love showing this game to friends and playing a few tables to show them why I speak so highly of it. Fascinating graphical effects, infinite difficulties for every table, at least 10 tables without DLC, great music, great soundtrack DLC's (I bought a few, no regrets), fascinating themes that affect every layer individually, global ranks where every millisecond from every trial counts for table ranks and individual challenge ranks. There's even some DLC skins for a Dig-Dug or RadRacer expierience.

There are game modes and challanges for almost every factor that exists in Pac-Man too, I'm pretty sure if you can think of a challenge, there is an option or game mode for it available somewhere in this game. There are also global and local leaderboards, ranking systems and many variations of maze-layouts to choose from too!\n\nWhether you are a fan of the game series or not, I couldn't recommend this game to you enough, particularly when it goes cheap in the sales, pick up the All You Can Eat Edition if you want to add even more variety. This game is definitely more than worth the money, I would also recommend buying this over Pac-Man Museum (if you want a more modern Pac-Man that is) as the Pac-Man Championship Edition featured in that collection is vastly inferior to this version.","March 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Lately PAC-MAN Battle Royale was be one of the best arcade games to play with friends, and now Championship Edition DX+ comes with an hardcore Score Attack with tons of maps and DLCs, but is it worth ?\n\nOnce you start the game, you'll be stuck on the menu for a while because of the music that is, for me, what's best in this game.\nOriginal songs of older PAC-MAN games are not included excepted for the DLCs Dig-Dug Revival and Rally-X Revival.\n\nThe rules of the championship are simple, you have 5 or 10 minutes to make the best score eating dots, fruits and ghosts but as Battle Royale, anytime you eat all the dots on the screen, new lines of dots appear including pac-dots. You will need to discover how the dots lead the way to make points as fast as possible. Also, after eating successfully a lot of ghosts without dying, the speed increases and can be really fast, your eyes should be prepared.\nBut don't worry, if you get lost, you can use bombs to make all the ghosts go back to the start, all the ways should be clean for you to move then.\n\nIn the end of a score attack, you will be added to the general ranking. And if this mode is too hard to achieve a good rank, you can try the Ghost Eater mode (Eating the most ghosts you can with a single pac-dot.), or the Time Attack mode showing you the lines of dots in each map.\n\nEach mode will set you to a ranking, each map will do an average score of all the modes and also set a rank, finally, they will sum up all your ranks of each map to set the total ranking.\n\nSo you understood now, if you like to challenge people and yourself to get a better rank in any game, you will definitely love this game. You will play the maps over and over to get the best rank possible. It's worth it, every run you make in any map can be reviewed by any player from the ranking. Some can be totally hardcore and incredible to watch.\n\nThe DLCs are quite useless, unless you want to play a new map or you play better with the Dig-Dug character or with the car of Rally-X. They only change the colors of the game, without the blur effects.\nI TOTALLY WARN YOU NOT TO BUY THE PAC IS BACK SKIN, it's totally unplayable, it's awful.\nThe other courses are fun to play but they don't include all the modes.\nFinally, the BGM DLCs are only songs to hear while playing, the Reentrance BGM is the menu song. (the best one)\n\n- To end with this, every single PAC-MAN lover should get this and fast.\nIf on your first play you're still not satisfied of the game, let me tell you that you can unlock the classic skin of the first original PAC-MAN game by getting all the achievement and medals. So now ? Play, discover how it works, get a pro score and you're gonna get addicted.","March 11, 2014","true","20.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a remake of the old pac man game.  Duh.  However; unlike some of the remakes over the years this version actually does the orginal game some due justice.  This is the original game on steroids.  Progressive levels, challenges, fruit collection, play patterns, nice mazes, leaderboards, achievements, etc..\n\nOptions and DLC include different skins to play with.  They get unlocked as you progress and there are themes to the game that keep the gameplay fresh (or retro as you choose), all without losing that Pac-man feel.  Graphics are generally 2D but they've done a good job updating them and my high definition was spectacular.  Eye candy is nice in this game.\n\nMy only problem with the game was the controller support.  My controller simply wouldn't work and I tried a few different ones at that and even a flight stick.  I got mixed results but the keyboard worked well.  I can't play pac-man without a jostick/gamepad... so I went to my trusty "XPadder".  If you don't have xpadder yet, you should have it.  xpadder.com if you're looking.  Worth the $10. It's worked every time I've needed controller support for a game that didn't have it already and it's now worked for this one as well. Changed my PC into a hyped up game of Pac-man.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the pac-man fans out there.

The music and visuals are stunning and go great with the gameplay. To sum up the game, it is Pac-Man, but infinitely faster and more intense. The two main modes are point runs and time trials basically. In point runs, you are given a certain amount of time to score as many points as possible. In time trials, you try to complete a task in as short of a time as possible. It is super fun to play.\n\nPros:\nExciting visuals\nExciting music\nExciting gameplay(see a trend)\nPretty easy 100% for you achievement hunters out there\n\nCons:\nOnly so much to do\nSome of the backgrounds and themes look as if they would be awful to play on(but there are plenty of others)\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7/10. It is fun if you want to play something for 10-15 minutes. The price is a bit high given that it is a glorified flash game, but still would be worth it if it was on sale. I personally got it in a humble bundle with the DLC. The DLC doesn't look like the kind of DLC I would purchase for myself though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/236450/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I began playing this game in 2015, the 35 year anniversary for Pac-Man. Pac-Man grew to be an iconic classic game. Many versions of Pac-Man games have come out since 1980 trying to cash in on Pac-Man’s greatness. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX brings back the Pac-Man fever on Steam and shows that Pac-Man has aged quite well.\n\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX has the traditional Pac-Man that everyone has loved over the years, but with updated graphics and new modes. There is still that addictive feature that brings players back for more munching of dots, pellets, fruits, and ghosts. The goal is to score as high as possible. I began with score attacks which require you to travel around the maze while being pursued by ghosts in 5 or 10 minutes. It has the feel of the original Pac-Man, but with state of the art graphics. There are various time trials which require you to eat a particular fruit in a limited period of time, but the fruit will reappear only after eating all the required dots in a particular section of the maze. This creates a sense of urgency so that the fruit can appear quickly enough while time is ticking.\n\nOne of the first differences I noticed in this edition of Pac-Man was the availability of bombs to get out of a tight situation. These bombs send all the ghosts back to their home in the center of the screen.  I don’t recall having bombs at my disposal when I first played Pac-Man back in the day. As a result of the bombs, you can die less often and focus more on earning high scores. There are many more ghosts in Pac-Man Championship Edition DX than ever and this means you will have more opportunities to gobble up ghosts as soon as you locate and eat a power pellet. One mode that is very interesting is the ghost combo mode which requires you to gobble up as many consecutive ghosts as possible to register the highest number of ghost combos by time the clock reaches zero. It feels really satisfying to eat so many ghosts in such short order. In most of the modes eating as many ghosts as possible is key to attaining very high scores. Besides high scores, there is the motive to unlock more challenging modes by completing the mazes without losing all your lives.\n\nThe replay value of this game is through the roof because of the available modes and the desire to score higher and higher every time you play. The sounds of the game are great and still retain the feel of the classic, original Pac-Man. The music intensifies as the clock ticks down to zero.\n\nThe leaderboards have plenty of stats, including where you stand worldwide and among your Steam friends. I am surprised that this game doesn’t have more than 12 Steam achievements. It seems to me that there should be more achievements given all the modes and challenges players can accomplish. There is a replay feature that you can use to watch replays of your performance. What I found disappointing about the replay is the inability to save replays. It is cool to have a replay feature, but it would have been cooler to be able to save replays. The low number of Steam achievements and the inability to save replays are probably my only disappointments in this game. However, the game is so well designed and has such great gameplay that they easily overshadow the low number of Steam achievements and the inability to save replays.\n\nPac-Man Championship Edition is very addictive and can encourage players to get better and better for a long time. The game design retains the classic feel of the original game and there are various maze skins to choose from for aesthetical purposes. For a price of $10, this arcade game is well worth it as it feels like it retains its great tradition while updating it to look modern. This is high entertainment value for $10 and the game shows that Pac-Man has definitely aged well.\n\nMy Score: 9.5/10\n","July 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The music is good, the gameplay can be fast paced but is fun and still accessible to everyone, and it's extremely satisfying to eat ghosts chasing you down. And lots of ghosts will chase you down. A lot. I strongly suggest you get the demo first, and if you're satisfied, get this game + the DLC too. More courses, more music (Pac Steps is my personal favorite!), and a few interesting skins.","June 19, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Since it's the only true remake of Pac-Man with a  new-gen feel on Steam, I personally would recommend this for anybody looking for a quick gaming fix! It's Pac-Man so, it's not bad, and remember Pac-Man is the "Godfather" of gaming - so it's hard to say that this would ever be considered a bad game.\n\nI RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE ONLY ON SALE PRICE.\n\nA New spin on a Old gaming formula\n10/10\n\nCONS:\n- The Price isn't worth what your getting. the Achievements will be easy to get, i got them all in about first 2 hours of "Real" Gameplay time.\n- The DLC isn't really DLC.","May 11","true","24.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I first became hooked on the PS3, and had to get it again on the PC.   What you initially think will be a few minutes ends up becoming very addictive hours.\n\nThere are loads of different play modes to work your way though (time trials, fastest time etc) and a lot of different maze designs to unlock.    You can customise the visual look of each maze and change the speed and difficulty of the levels.    On full 50 speed the game really moves, but I can somehow keep up and keep going.  you also have loads of Steam achievements to attempt to unlock.\n\nI've found it best played with a gamepad rather than keyboard, and for precision prefer an Xbox 360 controller.. with the analogue stick working better than the Dpad (for some reason).   You can get your next move ready really quickly and it feels very fluid at higher speeds.","December 3, 2013","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Since there is alot more diffrent things to do.\n\n+ PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is very addictive becasue its such a simple concept which you could easily play over and over.\n\n+ The art style is great and fits with the theme of the game very well as it alows you to change the background, A.I and the effects at the start which works very well.\n\n+ The game can be challanging since overtime you will do something wrong and having a difficulty setting.\n\n+ There is a bit of replay value in PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ such as the achievements, Leaderboards, awards and the amound of maps there are to choose and unlock.\n\n+ Music in PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ fits with the game very well and keeps you playing more. The feature were you can choose which song you want to play works well.\n\n+ The price of the game is good as if you like Pac-Man then its is wourth the money.\n\n+ One of the best things about PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is that you can only play for five minutes if you want becasue you can set how long you want to play for which is a great freature.\n\n+ Controls for PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ are good and since you can use the Xbox controller it make it alot better to play.\n\n- Over time it will get boring since its the same thing but that will take a while.\n\n- Only being able to have 720x480 this makes the screen look pixelated and annoying.\n\nOverall I would recommend PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ to anyone who likes retro or Score Attack games. I am going to rate PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ 8 out of 10.","November 16, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The skill of dodging ghosts, judging how to use pills, and pathfinding through lines of dots is still very much there, only now it’s ridiculously fast-paced and you have a trail of ghosts following you.\n\nThe looping, non-random stage layouts make for a perfect competitive experience, and the time-attack nature of the game makes it possible to consume in bite-sized portions instead of having to spend hours on a single credit like you had to at the arcade to get a high score.\n\nThe ascetics of the game are both superb and customizable; there are dozens of alternate skins available (even more if you got all the DLC), and the soundtrack is awesome.\n\nOh, and achievement hunters need not fear: all the achievements will be out of your way in no time at all, making this an easy pick for your 100% trophy case.\n\n$15 is steep, so get the DLC pack on sale if you can, preferably for $5 or less. But once you’ve got it, it’s very much worth playing over and over again.","June 30, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The soundtrack is great, as it really pumps your blood, and it also fits the overall presentation of the game well with its techno-ish music. There are also a buttload of maps with several gamemodes; I spent 7 hours on like 1 map (I like replaying a gamemode over & over till I get the highest possible score I can get) and I still have, I estimate, at least 8 more maps? The gameplay is also very fast-paced, as over time the characters move super duper fast & there will be like 30 ghosts on your tail, making it a lot more challenging & exciting than the original Pac-Man.

Both 360 and PS3 and perhaps a gift or two. However this is the first time I've bought DLC.\n\nOverall I think this is a pretty smart game. Very simple and very easy however figuring out a high score is also very intersting. I see many players say that the game is too easy due to the slow down when your about to run into a ghost. I feel these players are missing a key aspect in that while the action may be slowing down so you can prevent a death, the timer does not slow down. This means when finding ways to increase your score and death is already irrevelant, just nearing death means your wasting time, and wasting time means your wasting points.\n\nI was rather impressed by the DLC. All the boards are just as interesting as the original, if not more so. Where optiomal patterns that often change depending on your speed, length of train, and how many roaming ghosts there are.\n\nIn short if your looking for an casual easy arcade experieince it's a pretty good game, but also if your looking for a game to try to find the best way to grab that high score I think it's rather great!","June 11, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You didn't think they'd let you move so fast and not give the ghosts anything either did you? Mazes are littered with sleeping ghosts which will follow your exact path after you move past them. The original ghosts you know and "love" will still be after you, following (more or less) their classic attack patterns (I feel like Pinky isn't quite as prescient as he used to be).\nSo now when you eat a power pellet, you can be looking at a lot more than that coveted 3000 points for a 4-ghost combo - how does up to 3600 each sound? In a chain of 10-20 (or more)?\n\nFor a 30+ year pac-veteran like myself, it sounds like catharsis.\n\nI only have 2 complaints about the game - overpriced DLC that brings nothing new to the table, and the fact that the player must manually select to end their game from the main menu, rather than being able to just escape or cancel button out from the title screen. FaceBook users may find the passive-agressive auto-posted dialogue directly translated from the Japanese to be tedious (some other reviews harp on this a lot), but I don't have an account, so I can't really say.\n\nThe game itself comes heavily recommended - but the DLC bundles and alternate Namco game reskins are completely non-essential.\nBut hey, it's Steam - there will always be a sale!\n\nIf you like puzzle/arcade experiences that reward high risk behavior, or if you've been playing Pac-Man since the punk rockers at the local arcade had to find you a chair to stand on so that you could reach the joystick, then I think you'll have a lot of fun with this one.","January 22, 2015","true","46.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While most Pac-Man sequels were basically the same thing with a small tweak, this game manages to stand out.\n\nThe focus this time is less survival, more high score accumulation.\n\nThe main game concept is still the same. You are Pac-Man, and go around the maze eating stuff. But the objective is not to just eat. The game gives you a path of dots, around which are ghosts waiting to eat you who start following you when you approach. Power Pellets are not as common as in the original game, so watch those small spaces. The game DOES have ghost repelling bombs but they do run out and are only refillable by eating ghosts. Once you eat a pattern, a fruit piece on the other side of the maze appears to replace the pattern you ate.\n\nWhile this version is not so urgent and survivalistic in tone, it can be really fun, especially the faster the session gets. Plus each maze has a set of challenges with which to clear it. It may not be the Pac-Man your dad sank hours worth of quarters into, but it is still fun.\n\nI give it a 9.5/10, because one unlockable would be impossible to get without a Facebook account as the requirement to get it is to get all the medals and achievements and post them to your Facebook feed.","June 12, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"All the computer games available at the time were of the violent type - war games and Space Invader types. There were no games that everybody could enjoy, and especially none for women. I wanted to come up with a comical game women could enjoy." -Toru Iwatani, lead developer of Pac-Man. Pac-Man was then published world-wide by MIDWAY and became the most popular titles at arcades everywhere.\n\nWhat this version of Pac-Man is\nThis version of Pac-Man has you finishing levels to meet certain requirements, and even has a leaderboard for the best scores and players. There is a lot of content with the game, and a lot more with the DLC. Some of the trials have you eating multiple ghosts in a row, or collecting as many points as fast as you can.\nAlso, this version of Pac-Man has two helpful things to players. As the level progresses and you get more points, the game speeds up. So if you fear running in to ghosts, fear not. When you are about to run in to a ghost, the game slows down so you can make a movement to avoid them. In a do-or-die scenario, you can hit space bar or enter to use a bomb and send all the ghosts back to spawn for a short time.\n\nAchievements\nAll of the achievements are easy to obtain and can be collected in 0-1 hours and in a few play throughs.\n\nOverall\nOverall, this is a great turn on an arcade classic that anyone can enjoy. I would highly reccomend it to anyone that likes Pac-Man or games like it.","September 24, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is very similar to the original but they did add "bombs" of some sort that allow Pac-Man to escape when things get intense.  However, not only are the bombs an option, one gets an achievement if they play through a challenge without using them.\n\nThe game features a handful of different challenge mods, different layouts, and there are expansion packs that allow the player to turn Pac-Man into Dig Dug or the car from that one old racing game that has a name I can never remember.  The Dig Dug dlc expansion is worth it because while it is a bit odd to have Dig Dug eating ghosts instead of impregnating little monsters, its still adds some retro goodness to the game.\n\nThe game could have used a Ms. Pac-Man mode but whose to say there ever was a Ms. Pac-Man, maybe Pac-Man just decided he was really born a woman and started dressing as a woman?","May 2","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

And it's Pac-Man. You should probably play it.\n\nPros:Refined and faster-paced gameplay versus the original!\nNew mechanics and massive modifications that help differentiate it from the original Championship Edition.\nStellar Persentation.\nTons of visual options, music, and bonus time trials.\nNitpicks:DLCs are cool but they seem a bit unnecessary.\nThe menus feel a bit clunky to move around.\nCons:Leaderboards have been filled with cheaters, ruining one of the best aspects of the game.\nThe Review\nIt’s easy to see why this game was a massive hit during the early XBLA/PSN days. It took the Iwatani-designed version of the original Championship Edition and went even farther with it. Despite the naming, it is a much more different game from the original Championship due to it’s much faster pace, brand new mechanics, and loads of new visual/audio features.\n\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX throws away the survival element from the 1980 classic, and instead incentivizes players to follow patterns and munch on hundreds of ghosts for the best score possible. Eating the fruit upon eating all of the pellets on one side will rotate and change the other side of the level into a new layout, repeating in the same order until the timer runs out. It's very now a score-em-up, with you earning the majority of your points from collecting a massive chain of ghosts, then eating all of them with a power pellet.\n\nAnd this is the one major change that fundamentally redesigns this game as a whole. Various ghosts are now spread across the level layouts, and you can get them to follow Pac-Man, following his every move. You want these ghosts to chase you, as you’ll eventually be able to rack up insane amounts of points by picking up a power-pellet. But don't worry, because if you feel overwhelmed or are trapped, the game allows you to use screen-clearing bombs to push the ghosts back, which can be valuable to those who want to save precious seconds, or slow the in-game speed that rapidly increases while the game is playing. Basically, the game has almost a huge amount of new mechanics that's easier to show than talk about.\n\nAnd these new game mechanics aren't the only major differences with CE DX. The game’s speed now ramps up even faster the more pellets you eat, there are even more levels, time trial modes for each level, and a lot more visual options to change. Because of this, Championship Edition DX ends up becoming a surprisingly fresh experience that introduces a different type of way of playing Pac-Man, albeit one that isn’t exactly going for what made Pac-Man work. It’s main challenge is now pattern memorization, rather than the effective movement + score hunting present in the original. But like the original Pac-Man, it doesn’t get old that easily!\n\nPresentation-wise is relatively decent, although the game’s main menu is terrible in both its visual look and actually accessing things with it. The music is nothing special but is definitely well-made for the game, and the visuals for the game can be customized. You can change the game’s artstyle and music in any level, and it’s a really unique and cool feature, although some of the visuals are very hit-and-mess (Ghostly Adventures *cough cough*).\n\nDLC is a bit of a mixed bag. While the concept of new levels and themes are cool, some of them were just done poorly (Ghostly Adventures *hack* *wheeze*). They’re better picking up when the game + DLC pack is on a absurdly good price, because otherwise I wouldn’t see myself buying all of this.\n\nPC Optimization is relatively normal. It can probably run on a typical Windows Tablet since the original PC version was built off of that, so it’s definitely not a big worry. I wish there were more resolution options, however. Leaderboards are unfortunately quite the mess, so you can forget playing for the best score online since everyone has already blatantly cheated their way up.\n\nThere’s really not much to talk about when it comes to this game though. It’s Pac-Man. It’s Pac-Man, Championship Edition DX, a completely different and fun way of playing the game. And you should play it.\n\nTL;DR - If you like Pac-Man or good score-em-ups, you should definitely pick this gem up.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","April 22","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Racing around and giving Inky, Blinky, and the others a hard time is just as enjoyable and the bombs are a nice new touch even though I rarely use them.  As for the DLC, I highly recommend all of the DLC for re-play value and the Dig Dug and Racer-X skins are just fun for nostalgic purposes.   I'm not sure how much this game was when it originally came out but these days you can usually grab it for sale for 1-5 dollars during Steam and Humble sales and it is easily worth 1-5 dollars, especially since its usually the version that contains all of the DLC.\n\nI highly recommend this game to children of the 80's who spent all of their quarters playing the original at arcades, bowling alley's, and pizza joints.","May 28","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

Unfortunately, there are no settings for the graphics, so if your computer can't handle the gameplay that's going on, you're down a few bucks. I picked this beauty up for only 5 USD, with all of the DLC, and I don't feel like I've wasted my money.

This is definitely one to pick up when it's on sale, but for $3.75 with all DLC it's worth every penny.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it strongly encourages you to connect to a Facebook account and spam your followers, and doing so is required to unlock all content and achievements. Still, the game itself is a lot of fun, and while I would encourage people to complain loudly to the developers so that they know this is not an okay thing to do, I can't advise against picking up so joyfully entertaining over just that problem.","July 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

It is PAC's job, as the last surviving member of a near extinct race of super-beings known as MANs, to hunt down and attempt to destroy those who brought his own race to the brink of extinction.\n\nThroughout the course of the game you will travel to many of the large, colourful metropolises, known as MAPs. These MAPs are the home cities of the Ghosts, a race of somewhat dim-witted, as well as colourful, sentient beings. The Ghosts are the primary antagonists of the game, and it is your job to consume their eggs in an attempt to wipe out their race. In the same way, you will also find yourself devouring their primary sources of food, in an effort to deny them supplies. The Ghosts are, by nature, a swarming race of expert close-combatants, who will stop at nothing to overwhelm PAC and destroy him, as they did the rest of his race.\n\nA new side of PAC is revealed in this game, one which was previously unseen in other games featuring him, such as Mario Kart and Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing Transformed. This is his violent and fanatical side. In almost every level, PAC makes use of bombs which he straps to his body and detonates, should he be surrounded by the antagonists. It is for this reason that there has been so much controversy over this game, especially with some of the middle eastern gaming companies, such as IGN and Kotaku.\n\nThrough the use of an interdimensional source of energy, known as 'power-ups', PAC can traverse the aether and enter a realm whereby he has the ability to remove the Ghosts from time and space. His race managed to harness the power-ups and condense them into small usable spheres, which is the main reason why the MANs were so feared, and why the Ghosts rose up against them. You will make use of this energy fairly frequently, and I feel it adds a nice flavour to the frantic and fear-driven gameplay that will leave you on the edge of your seat.\n\nOverall this is a fairly decent first person shooter, with some good RTS mechanics thrown in that really strengthen the gameplay, and harken back to the MOBA roots of PAC-MAN™ Championship Edition DX+.\n\n8/10","June 7, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","0"

You'd think that 34 years after the original they'd have ruined the game with useless "features" or it wouldn't be as fun, turns out it's actually a really fun game to play.  It's typical PAC-MAN arcade action so don't expect a story or anything like that.  Time will tell if it has lasting appeal, but it's fun to play a couple games at a time so far.  My favourite feature is the "bullet time" when you get near a ghost, makes for some neat sequences.  The game also lets you string together epic combos of ghost kills to rack up the points.\n\nThe only real negative thing I can say about this game is the HUGE amount of "Share on Facebook" stuff that infests the game.  At one point I was trying to go back to the menu by pressing "A" but instead it took me to the Facebook share dialog.  Really an anti-feature, IMHO.\n\nI don't know if it's worth $10, but it has already provided me the $2.49 worth of entertainment I paid for it.\n\n7/10, would be an 8/10 if not for the Facebook garbage.","June 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timeformime/recommended/236450/","timeformime","timeformime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timeformime/","611 products in account","Boiled down to one phrase, Pac-Man CE is that elusive holy grail publishers chase after - it's the reboot that surpasses the original. it's got an officially licensed, authentic retro character and feel, but still deep, strategic, 21st century gameplay. Other retro characters should be so lucky to be re-imagined with this kind of love and attention. What stood out to me during my few hours with this game were the tight gameplay, absurdly colorful graphics, and the customization. There's a slight caveat to the graphics: keep in mind that it's not an exhaustive port from the original 360 version, and doesn't go past 720p, so your mileage may vary on the graphics if super crisp hi-def visuals are a must for you.\n\nIt's an incredibly addictive experience, but for me, having seen most stages and modes after a few hours, it didn't overstay its welcome. Your time with it can just be short and sweet, but depending on what you want out of it, and whether or not you care about the leaderboards, it easily offers enough variety to be your go-to arcade game. The DLC will give you a little more of everything - it's worth the $1.70 price difference if you want a handful of extra maps, visuals and music. I wasn't old enough to play Rally-X or Dig Dug, but it's cool to have them here. The more the merrier.\n\nThe gameplay moves too fast for you to consciously think about it, which means, like an arcade game should, it really engages your reptile brain, as you instinctively weave Pac-Man in and around ghosts closing in on him, and if you do it right, you get to munch up a buffet line of ghosts all by yourself. There are just very simple 4-way controls and a button for bombs, and that's it, which for me means it's the perfect laptop game to be played on the go. I wouldn't play it to relax or destress, because Pac-Man is anything but relaxing, but even just for 5 minutes, it gets me in the zone with something more in depth than some iOS game. If you try it for free this week, I think you'll find it's worth a buy and a permanent spot in your library, for those times when straight-faced action games just won't do it for you.","September 23, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/recommended/236450/","noq_pl","·noq·","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noq_pl/","908 products in account","In short, is the game good?\nDespite having a few weird design choices, the game is really fun.\n\nIs it worth my time and money?\nIt is worth your time, without a doubt. As for your money - the game uses a weird microtransaction downloadable content system. A few levels and skins are sold separately, as DLC. Thankfully, you can just ignore the DLC and play the main game as the extra levels and skins aren't really required to have fun and work towards better scores. I'd suggest buying just the main game or waiting for a sale for the whole DLC pack.\n\nIs this game for anyone?\nGameplay-wise, yes, the game can be enjoyed by anyone. However, the game has some neon-ish colours passing through quickly (this is especially visible on the highest game speed). It's not a huge issue but if you suffer from epilepsy attacks or some form of movement-based vertigo I'd suggest checking small clips of gameplay footage first (or even static screenshots) to make sure you'll be able to play the game without any problems. There are also other, less neon-like, skins included in the game - switching to a tamer one could do the trick.\n\nLinear, open-world or something else?\nThe game is using the classic PAC-MAN formula, but with a competitive twist. You roam around a labyrinth, searching for pac-dots and power pellets. You avoid ghosts (unless you have a power pellet) and try to get the best score/time possible. The difference with PAC-MAN CE DX+ is that you have various labyrinths, each with a different structure. A few of them are locked as DLC but they're not really mandatory to have. Each labyrinth has various challenges that you can play and compete in the leaderboards (time attacks, score attacks, ghost combos and even playing on a barely lit version of the labyrinth).\n\nGameplay mechanics, gimmicks?\nPAC-MAN CE DX+ is oriented more towards a competitive side of gaming. Instead of slowly roaming the labyrinths, the game quickly gains speed (and so do the ghosts), forcing the player to make split-second decisions and tests the player's reflexes at every turn. Also, instead of just a few ghosts, you will be chased by a whole chain of them, which gives the player the opportunity to build up massive combos. Running into a dead end can also be forgiven as the game uses a bomb item which will temporarily send all chasing ghosts back to their spawn, in the middle of the labyrinth.\n\nGraphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?\nSome skins look really good but others are just bland. You'll most likely find the skin that suits you best and you'll stick with it for the whole game.\n\nAudio design and soundtrack?\nThe sound effects fit perfectly into the pace of the game. There are some moments where the sound effects become quite loud (i.e. when you eat a 20+ ghost chain) but it's nothing a little volume regulation can't handle. Music choices are quite interesting, very fun to listen to while playing. Although, there's not many tracks to choose from. A few more psytrance or euphoric tracks to choose from would be nice.\n\nPlot, story?\nAs far as I understand it, PAC-MAN CE DX+ doesn't follow any particular story or canon of PAC-MAN and honestly it doesn't need to. The fast-paced gameplay hold its ground firmly and doesn't really need a storyline on top of it.\n\nHow does the game run?\nRuns without any issues on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM). Steady framerate, no jittering. The game seems to be locked into a 1280x720 resolution on 16:9 monitors. The game also doesn't have a proper graphical options menu, aside from a fullscreen toggle. While not a dealbreaker, a few basic options (v-sync, resolution, etc.) would be nice.\n\nAny details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?\nYes. The "PAC RAINBOW" track. A psytrance track in a game about running in a dark labyrinth with neon walls, munching down pills and seeing ghosts. There's something fitting about that.\n\nAnything you didn't like?\nYes. It seems that the top places on the scoreboards have been overrun by spoofed scores. This could be a sign of very weak coding of the leaderboard. Still, it's pretty fun to watch a replay of someone who has (allegedly) 500 gajillion points and see him fail on Game Speed 5.\n\nFinal score?\nI give PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ a Wakka Wakka out of 5.","September 23, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players should NEVER have to post to Facebook for an unlock (even in Facebook games, this should be limited to ONCE). Let me say that again, Namco: players should NEVER be required to post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, MySpace, LiveJournal, WordPress, or even Steam itself for an unlock in your game. The fact that the ability was even included (and shown off at the end of every bout in the maze) is bad enough, but as an unlock requirement, it's just plain stupid.\n\nApart from that, the interface could use a little work. It's tough to tell what mode you're about to play in the course if you've unlocked something and have just returned from the Facebook nag screen (note: it's the same mode you just played). It wouldn't be as confusing if the cursor on the menu was in the same place you'd left it (instead, it's on the thing you just unlocked).\n\nSo yeah, the social crap is more than a little irksome, especially for a game they aspire to charge money for. However, if you don't mind that (or are willing to put up with it for the sake of a Pac-Man game that looks, sounds, and feels new and exciting), then this game's probably for you.","September 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still captures the Pac-Man feel perfectly, and on top of that it's the first Pac-Man game I've enjoyed.\n\nThis game seems to be titled "Championship Edition" as it turns an endless Pac-Man gauntlet into a 5 (or 10) minute score attack challenge, an excellent timeframe for a competition. When played for casual survival, the game is an absolute breeze that'll bore most fans within hours as you get multiple raw surival mechanisms (bombs and slowdown before collisions) which drastically lower the difficulty of the game.\n\nThe challenge comes from playing for score. Using either of those survival mechanisms or dying will drastically lower your potential final score, as after using a bomb you're not able to gather up ghosts to chain for a few moments afterwards. Dying or bombing lowers the game's speed level along with lowering the point value of the dots, which means you absorb fewer points over time than you would if you had not messed up. It's still better to bomb than to die, though - death will shave at least 5 seconds of point-collecting time away.\n\nGhost chaining feels both fun and rewarding - mowing down a massive line of ghosts and watching your score skyrocket is a highly satisfying experience. The longer you play, the more familiar you become with all the mazes (and how they change over time!) and you amass more and more ghosts into your gluttonous point farm.\n\nThere are online leaderboards where you can view and compete with your friends scores along with automatic replays so you can view their runs, but the global overall ranking boards are currently plagued with blatant cheating (2 bil points? har) that may be a turnoff.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent score attack game. It has an arcade feel to it in that it's easy to get the hang of it, but challenging to master. All things considered, the chaining system feels more fun and rewarding than most arcade shooting games, but that doesn't say much.","September 26, 2014","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can you get ALL the points?\n\nEverything here is so considered from the death brushing allowing you to escape from the worst self inflicted situations to how it points you towards the best route at all times but can you actually take that route without dying? It's a glorious thing.\n\nAlongside Battle Royale which can't land on home computers soon enough (December, I think?) this is how you reinvent an old game.

You will probably spend hours beating your own score, allowing the sounds of power ups and munchies to be music to your ears, and not relenting until every achievement is won.  And then, what?  School your friends and anyone else who dares to challenge you at this game!\n\nThis game is not like traditional Pac-Man but it is still very fun nonetheless, not to mention fairly easy to play and understand.

Players should NEVER have to post to Facebook for an unlock (even in Facebook games, this should be limited to ONCE). Let me say that again, Namco: players should NEVER be required to post to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, MySpace, LiveJournal, WordPress, or even Steam itself for an unlock in your game. The fact that the ability was even included (and shown off at the end of every bout in the maze) is bad enough, but as an unlock requirement, it's just plain stupid.\n\nApart from that, the interface could use a little work. It's tough to tell what mode you're about to play in the course if you've unlocked something and have just returned from the Facebook nag screen (note: it's the same mode you just played). It wouldn't be as confusing if the cursor on the menu was in the same place you'd left it (instead, it's on the thing you just unlocked).\n\nSo yeah, the social crap is more than a little irksome, especially for a game they aspire to charge money for. However, if you don't mind that (or are willing to put up with it for the sake of a Pac-Man game that looks, sounds, and feels new and exciting), then this game's probably for you.","September 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing it for years on my PS3 and am glad to see it on Steam. This ain't yo papa's Pac-Man. It plays differently due to the different modes and the fact that the ghosts are usually lining up in a conga line behind you while others are sleeping, only to awaken when you zoom by. There is also a Speedometer that tells you how fast you are going because the better you do, the faster and faster the game gets. Totally frantic! I have never enjoyed Pac-Man as much as this version.\n\nI picked up the All-You-Can-Eat Edition which includes a lot of DLC. The Dig Dug skin is fantastic! (Rally-X not so much). The new courses are fun. I've seen comments that say Highway II looks just like Highway. It does look the same but it is way harder. There are many wandering ghosts like in the original Pac-Man in addition to the conga line. Mountain is a fun new course. The achievements are few and not that hard to get. If you earn them all and share them on Facebook, you unlock an origianl Pac-Man game skin.

A classic game modernized. You might think, "What can they do to change pac man?" but after you play this you'll almost definitely agree its an improvement. It is much more intense and frantic, simple yet stylish graphics and effects, that feeling you get with an army of ghosts right on your tail, it's a lot of fun, and a refreshing change  from your typical linear action game to be focused on beating the high score rather than just beating the game.\n\nI only have two bad things I can say about it - both are minor - and that's that there is no endless mode; the original Pac-man technically went on forever if you were good enough; but in Championship edition DX+ all modes have a time limit. The other problem is that the Touch/Mouse UI is always on screen and partially blocks your view of the maze, even if you're using the keyboard or a gamepad. An option to turn this interface off would be greatly appriciated.\n\nOther thoughts: There are some significant changes from normal pac-man, most notably the slow-mo when you're about to run into a ghost, and the bombs which knock ghosts out of the way. At first, it may seem like this dumbs the game down, but it really doesn't. The slow mo effect is helpful, but it's really just a cool thing- its very styleized and it doesn't save you when you're truly doomed. Bombs can save you, but you have a limited number so it creates a strategy element. This game is more challenging than it looks.","September 25, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's *perfect* as a game.\n\nWake the sleeping ghosts to get them to conga for you, get chased around the maze by increasing amounts of conga-ing and not-conga-ing ghosts then KILL THEM ALL (can you kill a ghost?) for massive amounts of points. Can you get ALL the points?\n\nEverything here is so considered from the death brushing allowing you to escape from the worst self inflicted situations to how it points you towards the best route at all times but can you actually take that route without dying? It's a glorious thing.\n\nAlongside Battle Royale which can't land on home computers soon enough (December, I think?) this is how you reinvent an old game. It's Pacman but it's not awful like Pacman is.","October 6, 2013","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

However, instead of the slow paced throughout the whole game in the original ones in the arcades, this one will gradually gain speed once you've eaten some ghosts and what not.\n\nDefinitely fun ^w^ just make sure you buy all the packs because this one only has a number of levels you can unlock to play where as the others you have to buy the add-ons. I would mostly recommend the PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ All You Can Eat Edition which is about $14.99.

There are plenty of different level designs, you can alter the visual style for each map, everything around you changes on the fly, you can be chased by dozens of ghosts at a time. It's intense! Everything is colorful and flashy. The classic arcade sounds maintain nostalgia while the game delivers an enhanced gameplay experience.\n\nThe game has clear objectives as "score attack" or "time trials," which is nice because it limits how long you play a single round for. While this lacks an endless mode, it does mean the game is easy to pick to kill short spurts of time with. Power-ups are plentiful enough that you get frequent rewards of vengeance against those nasty ghosts. If you get caught in a jam, one key-press drops a bomb that sends all the ghosts on the board back to their starting point (though these are limited).\n\nDifficulty increases as you progress and a run-in with a ghost knocks your speed down a bit. Naturally, your speed affects score. Scores are recorded to leader boards to compare your scores with friends or the community as a whole.\n\nPac-Man is a simple game. We all know how it works. Eat the dots. Avoid the ghosts. It's still that same simple, yet addictive gameplay with enough enhancements and flair to take it to a new level of entertainment.","December 14, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'd think that 34 years after the original they'd have ruined the game with useless "features" or it wouldn't be as fun, turns out it's actually a really fun game to play.  It's typical PAC-MAN arcade action so don't expect a story or anything like that.  Time will tell if it has lasting appeal, but it's fun to play a couple games at a time so far.  My favourite feature is the "bullet time" when you get near a ghost, makes for some neat sequences.  The game also lets you string together epic combos of ghost kills to rack up the points.\n\nThe only real negative thing I can say about this game is the HUGE amount of "Share on Facebook" stuff that infests the game.  At one point I was trying to go back to the menu by pressing "A" but instead it took me to the Facebook share dialog.  Really an anti-feature, IMHO.\n\nI don't know if it's worth $10, but it has already provided me the $2.49 worth of entertainment I paid for it.\n\n7/10, would be an 8/10 if not for the Facebook garbage.","June 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't make Facebook sharing a requirement.\n- As expected, a lot of the top times in the levels are cheated.\n\nA fair warning, if you plan on tying or beating any individual level runs of this game, good luck, hope you have frame-perfect reflexes all the time. Shoutouts to Nahucirujano, whose runs inspired me to pick up this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lizardbucket/recommended/236450/","lizardbucket","Kistaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lizardbucket/","733 products in account","Pac-Man CE DX+ is a game of memorization, optimization and micro-optimization, and full-screen awareness. As in traditional Pac-Man games, ghost behavior is deterministic and predictable, so courses can be played entirely on memorized routes - which, due to the incredible speed of the game at Expert levels, is how the game is meant to be played. The game is on a clock, so slowing down is a score penalty.\n\nFinding excellent routes on each board, and executing them, is a lot of fun, but after a certain point, the game loses its replay value. It took around 30 hours for me (across two versions of the game), which isn't too bad, but after hitting S rank on every item, it can be hard to see why to keep playing. There are usually more ways to improve one's score than one might think at first...\n\nSpecial note to the soundtrack - most of the background music is excellent, especially Pac-Rainbow and Pac-Steps (which is DLC).","December 5, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will probably spend hours beating your own score, allowing the sounds of power ups and munchies to be music to your ears, and not relenting until every achievement is won.  And then, what?  School your friends and anyone else who dares to challenge you at this game!\n\nThis game is not like traditional Pac-Man but it is still very fun nonetheless, not to mention fairly easy to play and understand.  If you think you'll like a contemporary take on a retro game, you should definitely give this a try!","October 25, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasmink/recommended/236450/","thomasmink","MinkSleep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasmink/","87 products in account","Pac-Man was the first game I EVER played. My parents used to tell me I was only three years old. Of course, I have no idea how true that really is.. but I do have one very old memory of playing the game on the Commodore64.\nThat being said, it's a true classic. I still love that old game to this very day... but this isn't a review of the original game, is it?\n\nI had to give that brief history lesson, because the sheer amounts of nostalgia I feel while playing this version is almost overwhelming.. yet, at the same time, it also feels amazingly fresh. The first time you gobble down a long string of ghosts, you'll have the biggest grin and probably not even realize it. Why? Because that huge speed increase caught you off guard.. so you'll remember that instead.\n\nThe goal is still to get as many points as possible, only now it's done with a time limit. Mazes are divided in two, and clearing one half of dots will place a fruit on the other half. Eating the fruit will cause more dots to appear on the empty half while also altering the maze layout on that half as well.\nThe dot patterns also often contain green sleeping ghosts. Getting close will wake them and they'll immidiately give chase, becoming rainbow colored in the process (their color constantly shifts and changes). Gathering large strings of these ghosts is a primary method of scoring points when you come across a power pellet.\nBlinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are also present and act much like they used to before. Getting too close will also make these guys angry and they can join the train. If so, their eyes will pop back into ghost house to reappear. As such.. Blinky will add quite a bit to the train just because he's the chaser, and the angry ghost train is that on crack anyway. Clyde ends up being a bit dangerous thanks to his somewhat random nature when combined with the train following you and the overall speed of the game. Pinky and Inky are also dangerous in their own regards, just not as much.\n<3 Inky\n\nThe music also must be stated. Whoever it is who made these tracks deserves more credit than they probably got. There is absolutely no way you'd be able to take your eyes off the action to glance up at a timer at the higher speeds. The closer the timer is to running out, the more intrusive the music gets compared to the sound effects of the game itself.. and it builds up to a climax as the timer runs out. The brilliance behind that cannot go without being mentioned.\n\nThis game, man. It's an updated take on a legend, and it's done perfectly. A 'classic' mode would have been icing on the cake.. but whatever. If you're a fan of Pac-Man, you're doing yourself a huge disservice by not AT LEAST trying out the demo.\n\nEDIT Sept. 16, 2015: So having unlocked the 'classic' skin and giving it a go... I feel let down by it, honestly. Keep in mind that Pac-Man is a game I loved since a VERY young age.\nBut anyway... to nitpick the 'classic' skin if I may, and I certainly may...\n..The colors on the sleeping/angry ghosts are horribly muted. I know they didn't exist in the old game, but still. They just look bad. All of the other 'characters' are bright and colorful, but these look drab and boring.\n..Inky isn't cyan. For the non-classic skins this is fine. But for the 'classic' skin, why isn't he cyan?\n..The ghosts have black eyes. I'm fine with this in regards to the angry ghost chain, but why do the four main ghosts not have blue eyes?\n..The normal 'pac-dots' are round. In the original game, circles weren't invented yet. The dots were small squares. In this regard, and for the eye color of the ghosts, the Type A skin does a better job than the classic skin does!\n\nI dunno. The classic skin does some things right, but I just can't get over the nitpicks. It completely fails at being 'classic'. But I can't change my recommendation on that alone.. nobody can. It's still a fantastic game. ...I just won't be using the classic skin all that much. :)","September 4, 2015","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Time trials, ghost combos, score attack, it's all a blast to play, and theres literally a million tracks to play. The soundtrack is catchy and keeps you on edge as well.\n\nIf you thought the original pac man was boring, you might wanna try this.

A ravishing assault on the senses: retro soundtracks with a electronic upbeat, multiple visual layouts to keep the playthroughs stimulating, and a new way to play. Rather than a repeat of the same board upon completing it, you have the optional Score Attack where you must earn the highest score before 10 minutes has passed. Every cleared set of Pac-dots boosts Pac-Man's speed, making it more challenging but necessary to obtain a high score even faster.\n\nDon't worry, you can buy yourself time with the newest addition of bombs to return the Ghosts back to the center as well as enter a "Matrix moment" to counter a last-minute turn. There are a enough Pac-dot sets that vary by stage and placement and the patterns for them don't repeat too soon either, keeping you on your toes.

Even if it's hard to believe, it has improved graphics and a somewhat different playstyle than the original, while containing the original game itself as an unlockable.\n\nThis game brings back the oldschool memories of the arcade Pac-Man game, making it bigger, better, with many more game modes and styles.\n\nBefore i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.\n\nPROS:\n+It's Pac-Man.\n\nCONS:\n-Doesn't have a Space Invaders easter egg, as much as i have played\n\nTL;DR A very good game, even your parents will love it.\n\n10/10 waiting for the Space Invaders version","January 8","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is... FANTASTIC. Seriously.  I normally don't review games, but I just felt like I had to, because it was just that awesome.  OK, here's what I was expecting.  Classic Pac-Man, the way I knew it as a kid, but on my PC.  Cool.  Nostalgia time.  Well, I was dead wrong.  Don't get me wrong, it's Pac-Man alright... but radically different.  The game dynamics are vastly improved.  The pellet pattern changes dynamically within the game, making the board feel more like a GAME board than a maze where you simply have to navigate every corner, as it was in the original.  The ghost chases are INSANELY fun.  I had what must have been 50 ghosts chasing me in a row, like the classic "snake" game.  And then the it was my turn to eat THEM!!  One after the other in rapid succession, down the giant yellow gullet.  There's a "warning" slow down to give you time to react when you're about to be eaten, but it feels natural and far less frustrating than the original Pac-Man where you hit a ghost and that was it... bloo, Bloo, bLOO, BLOOP! Gone.  Not in this version.  The developers did excellent job of balancing gameplay in that it's challenging while being acheivable, never boring, and worth every penny.  VERY... NICELY...

Being a seasoned gamer (25 yrs) I was pretty pleased with what I saw in this game. Although I had not played a Pac-Man game since the arcade classic as a child, and later as a teenager, DX+ was more than what I expected at a glance. Only having spent a minimal amount of time playing I would recommend this game to anyone who loves fast paced puzzle games OR Pac-Man. The course designs and options available for backgrounds are impressive but not over the top. Spoiler - Mine Loader added an alternate score attack mode, and the ability to drop a bomb if you happen to get screwed into a corner-which will happen. Also I liked that they stuck close to their roots here, and gave me some tingly nostalgia.

This is Pac-Man. True to the original game but with updated, numerous visuals. The persistent increase in speed properly increased difficulty through play. Eating a large train of ghosts feels satisfying, but does end up as too much of a serving of free, easy points. However, after about 2 hours of gameplay, you have already seen all there really is to the game. It doesn't offer much more than competiting against global scoreboards (which, typically, are led by hackers with unrealistic scores).\nThe gameplay remains rather static in that you are more likely to maneuver yourself into building your ghost train, while avoiding the few ghosts that do chase you in original pac-man fashion. Time attack is enjoyable for the first few times, but once you get used to the modes, there is very little to stay around for.  I feel maze design could have been played with more. Maybe making left and right or top and bottome areas split from each other with the side tunnels used to connect them. Another mode could have been to create as long a train of ghosts as possible.\nThe game is wel put together, but the need to integrate facebook into it feels forced.\n\nI played this during a free weekend and after two hours, I felt I had played out the game. I finished almost all the achievements too quickly. None of the achievements made me want to push harder.\n\nIt was fun for the little time I spent, but I know there is nothing more to keep me interested.","September 28, 2014","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The techno-style music gets annoying after a while.\nBUT, again, it is not THE Pacman.. They should've called it Re-Pacman since the visuals are vastly different and you cannot play the original version. If you want to play the original your only option is to buy the namco museum which is really milking the cow till it's dry.. How hard would it be to include it here and not make us pay yet another time for a 30 year old game..\nSo It's a fun game game for a while, not brilliant, not "better" than the original, but different, more "loud" and after a while annoyingly loud and flashy and in a way more shallow, yep if that's possible, than the original Pac-man where you actually cared for the little pizza dude..\n\nGet it in a bundle or heavily discounted, certainly not at full price.\n\nEDIT: You can only unlock the original skin (not original Pacman) after you get ALL the medals in the game which means sharing on FB and such crap. For that alone I should give it a negative thumbs because, believe it or not Namco and developers, some people DON'T HAVE FREEKING FACEBOOK and don't want to! <-- Now you can cancel before sharing but it's still a chore to share-cancel all. Add the original and I'll give it a positive..","October 3, 2015","false","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The leaderboards and simple-yet-intuitive controls are great.\n\nWith that being said - I don't like how simple this game, and the original game, is. When the original debuted around 1980, it was a major breakthrough - I get that. It was the first arcade game that I and many others played. To me, it was 'meh' then and is less-so now. Compared to modern games, it is overly simple and, really, not that fun after about a half an hour. Thats my opinon.\n\nI will vote this game 'yes' under the caveat that you already know you like running around the maze and want an updated version of the game. If you are looking for more complexity than the original - look elsewhere.\n\nI don't enjoy this game, but it is well done considering I understand and have played the original.","August 11, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought the all All You Can Eat Edition and had Dig Dug theme building up for 10 minutes in score attack. Marvellous!\n\nFor those older gamers who used to play the original coin-op version of Pac-Man, this version has a few mechanics that might reinvigorate that old spark. You'll probably see from the Store page video the differences, but my favourite is ghost training for that super high score!\n\nAs of writing this I've only played 2.2 hours, but I can guarantee I'll get a few mates to toss the controller/keyboard around and see who can top the high scores!\n\nDefinitely recommend! :D\n\nMusic 34/10","December 21, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You can wake them up though, Metal Gear Solid style.\nWander too close to a ghost whom are scattered around the maze and he will wake up and chase you.\nBut the games pacing is so slow that you really have to go out of your way to do that.\nInfact your mind begins to wander because the game is lit up like a Las Vegas strip with the music having a hard techno beat and yet everything is so slow and easy; I feel like I'm watching a 40yr old stripper and I am just throwing her money out of pity at this point, yeah it's Pac-Man but can it really keep up with the games of today?\n\nThe answer is yes, yes he can.\n\n──▒▒▒▒▒──\n─▒─▄▒─▄▒─\n─▒▒▒▒▒▒▒─\n─▒▒▒▒▒▒▒─\n─▒─▒─▒─▒─\n\nAll that slow pacing and sleeping ghosts is just to ease you into the game, to decieve you into thinking the game is easier than it is.\nThe light show? Soon that will become trippy and a hinderance as you try to get a good view of the maze to plot your path out in advance! The game speed? It starts to crank up in tune to the music and the music of choice is techno so you know that isn't going to end well, for you! And the sleeping ghosts dotted about the maze? Harmless enough right? Until they are sleeping RIGHT IN YOUR PATHWAY and the original ghosts? They turn up just as the games speed gets cranked right up! Suddenly you realize that this game is out for blood. And you will love it!\n\nEverything is just so, right! The game goes into slow motion if you get too close to a ghost so you can still claw back victory but it returns right back to breakneck speed as soon as you hit safety so you can end up building your own death trap out of panic. You get bombs now which help clear the way of ghosts, a simple concept but one that works and the ghosts? The A.I. is up! Pac-Man A.I. was always a treat even back in 1981 but for a simple game, the 4 main ghosts really had personality to how they chased you or wandered the maze. Now however you can have upto 30 ghosts on screen, maybe more, I lost count! It becomes a snake train of ghosts hunting you down while the original cast of ghosts are not upstaged because they retain their A.I. and the new generic ghosts simply congo line behind you. A touch that I really apprechiate, very nicely done.\nGhosts can now also contain power pills inside of them and eating an additional power pill will extend the timer of its effect, which is also nicely displayed for you to see. This means you actively want a congo line of regular ghosts so you can eat a power pill and wipe them all out for massive points!\n\nThe controls are fine, it's Pac-Man, you would have to intentionally go out of your way to break the controls in a game that originally didn't even need buttons. A new visual effect is added that can cause sparks to fly if you are holding down a direction with a wall on it. This needs a bit of explination but in the original pacman, it was common to hold left while a left exit was coming up so you could take the left ASAP, sparks now give a visual indication that you are holding in a direction which given this games amazing speed, is extremely helpful.\n\n──▒▒▒▒▒────▄████▄─────\n─▒─▄▒─▄▒──███▄█▀──────\n─▒▒▒▒▒▒▒─▐████──█──█──\n─▒▒▒▒▒▒▒──█████▄──────\n─▒─▒─▒─▒───▀████▀─────\n\nOverall Pac-Man has been in many games since his original introduction. Some where good, some were bad and this is not the first Pac-Man Championship game either. The efforts made to make this game feel like an arcade game but also to feel relevent in the modern era have all paid off.\nThe game is fun to play and I highly recommend it.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","September 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Surprisingly so considering I never played Pacman before. (The game is really good in guiding you into the faster, more difficult play styles by being so motivating and fun and doing it in a smooth, gradual way.)\nBut I guess it would be too good to be true if a well-designed game like this didn't have some points that leave a really bad taste, and 66% discount is not enough to convince me to buy this,\n1) The game is called Championship Edition. Everything about it screams "competion" and "highscore". And then you have tons of scoreboard cheaters, and nothing is done about it. Hell, you can even watch the replays of those people and they are clear evidence that they cheated!\n2) In order to unlock some stuff like the original Pacman skin, you need to share your in-game achievements and medals to Facebook! It's probably broken now anyway, and it will still work even if the attempt fails, but the very fact that a game tries to compel you to register with a business that makes using your real name mandatory and acts like an NSA service provider, and wants you do spam those achievements there is borderline unreal. Especially a game that is probably THE icon of video gaming, known to almost everybody.\n\nIf the first point had been fixed when the problem occured and the second point had never existed, I'd have bought the game right-away and recommended it to others passionately, but as things are, I'd probably only take it for free.\n\nUPDATE: Which I now kinda did.","September 23, 2014","false","3.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/236450/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Some classic games age better than others.\n\nPac-Man is one of those titles that still plays well today despite the fact it originally came out in 1980. That doesn't mean that it's perfect, however, nor does it mean that people have been happy to leave it alone since that time. Indeed, the Wikipedia entry listing all the Pac-Man games throughout history includes no fewer than 51 games (not including compilations) that either focus on or feature Pac-Man and/or his family at one point or another -- though many of these games radically deviated from the original formula of eating all the dots in a maze while avoiding the unwanted attentions of four ghosts.\n\nOf all the adaptations that remain at least reasonably true to the original game, two of the finest are surely 2007's Pac-Man Championship Edition, which made the game a timed score-attack affair, and its 2010 follow-up Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.\n\nOm nom nom. Or something.\nPac-Man Championship Edition DX (hereafter Pac-Man CE DX) was a masterclass in how to modernize an arcade classic: it kept the original gameplay intact while simultaneously incorporating features that simply wouldn't have been possible on the hardware of 1980. Its biggest change to the formula was the addition of "sleeping" ghosts scattered around the ever-changing maze layouts; passing close by them would cause them to wake up and start following Pac-Man in an ever-lengthening rainbow-colored trail. Scoring highly in Pac-Man CE DX was a matter of deliberately building up this trail to be as long as possible, then unleashing a Power Pellet to gobble up as many as you could in rapid succession, the screen exploding in a shower of disembodied ghost eyes flying off the screen as Pac-Man chomped his way to victory.\n\nThe simple addition of the sleeping ghosts had a huge impact on the way you had to play Pac-Man CE DX. Because they were always in the same, predictable locations, it became possible to calculate an "optimum" route through the game's maze layouts, though actually successfully executing that optimum route became more and more difficult as the game accelerated to speeds '80s arcade game makers could only dream of. Fortunately, the game provides a number of "time attack" modes which prioritize quickly completing mazes over scoring as many points as possible, and these provide a helpful means of learning the layouts a little at a time before applying them to the 5- or 10-minute score attack modes that provide the game's main, insanely addictive draw. Alternatively, you can use the "Ghost Combo" mode to test how many ghosts you can successfully chomp in one go before a Power Pellet's effects wear off.\n\nIf you played Pac-Man CE DX back in 2010, you already know all this, of course, and you're probably wondering what that little plus sign at the end of the title indicates.\n\nWell, it's not a completely new game, though the "Plus" edition does mark its first appearance on PC platforms via Steam. Rather, the new version -- available as a free update for those who already own it on console -- adds a few extra bits and pieces while keeping the core game experience just as it's always been. Specifically, it adds some social and comparison features to make it a little easier to check out how you're doing compared to your friends, and a new set of "medals" to complement the existing bank of achievements and trophies. The game also now has support for add-on content which can either be purchased separately or acquired via the "All You Can Eat" bundle. Currently available DLC includes four new mazes, three new visual themes (based on Dig-Dug, Rally-X and the upcoming Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures) and two new background music tracks, one of which is the finest piece of Japanese jazz funk/drum and bass I've heard from Namco since Ridge Racer Type-4. Have a listen for yourself.\n\n\nThe new mazes are interesting and worth a look for veterans. The Championship III course is a particular highlight, offering a significantly tougher challenge than any of the other courses in the new content -- I found it hard to even break a million on this one, while I'm comfortably well over 1.5 million on most others. Big Eater offers an entertainingly ghost-heavy (and consequently potentially high-scoring) romp that will probably take a few attempts to get your head around, while Mountain offers a highly technical, asymmetrical course that will likewise require a bit of practice to work out the best route through. The weak link in the new courses is probably Highway II, which is just a little too similar to its predecessor for comfort, though nonetheless features some interesting "wrap-around" layouts that require a keen awareness of how both sides of the maze relate to one another as you gobble your way off one side and chomp back on the other.\n\nOne of the more annoying new features about the update is the ability to share achievements and medals on Facebook. Indeed, three of the available medals are tied directly to how many other things you've shared on Facebook, and in order to unlock the classic Pac-Man skin for the game, you need to share all of your achievements and five medals, making for a total of 17 separate posts cluttering up your Facebook page all in the name of making the game look like its 1980 original self.\n\nThere are three main problems with this: firstly, the medals and achievements are all extremely easy to acquire with the exception of one, meaning they're not really worthy of bragging about; secondly, there's no means of posting the one thing you might genuinely want to share on social media, i.e. your actual score and leaderboard position; thirdly, try as I might, on both the Xbox 360 and PC versions I could not make the Facebook functionality work at all anyway, making the whole thing somewhat redundant. It feels like a half-hearted, unnecessary and badly implemented attempt to add social gaming features into a game that was already pretty good at encouraging competition between friends and among the community as a whole without shoehorning Facebook into the equation. It doesn't need to be there, and the fact that it doesn't work properly and thus actually locks people out of game content just adds insult to injury.\n\nThe "Classic" skin is locked behind Facebook sharing. Boo!\nI can't stay mad, though. Despite the Facebook-related idiocy, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ remains as ludicrously addictive as it was the day it came out back in 2010 -- and the addition of a new Steam version means that a whole new audience can now discover it for the first time. Good integration with Steam's network on the PC version means that you can quickly and easily compare your performance to your Steam friends list right from the game's main menu, though it might have perhaps been nice to see a more direct means of challenging one another. Steam Cloud support also means that you can transfer your progress from one computer to another without having to unlock everything all over again, though the reliability of this was occasionally a little flaky while I was trying it out. I lost progress on one occasion, though it's possible this was more due to the dodgy Internet connection I had at the time than a problem with Steam Cloud or the game itself.\n\nRegardless of a few flaws here and there, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ remains the perfect coffee-break game -- you can sit down and play for just five minutes and feel like you've had a rewarding experience, but at the same time if you want to spend several hours perfecting your cornering on the game's wide variety of mazes, you can do that too. It's an enjoyably intense experience by yourself, but if you can recruit a few friends to set up an impromptu league of your own, it becomes one of the most addictive games in the known universe. You have been warned!\n\n10/10","May 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This version of PAC-MAN was originally released on XBLA and later on PSN, and it blows my mind how they were able to refresh the game. I do believe the PC (steam) version is the superior version due to the opening menu screen leaderboards against your friends.

The shocker with DX+ is twofold. One, the DLC stages are as good as the older stages*. Two, the menu update that came with DX+ makes the menus less responsive.\n\nCE DX on the Xbox 360 had simple and responsive menus. The menus are mostly the same in DX+, but the few things that they added slow everything down. There's Facebook sharing. Yuck. Whenever you select one of the special skins (Dig-Dug, Rally X, Pac is Back), everything slows to a crawl for around a second as the game loads the skin data and messes around with your settings.\n\nApparently Namco won't let you play with Dig-Dug characters on a Pac-Man background, or use the Dig-Dug song for anything but the Dig-Dug skin. It's a very silly restriction, and since the practical effect of the restriction is less responsive menus, Namco and the company who did the port should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nOriginally, the files for this game were in an easily moddable format. But then the fun police at Namco or Mine Loader Software had to put a stop to it, lest people create custom skins or levels. Everything is now packed into one not-moddable file. At best, this was done because they didn't want people to buy the base game and then pirate the special skins. At worst, it was because they were scared that people would create new content using their intellectual property. Either way, it's bogus, and very, very sad, since it took extra effort to REMOVE modding support.\n\nThe game only runs at 720p, which if it were easier to mod might not be the case. If you use a 360 controller, don't forget to turn on vibration in the settings.\n\n*With the new DLC stages, it seems like they only exist in 5-minute mode. The regular DX (not +) stages can be played for 5 or 10 minutes, and have more unique mazes to cycle through before you see the same maze twice.\n\nOnce you actually start playing, DX+ is the most fun you can have with Pac-Man. Pac-Man CE DX+ is a fantastic game with very unfortunate business decisions bogging it down. Yes, you should buy it. It's great. Get the version with all the DLC. It's worth it.","February 13, 2014","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, this it, although with some new ideas and it's still fun to play once in while.\n\nIt's not only about clearing the screen anymore, but also about some tactics, because most of the time clearing the pre-set-up-screen won't suffice, that's where the new ideas come in.\n\nOften you need to gather as many fruit as you can, sometimes because it's the main objective to gather x fruit from the left and the right side of the screen, and sometimes just for points.\n\nBut the fruit does not just lie around anymore, it spawns when you cleared the respective other half of the screen, so planning with that while being chased on high speeds can prove a challenge, because it's not only your typical four ghosts that chase you either.\nThere's sleeping ghosts, that wake up once you come near them and others that spawn from the middle once any ghost comes in close range to you, so you will find yourself dragging around a long tail of ghosts most of the time, while some don't just enqueue but rather try to come from another side to get you.\n\nYou still can fight back using the power pellets and some ghosts grant you another power pellet when eating them to extend your combo, but eating ghosts always increases your game speed. To slow it again, there are just two ways: die or use a bomb.  Bombs send all ghosts chasing you back to the middle and they - as well as lives are given to you at the beginning of each level and it's up to you how to spend them.\n\nFor both time trial and score attack you will want to be playing on a decent game speed though, because it increases the things you can do in a certain amount of time, obviously, although in the classic Pac-Man game going around corners could be difficult - it also does here but they included a mechanic to counter that a little: instead of perfect timing you just need to plan ahead, your input is buffered, so if trying to go right at the next corner, just press right against the wall and Pac-Man will remember to turn right as soon as he can. If the speed gets really high, the usefulness of this feature vanishes of course, so yes, it's making the game easier but only so much.\nAlso if you're about to get caught, time slows down so you have a final chance to react, but again on higher game speeds there's little difference.\n\nLast thing to mention is the screens change while playing: If you cleared out one - let's say the left side - of the screen and collected the fruit on the othere - right -side, the first - left - side may change the layout of its maze and its contents.\n\nThe only thing that's a shame is, that if it wasn't for the free weekend, I wouldn't have given this game its deserved second look.","September 27, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a ton of courses each with many ame modes and a lot of replay value if you love going for that high score.

Well, this it, although with some new ideas and it's still fun to play once in while.\n\nIt's not only about clearing the screen anymore, but also about some tactics, because most of the time clearing the pre-set-up-screen won't suffice, that's where the new ideas come in.\n\nOften you need to gather as many fruit as you can, sometimes because it's the main objective to gather x fruit from the left and the right side of the screen, and sometimes just for points.\n\nBut the fruit does not just lie around anymore, it spawns when you cleared the respective other half of the screen, so planning with that while being chased on high speeds can prove a challenge, because it's not only your typical four ghosts that chase you either.\nThere's sleeping ghosts, that wake up once you come near them and others that spawn from the middle once any ghost comes in close range to you, so you will find yourself dragging around a long tail of ghosts most of the time, while some don't just enqueue but rather try to come from another side to get you.\n\nYou still can fight back using the power pellets and some ghosts grant you another power pellet when eating them to extend your combo, but eating ghosts always increases your game speed. To slow it again, there are just two ways: die or use a bomb.  Bombs send all ghosts chasing you back to the middle and they - as well as lives are given to you at the beginning of each level and it's up to you how to spend them.\n\nFor both time trial and score attack you will want to be playing on a decent game speed though, because it increases the things you can do in a certain amount of time, obviously, although in the classic Pac-Man game going around corners could be difficult - it also does here but they included a mechanic to counter that a little: instead of perfect timing you just need to plan ahead, your input is buffered, so if trying to go right at the next corner, just press right against the wall and Pac-Man will remember to turn right as soon as he can. If the speed gets really high, the usefulness of this feature vanishes of course, so yes, it's making the game easier but only so much.\nAlso if you're about to get caught, time slows down so you have a final chance to react, but again on higher game speeds there's little difference.\n\nLast thing to mention is the screens change while playing: If you cleared out one - let's say the left side - of the screen and collected the fruit on the othere - right -side, the first - left - side may change the layout of its maze and its contents.\n\nThe only thing that's a shame is, that if it wasn't for the free weekend, I wouldn't have given this game its deserved second look.","September 27, 2014","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is the same pacman from 1970, with nothing new to add. You just continually go around a small course and collect fruit and dots while avoiding ghosts and eating them. That's it. This edition adds some new skins for you or the ghost, and gives a few different layouts to the level, but the gameplay and repetitiveness doesn't change. After 1 level you have seen basically all this has to offer. And to charge 10 bucks for a 40 year old game is pretty meh. Oh yeah, there's leaderboards too, if that really matters at all. Buy this game if its 95% off and you are like 55 years old and want to relive playing pacman like you did on your atari. Everyone else, this game just reminds me how far we've come in 40 years and makes me grateful games are more than this these days.","September 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, I lived in Japan in the 1980’s. “Pac Man” has a special place in my heart. “Pac Man  DX” is actually a very respectable and fun gameplay variant on the orginal Pac-Man, has excellent production values, and I would have given it my highest recommendation, but....\n\n... It has (apparently) NO ARCADE MODE! You can only play in short bursts, in “time attack” mode, and that is just not Pac-Man!!! You can play for five minutes, or ten minutes. No “next level,” and no cartoon intermissions. “Pac Man DX” only allows you a small time limit to play, on one level. Once the timer runs out, GAME OVER, no matter how well you were doing!\n\nTHAT’S TERRIBLE!\n\nPac Man (and just about all sequels and variants) is an endurance game; you keep playing until you lose your last life! Get to the next level, get the next “key”, see the next “cinema,”  keep going as long as you can.... that’s Pac-Man!\n\nIf you’re a fan of “Pac Man,” then sure, buy this, expecially if it’s on sale, but you’ll probably be disappointed (as I was).

They've taken the perfection of Championship Edition's regenerating maze time trial concept and actually made it *boring*.  The layouts have clear optimal routes so you always know where to go, you're given screen clearing bombs that have no place in a competition-focused game of this nature, and the game even slows down to allow you to escape death with ease.  Score attack games are fun and competitive regardless of how challenging (or not) they are, but while the previous game managed to perfectly merge Pac-Man's gameplay into this frenetic nonstop arena, this time they've gone too far outside the box.  It's a score attack maze game with only a dead Pac-Man husk strapped on to the side.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/236450/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+ is an arcade game based off of the original PAC-MAN arcade game. The game centers around two ideas – speed runs, trying to eat all the pills on a stage as fast as possible, and point runs, where the player tries to score as many points as possible within a 5 or 10 minute timespan. The game differs significantly from the original game in many respects, but is still recognizably related to the original game.\n\nStory\n\nThere is no story. This is PAC-MAN!\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game, while recognizably very similar to the original PAC-MAN, is also very distinct from it. There are a number of different mazes (stages) for you to play in, with the completion of time trials and point attacks on earlier mazes necessary to unlock later ones. The gameplay is pretty simple – PAC-MAN moves continuously in the direction he is pointed, and can be turned into side passageways. All passageways are exactly as wide as PAC-MAN and the ghosts, so the levels are a series of paths.\nUnlike the original PAC-MAN, the stages in the game are not static. Each half of the maze contains a number of pills; once all of the pills on one side of the maze has been collected, a “fruit”, which can take many different forms (some of which are not fruit) appears on the opposite side of the maze. Once that fruit is collected, the cleared side of the maze shifts to the next pattern in a series. The series of patterns is preset, not random, and there is a path through each pattern which is “optimal”, and this path is continuous between patterns. Thus, at its heart, the game is one of memorization, and most of the mazes have at least one path from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen, and from one side of the screen to the opposite side of the screen, wrapping around and allowing for swift navigation across the stage.\nIn addition to the pills, there are two other important features in the mazes. The first is ghosts. These enemies come in two flavors; the first flavor is the wandering ghost. Early on, there aren’t any of these, but as the game progresses these continuously spawn, until eventually there are at least four of them, and possibly an infinite number of them – the maze seems to get increasingly crowded as time goes on. Some of these ghosts carry power pills, and some of them carry bombs, but the vast majority of them carry nothing.\nIn addition to the wandering ghosts, there are static, sleeping ghosts in each pattern. These ghosts are woken up by passing by them, and will start chasing PAC-MAN around the maze. Unlike the wandering ghosts, these ghosts will form a very long line chasing after PAC-MAN, though the wandering ghosts will oftentimes join the pack and join in the chase. The more of these ghosts are woken up, the longer the line will grow. One touch from either kind of ghost will spell PAC-MAN’s doom, but the game slows itself down if PAC-MAN comes close to touching one.\nPower pills are much larger pills which spawn in certain patterns of the maze. These can be collected by moving over them and temporarily give PAC-MAN the ability to eat ghosts, scoring a large number of points and eliminating them. Wandering ghosts will respawn after a short period of time, while the sleeping ghosts (and the woken up ghosts) will simply disappear forever after being eaten. As some of the ghosts themselves carry power pills, eating such ghosts (or eating another static power pill on the map) will reset the time allowed to eat ghosts and score points. The patterns of the map are set up such that the player can do this potentially indefinitely, assuming perfect play, retaining effective invincibility and the ability to eat large numbers of ghosts for points. Some of the patterns require PAC-MAN to eat ghosts.\nThere are also bombs, which can be activated to clear the map of all woken-up ghosts, as well as of all the wandering ghosts. If this is done, all of the ghosts will be put into the center of the map and slowly escape back out into it, pursuing PAC-MAN once more. Bombs are a last-second desperation measure, but they are very effective.\nShould PAC-MAN touch a ghost, a death animation is played, the ghosts are returned to the center of the map as if a bomb had been used, and PAC-MAN respawns where he died. The player has a limited number of lives, though can gain extra lives by scoring enough points.\nThe game itself has multiple modes, as noted. There are a series of time trials, which are intended to teach the player the patterns of the map and for the player to navigate through a few sets of patterns as fast as possible; the first six for any map are to teach the player the patterns, with a seventh intended to run the player through a full rotation of patterns, and the remaining three intended to run the player through a set of patterns with more ghosts wandering around, making it significantly more difficult. The time limits on these are generally fairly generous, but the player, once they set a top time, will change the maximum time limit on the map to the time they scored.\nThere is a point scoring mode, where the player must navigate a continuous, looping pattern of mazes with an ever increasing number of wandering ghosts spawning in over the course of the map; the goal in this mode is to score as many points as possible within 5 or 10 minutes. In this mode, it behooves the player to continuously maintain power pill status and eat as many ghosts as possible in order to maximize their point total, all while navigating the mazes and advancing the patterns to keep supplying themselves with fresh sets of pills and ghosts to eat.\nFinally, there is a “ghost attack” mode, wherein the player’s only goal is to eat as many ghosts as possible within a single continuous use of a power pill, with ten minutes to do so.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game is actually very attractive; while some of the graphical modes, in particular the retro pixel mode, are a bit harder on the eyes than others, on the whole, the game does a good job of visually representing what is going on.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nThere is very little wrong with this game, but it is very simple; all it has is the very pure gameplay. The game offers little but different maze setups; as a result, it is very likely that after playing a couple hours of the game, the player will have seen almost everything it has to offer save a few more variations on pre-existing setups.\nIf it does have a flaw, it is that a player who is unfamiliar with PAC-MAN would be a little bit confused at first. Even still, not knowing the controls, it wouldn’t take very long to pick up.\nStill, such a limited game is not worth very much of your money, and if you get the opportunity to play it for a few hours for free, you will have seen everything there is to see.\n","September 23, 2014","false","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeektheyoshi/recommended/236450/","zeektheyoshi","Zeek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeektheyoshi/","273 products in account","[I've edited my review completely, changing my recommendation.]\n\nThis game.  I've lost countless hours to it on the Xbox 360 version, and when I found out it was coming to PC, I was excited.  I really only ever got my 360 out to play this, and having it on my computer instead would be far more convenient.  Pac-Man CE:DX is the sequel to the first Pac-Man CE, something that, I believe, is still limited to consoles and handhelds.  That game was quite fun, and DX took that and gave it a serious make over, both visually and gameplay wise.\n\nThis game captures the arcade feel of Pac-Man quite well, minus the sense of endlessness.  If you’ve missed the Pac-Man boat until now, you play as a yellow circle that eats dots and avoids ghosts in a maze.  Why?  That’s a good question.  But, all of that aside, DX is comprised of a couple maze types, all of which have differing qualities that set them apart.  For instance, one called "Spiral" features designs that mimic a spiraling shape, and has you constantly looping around.  "Junction," as you may expect, has a variety of entrance and exit points that allow you to traverse all across the screen in a matter of seconds.  The big draw of the CE series of Pac-Man, is that once you clear a side of a maze (it's divided in half), a fruit will appear. Once eaten, the other side of the maze morphs into something else.  This goes on and on until time is up.  What DX does that the original CE didn't, is that there's now a train of ghosts that follows you around until you gobble them up.  There are ghosts scattered around the maze, sleeping, and they wake up and join the ghost train once Pac-Man passes.  There are also bombs that reset all the active ghosts on screen to the ghost pen in case you get yourself stuck.  Lastly, some ghosts will be carrying bombs or power pellets, so that when Pac-Man is able to eat them, he’ll collect that power-up.\n\nSo, basically, the gameplay is: eat a bunch of dots, gather some ghosts to follow you, get a power pellet and go to town.  The maze patterns eventually repeat, and this goes on until time runs out.\nThere’s a few different gameplay modes, with the big two being 5-minute and 10-minute runs.  These two modes are what you’ll be coming back to, and they are the core gameplay of doing what I’ve already described in the time limit.  The other modes are:\n*Ghost Combo: Eat a power pellet, and consistently eat ghosts for as long as possible.\n*Time Trial: Complete the course as fast as possible\n*Darkness: Complete the maze when only the dots light up the walls; everything is hard to see\n*Free Play: Do what you want in the maze without a time limit\n\nThe visual style of this game is fantastic, and is something my friends frequently joke about being something that would be wonderful to watch while under the influence of something.  Namco-Bandai kept the charm of the original game, and then smashed in some dubstep and trippy visuals.  You can also select different visual styles of Pac-Man (from the iconic arcade type, to the design seen in Pac-Mania) and colors for the maze.  Overall, they WILL NOT detract you from the game going on, but people watching may get a bit hypnotized.  (I will note that there are a few visual styles that make things a bit more difficult, but you’ll find what works best on your own.)\n\nThe music is hit or miss for me.  Some tracks stand out, others are boring.  The annoying thing about the music in general, however, is that as time runs out, the music reaches a quickened pace to mirror the dread of "you're almost out of time, better hurry up and get that last bonus."  If you're like me, this can easily put you on edge and screw up where you normally don't.  I usually just keep the music off and listen to something a little more slow and/or peaceful (it's helped me numerous times when I tried to beat my high scores).\n\nYou can breeze through most of the mazes in an hour or two, and you’ll be coming back for more to beat high scores and get on the leaderboards.  It’s important to note that you are paying for a game that you’ll play the same couple levels over and over again, aiming for a high score.  So, if that doesn’t sound like something you’d like, then I’d say not to bother with this game.  But, if you like arcade games, then this is absolutely perfect.\nHowever, there are a few small (or big?) issues with this port:\nThis game suffers from random frame rate drops very frequently during normal play.  On consoles, this is unseen.  I don’t know why this happens, and it isn’t just my computer.  It can happen when there isn’t much going on screen, and also can happen when the screen is filled with activity.  This has been reported in the Steam community for this game, and I have a couple friends who have purchased this version of the game and they also experience random FPS drops.  Being that I already own this on the Xbox 360, I’d much rather play that version of it, since I know it’ll stay constant.\nThe other issue I’ve found is that the textures in the game are definitely not as crisp as those on the console counterpart.  There are artifacts in the images (the “READY?” message before each game is where it is highly noticeable).  Why this is, I have no idea.  Apparently, at one point, this game was more mod-friendly, allowing file replacement for different sprites and textures in the game.  However, now, the game is grouped into one large file that you can’t edit.  I’d imagine this might have been fixable, but, I have no idea.\nThe biggest problem, however, is the frame rate issue, since that has tripped me up a few times while playing, and I don’t understand why it’s even happening.  Other people have experienced this, and you probably will to during playing.  This game requires quick reflexes, and if the game drops a few frames during those times, it can make you run into a ghost when you meant to turn.\n\n\nDespite all of that, the game isn’t bad on the PC.  If you don’t have a 360 or a PS3, this does get the job done.  However, if you have an easily accessible 360 or a PS3, I’d recommend getting it on there instead of Steam, since the game doesn’t have any issues (and the leaderboards are far more populated).","January 2, 2014","true","13.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Grab all the dots on one side of the screen, grab a powerup, and that cleared side gets refreshed with a new maze. Each maze has sleeping ghosts you can avoid, or run by them to make an aggro chain of thousands of points. Losing isn't really a thing, as when you almost hit a ghost, the game does slow-mo to let you get out, or use Bombs to wipe ALL the awake ghosts. Of course, when they come back out of the spawn, they can very well cut you off and force you to spend another bomb to reroute the ghost train. It's not very engaging, too focused on flashy visuals and connecting to Facebook. The visuals are surprisingly strong (and annoying) for what is a more-casual Pac-Man. Yes, it gets fast, but the penalties don't exist when you can bomb or give up a life to slow the pace down, or just abuse slow-mo.\n\nI saw about all there is to the game in under 2 hours. Even at 66% off, it still seems high. Yes, there are many maps, but it's the same idea and just too simple to make me return to the game. There is no infinite play or anything like the original, there is no intelligent AI, and the mazes repeat their patterns noticably in just 5 minutes. It takes no time to learn, and just doesn't compel me to master it.","September 28, 2014","false","1.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

There is no variety in this game and it has very flawed AI. In some levels it is impossible to get an "A" rank because of the way the ghosts move. The ghosts normally trail behind pacman, but in the level "spiral" there are atleast 2 or 3 ghosts that move in random patterns. These ghosts often force you to stray from the path, making it very difficult to clear the pellets on either side of the board.","February 2, 2014","false","18.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

SO much flashing, obstructed views from pointless text overlays just obscure your view, and distract the player. Die from your blocked view, lose track of your Pacman character after re-spawning,  because of the intrusive flashing effects, charcter trail overlays,etc. The menus and interface are constantly seeking confirmations to exit to the LAST menu instead of leaving this f***ing game.You can't even play Pacman with Pacman graphics-you have to play these cheesey mazes to earn the genuine pacman graphics ( but not an original Pacman or Miss Pacman game ) !\nIn the speed trials, if you succeed in setting new record time, it sets the next level at YOUR record time, but at the normal speed, making the next time period to complete  impossible - you are just stuck at that time limitation, without the necessary speed to accomplish the task !\nI just quit in frustration now. Why do they even call it Pacman ? I've wasted too much money on stupid games from Steam. I play less a quarter of them because the interfaces, scrolling, or restricted view of your game field. Pacman DX is just another exercise in Steam frustration. I'd like a refund for this, Company Of Heroes, Chains, Day Of Defeat, Fallout New Vegas, Far Cry 3 ( glorifying drug running), and I'd like to simply remove Tropico3 about running a communist country (a gift) from my games list. Pacman DX? THREE thumbs down ( and I only have 2 thumbs).","September 29, 2014","false","28.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
