"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/9310/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","Dawn of War continues its epic conquest with Winter Assault. Fixing most of the unbalances of the original. Winter Assault even brings an additional kick by adding the Imperial Guard (my favorite team).\n\nStory:\nThe campaign offers two stories, the Forces of Order and the Campaign of Disorder. The Forces of Order has five missions and that switches between the Eldar and Imperial Guard. Unlike your traditional strategy campaign both the campaigns allow you to manipulate the story. On the fourth mission you can change the campaign by deciding which team makes it too the end. This is similar for the Campaign of Disorder, where you play as the Orcs and Chaos Marines. The campaign is rather fun and delves into the issue of the fallen Imperator Class Imperial Titan. If you played 40,000k Space Marine you know have seen the Titan before and that it is known as a ultimate weapon. Each team has a different objective, but they all revolve around getting to the same final location. Interestingly, there are four endings there is one “correct” ending which the story picks up and continues with in Dark Crusade (do not read the next secion if you do not want any clues to the games campaign) the Eldar Ending. In the next game "Dark Crusade" the story continues where the Eldar left off, this is not obvious but notable from how the games dynamic is set up in the strategic map campaign.\n\nAdditions:\nThe new team is the Imperial Guard. If you are unfamiliar with the series they essentially represent, in my opinion, a futuristic style army based around communist Russia. The army is initially based on sheer numbers and they even have units which execute soldiers in order to scare other units and make them hold the line. The game shows the Imperial Guardsmen surrounded by snow, which as we know is a strong environmental factor in Russia. Thus this team to me is like playing as the Russians. Similar to the orcs they fight in numbers, but unlike the orcs the strategies for the Imperial Guard early in the game lies in pairing up squads appropriately with commander units and working with your hero squad. While later the Imperial guard shift and play like other teams by using a few strong unit squads rather than keeping the weaker Imperial Guardsmen.\n\nMultiplayer:\nIf you want to play online with friends I would recommend getting Dawn of War: Dark Crusade instead. As Dark Crusade fixes most of the glitches and unbalances of Dawn of War Winter Assault. These are not really game-breaking, but can be noticeable. Plus Dark Crusade offers the benefit of adding two new teams. One of which is featured in the Winter Assault campaign.\n\nIf you haven’t played the first Dawn of War then skip the next section:\nMy major gripe about this game is that the story of Gabriel Angelos is not continued. Luckily for all those wondering the story of Gabriel Angelos and the reviving the Daemon of Khorne is covered in Dawn of War II: Retribution.\n\nResults:\nI loved this game and all the installments so much I repurchased them all on steam. Despite that I still have all the discs, in functional condition, right next to me. Although it looks like there are more Pros than Cons this game is a good game, and definitely a worthy installment to the epic Dawn of War saga.\n\nPros:\n+More balanced than the first game\n+Campaign introduces new elements to the story by allowing you to choose the ending.\n+A whole new team (the Imperial Guard)\n+Missions are rather interesting and the campaign is not too long.\n+Economic, Base building, and macro unit management\n+Fantastic story and campaign (which is very rare in a strategy game)\n+Amazing teams which each play completely differently.\n+Fast paced gameplay which requires expansion to acquire resource nodes (but those nodes do not run out like in most games)\n+Unit customization allows you to create squads for specific tasks\n+Fantastic computer AI that puts you to your wits\n\nCons:\n-My game glitched after the third mission of the Campaign of Disorder where I could not load any of my saves (I tried validating the files and it replaced the lost files yet still I could not load any of my saves. Then I tried to reinstall the game, but still to no avail).\n-The third mission for the Campaign of Disorder is rather cumbersome as you have to retrieve Imperial Guardsmen from one side of the map to the other. This would be fine if there was something along the way to keep you occupied, but reality is by the time you've got to this step the map is already baron as you killed everything else.\n-The game can still not be played with a second monitor. If you have two monitors and you move the cursor to the edge of your monitor that is adjacent to your extended monitor then the cursor leaves the game and causes it to minimize. It’s as if the game is permanently in windowed mode.\n-The movement AI can be annoying causing units to spread out rather than clump together. This is fine expect when you want to ambush an enemy and one unit gets too close because it decided to go too far from the rest of the group.","March 1, 2014","true","12.9"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","42","46","0","0"

A World Class Titan was found buried in the ice and the armies of men and horrors of Chaos scramble to get their hands on it. The stage is set for the Winter Assault of Lorn V.\n\nThe first expansion of the first Dawn of War adds the Imperial Guardsmen as a playable faction. The Guard sets itself apart with massive disposable numbers and cheap buildings, set off against strong armour units and many special leader units. It is a special mix that requires a new and vastly different approach to master.\n\nThe expansion comes with two seperate campaigns. One where you play as the forces of Order, to protect the planet and to keep the titan from falling in the hands of Chaos. While on the other side you can play as the Orcs and forces of Chaos to claim this weapon to rule the universe. The campaigns are entertaining and change up the formula just enough to keep the interesting, but it does suffer from occasional jumps in difficulty that can ruin your fun severely.\n\nAs with the original, the expansive multiplayer mode is still in place with all the modes availible to whoever seeks to indulge him/herself in this field, but with Dark Crusade and Soulstorm widely availible it seems futile to linger in this slightly dated expansion. Still, the campaign merits a run, if just for the hilarious antics of Orcs and Chaos.","January 4, 2014","true","9.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The task proves much more difficult than it sounds, as war-loving orks and blood-thirsty forces of chaos stand in the way.  For the first time in its day, Winter Assault allows the player to choose between two separate campaigns, where they choose to play as the forces of order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or the forces of disorder (Chaos and Orks).  Unlike most games where alliances remain permanent however, players can (or should I say, are forced to) determine which of these sides ultimately win because in Warhammer 40K there is no peace, there is only war.  Unlike the first game in Dawn of War I, there are multiple endings (4 actually) that depend on the player's choices.  Great for adding a bit of replay value, and while the story isn't spectacular, it's not bad by any means.  Score: 4/5\n\n-Gameplay:  Nothing much has changed between Dawn of War and Winter Assault, save for the addition of new maps and a new faction in its entirety:  The Imperial Guard.  While the Imperial Guard had some units featured in the first game's campaign, Winter Assault focuses greatly adds upon them by granting the Imperial Guard faction a vast increase in infantry units and artillery, with the most noteable addition being the powerful, bullet-soaking brick of a tank called the Baneblade.  The fact that the Imperial Guard infantry can travel between their buildings adds for some new tactics, combined with their additional units all help flesh out the faction.  Despite its focus on the IG, none of the other factions are completely left out, as they each gain additional units, some with new abilities to mix things up a bit.  It might not seem like a lot of additions, but for the casual and dedicated WH40K fan it's enough to keep things interesting.  Score: 4/5\n\n-Graphics:  Because Winter Assault and Dawn of War were built from the same engine, not much has been done with graphical improvements.  This isn't a bad thing however, as consistency is something to expect in any expansion pack or DLC.  The frigid atmosphere of Lorne V further adds to the sense of bleakness that the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40K is known for, as it creates the impression that even the weather is out to kill you.  The ice and snow also creates an interesting contrast to draw more attention to the scorch marks, blood stains, and general scenes of death and destruction that make WH40K what it is.  So while there might nto be anything new, the old adage "If it isn't broken, don't fix it" works in this case.  Score:  4.25/5\n\n-Sound:  While Winter Assault recycles many of the same tracks and sound effects from Dawn of War, it does add new music and lines.  The masculine choir added to the orchestral soundtrack fits both the mood of the Imperial Guard and the frozen environment they're in, and some of the lines delivered by the commanders of each faction are pretty memorable.   Much like the situation with the graphics, there wasn't a lot added to the sound aspect of the game, but what was added works very well.  Score:  4.25/5\n\n-Replayability:  As said earlier, the fact that Winter Assault features two campaigns with a total of four different possible endings adds to the replay value of this game.  The maps from the original Dawn of War are also included in the multiplayer aspect of the game, and the Imperial Guard faction offers a new challenge for those looking to try a different faction in multiplayer.  While Winter Assault's multiplayer might have seen some form of population back in its heyday, online matches are practically unheard of save for games between friends.  Still, the amount of replayability for this game in comparison to is predecessor is an improvement, albeit a marginal one.  Score:  3.75/5\n\n-Overall:  Winter Assault is a worthy continuation of the Dawn of War games with some worthwhile new content.  With subtle changes to the game's mechanics and more than one campaign, Relic Entertainment adds enough to satisfy most fans while avoiding any major changes.  Those expecting a massive amount of additions will be somewhat underwhelmed, but not disappointed.  Overall, I'd recommend getting this game during a sale if you need something to pass the time, it's worth it.  Overall Score: 20.25/25 or  81%","April 15","true","12.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It adds some unique experiences and mechanics to the gameplay and forces players to try out the different armies available, adding some variety to the single-player campaign. The massive difficulty spikes add some excitement and challenge to the experience, but some frustration as well. Unfortunately, even though the total number of missions across the two campaigns is the same as it was in the original Dawn of War, Winter Assault's single-player game feels short by comparison. All in all, I didn't love it, but I still had fun and it was still worth playing.\n\nRead the Full review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/01/20/dawn-of-war-winter-assault-review/","January 20","true","13.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And this is a good thing because the campaign is better than ever with multiple choices and you get to play as both order/disorder fighting for a powerful artifact throughout the story.\n\nMuch of the game is still the same as the original except you'll be getting used to the mob tactics backed up by powerful armour of the Imperial Guard along with all their secondary commanders such as commissars, priests and psykers all with a unique ability that help all the small meatshield soldiers push through almost any obstacle. Personally my most favourite faction to play as out the rest and all their units are very well voice acted.\n\nIf you're wanting to get this game to play as the Imperial Guard or other factions though to test out their new units, move along and grab Dark Crusade or Soulstorm instead. This game does bring in a few new things but nothing to really jump out the chair for but if you love the games for their campaign then this is worth the money.","June 1, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kinda basic, but it's the gameplay that sucks you in, and the Ork dialogue is absolutely classic and hilarious. Bottom line, good for a full playthrough, but overall it's an addition on top of an already great game.

I got most of the way through the Order campaign, and the second-to-last level is just asinine. You actually get a choice of which faction to side with--which changes the objective significantly--but both options are terrible. Stick with your lovable, underdog human scamps, and you are rewarded with an escort mission through hell. You get a toolbag space marine commander who whines about how it is taking you too long to slaughter an entire Ork army with your dozen or so militia guys, and the fighting is just incessant.\n\nAfter failing a half dozen times because the onslaught provided no breaks, I opted to try and see what my unfriendly neighborhood aliens were up to. On a funny note, the PC controlled faction of my beloved guardsmen were wiped out equally as fast as I was, so I felt a little better about that. Anyway, this was the first time I spent significant time with the aliens, and while they look cool and have fancy weapons, it feels like I would be better off throwing urine-soaked snowballs at the endless legions. As a bonus, the enemy would just roll through my guys (who had such pathetic firepower they could not even stop 1 enemy as they passed by) to directly attack my base.\n\nI suffered through about an hour of that. I built up a pretty large nerf-wielding army, and relocated my base twice (as instructed), only to be hit nonstop bombardment on one side, and a somehow endless-er army on the other. I probably could have pushed through it to win at some point, but what's the point?\n\nI get it, war is hell. It's relentless, it's unforgiving, and you're not supposed to enjoy it.\n\nAll things I specifically do not look for in a game. Again, I am sure I could have slogged through it eventually, but why bother? Maybe some people find ridiculously unfair fights to be fun, but I'll pass on that.","September 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","12","25","4","0"

The standard 1v1 games that would result in a mass infantry battle in classic to more of a tech game in wa which allow more use/variety of all units choices at use and wa made the change to anti vehicle unit type haveing the own individual counter example(horrors/fire dragons) makeing life alot simpler but giveing the unit type a individual role. Imperial guard were a good adition to the game whcih added much to the game adding new units/building and style of play giveing a player that like to turtle or play defenceive and liked to use vehicles a race to play.The AI current on steam  was  was quite challengeing on insane it does cheat but knows how to change its unit choices and  always keeps the same eco always and haveing more troops then i did so it gave me a challenge in learning to be able to beat it if i what'd to play something more fair i could always just lower the difficulty. As it quite difficult/expensive/complicated to build an advanced ai that can do many example builds/tactic/micro was not bad in my oppinion.My only drawbacks was with the campaign did not tie into the classic campaign as i would have liked it left my questions unanswered and was not as fun. it need to be worked on more still for its time when this game was realeased it was decent but its not something i what to play over and over again as it was not that interesting. More maps is always good adding some more stratigic map and colourful maps with more objects so they do look quite interesting and change up the game a  bit.\n\n-multiplayer i give 7/10 i could have spent more time on it if there were players.\n-single player a average 5/10 not as great as the predecessor.","April 20","true","100.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However the campaign is awful. It's only five missions long. You can play as Order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Disorder (Orcs and Chaos).\n\nOrder campaign has a bunch of sections where you control an Imperial Guard base. I personally hate Imperial Guard. They seem really underpowered and weak. And the Eldar parts are basically hero missions.\n\nDisorder campaign has a really annoying 3rd mission.\n\nBoth campaigns are essentially the same story/content wise with only some differences which I mentioned. Both sides have a really confusing 4th mission where you have to switch back and forth between the two races. The transition is very choppy and annoying.","April 10, 2015","false","8.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","2"

Bad.\n\nWhile the multiplayer aspect of this game is pretty much the same as in any other Dawn of War game (except this add-on appears to be the first to have allowed you to play as the Imperial Guard, which is a nice, though not entirely well done addition) the single player campaigns (there are 2, each of which have 2 different endings depending on which individual faction you decide you support the most) are not well done at all. The single player campaigns do not play much like normal skirmish matches but instead require you to complete very specific objectives. This would be all well and good were it not for the fact that, (at least in the good-guy's "Order" campaign I tried to play) the campaign (and your units) are hampered by bugs and design mistakes which make the whole experience enormously frustrating. Too frustrating for me to want to complete anyhow, not when there are so many other, clearly better games out there.\n\nGood things:\n+There are 2 single player campaigns, each of which feature 2 factions resulting in a grand total of 4 possible endings.\n\nMiddling things:\n+/-You can play as the Imperial Guard (but you can also do that more effectively in the Dark Crusade add-on). The numbers of imperial guard units which you control is still not numerous enough to be canonical. The battles still don't feel extremely epic (despite the nice ambient battle sounds in some missions). In the overarching context of Warhammer 40k seems very, very strange to be able to simply teleport in replacement imperial guardsmen as squads become depleted (and this also feels strange for most other factions as well). Why not just teleport everyone who's available all at once and flood the battlefield with soldiers like the Imperial Guard would actually want to do?\n+/- Which ending you get apparently depends on a particular choice you make toward the end of teach campaign and which campaign you chose from the outset.\n+/- The graphics, sound and music quality are, for the most part, the same quality as in the original Dawn of War Game.\n\nBad Things:\n-You usually have to build up the numbers of your force during the course of each battle. This is yet another game which resorts to the tired and true (and completely unrealistic) Command and Conquer styled game mechanic of getting buildings, building the force and attacking with what you've built. I'm honestly getting truly sick of seeing this completely unrealistic game mechanic. All RTS games do not need to be this way but most of them are exactly this way and usually implement it in a manner which makes little sense (as we see here in Winter Assault). If the imperial Guard is really so massive they should be able to bring their own pre-built tanks and such along with them (etc.) and they should have already landed a whole bunch of them during the initial planetary invasion (and the same is true for most other factions) Only the Eldar and the Necrons, perhaps, should be using the "build-your-army" mechanic that all factions must use in these games, and even then that side of things should be handled automatically for the most part.\n-Units will automatically engage enemy units whenever they are in range. Once engaged units will absolutely refuse to retreat or tactically withdraw even if they are engaged against a clearly stronger force. Given the manner in which the main campaign missions of winter Assault are setup, where you continually have fewer forces than your enemies, this (bug? oversight? design error?) problem causes the game to become severely (and needlessly) frustrating. The elite units of the Eldar should be disciplined enough to withdraw when ordered. The non-elite Imperial Guard units should actively run away from such confrontations (unless a commissar is present) but your imperial Guard (being the elite Cadians I guess) will never, ever run away even when they clearly should do so and (unlike the cadians) will ignore any orders to do so. This frustrating problem effectively breaks the game for me, particularly when there are so many other, better games out there to play.\n-The space marines still look cute and cuddly.","March 16","false","4.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Relic has resolved the issue - I have not tested this myself but it appears to have worked for the community. As such, the new review reflects this change.\n\nWon't speak for multiplayer because I don't play it, but it does appear to work now. Game will be easy or hard depending on your skill level and the faction you play against. Here's why -\n\nCombat boils down to two different kinds - melee and ranged. Most factions will in general prefer one over the other, the exception being the Space Marines who are Jacks-of-all-trades. As such, if one faction prefers one kind they will naturally be weak at another. For example, I prefer the Imperial Guard, who use ranged units almost exclusively. As such, if I can't keep, say, the Orcs at a distance, my men in their weak armor will get chewed up and spat out. If I can hold them back however, the enemy will find themselves unable to survive the continual barrage of artillery, autocannon fire, lascannon volleys, and tank shells :D the key, for the IG, is to keep them away. It works differently for each faction. Know your strengths and weaknesses and the day can be yours!\n\nCampaign is also great - it's seen as one of the best in the series too. If you're new to Warhammer entirely, you might like the first Dawn of War's campaign better - it introduces a number of the races to you quite nicely and the story is fully of mystery for the first half. If you're not new to the 40k universe, then you'll probably find Winter Assault's campaign the most gratifying.\n\n40,000/10 would pit a supertank against a Squigoth again","August 11, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story mode is split into 2 main segments, one focusing on the Imperial Guard and Eldar, the other being focused on the Orks and Chaos. The second to last missions have two endings each. Depending on what faction is used to win the second to last mission sets who is going to be used for the last mission (This can be altered by loading up the second to last missions and using the other factions. The missions are quite long and sometimes require the use of many different tactics to complete. The last mission itself is enjoyable for another reason that I will not spoil.\n\nThis expansion added a few new units to the game outside of the Imperial guard e.g. Chaplains for the Space Marines.\nAnd of course there is the new faction, the Imperial Guard. The IG are weak as infantry, requiring large amounts to be effective, but do have the balancing of their forces by having a very strong set of vehicles. They utilise the Basilisk (the only real long range unit in the game), The Leman Russ (A fairly strong main battle tank) and a few others. All of the units in the Imperial Guard are completely overshadowed by its magnum opus, the Baneblade. The Baneblade is the most powerful unit in the entire game with its ridiculously high health and major firepower. The Baneblade is the only unit that can easily go toe-to-toe with an entire army, take out there base and then return home without taking too much damage.\n\nAlthough all the units are available in the later expansion (that do not require the original game or any other expansions, I would recommend buying this expansion aswell, even if it is just for the story mode.","May 30","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
