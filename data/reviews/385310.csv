The visuals are very nice, and create an intriguing and whimsical world.\n\nGameplay:  In each chapter, you have to explore the level and read the page of a book to find hints and discover how to progress. The enigmas, so far, are well done. I wrote some notes on paper to solve one of them and to find the solution was really satisfying.  You also have to move the characters to accomplish certain tasks. The two children always move together, at a different speed. The girl moves faster, but if you press shift, this is the boy who becomes faster. That takes a little patience to control them, particularly in the first chapter where they must walk on a long curvy path, but once we are used to the controls, that's o.k.\n\nI look forward to discover more about this world. At this moment, there are three chapters, with more to come.","October 28, 2015","true","7.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","23","25","2","0"

The story is still being developed but the premise is awesome.  My favorite part about it is how dark and immersive it is.  The music is very well made and adds the the atmosphere.  It is very scary and creepy.  The games feels like it was made by Tim Burton himself.  I am very pleased of the quality and dedication that has gone out to making this game.  You guys should definitely try it out!  It is like if Tim Burton made Flappy Birds based on the Never Ending Story.  Super hard and super addicting!

You seem to be guiding some devil girl and if you step off the path, you turn to stone.  I haven't figured it out yet but seems interesting.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A WORK OF ART!!!\n\nThe design style of this game is colorful and playful.  The developers put a lot of thought into this.\n\nI won this game in a contest from a Steam group, but if I heard of it before, I would have paid money.  I'm snuggled on the loveseat right now and am playing my way through!","December 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

The Land of Lamia!\n\nThis is a very intriguing little game and I enjoyed it. Each chapter is filled with a complex puzzle which indeed makes you use your brain bucket. I have to admit that there were two of the chapters I was banging my head against my keyboard due to the difficulty, or so I thought. After reviewing the actual puzzle and my gameplay (I'm a YouTuber for those of you reading this) and came to find it was due to my over thinking thought process. The developer has done an amazing job with the well thought out layout of each chapter and not to mention the mechanics. The mechanics may not be brand new to the gaming world but the way he has implemented into the game is fantastic. The mechanics themselves makes you think of how to solve a puzzle within a puzzle...marinate on that. Controls and camera views can be wonky at times but not enough to turn away from the game. You want a challenge? You want to have good content for a little game? Good, you're in the right place.\n\nInterested in my gameplay of the first chapter? Enjoy! Remeber if you like, like. If you dig what I do and enjoy my videos please, subscribe. If not, thanks for stopping by I appreciate it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsxN95mLbo8","November 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","11","16","4","0"

Especially in the first level where if you go off the path you die because all you end up doing is constantly switching between using shift and not using shift and combine that with some slow camera movements and lots of turning and it is just infuriating.\n\nMoving the two characters at the same time is fine but having them move at different speeds does not help at all or offer up unique challenges.\n\nThe game is visually nice and when there was sound it was good. The puzzles could be better if you could move a bit quicker as the game moves very slowly at times. Overall I see potential in the game, it definanlty has a good base to build from.\n","July 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

It's not a typical indie game but not main stream either; It's definitely a good change from all the games that are fast paced. The characters were difficult to control at first but becomes second nature after a short period of time.\n\nThe art style is unique and the music sets a mysterious mood. I personally enjoyed the atmosphere of the environment and I would recommend this game to someone who's looking for a new direction in a game. Keep in mind to be open-minded about what to expect. It's a short 3 level game; the developer has a lot of visuals to offer that makes you wonder what exactly are these two heroes up against albeit lacking in description (which adds up to more mystery). I personally believe this is more of a teaser than what the developer has to offer in the later stages. I'm utterly curious as to know what Lily and Thomas has installed for them!","November 27, 2015","true","6.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"
