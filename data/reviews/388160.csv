Still, even with such dull visuals (pre-made assets?), crude architecture and generic music it could entertain a little if not for the slow and choppy movement, occasionate crashes, sticking to walls at every corner - the legacy of RPG-maker engine..\n\nЛюбительская стрелялка с независимым выбором направлений движения и стрельбы, с медленным темпом стрельбы и надоедливой генерацией врагов в реальном времени. Все же, несмотря на унылый вид (заготовки из наборов?), грубую архитектуру и никакую музыку, могла бы развлечь немного, если бы не вылеты, замедленное и дерганое движение, застревания при сближении со стенами на каждом углу - все наследие движка "РПГ-создатель".","October 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","3"

Not fun.\n\nWhen you are on the menu screen you will be prompted to choose your language then go through 3 screens where each time you press space to continue and the screen slowly fades to black while you are forced to wait.\n\nThe game itself is a simple maze game with enemies that follow you around and when they touch you your health is drained in a continuous fashion as long as you are touching the enemy. The oblong collision boxes despite things not looking oblong will mean you get stuck on corners a lot and die.\n\nWhen you die you have to press y or n to restart and if you choose n then you go back to the main screen and have to choose your language again.\n\nI REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS TRASH.","August 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","16","24","3","2"

No spoken text. In fact, not much of any text at all except for the intro.\n\nCons: Starting screens are slow. They contain intro and basic game info, and fade out very, very slowly after pressing space.\nControls are lacking. Arrow keys to go in all 8 directions (including diagonal, by pressing two keys at the same time). If you get near the edges you can get stuck a lot. The corners and the gap between large trees are the worst.\nEnemies spawn on top of you. You just killed a ghost? Here, have another one spawned right next to you!\nBattle mechanic is flaky. To shoot you have to use the arrow keys and space together. You can’t shoot if you’re standing still. Shooting diagonally is flaky. Shooting sometimes won’t even respond.\nYou’ll die a lot. Get stuck on the edges? Ghosts and skeletons all swarm to you? That’s a scenario you’ll get familiar with real fast in this game. The moment the mobs ‘touch’ you is the moment you lose health. And if you’re stuck, gee, guess you can’t untouch them anytime soon! Do you wish to continue? (Y)es or (N)o restart the game.\nIf you’re just standing still you’ll live. Go AFK, and return to see all the mobs swarming around you, not harming you but still attracted to your location. They’re like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park; ‘Don’t move! He can’t see us if we don’t move.’\nGraphics seem ganked from the basic RPGmaker games. Nothing special or distinguishing about it. Not a problem if it’s a good game. This is not a good game.\nPros: What the hell should I say? Desperately trying to find some positive thing about this game. I’ll just go play pacman instead.\nConclusion:Terrible, terrible game. It’s simply not enjoyable with those flaky controls and mechanics. Just avoid. You could give it a try when it’s on sale, but it’s not worth any money.","August 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","8","13","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heikkito/recommended/388160/","heikkito","Nax_o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heikkito/","1467 products in account","Edit: game received an update and is playable now. No insta-death on enemy spawns, Firing works and is accurate with the mouse. this allows proper crowd control which is essential once the introductory above ground levels are over. Lots of other bugs fixed and more to come. As i see now there are no game killer bugs anymore but more polish is needed as the game is quite crude. All in all it is now a recommendable buy - as long as the buyer understands this is a true indie/niche product clearly aimed at people who like games like Druid used to be.\n\n\nOriginal review:\nDruid 1 & 2 on C-64 warped my fragile little mind many decades ago so when i first saw this i wanted to give it a try immediately. Time to re-open the scars i got then.\n\nBut alas. Game is not quite there yet. Not as a stand alone game - or compared to the obvious Druid games that have been the inspiration.\n\nThere are just so many glitches. Stand and fire? Not working if a enemy death animation frame was just in front of the player. It's now a invisible wall until you move a small distance. Most common way to die? enemies spawn on you. Not a very good thing for a crowd control/maze game. Combine that with the invisible frames that prevent firing until you move enough and things get tricky in Dungeons of despair or even earlier. Ghosts spawn in the corner of the game screen. I get damage from something but it doesnt kill me. Right. probably the ghost in the corner.\nSounds? none. Music warps (hopefully not intentionally?) like there is too much echo effect and bass. OST is ok i'd say but glitches make it terrible sometimes.\n\nAnd then basically there is no game gimmicks like in D1 and D2 where the goal was to manage your ammo inventory and crowd control along with exploration. Now there is hard crowd control w/glitches and no other strategy other than knowing in which chest the key is.\n\nSo at this point i'll give this thumbs down until it gets more flesh. Too raw deal now to spend money on. Yet.","August 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","4"
