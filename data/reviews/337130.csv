Given the fact that I frequented a lot adventure games sites, I naturally was drawn by the Carol Reed series (which was at the 5th game I think). I've immediately liked the quality of the photos and the concept of being a foreigner in Sweden.\n\nUnfortunately, back then, I couldn't order MDNA games. And with my life evolving, I"ve kinda forgotten about them. I knew about Bosh's Damnation after adding the profile on Neoseeker last year but still, I didn't order anything. I don't remember if I saw it going through Greenlight. But when I saw the title in the upcoming list, it was wishlisted. And when I saw the release, I didn't hesitate to spent money for it.\n\nSo in other words, what's a Carol Reed game? It's a game about a young woman, loving Sweden and solving cases around like a private investigator. This time, a cleaner called her about the disappearance of his employers. Carol began to investigate until the family is giving a sign of life. Carol forgot about it... but in the summer, is brought back into the family's business as the daughter's boyfriend is found dead at a barn and the murder isn't from yesterday. Guess who will snoop around?\n\nIt's a point and click game, you find objects, you use them, you solve puzzles thanks to clues and you speak with people. The game is done with real life pictures and real people. There is no video inside but you can see differences in the pictures: people are making differents expressions, if you open a door, you'll see it open.\n\nIt could be a walking simulator as you're walking from scene to scene without having to search something and each close-up doesn't bring everytime a clue or an object, just a nice view... and the fact that in real life, you would have looked at that. In other words, Bosh's Damnation, which is the 10th game in the series, is trying to stick to reality.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite good, the mystery is well done too and the voice actors are also good. But the quality of the pictures and the beauty of some are also the strongest points for the game.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Even the hint system is quite interesting.\n\nI recommend it, mainly for those who love solving mysteries.","July 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","28","31","3","0"

While the photo-based graphics are immersive, the large world could have been utilized better with more interaction points (there were suprisingly few for a rendered world that large). I do not know a lot of Swedish history, so several of the museum locales were interesting (mannequins?!) but I could only interact with things in 1-2 rooms out of 6 (seriously there were whole rooms with nothing to do in them). The puzzles in these locales weren't related to any of the objects in the rooms, aside from a random abacus and Bosch painting, so could have been done anywhere. It would have been nice to have the puzzles better utilize these locations (maybe I could have learned something). Would recommend in the under $6 range.","November 10, 2015","false","3.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
