With that being said, OMDU being FTP really concerned me.  Most FTP is poorly implemented and done in a way that punishes the player if they don't dish out several games worth of money into them to make progress.  And based on what I was hearing, it sounded like OMDU was going down that exact path.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like it really was.\n\nOMDU plays better than ever.  The gameplay is great, the new roster of characters is a nice change of pace, and the new abilities and traps are a welcomed addition.  I am already addicted to the gameplay and would love to keep playing.  But, the problem is, is that most players will never experience 1/3rd of what this game has to offer due to the INCREDIBLE cost of literally everything in this game.  Want a new trap?  Better hope you have either a padded wallet or 30 hours of grinding on your hand.  A new character?  Well that costs even more, better pick which arm and leg you want to give up.  The costs are absolutely astronomical and brutally punishing.\n\nWhich is incredibly disappointing actually, because all of the charm from OMD was leveling up, getting new traps, getting new gear, getting new weapons, upgrading it all and trying to find that PERFECT setup for each specific level.  But with OMDU, it's just "This is what you have, grind match after match after match and MAYBE, JUST MAYBE after a couple days you can get the base variant for a single new trap if you're lucky."\n\nIt's such a flipping shame, because I would've gladly paid full price for this game and enjoyed the living heck out of it had they not gone the FTP route.  But now, I am honestly questioning whether or not I will continue on with this game knowing that I either have to shovel truckloads of money into it to make any progress or grind for weeks and weeks and weeks just to get a decent variety of traps and characters.\n\nHopefully Robot will decrease the insane cost to make progress in this game.  If not, they're likely to lose a longtime dedicated fan.","March 30","false","61.2"," 735 of 905 people (81%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","81","735","905","24","52"

"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.","March 29","false","3.7"," 1,831 of 2,318 people (79%) found this review helpful 332 people found this review funny","79","831","2","332","73"

I agree, it was a poor choice, but giving a great game a bad review because of the publisher is ridiculous.\n\nAlso, many people have complained that this game is a MOBA. That's also ridiculous, because that is ONE game mode. Survival is the classic tower defense that we all know and love from OMD and OMD2, except that we have the option of playing it with a larger party if we wish (the level will scale in difficulty based on party size). Also, the MOBA-ish game mode that is Siege just happens to feel like a natural next step for the game. "Hmm, I wonder what it would be like to be on the other side of this, trying to get MY minions INTO an enemy rift...?". Well now we know. It's a load of fun! :D\n\nI've also seen the complaint that it's pay to win. How? Consumables that you can also craft and/or get randomly from chests that you sometimes get after a game? I have a load of consumables that I haven't used any of. Sure they can make the game a little easier, or give an edge in a match for a short time, but they're not THAT big of a deal. edit: And you can't even use consumables in PvP.\n\nI love this game, and while it can be somewhat grindy, the materials for unlocking heroes can be easily obtained through daily quests. It may take a couple of weeks to unlock a hero, but that's no different than any other free to play game that I've played.\n\nIf the grind is too much for you, then throw a little money at the game. I have yet to actually pay a dime for this game, but I probably will at some point. These people have families to feed, and that's why they made this game.\n\nI do have minor complaints though. One is that I feel considerably less effective as a hero than I did in OMD and OMD2. The thing is, I understand that we have to be weaker than before, considering that there can be up to 5 people on a team. The other complaint is that if someone leaves or disconnects, your team can be left in a pretty rough spot. I assume they're working on a solution for this, like an AI bot that can take over or something, but that's why games go into beta.\n\nTL;DR: It's free, and fun.\n\n11/10 Would commit orc genocide again.","April 1","true","64.1"," 583 of 732 people (80%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","80","583","732","53","23"

Even worse - it made me hate and despise this game and it's developers.\n\nOrcs Must Die! Unchained got nothing to do with its predecessors. It's based on dated, dying model and made only to earn cash rather than entertain.\n\nI wanted to have fun. I wanted to play co-op and defeat hordes of monsters using traps and skills with my friends. If i wanted to play moba - i would've continued playing Dota 2. Heck - why would i even want to spend a dime on this instead of Overwatch? Why would i want to pay for chests and materials, and health potions, and consumables if i can install any of the dozens of free (or "free") moba's, get better experience, more heroes, more content, less grind and stores which actually contain only cosmetic items, rather than the ones which manipulate you to buy them to avoid grinding and failing?\n\nShame on you Robot Entertainment and shame on anybody who's going to support them.\n\nP.S.\n\nI've played the beta in a separate client so don't pay attention to my play time on Steam.\n\n"wakes up"\n"sees 20 comments"\n"facepalms"\n\nJust to clarify - OMD2 was "very" bugged on release and remained "quite" bugged in the end and i did not praise Overwatch. It's just that i don't see any point of spending my money on bits and pieces when there are plenty of games which are only selling cosmetic items or got a better economy to begin with. Whenever i see something that sells consumables, crafting or upgrade materials and gold - i just shrug and move on.\n\nPerhaps the only exception i made to this "rule" was "world of warships" which has pretty awful grind and despicable economy, prices and store but is actually fun enough to play even without spending money on it.\n\nThat said - i am not discouraging anyone from trying this game. It's free so go and try it for yourself. Perhaps you'll enjoy it or perhaps you'll feel like i did - cheated out of a decent co-op game. It doesn't matter that the game has two modes - you can't separate the economy and grind, and store.","March 29","false","0.2"," 743 of 1,025 people (72%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","72","743","1","24","39"

The developers of this sequel seem to have missed what so many people loved about the first two games - the ability to purchase and upgrade items in order to take on more challenging maps. The item system for OMD and OMD2 was simple, and relatively quick. Not so in this ill conceived chapter of the OMD franchise.\n\nAfter 81 hours I've managed to upgrade two traps to level 2 (of 4 possible levels), and buy 1 hero. The upgrade system is overly complex, and the materials cost of purchasing upgrades is simply absurd. In order to upgrade five traps to level 4 you would be looking at literaly thousands of hours of farming.\n\nSorry Robot Entertainment, I'm not looking to spend 3,000 or 5,000 hours grinding survival matches to upgrade my traps.

So don't look at the playtime here ;)\n\nI'm one of the old alpha player and I have to say that they turned a really nice game into a damn little piece of luck based MOBA ♥♥♥♥.\nFirst of all gameforge and robot couldn't care less about player feedback in the last 2 years.\nSomeone suggested on the forum consumables for skulls because you can't do something with your skulls once you hit max level and have all the cards.  So they come up with consumables for real money. (also for crafting) But this greed is insane. Even if it's just usable in the PvE part.\nI suggested a lot of things during the alpha and mostly BETA game and they ignored most of that stuff. 1 year later they said "WE have a awesome new patch for you. WE thought this is cool."  And I read 95% of the ideas they rejected before... Well they also turned this into crap.\n\nThis is just to give you a idea how they developed "without" the community.\n\nBack to the game and what it is now.  I think that it is "pay 2 win" because money gives you a huge advantage since you can craft a lot of traps and other cards if you buy enough chests for gold (real money)\nWith my Master Founder Pack I have 40k ingame Gold and I bought like 10 chests (600 each) so far. They allowed me to craft a lot of stuff and I also got a lot of good cards from it. This gives you a huge advantage in early pvp matches. Pay 2 win = confirmed.\n(Also gameforge is more expansive than robot entertainment over on the NA Servers. Again a good sign for Greedforge)\n\nGame Pros:\nSurvival Part is in a "okay" place.\n\nCons:\nGameforge, Failforge, crapforge, shitforge, dumbforge, CANCERFORGE\n\nI actually like crafting in survival games but it does not belong to a MOBA. Because this turned it even more into gambling and farming game. And the mats you "can" find are random as well. I can't see a real "crafting" system anyway. Clicking a button called "crafting" does not make it to a crafting system.\n\nQueue times are ridiculous long. Sometimes we are in the queue for 15-30 minutes (with around 5000 player online)\n\nA lot of problems with unbalanced stuff\n\nStill no map editor to come up with new maps. It took them over 2 years to make 3 PvP maps. 1 isn't even in the game anymore.  And  6 PvE maps (4 of them are just parts of the PvP map)\n\nBugs like: Game ends, you can't quite and have to ALT+F4 and you get leaving penalty <<< worth it! And this is known for far over a year now.\n\nA few words of what they removed because of people who complained that the game is way to complex:\nPhysical gates to close and open whenever you want to (Quite some funny tactics)\nLeadership system to for minions and warcamps. That was a awesome thing with a lot of tactics and deep gameplay in it. They also removed that because new player were to dumb to spend this leadership at the gate.\nThey removed different weak and strong points on minions because it was to complex and replaced it with a weird kind of "tag" system.\nWe used to have fire, lightning, Arcane and frost armor. Now we have just "magic armor" because it was to complex.\n\nI think they did most of that because of the console version that's coming up... Console noobs are not used to complex PC games ^^\n\nI keep adding negativ things... don't worry... there are enough ;)","March 30","false","794.5"," 234 of 335 people (70%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","70","234","335","27","16"

The combo system is now much more important to success, and can't spam tar and arrow walls to win like before; you'll be broke and ogres will be trampling over your tiny baby-man corpse. You will have to vary the traps you use and keep in mind the damage properties of the traps (and sometimes even heroes) to maximize funds. The second major change is that rerouting orcs to where you want them to be (and where they really, really don't want to be) is key to success. Barriers will become your friend, and sappers will make you cry tears of blood.\nHere's why it's not Pay to Win.\n\nList of Things That Cannot be Purchased With Real-World Money:\n- Traps\n- Trinkets (called gear in this game, same thing)\n- Guardians (some can be obtained if you buy the packs for the game, but otherwise not for sale)\n- Traits (passive bonuses to your character)\n- Minions (PVP)\n- Bosses (PVP)\n- Materials\n\nList of Things That Can ONLY be Purchased with Money:\n- Skins\n\nConsumables and characters can be bought, but they can also be crafted. However, it is important to note that the materials needed for crafting characters are not found in low level maps and it will take you a while to reach the point where high level enemies spawn to find those drops.\nAnd that's where I think all of the negative press comes from. Almost all of the negative reviews come from people with 4 hours or less of gameplay, so they don't really understand how this game works, they just played it, saw it wasn't OMD2, and downvoted it and started crying about it.\nIt is not P2W, it's very well made, if you like OMD2, you will like this, as long as you have the patience to level up a lot before being able to hit the big leagues with fancier upgraded traps and consumables.","April 2","true","98.9"," 156 of 221 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","156","221","9","2"

OMD 1&2 were simple and beautiful and nailed what they were tring to do. I cant help but feel like someone got greedy with the decision to make it into a PVP MOBA game, and now OMD:U doesnt seem like it knows what it wants to be. There is crafting, grinding, TD, battle arena. The neat and clean UI has been replaced by loads of cluttered and confusing menues. Lots of pickups, none of them feel meanigful or intuative...\n\nIts not all bad. Theres some good stuff here, but its a far cry from what would make me continue throwing money at the franchise. The same level of humor is still there, and the art style is on point. The PVE/Co-op aspects are great, alot of which would undoubtedly qualify for OMD sucessor status if it were not for the stunted grindy crafting system encouraging you to buy booster packs to increase drops and experience.\n\nI would have happily bought OMD3 outright for a heafty sum, but nothing turns me off of a game faster than a micro-transaction reliant buisness model.","March 30","false","3.1"," 194 of 285 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","194","285","5","0"

I love MOBA's and am one of the few who thought it could be cool.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nI did some games with friends against bots and that was all fun and good, then we did a PVP match. The difference was night and day, all of a sudden i was getting hit 4-5x harder by their attacks, they passed us in levels within 5 minutes and had broken through several walls with little to no resistance. I look at their traps, they have ones i don't even have close to the resources for. It wasn't fun.\n\nUnfortunately in its current state I can't recommend the game. I will continue to watch the development but I'm not terribly optimistic at this point. This game is quite pay 2 win at the moment and it makes for a very unpleasant experience.\n\nEDIT: Ok so since this review has received a fair amount of attention including a developer response, the traps "may" be balanced to be equal at the very end when everyone has maxed everything, however that is a LONG way from where you start with the game. You cannot expect players to grind through one sided gameplay at the promise that they will at some point be on EVEN playing ground. They should be on even or as close to even as possible from the very start.\n\nWhen I say pay to win in my review I am stating that if you spend money, you have access to stronger traps, better synergy, and traits that increase your hero's power and your traps power. There is a noticable power spike BY SPENDING MONEY. If they were cosmetic upgrades or exp upgrades that would be fine, because then your level would correspond to your power, however your level can be low while your traps and such are high.

There is also a "survival" mode, the classic Orcs Must Die style of cooperative tower defense.\n\nThere are quite a few playable heroes each with there own style. Most I feel have been withheld for further balancing and reworking, as some of my favorites have not made it back in yet. but that just makes me more excited for the future of the game.\n\nThe game I feel has changed tons over the course of testing, each time I started playing it felt like something completely new. I hope this time around they decide to stick with what they have and work towards improving it. I hope you give OMD!

They will bait you in by feeding you enough crafting materials as leveling rewards to craft a hero and a couple of traps, but all the interesting traps are gated behind materials with drop rates so low that they might as well not be in the loot table.  You know it's bad when a studio employee publicly admits to using an exploit to farm materials.\n\nThere's also what I would call a steep strategy and teamwork curve for survival matches.  Matchmaking and map difficulty are determined by account level and it's very easy to find yourself on maps that require a cohesive strategy executed as a team within just a few hours. Because every hero level advances your account level, it almost feels like a punishment for trying different heroes once you find yourself consistently losing on the advanced maps.\n\nWhile I don't think it's fair to call the game pay-to-win, I would call it pay-to-enjoy.  You NEED upgraded traps to make a difference as the difficulty ramps up, but with the aforementioned dearth of materials needed to craft and upgrade them then the only other option to acquire them becomes purchasing chests with cash.  The drops from the chests are randomized, so if you go this route be prepared to burn through some money.\n\nWith the initial flush of materials you get in the first levels, it's also very easy to make the mistake of thinking this represents the progression you'll see in later levels and make sub-optimal upgrade and crafting decisions.  By the time you actually have a feel for the game and what traps work well together, you're in a materials desert and stuck with the choices you made when you didn't know what you were doing.\n\nThe carrot on the stick in this game is the traps, but when you find yourself playing game after game with the same starter traps and the few traps you were able to craft with the early level rewards, the drop rate on the materials needed to craft new traps really starts to become demotivating.\n\nThere's potential for a really fun game here and I really want to enjoy it, but right now it's all stick and no carrot.","April 30","false","155.4"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","41","56","5","1"

It's a F2P multiplayer game, not P2W, Different from OMD1 and 2. It has PvE and PvP, not grindy at all for a F2P. Regular updates, the devs listen to people, fast fixes.\n\nMost negative reviews talk about things that have been adressed like the slow progression/p2w feeling and will keep being adressed actively with patches.\n\nThis game has good graphics, and it's really well done taking into account that is F2P and not from a huge studio.\nThe gameplay is very enjoyable and addictive.\nIt's not casual and super easy like OMD1 and 2 was, it shifted into a bit more competitive and challenging stuff like the PvP. Early levels of PvE are still plain easy.\nThe PvE progression is slower than OMD1/2 but that makes the game not that boring too, it has a longer campaign, more heroes to play and you can still choose to play solo or up to 5 people (the game autobalances the level for you).\n\nAlso new traps, gear, minions, bosses, etc.\n\nThe PvP mode is still a tower defense but inspired by "MOBA" aspects from games like HoTS. It's quite fast-paced and really engaging, very active and thrilling 5v5. There are different roles, defenders, attackers and pillager (jungler).\nIt has a lot of strategy to develop and improve on. Also the teamplay is a important aspect.\n\nYou can craft everything in the game without paying, and you can obtain heroes quite fast. The first 10 levels give you enough to craft one, and that takes less than a few hours.\n\nThe updates and new content addition are regular. Also the developers are actively participating with the community and reacting fast to the feedback given, resulting on fast fixes.\n\nSome cons: crafting some type of cards can be messy for new people and feel tedious. No ranked mode yet. Matchmaking will need some time to set everyone on their real skill level for PvP matches.\n\nReally worth to give it a try and I fully recommend it, try it without prejudices and don't expect it to be exactly like the previous games, because it isn't, i'ts different but much better imho.","April 6","true","418.6"," 91 of 143 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","91","143","7","12"

Then I find out Gameforge is publishing it in Europe; my excitement goes straight out the window. But of course I still had to give the game a chance (even if I now regret that decision).\n\nBasically what has happened is; Robot has hopped on the "sub-par, everyday MOBA train" in an attempt to hitch a ride to "Money Town".\nAfter a very brief time playing I found the game to be repetitive and boring but, don't worry, if you're not a fan of grinding you can unlock EVERYTHING in the game by throwing your money at it.\n\nNow, you may think a game that offers 5 player co-op would be fun, but you'd be wrong.

If you’re not happy with it now, put the game away for a while and come back later, if development in Open Beta will follow the same pattern as in Closed you won’t be dissapointed when you come back.\n\nThe businessmodel and crafting system does look a bit messy at first glance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jacowboy/recommended/427270/","Jacowboy","Jacowboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jacowboy/","436 products in account","So here's the skinny: This game is pretty good, but not perfect yet... though, remember it's only on open beta phase, so it's to be expected, and patches are coming in regularly, so it looks good so far.\n\nLet's get on with the obvious first: Yes, it's a free to play. Yes, it's VERY grindy (as you can expect from any F2P game).\n\nThat said: NO, it's NOT pay to win. Not at all in fact, since money will get you characters, skins, consumables (a bit useless tbh and PvE only) and chests. Now, chests are luck based basically, and you will get PLENTY of chests for free while playing anyways, so paying would in fact just give you more random ressources than non-paying players, but it's still luck based, so it doesn't really make that much of  a difference in the end.\n\nYou'll start with enough items to be able to play right away and not feel under-powered, and the reality is: this is a lot more skill-based (and strategy-based) than item-based.\n\nOkay, so, with that said... 2nd thing: This is NOT a MOBA game... Yes, the "Siege mode" has MOBA mechanics, but it's nowhere near as unpleasant (for people who don't like MOBAs like me, that is) as your typical MOBA games. At best, you could call this a MOBA-light, emphasis on the "light" part. And even then, that's only one half of the game...\n\nThe other half is "Survival mode", and that's about as close to OMD 1 & 2 as you can get (when factoring in the necessary changes for a multiplayer system). You can play solo, you can play with friends, or you can enter the "matchmaking queue" to play with up to 5 random people. You have your starter "decks" (or loadouts) but will soon be able to craft other traps with rewards from the game. You just need to be carful before spending those ressources, because as I said, it's grindy and you'd better be smart with your choices or you're gonna regret them quickly =P\n\nSiege mode (PvP) also offers different choices: You can play with friends or in the matchmaking queue against either other players or a team of bots to get used to the mechanics at first (it doesn't take long though, the game has nice & simple but fun mechanics).\n\nAll in all, and considering it's still in beta phase (open as it might be) I've gotta say the game is pretty fun, either if you're a casual or a hardcore fan. Personally, I had tried the closed beta and wasn't convinced with it (because I don't like MOBAs as I said), but since they implemented the "classic" Survival mode, and made a lot of changes overall, they've won me over.\n\nLong time fans should think of this as the "natural" progression of what they were going for with OMD2 Co-op system. Don't be scared by the "pay-to-win" doomsayers... but be warned that it is indeed very grindy at the moment (though some in-game changes might come out soon to mitigate those issues).\n\nThis definetly desreves a better review average than "mixed" and it deserves being played... Plus, it's free, so you know... It doesn't hurt to try =P","April 26","true","553.5"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","26","36","0","0"

W.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Intraman/","445 products in account","OMDU is a fantastic adaption of 3rd person multiplayer tower defense. It builds upon OMD 1 and 2 in ways that fans of those games would enjoy while being also a unique multiplayer experience with both its co-op and competitive modes. I have been playing it off and on since it's closed alpha and find the current Open Beta to be absolutely wonderful if still a bit rough around the edges.\n\nAllow me to clear up some common misconceptions about this game.\n-Is this just another 3rd person atempt at a MOBA?\nNo. Its  Siege mode (competitive mode) does have a lot in common with MOBAs, but it is reductive and incorrect to classify it as "just another MOBA." It's not a 3rd person version of DOTA or League. If you come to OMDU expecting that you'll be disappointed. While I would certainly classify the Siege mode as "MOBA-like" it has it's own unique spin on the concepts and requires its own skill set.\nExample: Each team has offensive and defensive lanes. When on defense you'll be setting traps and arranging the path that the enemy minions will take just like you would in the other OMD games. While on offense you'll be trying to push back or defeat those defenders to get your minions through.\n\n-Is this game only multiplayer?\nSort of. There is a Survival Mode (co-op) that can be played single player, but you'll likely find that it quickly becomes really difficult. At the moment the Survival mode appears to only have varients of the Siege mode maps, but it would not surprise me if they make Survival only maps or even port some of the classic maps from the other games to that mode. It should be mentioned that Survival has it's own mechanics that do not appear in the Siege mode such as placable Guardians and an "Unchained" meter (which is sort of similar to Marvel Vs Capcom 3's X-Factor in that it give the character a powerful buff for a short peroid.)\n\nWho would I recommend this game to?\nIf you're looking for a unique multiplayer game and enjoy either tower defense or the previous installments then you should at least check this game out. It still has some ironing out but any grievences I have with the game are too specific to bring up in a review (like certain character having more costumes than others, or fiddly balance stuff.)\nIt is free to play but the current progression seems pretty fair. You seem to get a pretty steady stream of new things from just playing the game.","April 14","true","28.3"," 56 of 91 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","56","91","5","0"

Really adds up to the tension.\n-Difficulty for now, is right on spot. I lose some, win most (but not with 100% rift). Which is great!\n-Different heroes, leveling, play style. Minor downside is that you can't choose more skill upgrades after level 12?\n-Lots of traps and high trap placement cap.\n-Awesome Guardians.\n-Hero variation + you get 5 of them f2p for one week.\n-Fun siege mode which can be ignored if you don't like it.\n\nNegative:\n-Most people will be bored before they unlock even 1/10th of the game. Rather 1/20 of the game. I'm still not there.\n-Lots of traps, you'll never get to enjoy because of the insane cost.\n-No point in trying and testing the traps you love the most => insane cost, so you'll never have even 1/4th of the traps\n-Upgrading traps is even more of a joke, even higher cost\n-Hero cost is also insane\n-Drop rate is horrible compared to crafting cost\n-No variation at all when you play with other players => nobody can get any new traps because of the insane cost\n-You can't place archers/fighters anymore. Why remove this awesome feature?\n\nConclusion:\nThis is still a beta, so things may change. They reduced the hero cost from overpriced, to less overpriced. I want to enjoy this game with other players, seeing all kinds of trap variations and fun combinations. Sadly, 80% of the player base will probably quit before reaching any new traps, due to this insane cost.\n\nYou are PUNISHED for trying different kinds of traps. There is absolutely NO WAY you'll get around testing and upgrading various traps, due to high cost, weeks and weeks of grinding to just upgrade even 1 trap.

Even though they're supposedly fixing the drop system, you can't experiment with different builds or traps to see what you like; and even if you have the resources a LOT of the good traps/equipment/etc is random drop from chests only.\n\nI can see a lot of potential in the core mechanics, it's just buried so far underneath the systems designed to 'encourage' players to invest money in the market that it just ruins the game for me.\n\nI bought the founders pack way back, way back when the game was announced and I completely regret it now. The founder's deal gave a bunch of unique skins and offered more gold than the current packs for a lower price. Even with the better deal the game isn't worth it, wish I could get a refund based on the current game.\n\nThe way the game is now, I doubt the system will ever be rewarding enough to casual players or people that don't want to invest the money.","May 10","false","29.5"," 45 of 73 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","45","73","0","2"

Traps can be a little grindy to grind for the materials, and craft, but it honestly isn't too bad if you're going to be playing it regularly.\n\nPlus, you can bring 4 other friends with you to slay hordes of orcs, instead of just one like before.\n\nI like it, I say give it a try!\n\nEdit: Just wanted to touch on Siege (the moba mode) - It has a pretty high skill cap, and it can be pretty difficult to figure out everything that may be going on, but if that's the kind of game you like, I encourage giving it a try.\n\nAnyone that calls this pay to win can eat a major one, because you can craft anything in game barring skins with in game materials. And buying chests does not guarantee you the materials to advance as quick as you might think. Trust me, my gold I bought from closed beta were spent strictly on heroes, and the chests I purchased with leftover, didn't yield much in the way of useful items. It is definitely not pay to win, and in fact, I'd suggest against buying gold and getting chests too much.\n\nDoes the game have its faults? Well yeah, what doesn't?  The game holds my attention because it's survival mode is similar to OMD 2, and it allows me to group with up to 4 others, and there are more heroes and IMO, the gameplay feels pretty gratifying.\n\nAgain, this is my opinion, and I would recommend anyone to give it a try.

I played OMD! 1 and 2 through, even the endless maps ontop, so much fun did i had with the games. But this, this is not the sequel i wanted nor needed.\n\nIt looks like OMD! but, it feels so wrong, so very, very wrong. And maybe thanks to Gameforge, did i just now learned about OMD! U. And thank god for that.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting Heroes to choose from, once you unlocked them either through grinding or RNG shop with money\n-All the traps from the earlier games are there! But not all, you have to unlock them again through grinding or RNG shop\n-The levels and survival maps (runs? Missions? Not sure how to call them) are nice and fitting into OMD! But there are only few now, and the few are getting boring quickly.\n-Good ol' OMD! humor is inclusive and free!\n-Ummm...skins for your heroes? No, wait, you have to unlock them through leveling and RNG shop too.\n\nCons:\n-Almost all the mentioned points up there\n-Graphics are looking horrible\n-Tutorials are stuttering! No joke, my pc is able to run The Division on ultra smoothly, but the tutorials of this game are stuttering for no reason!\n- GRINDING! Everyone playing this game can assure you, that if you want to play free, you have to grind, ALOT.\n-Crafting. Yes, the tedious amount of crafting is a con too. You have to craft almost everything in this game.\n-MOBA. Sadly yes, the MOBA aspect is a con too. Other players with money can unlock early on Heroes, you don't know and know how to fight. Put in the level imbalance and upraded Traps imbalance, that can happen, and your game is over.\n-It feels like you have to put in cash to get somewhere in the game, into a shop to buy chests with RNG. Great.\n-As some others mentioned, the Community isn't happy at all about Gameforge and Robot, ignoring and stealing ideas for Patches and more.\n\n\nOverall, ignore it, or better, play some round first, than get back here and give it a negative Review.

Which is make it more online in-game store, LOTS of blizzard inspired elements from hearthstone and HotS primarily, but sadly now it just feels like another wannabe MOBA cash grabbing game, why alter something that's not even bad to begin with?

NO\n\nLong story short if you loved the older orcs must die for it's casual sit down single player/co-op with another friend campaign fun beat it in a few days... This is 100% a whole new game that'll take hours of grinding to unlock all your traps/abilities/skins/chracters/etc it essentially is playing another MOBA type forumla game... Sure it has a nice twist to it but to really make most of this game... be prepared to play this for the long run and long nights to really get most out of it\n\nI'm saddened but happpy for the game it is trying to reach new heights but honestly it was a perfect game the way it was... Why couldn't we just get the same game with the new heroes and new challenging locations for the extended replayability\n\nThe MOBA scene is already dominated already by the 2 kings trying to go up against them or stand with them or re-invent the formula is just foolish should of just stuck to creating the same great game...

I, presonally, found no real purchase in the versus aspect of the game. It makes otherwise good gameplay feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ moba that was forced into the game rather than designed into it.\n\nThe base coop mode is more of what you have come to expect from orcs must die in the past, and its done well enough. However, it does feel like it is done worse than in previous games. They reworked some mechanics (ex. guardians are stronger but VERY limited, think just a couple per map, and can only be placed in designated spots) and shifted the focus away from the traps a bit and more onto the player's character. Personally, I really dislike this choice. They did add in quite a few characters and an ingame talent choice system similar to Heroes of the Storm, but it ultimately still feels fairly hollow.\n\nThe worst part of the game has to be the progression system. There are multiple types of currency that you have to collect from various sources and the drop rate makes it feel like you are making hardly any progress at all. It basically feels like they took what was in the previous games, and took everything away from the character in order to force you to buy it all back in this game.\n\nThe absolute worst decision I can think of is also related to this progression system. Account levels are gained as you gain experience for different characters by playing them and levelling them up. The problem with this is that players that are too far apart in levels cannot play with each other in full groups. My friend showed me this game and so I decided to try it. However, because we are too far apart in levels, we can only play together with the two of us and can not get into a matchmaking group. The problem with this is that everything in this game definitely feels like it was designed for a full 5 players. The game does scale back the enemies to compensate, but the map design and everything else just screams at you the entire time that you should have 5 players and that is the way the game is meant to be played. But you can't. the game gives no indication or explanation to what is happening and you have to dig through old patch notes to figure out that they wanted to make it so that the matchmaker wouldn't just average out the players levels and leave moderately leveled people playing with one much higher level and one noob. They give absolutely no indication of when you will be able to play together the way the game feels like it was meant to be played. You just have to keep ranking up hoping this will be the one that does it. Worst system ever. I have no idea why anyone would impliment a system that actively discourages players from playing with their friends.\n\nIts not like the problem I described above is just a newby problem either. there are 100 account levels, and as far as I can tell, a difference of 10 will mean you can't matchmake together. Again, despite my best efforts and a long time looking, there is no information other than one sentence in some patch notes a short while back explaining it.","April 4","false","22.6"," 62 of 109 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","62","109","4","0"

In essence I think that what orcs must die was has been stripped because it's not really a game that was every designed to work wtih microtransactions.\n\nBy no means is this game as good as 1 and 2, but it is still enjoyable for a time.

It's just... not good.\n\nIt's trying to be a MOBA in a space where we just don't need MOBAs. I have DotA 2. I don't need another one.\n\nYes, there is now a PvE mode but that doesn't solve the problem because the game was still designed around PvP and suffers as a result. It lost all the shine and fun in the original series.\n\nThe physics aren't zany, off-the wall, and sometimes glitchy. Hero characters can't equip multiple weapons to create unique play-styles. Hero attacks are "balanced" instead of just letting you be a maniacal orc killing machine. The strategic/puzzle element of the game at the harder difficulty levels is gone. There were some levels on nightmare my friend and I played like 7-8 times before we finally figured out a winning 5-skull strategy and that was really rewarding, then we'd check online and other people would have completely different solutions. The cap on total traps per level prevents you from making an insane unstoppable meat grinder and watching it work.\n\nI could go on, but basically, this game has no soul.

However, the action part of the game can be kinda bland at times and it's left the impression on me that more development has been put into all of the aspects related to defending and not enough in the more offensive actions players can take. There isn't much of a learning curve to the game as it is now which is sort of a good and a bad thing. On one hand, nearly anyone can enjoy the game but on the other, there's a very low "skill cap," if you will, and you'd have likely explored most of the creative stuff you can do pretty early on. This also means that there isn't any competitive scene in the game (yet). Should one pop up in the future and that's not your kind of thing, fear not, my kindred spirit, for there is this glorious thing called  SURVIVAL MODE  where you and your fellow plebian casuls can take part in jolly trapping as you defend your "sparkling cotton candy!"\n\nSurvival Mode is definitely where this game shines more as the PvP feels very bare bones in it's current state (though that should probably go without saying, given what series this is from.) It does a way better job of keeping you thinking, wereas PvP you can sort of just play mindlessly and still carry around your own weight. With more things to select from and maps better designed for what  Orcs Must Die! started out as, it's definitely a much more engaging experience compared to it's PvP. There's a lot of fun trap setups to explore\n\nThough I've mostly been playing PvP for whatever reason, despite all of this....","May 6","true","63.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

It feels like a different game.\n\nNone of my complaints are things that can't be balanced before the full launch and I'd love to come back and recommend this game as things progress but as it stands right now after playing 4-5 matches with my friends I have issues with the following things:\n\n1) The gate/guardian mechanic is weird. OMD2 was corridors to place traps in and create kill boxes. I find that more often than not in a 4 player game we wind up just wailing on enemies that are wailing on a blue barrier. This stems from my second complaint -\n\n2) There isn't nearly enough room to place traps. Nothing in OMD2 was more satisfying than setting up a bad ♥♥♥ killbox that you got to watch enemies evaporate in for a wave or 2. You don't get that in this game. You have little tiny restricted areas in which to place a few traps and it's not enough to really make much of a dent in the later waves of enemies. The traps feel like an after-thought instead of a core gameplay mechanic like they were in previous games.\n\n3) Along with there not being enough room to place traps the balance of money earned on waves and trap costs is way out of whack. The fun factor of this game would increase 10 fold if we got more coins per wave and were given more space to place traps. The trap power feels pretty okay (frost vents are still trash, always have been, tar for life) but it just feels like you don't have much room for creativity, nor the cash to be creative with trap placement.\n\n3) Hero balance is way out of whack. Melee level up at least 2x as fast as ranged because they can hit every single enemy while the ranged shoot the melee in the back (thankfully no FF) instead of hitting enemies.\n\n4) All hero power is way out of whack. They are all far too weak to be fun to play. Even the most basic enemies take way too many hits to the kill to the point that you don't feel powerful just annoyed that nothing dies in a timely fashion. It would be a lot more fun to be able to kill enemies faster but have more enemies to kill, with the exception of the classic exceptions which are supposed to be really tanky and hard to kill. I know the game has the different gear and traits but honestly looking at them none of them look very exciting. 12% more damge to ogres - hold the phones did someone say 12 whole percent? Against a single enemy class? Whoopie. I think the heroes should all be baseline probably 2x as powerful as they are, the amount of enemies increased to compensate, and the traits changed to more creative/engaging buffs. Faster movement speed after X number of combos in a set time period, chance to set fire or slow or freeze enemies on hit, chance to trigger double damage against certain classes, etc.\n\n5) The special abilities are all really underwhelming. I haven't played every hero but the ones I have tried have all had really underwhelming Q and E abilities, and the V overcharge type ability is really underwhelming. There are some exceptions - I liked the fire ladies dragon's breath type channeled ability and Hogarths damage reduction is super handy but his leap ability? It's non targetable and practically a death sentence if you leap into the wrong group of enemies. I'd rather something more useful like a frost breath frontal AOE slow or a ground stop type stun. Especially with the lack of trap placement taking away most of the killbox gameplay the characters should have more CC available.\n\n6) The respawn timer is too long when you die. Probably 2x too long. Drop the initial cooldown WAY down and make it increase with each death IMO.\n\n7) Please for the love of everything good and holy give Maximillian the shotgun back. That stupid bow is total trash.\n\nI think it has a lot of potential and people new to OMD might like it but for people who've been salivating for a 4-5 player co-op OMD since OMD2 are going to be disappointed. A great start but could use some tweaks to make it more fun.","April 1","false","1.9"," 65 of 119 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","65","119","6","1"

That was nearly two years ago, figured I'd give the PvE a try since the word is it's "like the old OMD".\n\nI'll save you the read: it's not.\n\nAm I just a bitter PC Masterace type guy who doesn't want anything to change ever?  Am I just mad because it went F2P?  Let's look at the facts.\n\nHere's a PARTIAL list of things that were changed.  Most of this has nothing to do with the F2P model, mind you, but everything to do with what helped make the first two games good:\n\nHere's a partial list of what was made worse:\n\n1. No Single Player campaign* (a tacked on solo experience with no story and no progression)\n2. No Double-jumping\n3. No Head shots\n4. No Sprinting (yes, you cannot sprint in this game!)\n5. Slow rate of fire\n6. Bad guys are bullet sponges, primary weapons are nearly useless (except to add a hit to your combo counter)\n7. No charge shots\n8. Traps do less damage and fire less often.\n9. Traps cost more and thus you place far fewer in the course of a match. (If you manage to lay down 10 traps in the course of a half hour match, that's about typical in this game)\n10. No trinkets\n11. Slow movement: as mentioned, no sprinting, but backing up or strafing are oddly far slower than moving forward.\n12. Character stops dead to cast magic or melee (again, adding to the SLOW feeling of this game)\n13. The excellent progression of unlocking traps each level in OMD 1 and 2 is replaced with a deliberately complicated crafting system that requires (literally) dozens of hours of grinding to make any real progress.\n14. Most levels limit trap placement to a single small hallway. The entire trap mechanic in the game is hugely downplayed.\n15. Guardians cannot be placed strategically, only on designated spots\n16. Auto-aim/bullet magnetism has been added (explains why no headshots)","March 29","false","9.6"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","2"

The new heroes, modes, and traps are interesting, but the game is overshadowed by the use of micro-transactions.  Although you don't have to pay any money to obtain stuff the grind to get anywhere is a tad over the top.

But it's so short sighted to make your game un-fun just to try to force people to pay real money to bypass the grind.\n\nWorse then the grind, the higher your account the more often I seem to encountered people who don't know how to play.  They didn't work as a team or even know how to play the roles.  (IE siege attackers not escorting creeps or ever bothering to upgrade portals, defenders who run off and go  commando)  I can only guess this is because they paid real money to unlock higher level traps/heros and got boost in XP so appear to be higher level than they really should be.\n\nOverall, on the surface it looks like the old OMD games, but it's been turned into a boring grindfest that just isn't fun.

First it was Dungeon Defenders 2 now Orcs Must Die Unchained.\n\nWhy a MOBA?  This game's style is not suited towards a MOBA.  Moreover, the popular MOBA's on the market don't require tedious grinding or microtransactions to unlock all hero skills/abilities.  DOTA2 only has cosmetic microtransactions.  Heroes of the Storm requires you to unlock heroes with gold which is slightly more tedious but passable.  OMD Unchained requires you to unlock heroes AND purchase unlocks/upgrades for traps and items to increase your hero's power.\n\nCo-op Survival mode suffers from the same grinding feeling but the awkwardness of playing with four teammates.  Strategically planning trap placement is not something you want to do with four random players who often don't comunicate at all.  Never mind the fact the load times and 'waiting for player' queues are extremely frustrating versus OMD 1 and 2's drop in and get started right away.\n\nA sad end to a great franchise.

It's hard to be in the game, and not having fun. When the game is playing and you're in it - it's a good time.\n\nEverything else is kinda trashy. It will take you ages to unlock any character. I've played 12 games and won 6 of them - sure you can use that to say I'm not very good at the game, but this is a game where I have no control over 9 of the 10 players in it - and that has amounted to 17 rift embers. You need 450 rift embers to unlock a character. If I'm averaging about 2 embers per game, this game is asking you to play about 225 games to unlock one character.\n\nLet's suppose you want to be a good digital citizen and purchase characters one by one for real dollars. You like the game and want to support it with money. Okay.\n\nEach character costs some amount of premium currency which can only be purchased with actual money so the fact that these characters aren't just being sold for actual money is already one level of unnecessary obscurity. The premium currency needed to unlock a character CANNOT BE PURCHASED. Premium currency can only be bought in increments of 1,250 (250 per $) - 2,750 (275 per $)- 5,750 (287.5 per $) - 15,000 (300 per $) - and 32,500 (325 per $) while characters themselves range from 900 to 2500.\n\nUnlocking every character in the game would cost 21,700 premium currency.\n\nWhile the question: what's the best deal? might make for an interesting math problem, this system is virtually guaranteed to overcharge you by making exact change impossible. For someone mathematically inclined it is a puzzle . . . probably the best value is to buy 5$ worth at 2,750 and use that to get the 3 cheap heroes.\n\nThis cash shop is asking for at least $60, just for the characters. It's asking at least that again for all the various accoutrements.\n\nI just . . . I don't see the value there. In terms of production value, I don't see 60$ up on the screen. This game is way too expensive to own so the question you should be asking yourself is: what portion of the pie do I think is worth playing? It's a question I hate to ask myself when I'm just trying to enjoy the game.\n\nI get that this developer probably doesn't want you to unlock characters too quickly for perfectly valid reasons. It's free to play, they need to make their money back somehow. There's not that many characters in the game, if you were unlocking them super fast you'd be done way too quickly. That last reason is maybe just padding - but it feels like it has more weight than just nothing.\n\nThe game's fun, I'm probably going to keep playing it, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if unlocking anything isn't extremely arduous.","March 30","false","107.2"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","1"

So I'm hoping that this review might help people look past the current rating.\n\nSo what is Orcs Must Die!: Unchained? It's a MOBA combined with turret defense type gameplay (or trap defense in this case). In most MOBAs (say DOTA 2) minions spawn from 3 lanes from a barracks type structure and head towards a main structure in the enemy's base to attack and destroy between them are Heros (players) and turrets.\n\nIn OMD: U it's slightly different. For starters theres only 2 lanes and the minions spawn from portals. Which must then travel from their portal from your base in to the enemy's rift. There's nothing for them to destroy once there, they simply must get in to the rift to score points. Once the enemy has lost all of their points your team wins. The minions must overcome traps (laid out by the enemy team heros) and guardians (which is a big dude in armor with powerful aoe attacks) which stand in front of gates.\n\nNow heres the cool thing: you are free to customise what gets sent down the lane! There are 3 slots for front, middle and back positions. You can send everything from orcs which are numerous but not very tough and only worth 1 point each to giants which are big, tough but slow and I believe worth like 3-5 point each. You can also get dwarfs that cast protective shields or crossbow infantry that perforate heros and guardians from a distance. To get different minions to need to unlock thier cards which are crafted from materirals you get as you play the game or from chests (which can be bought with real money).\n\nYour can also unlock different traps in this way and traits which are minor boosts to your hero. From bonus starting gold to slight increase in health or mana.\n\nBut thats for a 5v5 match Siege mode. If you're not feeling competitive theres a Survival co-op mode where you and up to 4 other people must endure several waves of minions.\n\nMost people will complain about micro-transactions and whatnot but well thats how a free to game works I'm afraid. Do they expect that the poeple who work on this game work completely for free? Not to mention they are completely optional. Maybe if people focused more on the actual FUN of the game instead of grind this game might get more favourable reviews but I don't really want to get more in to that. If that's their opinion then so be it.\n\nIn short this game is really fun and even though it's in beta it's very well polished. And well it's completely free if you wish to at least try it out.","April 26","true","132.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","0"

I would had prefered a story mode and the ability to carry more traps, that is what made orcs must die fun. Thought there is so much, it feels so limiting cause of that paywall. Personally orcs must die 3 with a few dlcs sounds a lot better to digest. Aside from those complaints, the game is fun, and in the first few areas in survival there were times I was at the edge of my seat cause I couldn't lay enough traps or maybe traps in one area and the other 2 are open, which I see why people think of it as a MOBA.\n\nPros\nThe game is fun\nA lot of trap options, though linited on how many you can carry\nGoing solo is a lot more intense in my opinion\n\ncons\nNo story which is sad since I loved the humor\npaywalls are never good and no one should defend them, especially if you are the type that complains avout dlc\nCrafting is hit or miss, I personally like it but whats the point if you are limited to what you are able to carry\n\nabout my dlc comment\nDo some math add everything you could buy in game with real money and then break it down to how many items usually come in an Orcs must Die game, And feel ripped off.\n\nI kind of recommend the game even though I refuse to pay for anything that in 10 years the servers will go down and I lose my money","March 30","false","5.4"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/babycakecake/recommended/427270/","babycakecake","ﻮ๏๔๔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/babycakecake/","17 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI have an incredibly extensive and large Steam Network, and have 10+ years on my other account.\n\nDuring this time its possible I have never reviewed another game.\n\nI played many of the Orc's Must Die series, and we all know how plagued they were with limited multiplayed features, and limited creativity.\n\nI am glad to see they have FINALLY satisfied my need for an RPG.\n\nI will go over the basics for all those that care, and are interested in this game. And I will start with the bad things.\n\nLimited charaters at this point. Its scary to buy any champion because they are probably going to be in the free rotation soon. Most characters already in game feel very basic, and without pizaz.\n\nThis game is a MID GRADE MMO. That means if you are looking for anything beyond mid level customization, skins, and basic item unlocks, you should stop.\n\nCharacter Customization? Easily more extenisve than most MOBA's, especially the free ones, but mid level feeling in the end.\nGraphics? Excellent for the Orc's trilogy, mid level detail overall. Regarless= great effects and look.\nSounds? Absolutely hilarious the things you hear and the theme songs they implemented. Mid grade quality and synthisizing.\nI think your getting the point.\n\n\nNow lets continue to the PROS:\n\nThis game is absolutely hilarious. I mean the song the guy hums when you load into que makes me lol every time. ANd its not just a chuckle, like i actually start reflexing from my belly.\n\nMany people have stated P2W, and P2P but that is NOT TRUE AT ALLLLLLLLLL. The correct terminology they are looking for is PAY TO PROCEED. If you want to play with your Level 50+ friends first day then sure, drop 50 bucks in the shop, get a whole bunch of chest, and enjoy.\n\nThe default farm rate of all items ingame seems legit. I mean its literally fresh open beta (as of cinco de mayo) so I get the feeling the developers want you get ur fair share of items so the game expands.\n\nIf you play 1 game a day? Can you proceed? (1 win) Yeah about every weekend I would guess that  you would have enough points to unlock one new trap, champion, guardian or whatever you choose. That seems fair since your not even grinding.\n\nThe community is amazing. I have played 20 hours so far, so about 20 games and only ONE game was someone toxic. It was still hilarious because the other players kinda just banded together and played around in the corner of the map.\n\nThis game is not a high stress game. You lose very little games while farming xp (thats right BONUS xp) in the survival area and the item drop rate seems very fair if not generous. I havent ventured into the siege mode (5 man vs 5 man) but I assume you would maintain a 50% win ratio there.\n\nLastly the largest PRO in my opinion is the ability to build your own trap/guardian/potion deck, which is entirely based on your creatitivy and farming capability. Isn't that what an MOBA is about?\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nI tried to answer some basic and broad questions, but I would 100% recommend downloading and playing this game maybe once a day to giggle intently at the loading que tune, and plenty of other hilarious, action packed and creative moments.\n\nI guarantee end game playability will leave you a little bit hungry for more "keys" (infinite survival map unlocks),  advanced trap/attack physics, customization, and diverse champions but remembering to enjoy the little things in life is what I believe Orc's Must Die is all about.\n\nAfterall its only open beta and they are doing a great job so far. Most of the hunger will be solved by periodic released of new champions, maps, traps, etc etc.","May 5","true","58.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

First of all this game is quite fun and is in OPEN BETA this means that it is still a work in progress and will be changed in the future so naturally quite a few things may not be to your liking at the moment.Second of all there is a lot of whining over it being "pay to win" it is not. I have not spent a single dollar so far and have crafted traps, heroes, and have enough materials to craft many more. You can easily play this game and be sucessful without spending a dime. It is so much fun and the fact that it is getting bad reviews is scaring me as this game does not deserve them.

My steam record shows only small part of my playtime. I love evrythink about this games and i was hyped for this game to come out mostly because of more playable heros and bigger multiplayer missions. I know it wont be OMD3 but it still should be fun since its still an OMD game. What i got is kind of a dissapoinment.\nIts a big step down from "Orcs Must Die 2". No real story, much less funny dialogs, stupid F2P mechanics, PvP based game in MOBA style (who the @$%# came up with this? Lets make a fun to play action tower defence and change it into an other MOBA title), PvE survival mode is just components farm on same maps over and over again. Even game controls dont feel the same, there is no sprinting, no headshots, no weapon swap, no mercenaries archers or palladins. Only one weapon with ability, 2 special hero abilities and one special trap (that for some heroes can be used only in PvP mode) per hero. Crafting system based on how much you farm on specific maps (progress wall). There are much less game customization like no way to change camera placement to over the shoulder. It is always over your head. Even for beta there is almost no content and one big P2W wall that wont let you have anythink good for weeks but you can buy chests for real money and hope it drops somethink good so you can play more.\n\nHeroes have few unchangealbe abilities and only one weapon and this is a step down from their big variations of playstyles. One hero per playstyle and you can't play with 2 same characters in one team even in PvE so it makes problems in mages selecting screen that makes many PvP games dismissed because one player didnt got his badass Wolf hero. It even a problem in PvE with my friends when we cant buy more heroes since they cost so much and free rotation never gives what you want in 100%. PvE should allow clones in team just for more fun with friends. PvE should be fun in everyway.\n\nI can only say that you can still have some fun in coop missions with up to 4 friends but maps used for it are just little cuts from pvp maps and still have all building restrictions (YES! YOU CAN BUILD ONLY IN SPECIFIC AREAS!) but if you have only one friend to play with its much better to just play orcs must die 2.\n\nI am really dissapointed that this game is being made with help from gameforge. They have a bad reputation for a reason and many other users reviews talk about it in more details.\n\nRobot Entertainment! If you want my FEEDBACK i can only say that i understand that this is only a beta version of the game. BUT! I wont belive that you just could not program same mechanics once more and then improve them. You should bring back old game mechanics meaning: Sprinting, Heatshots, Mercenaries, More weapons for all heroes and freedom of gameplay styles like before. (also please bring back optional camera placement over my shoulder.) In my opinion maps in survival mode should not have specific areas where you can build defenses and place guardians. Crafting system is a awful with so little drops and so many materials needed to lvled up anythink. Also Hero crafting will have weeks of day to day gameplay to unlock only one character which is frustrating. You need to tone it down so we can enjoy your game even with out paying so much for everythink. Its a F2P game so it must be enjoyable for free and should not be frustrating to play vs paying players. That means you have to change system of leveling up defences for all players are equal or get rid off time skipping P2W chests. You should also focus much more on single-player and coop! This is the part that made Orcs Must Die series so popular and good! If you make this game a real improvement from Orcs Must Die 2 I will change my review but for now...\nI would rather pay over 30€ for fully developed Orcs must die 3 game and add even more money for future DLCs that are an improvment to game mechanics and gameplay with more multiplayer options than play this degenerated game not even thinking about buying any premium credits in this game.","April 1","false","2.4"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","3"

This is a Steam game. Why do I need to create another account to play your game?\n\nThis is a stupid gateway to get to your game. Use the platform that you're already on.\n\nThe first 2 games were great, but gameplay is always sacrificed under the free2play model. Robot Entertainment is showing a serious lack of innovation on this one. I loved the first 2 games so much. This game is those games, except that they slapped on a serious helping of Dungeon Defenders. If you like that sort of thing, I'm sure you'll love this one; but this feels like the developers were in a huge creative slump, so they took all of their traps from the first games, threw in a handful of new hero types, and decided to nickle and dime their players.\n\nThe tragedy is that the new maps are great, and make me want to play it. But, in order to make the game a MOBA, you're not really allowed to route the hordes in any meaningful ways. You're not allowed to block off any passages; sure, I get that, but what about blocking off passages that would route the hordes a different direction? Nope, can't do that. Because we want to milk the Dungeon Defenders cow. The second level had several spawn points for the hordes, so I tried to be creative and route them into a single killbox. Not allowed.\n\nSorry if I sound angry. I just know that the developers will make this their new money stream, and they won't make a truly gamer-focused experience, at least for the forseeable future. It's a shame.","March 30","false","1.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

I've played 100s and 100s of hours between the alpha, closed beta, and open beta.  I never write steam reviews but I just felt compelled to write one for OMDU.  I'm a huge fan of OMD and OMD2.  And an even bigger fan of OMDU.\n\nPROS:\n• Survival Mode allows one to five people to group against minions.  This is very similar to OMD2 gameplay with a few main differences.  1) Unchained Meter which puts you into a crazy killing machine mode.  2) OMDU Heroes and bosses show up during the waves.  3) You can place guardians to help you.\n• ENDLESS!  Just like in OMD2, you can play Endless in OMDU Survival after you reach a certain level.  It is SO MUCH FUN!  It is by far my favorite mode in the game and I want to play it all the time.  One to five man endless, with scoreboards and everything.  Go for combos and score, or go for the most waves on the scoreboard.\n• The game is very balanced for being in Beta.  I'd love to see some tuning for Zoey who is a total boss in the right hands.  Any balance changes needed are fairly minor.\n• The art is fun and playful.  The trait cards are hilarious as well as the "loss game" art.  The maps are pretty as well.\n• The humor is great.  The tutorials, dances, and some of the character comments and jokes are so funny.\n• Siege can be played 5 v Bots (Siege Coop) or 5v5 (Siege PVP).  If you have two well matched teams, the games are so exciting, energetic, and strategic.  I've had some of the most fun I've ever had in any game I've played (and I've played a lot of different games) by playing OMDU team games in Siege and Siege Custom matches.  Trying to figure out if they are going to push a certain lane, go for objectives, defend, sneak around you, go for your guardian or gates, murder your teammates prior to the wave spawning, etc.. There's just so much strategy that can happen.\n• There's a huge amount of traps, traits, guardians, trinkets/gear, and minions you can acquire.  You can decide what type of deck you want and go for those cards.\n• The game is free to play.  You can acquire EVERYTHING by playing except for some cosmetic skins.  If you want certain heroes faster, you can buy a package or go for chests with money.  It's definitely not pay to win because the heroes are balanced and you won't lose just because you don't have a certain hero or trap or trait.  I find it funny that people are calling this pay to win.\n• Any trap upgrading and potions are only allowed in Survival games (PVE) so it doesn't affect PVP matches.  If you lose, it's going to be because you didn't play as a team as well as the other team did.\n• The developers listen and act very quickly on items.  Case in point, they patched the day after release of Open Beta due to people's comments.  An example is they saw people complain that it was hard to acquire new heroes so they upped the material rewards for it.  Please remember though that this is a free to play game and if you enjoy the game, why not throw $10 at the devs and purchase some new heroes.  They obviously do need to make some money off of this.  I don't personally feel that's unreasonable.  You don't have to have a certain hero to win… it's very balanced and they're each unique and fun.\n• The amount of content they consistently add is fantastic.  New maps, new heroes, new traits, traps, and bosses.  It feels like almost every patch is unique and grand.\n• I've had no lag and no crashes.\n\nCONS:\n• It is a little bit of a grind right now for epic or unique materials.  You don't have to have these to play or be competitive however you can really make your experience unique and it can be fun trying to acquire extra bosses, guardians, minions, traps, and traits.\n• It's a little hard right now to figure out where you go to obtain certain materials but it's not impossible.  There are people developing online resources for that and I'm sure more tool tips will be implemented.  They are constantly improving that.\n• There's a few maps right now in Survival that only allow you to place traps in certain areas.  It's very clear on the map where you can place traps but some people don't like that and don't want to be limited.  Those are the maps that are a copy from the list of Siege maps.  The ones that are designed strictly for Survival mode allow you to place traps pretty much anywhere… just like OMD2.  :)\n• Each character has their unique weapon and you can't choose your weapon like you could in OMD2.  This doesn't bother me but I know that bothers some people so thought I'd mention it.\n\nNote:  I see people complain about Gameforge.  I don't have to deal with Gameforge because I play in North America.  The game itself though is fantastic and is constantly being improved and added to.","April 1","true","270.8"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

It also is a terrible that the lvl you are is based on your hero's lvl as it means if I play multiple heros my lvl would dramatically exceed that of a person who only plays 1 hero.\n\nAt the start I would be getting matches with 4-5 people for a survival match. Now im getting like 3 in 10-30 mins depending on the day and at worst a hour. Also I rarely am able to win a match because I am constantly being forced into soloing and 3 party matches where the trap dependance is at a considerable high. I am resorting to using the all chat to add people to party up with and even then its hard to find people around one's lvl.\n\nAlso cant craft a specific trap for cash because I had only gotten 11 of a crystal needed to make it out of all the matches Ive played. I am also a etherel mote junkie because you really do need them as slowely as the come. I also have enough troll gibets to kill a horse which would be as pointless on having soo many.\n\nBesides that I like the game as it offers a interesting mix of tower defense and moba like experience with certain aspects that I appreciate.

Yes, there's traps, but they're so incidental to the gameplay that they're almost not even worth thinking about.\n\nThe traps, by necessity can't just outright slaughter waves as you'd expect from the game's sister titles. Counter to a traditional MOBA where mobs fight each other in lanes, in OMDU the traps are the only thing standing in the way of the mobs, and because once the traps are placed they're untouchable by the other team they serve merely to reduce pressure on one lane; you still have to run back to do something about the wave. This results in a large portion of the gameplay that simply doesn't feel good (not that you're given the space to design fun mazes even if it did).\n\nRemove the traps from the equation and you're left with tepid, uninspired PvP that feels a pillowfight, floaty and not very impactful, and a leveling system that's easily unbalanced and makes it hard to recover if you're behind. There's simply no reason to choose OMDU over a more refined, better balanced MOBA at the moment.","April 8","false","11.3"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","37","71","2","0"

DD2 managed to realize the mistake it was making and pulled out of its tailspin, largely scrapping their game and starting fresh. OMD:U seems to have made the same realization, with its dramatic shift to putting in more PVE survival content, but the moba aspect remains, a milstone around the game's neck.\n\nTraps and items suffer most in this transition. Where in OMD1 and 2 you could customize your favorite traps with special abilities, that feature is absent in Unchained. Absent too are several weapons. Wind Belt? Gone. Bone Amulet? Gone. Vampiric Gauntlets? Gone. Those items that remain are heavily curtailed from previous versions, and lack the interactions that made them fun. The Ice Amulet, for instance, now has a large cooldown attached to it, and there's no hammer in Unchained to score big damage against frozen ogres and trolls. It's understandable why these changes are made, but only because the game is beholden to its moba elements.\n\nThe survival mode is lacking, the grind is intense, and the series once beloved traps are sidelined. It's nice to see Robot trying to make some changes, but as of now OMD:U gets a stamp of avoid. Put it on the shelf with the other games in the last few years that tried to chase the moba rabbit and failed.","May 18","false","0.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","1"

You should be able to get heroes much easier because that is a huge part of the game.\nThe last con is the micro transactions, as all gamers know, they really mess up games when you get big spenders and along with micro transactions comes more difficulty to get items while not paying real money. I would really like to see most micro transactions taken out and to revert more to orcs must die 2 style where its much easier to buy items and heroes.\n\n\nThe reason I recommend the game is because it is in open beta and yet it has minimal bugs and runs smoothly and has content, so try the beta out and see what the devs will change and then make a decision to buy it or not when it comes out.","April 2","true","29.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","1"

You will be given time to build traps etc but as soon as the game starts, the system will tell everyone that the game will immediately close due to an incomplete team.\n\n- Many many more!\n\nSeriously botched. It's open beta, which tells me that these problems should have been addressed by now. By all means, stay tuned with this game to see if they bother to fix any of these horrendous issues. I can't recommend it at the moment unless you are either: A) not intending to buy anything with real money, or B) don't mind having to wait for games to drop due to leavers or disconnectors.

Second, you have to find your friends all over again because it doesn't use the Steam system.\n\nBut that's not the worst part. The grind is real. I need hundreds more items before I can do my first crafting.  You have to play the same things over and over and over again.  This might not be so bad if you like PvP, which is what this is geared toward, but my preference is co-op. So my co-op partner and I have to do the same 3 levels over and over again to get to the point where we can craft items and get to the next level.\n\nThe game might be sort of OK if you are into PvP (but still not nearly as good as OMD2 as explained below).  A lot of the best things about it are only available in PvP, like the minion cards. But that just makes it worse for those of us who prefer solo or co-op play. You can see some cool things that you can't reach unless you are playing PvP.\n\nHere's an example from OMD2.  In that game, you could buy archers and swordsmen and put set them up to help you with your traps.  You can't do that in SP or Co-op.  You get a single guardian, and when that guardian dies, it dies for all the upcoming waves too.\n\nAnother example of going backwards is that in OMD2, you had a lot of options of where to put traps and a huge variety of traps.  Trust me, you won't get nearly that many different traps in this game unless you put hundreds of hours into it or pay real money for upgrades. Also, there are small, clearly defined areas where you can put your traps.  You can't just place them anywhere. That glorious death march you sent enemies on during OMD2? Completely gone.\n\nI feel what is at the heart of what is wrong with this game is the free-to-play model.  Much of the fun stuff is trapped behind paywalls. Sure, you can get it by grinding for hundreds of hours, but who wants to do that?  Literally, I'm not sure I've ever played a game that casually expects you to grind this much.  After 2 hours of play, I am not even close to crafting a single item of any type.  It's just too much.\n\nThis game is kind of fun for awhile, but overall very disappointing.","April 2","false","2.3"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","0"

The devs have been working on solutions to these problems and have done a great job so far, making heroes much more accessible, and they've done it all with no progress wipes.\n\nSiege mode is a great take on MOBA pvp, although a surrender button would be appreciated, and Survival is still as great as it was in OMDU 1, but survival seems like the only real viable way to get any crafting materials to make new traps or items.\n\nEven with it's shortcomings this is still a solid game with great gameplay, and I would recommend trying whether you're a fan of OMD or MOBAs","March 31","true","90.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Recipes simplified ( They removed some resources from game, Ex. Kobold tears no longer exxist)\n\n2.Amount of Resources required to craft things reduced\n\n3. Now before the starting of the match you are able to pick ONE resource you want GURANTEED (You still will get other random resources at end of match too) to drop once you finish match. NOTE: Even if you lose you will still get resource (just not as much,also the amount you get is based on your performance during game)\n+This allows crafting to be more focused on getting EXACTLY what you want,whenever you want.\n\n4. IF you played BEFORE patch all resources you currently had that they have REMOVED from game will be CONVERTED INTO the NEW resources. Ex. Before patch i was unable to CRAFT any Traits,Minions, Bosses, Parts or Traps with my current resources AFTER conversion i was able  to craft 5 new traits i hadn't previously owned, 6 traps, 2 bosses, 4 minions, 8 Parts and 3 heroes (although i already had enough for bloodspike so 2 new heroes)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros(+)\n+Fun Gameplay (even with randoms)\n\n+Now has that same old OMD feel with minimal Grind\n\n+Enjoyable matchmaking (most of the time.... every game has its trolls and noobs)\n\n+Variety of New and mostly Original chars that all have unique abilities that can help or support the team with direct roles\n\n+Challenging\n\n+ Friendly Community (Again mostly)\n\n+Intuitive tutorial that teaches you pretty much everything (with ingame video clips that show you how something works/behaves before you buy them)\n\n+Not p2w (EVERYTHING & ANYTHING is craftable except for Skins which have no impact on gameplay except maybe intimidation when u have a badass wolf in a pink frilly tutu on a with bows in its hair,ermm fur)\n\n+Decent queue times\n\n+Active moderators that will sometimes group up with players and actively play with people ingame and give tips and will answer anyquestion you may have( NOTE: there hasent been not ONE week were i havent seen at least one moderator or admin not play.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons(-)\n-Not enough purchaseble skins (it rlly sucks that most skins are embedded in chest that have random drop chance even when buying highet tier that does guarantee a legendary but it may just be a resource or trait)\n\n-Currently Only 2 different siege maps\n\n-No Ingame Report button currently , must send ticket to report on  their website\n\n-Games can be quite annoying when one of your team members are afk or disconnect during match, theres like a instant 70% chance you will lose (there needs to be away to somehow give the team a buff ( like a slightly reduced spawntime) or maybe have like the AI take over for that missing person(s)\n\n| Overall 8.8/10 |\n\n****ALSO FOR ALL YOU BIASED F-ERR'S OUT THERE STOP GIVING THIS GAME A BAD RATING JUST BECAUSE ITS PUBLISHED THROUGH GAMEFORGE, DOES NOT AUTOMATICCALY MEAN ITS RUBBISH.....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braeken/recommended/427270/","Braeken","Braeken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braeken/","343 products in account","I love Orcs Must Die. It's an excellent game. 2 was even better. But this? It murders it completely.\n\nTo be fair, there is some good to this. The multitude of different heroes adds a nice change - the lack of different character options in previous games was one of the downsides for me. The levels in this are also quite interesting, at least the few I've played.\n\nBut the cons far outweigh the pros for me here. For starters, cash shop. Minute those words come up, a game gets major down points with me. I knew about the CS in this before I'd even tried it, from other reviews, and it put me off trying it for a time. In the end, I decided to try it anyway. The CS isn't as bad as I'd expected - you can still get heroes and traps without paying by grinding for the items to craft them.\n\nBut.\n\nNow, if it this was like the other games and purely PvE, this wouldn't be too much of an issue. Though some players would get the stuff faster, it wouldn't directly impact the play of F2P players much. It might even help somewhat if they're random matchups were with paid players, who'd be good help (in theory, anyway). The issue with it might be that paid players could get up leaderboards and the like easier, but that's not exactly the end of the world. But siege mode - which, as a concept, sounds fun - will be affected by the CS. Players who pay will be more powerful, and more than likely mash the free players into the ground. Fair? Not so much. By which I mean, not at all. If you intend to do more than the PvE on it, it's Pay to Win. Or at least Pay-to-have-a-hugely-overwhelming-advantage.\n\nBut the cash shop isn't the only issue I take with this game. For one thing, because the matches are on servers, that means the servers run even if the players aren't all ready yet. I've played single player, because I'm not really one for putting up with random groups - I tend to get the players who'd fight each other as much as the orcs (not literally, but you get the idea). But if the match takes time to load, sometimes you end up in the match which has already progressed to the point where orcs are pouring through the rift you haven't had time to defend at all. Not so helpful.\n\nAnother thing is that the traps, whilst useful, just don't seem to have the effectiveness that they'd had in previous games. Half, usually more, of the fighting that goes on in matches seems to fall down to my character and guardians. Part of this is due to the traps themselves seeming a little on the weak side, but also partly due to the way the orcs spawn. They tend to come at you in huge groups that your traps simply cannot handle, whereas in the previous games the waves were more spread out, so at least your traps had time to reset before more orcs came at them.\n\nWhilst there's a chance this game could improve, at the current time, I wouldn't suggest this game to people. You're better off buying 1 and 2.","April 28","false","7.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

While it does have that element it's so-so. It still keeps it's great humor as well .Main reasons why I think there will be problems are:\n1. You need to get materials to craft traps, minions you can summon and get heroes so players with more play time techniclly have an advantage. This wouldn't be a problem if there was no PvP element.\n2. Another take on the DOTA clone genre. While it does a lot of innovation I don't see this making people stop their DOTA or LoL or SMITe or whatever you play and focus on this. While fun I don't see this mode keeping many players.\n3. Published by Gameforge. Anyone who knows anything about Gameforge knows they are terrible. I mean the guys managed to kill EU Tera servers.\n\nSo in conclusion wait and see if it sticks around. "MOBA" games usually die or prosper really early on. So unless you are really REALLY into this wait and see.

I have been a large fan of the series for awhile and was looking forward to this game because I'd enjoy it more with more friends being able to play. But due to the limited settings and RNG ontop of RNG I will not be recommending this game at this time. I enjoy my time in games, and as an educated gamer understand that time itself does not make a game great, it's what you do in that time. In order to play well and have fun I am required to grind endlessly just to get the basic loadout, let alone advance.\n\nI have no issues helping and funding games that show they are there to be entertaining, but I wont open my wallet for those tha simply do it out of greed.\n\nIf the RNG goes down and the game has better options to fund it. (Such as a buy option for say 30-40 that opens the entire game up) then I'll be happy to help fund there work, but nickle and dime tatics simply don't work on seasoned players.","April 6","false","3.4"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","19","37","0","0"

That's also rediculous, because that is ONE game mode. Besides, it's very fun and hardly feels standard. Choosing which minions to send and structuring your defenses makes it feel more like a Tug of War.\n\nI've also seen the complaint that it's pay to win. Yes and No. If hearthstone and league of legends is pay to win, then yes, you would also see this as pay to win. You start with a standard deck that once modified with a few cards, is really solid.\nIf the argument is that the grind is too high, then I disagree. Maybe it is too high for PvE (survival), but that is because there are Trap Tiers and consumerables. On the other hand for PvP (siege), after 30 or 40 hours you will have multiple layouts/decks. The prices are so low, that they are comparable to F2P shooter games that lend you the cards except, here you permanently get them.\nThey are still adjusting prices, they already wrote hero prices will be changed next patch. Besides, spending a few $/€/£ is perfectly okay, not every game feels that can use Dota 2's income model and get away with it.There are currently some technical issues and the playbase is not high enough to instantly find games 5 AM on a weekday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. However, I am not going to badly rate a very fun, solid, new, and original game low based on that.\n\nTL;DR: It's free and fun.\n5/7 - Looking forward to seeing this develop.\n\nBtw, they currently have a referral program that rewards players that sign up with one. About the same as 2 cheap heroes. If you know anybody that plays it then they have a link, you could create 2 accounts, or if all else fails you could use mine.\n\nHere:  http://en.omd.gameforge.com/registration.html?refbyfriend=0e1db7cf-f5b8-11e5-a83f-c81f66b90a86\n","April 2","true","142.8"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","24","47","2","2"

Basic minions (or creeps) are small and nigh faceless 'bullet sponges,' you can only place traps in blue areas, there's a limit to how many traps you can field, and you gather resources to craft basic items and upgrades. Or you could do what Robot Entertainment would rather you do and pay for the upgrades, heroes, and skins with real money in their cash shop.\n\nThis game may mean the end of the Orcs Must Die franchise as it has been known, as an authentic sequel would take away from what its developers are trying to do here: get rich quick or go broke in this modern MOBA gold rush.\n\nFans of classic OMD need not apply. You won't find much of what you loved in the originals under this game's hood except for the conspicuously familiar coat of paint that clashes jarringly with its unfulfilling gameplay.\n\nPlay OMD 2 instead, enjoy it, and long for the 4 player cooperative winner this game could have been.","April 11","false","8.3"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","27","53","0","0"

I've played for 13 hours and still do not have a single trap or hero unlocked that is actually good. Because it turns out only a few are worth using and everything else is just countered and left completely pointless the second you get matched up against someone with the end-game stuff already unlocked. Which has happened to me every game but 2 out of probably a little over 20. If you try sticking to the PvE mode then the players with the good traps just make you build barricades while they kill everything.\n\nTHIRTEEN HOURS THOUGH! Thirteen hours in to DOTA 2 you at least have a few little costume pieces. Thirteen hours in to Black Desert Online you can have a horse and a couple workers and be pretty on top of your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nPeople say by about 70 hours (level 50) you start to get a couple interesting options. If you don't pick the wrong thing on accident. Because then progress gets about 10x slower from looking at milestones beyond that point. I can't convince myself to invest 70 hours in to something just to see if it ~might~ get more interesting.","April 9","false","13.3"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","34","67","3","0"

Not a big MOBA person so was a bit worried at first with OMDU.  Survival in OMDU though is awesome.  If you're new to the series and just attack it as a brawler or like a MOBA in Survival, you're in for a rough ride.  But when you get with a group of strangers having to improvise a killbox together, putting all the tricks together (different traps to combo, killing in killbox to combo, creative walling to delay waves on one side so you can rotate over later, etc.) it is awesome.\n\nAfter getting a perfect score on the hardest difficulty on all the levels in OMD2, I had gotten used to the carefully planned killboxes, knowing exactly what was coming every wave.  With the random minions/doors each wave, the improvisation and cooperation really make OMDU Survival mode a standout.\n\nIf you're a MOBA fan, I haven't tried much siege mode as it's not my cup of tea.  I can guarantee that it is different than any other MOBA you've tried. This isn't a LoL/Dota clone.\n\nIf you've never tried an OMD game, there's a bit of a learning curve on Survival, but the community is friendly and there's nothing more satisfying than beating an especially hard match.\n\nIf you're an OMD1/2 fan, matchmaking will take away a lot of the control you're used to.  You'll also have to be patient about unlocking some of your favorite traps.  Still, the new heroes (omg, all the smolder damage with her unique trap), more traps, more types of enemies and supersize maps make OMDU Survival something special.","March 30","true","48.1"," 41 of 81 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","41","81","4","0"

Unchained although untraditional in many senses for an Orcs Must Die! game is far from a poor game. It still maintains much of the orginal content through Survival Mode and is just a more modern take on the game. I understand that this isnt what many were looking for but the game offers content that is very fun and is still truly free to play. If the PvP is not your thing like me then just aim for the Survival Mode instead of Siege Mode and it makes for a wonderful multiplayer experience with friends or alone. Also the crafting system makes for a wonderful amount of content that keeps pulling me back!

Many people don't like this publishing choice but the publishing choice is not a reason to dislike the game.\n\nIt has MOBA tagged also which is getting some hate, Its only 1 gamemode, there is still our survival that OMD fans love! Also the seige is a lot funner than people are expecting, you get your OWN minions and have to defeat the ENEMY rift. ! realise that it was a big change in OMD but people should embrace the changes, it may be a new step for OMD!\n\nAnother thing people are criticising the game about is availability with crafting, it is pretty hard to get enough resources to craft items, there are easier crafting items such as a number of traps and a number of traits. Crafting heroes just needs a bit of time to gwt but don't worry there are new guest heroes every week to help decide your first hero that you want to craft. Crafting just takes time and I'm sure if you play it, youll get them in a breeze!\n\nThere are a few bugs and glitches but the devs have recently made a survey which people can enter their findings that they found and they will try and fix it.\n\n\nI have played this game for many hours and will play for the many hours to come. I recommend downloading and giving it a shot, doesn't bashing orcs to death sound fun!\n\nGood Work Devs, Keep it up!\n\nP.S Don't worry about the haters, they just don't think its the same anymore but I think its a new step in OMD history","April 5","true","34.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Free to play and with player vs player moba style mode? Not what I was hoping for! But they have really improved things over the las tyear. I played over 100 hours of this game during the closed beta over the last year.\n\nWas expecting crap but this has turned out much better than I was expecting so far. I really ho pepeople give this game a proper chance as in more than just a few minutes. Especially old fans of the first two games, give this one a proper try please!\n\nThey started off with just player vs player with a moba style mode, but during this last year they have started to add PvE aspect to, sort of like the previous games Endless modes, sort of a survival style. I also hear more pve options are on the way as the game keeps getting worked on.\n\nIt is not perfect and I was expecting the worst, but after giving it a bunch of time adn seeing the game improved over the last year, I am pretty impressed with the game and the improvements the devs have done lately.\n\nDo me a favor and atleast give this game a try, it is one of the few free to play games that I enjoy, I have not once felt like I had to spend real money on this game, over the last year it has been no problem to get items and traps just by playing the game. Still some work to do on things just as AI and hopefully they continue to add more to the PVE aspects, but this is a much better start than i was expecting! Also nice to see it is on steam now finally, which will bring it to more gamers, I just hope people give it a proper chance and stick with the game as it is being worked on and improved. I thought the worst, but have been surprised with its progress so far. The game offers some PVE and some PVP, check them both out and maybe see you online!","March 30","true","30.7"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","18","36","0","0"

It struck a perfect balance between trap and player damage, allowing you to create a great kill box and sit back, a decent one and pick up the slack with player damage, or just kite your way to victory with pure player damage.  Absolute brilliant game & level design.\n\nOMD2 faired less well.  They shifted the focus to players being required to do most of the damage and traps were just there to help out a bit.\n\nOMDU is complete and utter garbage.  Not only did they take the OMD2 model and make it even more about player damage, especially with patch 1.2, they had the absolutely idiotic design choice of forcing players to stick in place for a time before they can attack.  That's right, no kite killing, no chasing down an enemy bashing at it... you have to get out in front of them and stop, wait, and then attack as they run by you yet again.  The player has literally become another stuck in place trap that can be run around.  Add to this the 'free-2-pay-more' greed, a focus on adding needless shrubery to the environment, painfully bad map design for kill boxing/multi-level gaming/pathing or any type of real creativity, no campaign, a crazy number of bugs for a Beta, and recycled audio... this game is the biggest disappointment of recent memory.\n\nRobot Entertainment has alienated a fan today.","June 1","false","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A 'mixed" option would be the best rating for OMDU, or a 3/5 stars.\n\nWhile it is fun and is similar to OMD2 (which I enjoyed very much), I'm constantly being disconnected after finishing public matchmade matches. Now that is frustrating on its own, but when there is a penalty for players who leave before a match is over, it makes the experience much worse. When I get disconnected after the match, the system takes it as a mid-game disconnect, and thus penalizes me by preventing me from starting another match for X amount of minutes. Apparently the issue causing this post-game disconnection has been found. but a fix has not yet been implemented.\n\nIn short: The game is fun, and the experience overall is good, but you may constantly find yourself being disconnected post-match (and be unable to start a new one right after due to the penalty).","May 6","false","38.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It's in beta right now, but all progress you make in the game will carry over into release. I have been enjoying the game so far, but I don't see the fun lasting long in it's current state. (Barricades Must Die) There are lots of problems I've seen already, between the unfun and unnecessary grind for materials and loot rewards for leveling up or finishing a game, and the later levels in Survival mode, taking up to 50 minutes to complete, with no option to pause the game and the time constraints between waves, where you, yourself have to run all over the map to loot every single item that drops before the next wave comes or risk losing it. In Siege mode, especially against other players, where games can take up to an hour to complete, I do not feel like the material rewards justify the time investment, though the game mode is extremely well done and fun otherwise.\n\nI feel like some changes they are making already are both good and bad. I see a lot of issues that could potentially ruin the game with them having specific "siege" heroes vs "survival" heroes, almost forcing people to play certain heroes in the different game modes, especially at higher levels. Overall, I've enjoyed the game but definitely feel they have their hands full with balancing the game between the two game modes and either making the material grind easier, or at least make it feel more optional to take on the higher level maps with less upgraded traps. I will look forward to seeing what they do with the game and will definitely play A LOT more when they tackle some of these issues. Good and fun Co-op gameplay that just needs some minor tweaks!","April 27","true","147.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskedklaus/recommended/427270/","maskedklaus","Reverend Klaus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskedklaus/","495 products in account","I feel like this game is getting a lot of semi-underserved hate for not just being more of the same ol' OMD (and some deserved hate for the F2P elements)! It's resigned to be a 5 player co-op experience, and a 5v5 competitive experience. If you've played the previous games and are wondering about this one, here's what you should know...\n\n--Classic Gameplay--\nThe classic "defending against waves" format is back in the form of Survival Mode. With this you can team up with up to four other players to defend against waves of enemies. The places you can construct traps are a little more restrictive, and the traps don't quuuiiite have the pop they did in previous games. This is because, hey, there's 5 of you. That's a lot of firepower from the heroes, so the traps seem more toned down. Still, they are essential, and plenty of fun. Most of all, it's a lot of fun to actually get to play OMD with more than just 1 friend, and I think overall the mode feels balanced and is a lot of fun...with friends you know. Random groups...less so.\n\n--Siege Mode--\nThis is the competitive 5v5 mode. It is very similar to a MOBA like DOTA2 or LOL, but also pretty damn different. There are still traps and minions, but now each team is leading their own minions to their enemy's rift. It'd be hard to explain everything, but you gain points to power up your portal(s), allowing your team to summon better and better minions (which you get to choose just like your traps). Each hero has really well defined strengths, and you even chose your roll before the match starts, giving you actual bonuses based on what you intend to do. Compared to most MOBAs it's pretty simple, but the added tower defense mechanics make it a surprising amount of fun once you get into it.\n\n--Unlockables--\nI think this is a sticking point for a lot of people. This game is F2P, so prepare for microtransactions. You can certainly get by without paying anything, and you'll still be able to eventually unlock every hero, trap, minion, and item. But it's fairly slow going. After the tutorials and about 5 siege matches I managed to unlock 2 traps, 3 minions, aaand...well, that's pretty much it. Unlocking heroes  take forever, and there are only 5 free heroes in rotation at a time (out of like...12, so, not a huge deal). The real kicker is unlocking items requires the classic skulls...AND materials, of which there are a pretty big variety. They drop randomly during matches, and are rewards for logging-in, quests and leveling up, buuut if you aren't lucky it might take forever to get the Radiant Gears you need to get that new trap. Plus traps/items/minions are rated by rarity, and the rarer ones require even harder to get items. What's worse, you can buy heroes, but you can't buy traps, minions or items. You can just buy chests that MIGHT contian the materials you need. It's an ok system if you plan to play a lot, because it'll give you a lot to constantly strive for, but for a lot of people I can see this being a deal breaker. Frankly, I don't blame you if it is.\n\nTLDR; It's different than the previous OMD games, but there's a lot to love here. The gameplay is exactly what it needs to be. However, if not for that great gameplay, the grind required for unlocking all those sweet traps/minions/items would be almost unforgivable.","March 31","true","13.2"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","19","39","0","2"

If you don't, maybe you'll like killing bears. Doesn't really matter. If you like horde killing with buddies, you'll love this game. This is one of my favorite game series, and I beat both of the first two. With more heroes and different unique mechanics for each, it makes playing co-op that much more appealing to everyone. However, I am sad there is no bladestaff weapon character, as it was my favorite setup in OMD2. I'm looking forward to more characters, more enemies and more laughs. This could quickly become my most played game on steam, right above KF. Traps, accessability, progression, cards, crafting. It has a variety of features, although I would recommend robot give everyone enough materials to purchase a single hero, just to get started. Especially if you have a bunch more heroes planned. Everyone needs a starting point. Or you could go the LoL route and rotate free heroes.\n\nBottom line, F2P, fun, fresh, humorous with a ton of potential, in both playstyle customization and map variety.\n\nI rate: Try it, support the devs if you like it.\nNo actual rating until the game releases fully.","March 29","true","96.8"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","0"

This... this is not orcs must die. It has a couple of characters from orcs must die, and the monsters are from orcs must die... but that's really about it...\n\nOrcs-must-die is a fast-paced beatemup-survival type towerdefence game where nearly endless waves of monsters rush at you at once, each trying to reach the mcguffin you are defending with your life, forcing you to rely on your quick-thinking, fast reflexes, and powerful weapons, traps, and spells to defeat them.\n\nOrcs-must-die is placing a new barricade directly behind a barricade that's seconds away from being destroyed and placing twice as many traps to defend it mid-round. it's placing three paladins down in a row in the middle of the hallway while four archers and two dwarves cover them from the platform above. Orcs-must-die is rapidly spam-clicking your bladestaff for a hithithithithithithithit on twenty enemies at once before swapping to your blunderbus or acid bombs to take out the flying units above you. Orcs must die is carefully picking the spells, weapons, traps, and guardians you want at your side, and upgrading them in a way that suits you best and makes them do the job you need them to do.\n\nIn this? Well for one thing I’ve tried three different heroes (one even being described as a fast-hit-and-run type) and not once did i ever experience the rapid-fire attacks of the beautiful OMD2. not once did i ever feel i got more then one attack in every two seconds. Not once was i given directions or information on how to look through my traps, learn about what they do, and pick which ones i want to use after upgrading them to my liking. And you can only place one paladin down and only in very specific spots? WTF? where are the archers or the dwarves? I have a huge-♥♥♥ hallway to defend here, why can't i have two or three paladins standing here defending it rather then lazing back where i don't need them?? Where are my spells? where are my multitude of magical weapons? Hell, here's a big one. Where the hell is the plot? or the character interaction? Orcs must die 2 had over twenty different levels, each with the warmage, sorceress, and archmage talking to and bantering off one another the whole time, giving the world a feeling of immersion and interest! Oh, and hey, here's another big one. Where the hell are the endless hordes of orcs! That's kind of the whole point! I've seen at most ten or twenty at once? And what's with the heroes? you don't need heroes! Gnolls, Trolls, and Ogres! THOSE are the big bads you need to look out for! Introducing enemy heroes you need to worry about does nothing but add more tediousness to an already terible MOBA blasphemy of a great brand!\n\nThis? This is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DOTA rippoff. This is not orcs must die. this makes me sick.\n\nWill i try it again? Possibly. I made a deal to try it again with a friend of mine who thinks it's really good after we beat orcs must die 2 together. will playing it more change my mind? Probably not. But I’m willing to give it a go.\n\nRobot Entertainment. You had a perfect game with orcs must die 2, and i will forever love you for it. it had a great plot, amazing gameplay, funny characters, and a satisfying ending. you could have left the franchise there and it would be good. I can only hope that if you ever plan on making any more orcs must die games, you realize the mistake that unchained was and go back to the formula that was perfection.\n\n\np.s. what's this about the war mage having a crush on someone called the disciple? What nonsense is this? War mage X Sorceress for life.","April 12","false","0.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","15","31","2","1"

I bought the first one shortly after its release and I have been in love with it ever since. I still fire it up occasionally just to kill a couple Orcs. When the 2nd one released I felt like their focus on Multiplayer detracted from the experience of the single player. It was still possible to play on your own, but at least the first part was a chore.\n\nAnd now we come to this. Single Player? Forget it. Much like games like Smite, which the Siege Mode reminds me of, there is no single player. This is a Multiplayer only title. Single player is in there only in the Practice Levels, so congratulations, I hope you got friends to play with, because coordinating with a bunch of strangers in a PUG match, about how to build kill boxes is neigh impossible.\n\nThe Maps are even more Lane based, reminding me of Mobas like Smite where minions are pushed down lanes, and this example becomes even more glaring in the Siege Mode where two teams fight each other. You have to build traps and send minions down the lane.\n\nSpeaking of building traps, remember how fun that was in OMD 1 and 2? Yeah, not so much here. Traps do not seem to have any impact on the Orcs. Sure, it does Damage, but there are no animations corresponding to it. It doesn't feel like the traps hit the Orcs. Sure they throw them up in the air, but it lacks the visceral feel the first two games had.\n\nThe Oomph that made the first two games so enjoyable is gone. Gone are also other mechanics such as Headshots. They even make fun of it during the Tutorial saying “Aiming for the head does nothing but feels good”. No it doesn't. It makes no difference. It feels like I do a pittance of damage to the enemies, and I do not even get rewarded for aiming properly. Every Hero coming with their locked in weapon abilities and one special thingy. I am writing thingy because its not even guaranteed to be a trap.\n\nSome Heroes and their abilities are clearly designed for PvP. Its more than clear that the MOBA like Siege Mode is where they want you to play with most of the heroes.\n\nThe Animations of the Heroes are also a bit stilted and overall I can't but help feel like the B-Team has been working on this. Like they gathered the interns, gave them some pointers and access to the graphic assets and let them run wild. Now you might be saying “But its beta”, yeah well Beta doesn't excuse the poor Animation quality in my book. It also doesn't excuse how floaty the traps feel, or how grindy everything became.\n\nSpeaking of grindy.. I hope you like random rewards and booster packs. Traps are now cards, which you have to find in chests. But fear not you occasionally get a chest and hope you get something useful out of it. If not.. don't worry the cashshop is quite in your face, so don't worry about leaving some money. And of course heroes have to be bought. You can earn them (or rather craft them) Warframe style. Grind, grind, grind with random rewards, hoping you get what you want and then grind some more.\n\nIt makes me sad that this is what OMD has turned into. Nothing I enjoyed in OMD 1 and 2 is being found in this game. Instead I get a soulless cash grab. And if you haven't caught on by now.. Avoid like the plague, it will just ruin your fond memories of OMD.","April 10","false","1.1"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","2"

I've won over 20 matches, more than I've lost, I've added 3-4 traps to my itinerary, some rare, I've crafted two ability item thingies, I've crafted two trait cards and need one more to have a full deck of my own customization and I've crafted a war mage. So pay to win, I don't really think so, I haven't spent a penny. Answer: NO!\n\nCO-OP?\n\nThis game is really about teamwork, from the beginning if you don't agree with your team mates as of which hero each of you is going to use, who defends, who attacks and who pillages, then inevitable failure is near. This is not DOTA 2 or league of legends, although it has elements of these lane pushing games. This is also Orcs Must Die, a tower defense action game. Keep in mind I mainly play siege PVP. YES!\n\nCan smart people and dumb people play it?\n\nIt is easy to learn, my friend coached a new member of our team as of what to do and we won, despite having this newbie on our team, who at first was playing very badly and my friend told him so. By the end of the game and at our victory, he knew what to do, and in fact had collected the steak and cooked it to spawn our boss minion. But this game takes time to master, there are melee and ranged characters, with strengths, weaknesses and unique abilities, in my opinion the game is masterfully balanced, these developers know what they are doing. Some characters require more strategy, some are just ravagers, all are fun to play with and in my experience, each one caters to a different playstyle. YES!\n\nIs it cool and funny?\n\nDamn yes, this is a funky and funny game, just as much as the other Orcs Must Die games. It's wickedly cool, characters are hillarious, and seeing orcs dismembered, well, that's a matter of taste.\n\nUPDATE! 70 hours in, I'm almost at level 80 (75), I have unlocked two warmages, StinkEye and BlackPaw, upgraded a trap, have loads of resources and am having lots of fun. I've won 61 matches. I love this game.\n\nI think the negative reviews come from people who know the game is in beta and just want the developers to give away more goodies. The way I see it they've been very generous already, it's a shame people have that attitude, give an inch, take a mile. Because, I hope it doesn't put people of playing the game. My opinion, try it for yourself.\n\n(One suggestion, please allow players to place guardians in siege, that would be awesome!)\n\nUPDATE! 100 hours in on steam, and about 50 hours in on Gameforge. I love this game! What can I say, it is so addictive. Siege PVP is where I play the most, although upgrading traps in survival is cool and fun. I just love the team work, I love the way the games laid out, if you are starting, try pillaging, because you don't really need great minions or traps for that. Once you get better and have better minions attack, Once you have really got the hang of the game and have nice traps defend. Don't just run around and then complain about the game. I enjoy this game so much more than Dota 2 and I believe it is deeper and more strategic. This game is not just a gem, it is the Pink Panther baseball sized diamond!\n\nSo I'm 160 hours into this game, just on this account, about 100 on the gameforge account. I love this game so much I bought the Ultimate Pack, just to support the developers. Thank you for all the fun!","April 6","true","236.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

A lot of the gameplay seems to sort of be there, but it feels more weighted down. Movement feels much more clunky and the fun of being able to run around in battles is much less exciting and rewarding. Things feels more condensed and even traps are much less impressive.\n\nThis seems to be because some things had to be balanced, de-emphasized or made a bit faster. It makes sense for the type of game because it is now more focused on multiplayer. However this takes out much of the charm the other two games have had for me.\n\nSo in summary: If you are looking for Orcs Must Die gameplay, this game only sort of delivers. It has a different purpose, and I'm sure it's good for people who like that. But for me? I'm going to take a pass. I hope they do another game more like the other two in the future.\n","April 9","false","0.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vorrrace/recommended/427270/","Vorrrace","<.GP}Cmdo.Delta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vorrrace/","168 products in account","Few days ago, I made a negative review for the game. Not because the game is absolute trash but because for a F2P game, it was too heavy grind. I would have not called this P2W game as half the game is just coop and the PvP part of the game is not affected by trap upgrades and stuff like that. It's pretty much impossible for a player to pay and make the PvP unfair for those who didnt pay. But the game was feeling like a P2P because it was so long to unlock something that most people would have been disgusted before even starting to grind. Add to this the heroes and traps feel weak and the rewards for playing/leveling were not awesome. It was the perfect conditions to make this game a complete fail because only the hardcore fans, who can stand heavy grinding, would have played.\n\nI have to admit I was very surprised how fast the devs reacted to massive complains about insane grinding. They quickly adjusted rewards for leveling, changed missions so they are not too painful and boring to do (those missions were forcing you to play a given hero and people that were not able to get their hero at beginning of the game were just rage quitting to queue again, mehhh!!). So yeah, not only surprised but impressed too. They proven they were ready to listen and bring some change to keep a good playerbase which is good. The game is not easy, you still have to grind but the grind is fair. You can unlock a new hero pretty quickly compared to before. Honestly, I think it's fair.\n\nNow let's give the good and the bad of this game:\n\nPROS:\n- PvE and PvP (everyone will be happy!!!)\n- PvE up to 5 players in coop\n- Progress thru crafting\n- lot of heroes VS only 2 in the OMD 1/2\n- Trap upgrades are not available in PvP\n- Free rotations of heroes (seems to change every week??)\n- Daily quests + missions + daily rewards\n- Devs seems to care about feedback as they made tons of changes since the open beta\n\nCONS:\n- Grinding required but never as heavy as it was at the beta release\n- Survival (same mode as OMD 1 and 2) is not feeling as awesome as the previous games\n\n\nHonestly, I like very much the idea behind the PvP and the fact that there is no trap upgrades allowed in PvP. This way, if you just unlocked traps you are as strong as a player that would have played so much hours that he would have all his traps to tier 3. And crafting a trap is much much more easier than upgrading them. So I believe it makes the P2W pretty much impossible and it keeps the game fair. A newcomer as equal chances to wreck than a long time player. Also, it's pretty easy to buy new minions so again, games wont be completely unbalanced and unfair for new players. The only issue that could happen is the balance of heroes. But this is true in almost every games like League of Legends, Dota, etc. Hero balance will be the hardest part. I hope they are going to work hard on this and listen carefuly to players review. But What I heard is like 5-6 heroes were removed from the open beta due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance. They wanted to rework them before releasing them again when they would be less OP. I hope it's true because that would be just perfect to me.\n\nThe survival is the same mode as OMD 1 and 2. The traps and heroes feel weak at beginning. It's due to the fact you level up quifckly and you need to upgrade traps which take alot of time. It's going to be the hardest part. If you are playing with friends and splitting the duty of upgrading traps, it can helps alot. Also, some heroes feel weak at first but synergized very well with some traps or other heroes. This will be your job to discover the best combos and how to reveal the power of every hero. But so far, I seen some heroes I was considering poop being useful in unexpected ways.\n\nI honestly think that when you're done upgrading your traps, the surivval mod looks like OMD 1 and 2 but more challenging as it is a 5 man coop (harder to coordinate a bigger team). And I enjoy very much what they did about the PvP. The idea is very great. I know alot of people are complaining this game is not like OMD 1 and 2. Well guess what? It is the reason it's not called OMD 1 and 2 lol. And I think it's ok the devs try new things. Bringing back the same game over and over again, this is the real boring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things. I prefer devs that try new things. If I wanted to play OMD 1 and 2, I would just go play OMD 1 and 2 lol. I would not play this game. So yeah, I think for a F2P, OMDU is just more than fine and enjoyable. I decided to put some money in it because the devs proved me they were listenning and the game overall is far from being broken and bad. Just try it. You can decide you dont enjoy it. But I dont believe it's a fair reason to give a negative review to say that "this game is bad because it's not OMD 1 or 2"... come on lol.","April 6","true","33.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","14"

I love the concept. The combination of PFS and TD. And I've been longing to play this game together with more than one friend (as was the fact in OMD2).\n\nBut OMD!U is another great gaming concept almost ruined by the Free 2 Play business model.\n\nFact: The investors and devs must earn their money some way or other.\n\nThis requires placing some portion of the game's potential behind a paywall. But this makes the game pretty much like the old days where players paid a fixed fee to unlock the whole game. The investors want max profits. So they turn to the addictive and gullible nature in most of us (and perhaps us gamers in particular). This has caused a surge in games choosing the F2P business model.\n\nFor not to be accused of making a Pay 2 Win/Pay 2 Progress-game, there must be a way to attract as many players as possible by offering a grindwall.\n\nBy promising LOUD and clear that EVERY aspect of the game is available without having to sink ANY money in the game, the investors try to attract as many players as possible.\n\nAs with spam: If only a tiny fraction of the recipients bite, then the conman will strike rich.\n\nTo maximize the desire to climb a wall, a large enough portion of the fun must be located on the other side.\n\nIf the GRINDwall is too low then players will simply play themselves over it. =Money lost.\n\nFor fear of unhappy investors the devs will have to make the grindwall very high. This makes it impossible to climb for casual gamers.\nThe players who are willing to sink valuable hours of their lives playing a fun-restricted game should get just enough reward - slowly enough - to keep them coming back for more.\nBut they should also constantly be enticed to pay money to progress faster. The progress must therefore be sufficiently slow. There are many ways to conceal slow pace: long cooldowns, ineficcient traps, puny effects, little game impact,\n\nThe promise that the game will eventually become maximum fun should always loom above the next hill.\n\nThe grindwall will gradually increase the motivation to defend all the time invested in the game by paying for quicker advancement. In OMD!U it takes the form of chests providing completely random rewards. The more expensive chest you buy the greater the chance for rare loot and greater amounts of it.\n\nThis opens up the casino-part of most F2P-games.\n\nSince investors demand a maximization of profits, any player revealing him/herself as willing to play the casino game should be milked as much as possible before they realize they will never get to the greatest enjoyment of the game.\nOr they will have to pay a LOT, to reduce the chance of the game being pegged as P2W.\n\nThese gamblers must - after all - pay for the players who doesn't pay. Patching, content development, servers and bandwidth costs money.\n\nIf the gambling system is designed right the player should believe s/he got something good. But after playing a bit they should realize that it was not that good anyways, and be tempted to protect their earlier investments by gambling some more. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIt is human nature to throw more money after lost money, in order to somehow redeem or avoid losing the earlier investments.\n\nIf you read this thinking "The game is fun as it is": As yourself how much more fun you could have had with a fully unlocked game.\nIf you read this thinking "I can play myself over the grindwall": Ask yourself how many hours you think you'll have to play to get to the full enjoyment that the game can offer. And if you - perhaps - have gone bored by then. Perhaps you will leave the game having never experienced all the fun it could provide? Perhaps there are other games you could have enjoyed instead? Do you think you will live forever? Time is valuable, and we gamers should ask ourselves if gaming companies respect our time or not. They should focus on making games that gives us max amounts of fun, and charge a reasonable fee for it. -Rather than having us pay both valuable time and money to never get the full game.\n\nWhat if you could play every game and enjoy all its potential without having to pay with hours of reduced enjoyment?\n\nWhen you go to the cinema you can expect to pay a bit in both money and commercials. But after that you get the full movie, from start to finish, in all its glory.\nBut what if they offered a Free 2 Watch business model like F2P:\n- The movie starts great. You love the story, and decide to keep watching.\n- But there are loooong scenes of the hero brushing his/her teeth, eating dinner, reloading weapons, shooting the breeze. It is OK to watch. Not fun, but OK.\n- You will never get to see all the scenes of the movie (or its complete ending). Because when you do you're off the hook and have no incentive to keep wathing.\n- Some of the audience will decide their lives are worth more than their money, and will start gambling. They will have to pay for all the rest who still take up seats. But will get to skip some of the teeth-brushing and weapon reloading scenes.\n- And no one will get to know what the movie wold have been like if it was provided Pay to Watch as the director intended.\n\nBack to the walls:\nIf a paywall is too low then the game will quickly be pegged as Pay 2 Win. And since this is both a PvP-game as well as PvE-game the devs cannot allow players to purchase themselves to power. If this happens the game will receive crippling reviews and bleed players quickly.\n\nAs you can see: The whole F2P concept - by inherent design - ruins games.\nInvestors could not give a damn about this fact. They are in it to earn money. They do not care about your enjoyment.\nThe devs are paid by the investors, and have little say. They are victims of this just as we gamers are.\n\nWhy should we accept this?\n\nI implore you: Make a principal decision. Make a statement by supporting the paid games and refusing to play F2P. Let's all contribute to sending the destructive F2P business model to the junkyard of financial history.","April 9","false","10.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It's fast-paced and punchy and I really don't care what others think. I like this game. You run around a map (Personally I like Jungleing) and you either defend by placing traps, attack by leading minions through the other team's traps, or play a midrange character who jungles through the opponent's side collecting buffs for your minions and defenses.

The graphics are really pastel and cartoony, the minions arent even a little bit dangerous, the game mechanics have been changed significantly, and worst of all, the traps just arent fun to use anymore. It doesnt feel like you are stabbing orcs with pointy sticks or burning them with acid, like it used to, all of the visceral satisfaction is gone. Plus, you can no longer build your defenses the way you like; they give you little "kill boxes" where you are permitted to build, and you cant place anything anywhere else.\n\nAnd why is this a MOBA now? Everyone and their dog has a MOBA these days, do we really need to start changing our favorite indie gems into them too?\n\nI dont know what the devs were thinking with this, it is such a wild departure for the series, and none of it seems to have been done to improve on the players experience. I havent even mentioned the fact that its  a Free To Play game, yet. I dont mind the F2P model, when it fits the game well, but OMD does NOT fit the model at all. Half the fun was in unlocking new items and buying upgrades for them, then using them to squish baddies or fling them into lava. Now the former is replaced with a paywall, and the latter is replaced with watching tiny lines of minions walk through your "kill boxes" so you can farm crafting materials off of them.\n\nThere are only a handful of levels, and none of them are particularly interesting, and there is no storyline or plot, as far as I can tell, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ considering the previous games both featured prominent single player campaigns.\n\nWhat a dissapointment.","April 29","false","0.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

New Characters (I.E not the default 5 you have access to) are about $10 each, skins are also $10 which is a little ridiculous. You can also buy chests that have rewards inside to speed up the process of crafting traps.\n\nCrafting - In Orcs Must Die 1 and 2 you were awarded skulls based on performance and kills at the end of the level. You would spend those skulls on new traps, items, skins. In Unchained, you'll need a range of different items in exorbitant amounts to craft, upgrade, and tweak traps. SO you'll get the same traps and items that could be enjoyed in OMD1-2, but at a 10x slower rate. On the plus side, you can "craft" new heroes instead of paying money to purchase the heroes.\n\n5 player Co-op - I thought this would be a mess of traps but people are usually good about trap placement, selling traps to make room, splitting up to stop enemies. You will get the odd person that won't listen or speaks another language, but so far it's been rare or not much of an issue. One downside is a cap on the amount of traps that can be placed can be reached very quickly then it becomes an arguing match over what gets cut and what gets a better trap.\n\nNew characters - Fire Mage, Ice Warrior, Assassin Gnoll and Cat girl, Money Dwarf, Soul Mage, Elf, Cyclops Mage, Chaos mage. The people behind OMD have done an amazing job of adding characters to this world. Each character has a unique personality, playstyle, and are very fun to play.\n\nMaps - While amazing to look at, I feel some of the maps are lacking in imagination. A couple of the Co-op maps are just snipped versions from the 5v5 siege mode. Many of the maps get very old and fast when you play them over and over. Maybe it's too early yet and better maps will be added later.\n\nUltimately, the game is free to play and almost everything can be crafted without hitting the wallet.","April 5","true","90.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The only thing I've been able to buy is a hero who I thought was good and turned out to be horrendous. After making my first terrible choice of champions to make, I decided to then go for a boss minion which only requires 20 summoning lamps. Not so bad right? WRONG. After almost 50 hours, I still only have 17 summoning lamps and not even close to the amount to craft another champion. This game is fun don't get me wrong but the system in which you acquire items is absolutely absurd. I can understand grinding for items but 50 hours for a garbage champion and saving all you can for 1 boss minion is a little bit ridiculous. I'm still going to play this game, however, I would not recommend for anyone who actually wants a life.\n\nUPDATE: I still don't recommend this game, you know why? Because when you finally join a game after waiting 5 minutes in queue and everyone accepts, you immediately have 2 that don't connect and a third teammate who disconnects after the game starts within 2 minutes. There's absolutely no reliable reporting system either without having to go through thier website and upload screenshots of what happened and writing an essay. I've played a countless amount of games in which we have 2-3 teammates who just don't connect and there's nothing you can do except accept the incoming carnage that the other team (who are always all asian and know exactly what to do and when) are about to hand deliver to you on a silver platter. Meanwhile my teammates are raging over the placement of a barricade and a defender is defending a lane that hasn't even opened yet.","April 17","false","118.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I'm underwhelmed.\n\nThe character rotation makes the game a cash mine, as well as grindy to unlock the characters for free. It still feels like an Orcs Must Die! game, but frankly, the characters I was looking forward to, such as the War Mage being a bada** with a blunderbuss, and the sorceress going ham, were gone. They're renamed, nerfed, and the game feels weighted towards the orcs. The traps aren't unique to characters, so one character doesn't have a unique trap to place which does something that can't be duplicated. The weapons and skills change, but they're fairly unoriginal, on the heroes I've looked at. No numbers are also listed on any skills or weapons or most traps, and frankly, I don't know what I'm placing or doing until I take the time out of game to view it, and there it's hard to find. The whole "launcher" setup I dislike, where it's one window for the menus, and it opens and closes the actual game every time you load a window.\n\nI also don't want to play Spiral Knights or Warcraft or something and grind out the materials to unlock the characters I want to play, because it's an excruciating grind to get the materials, where you have to win to get the major component, and even then, because you have to win, it's an uphill battle because the Orcs are stronger.\n\nThe hero leveling system seems cool, but wasted with the hero rotation, so you spread playtime out across games, as well as you can't take the hero you want if you load slower than everyone else and they claim the hero first in survival.\n\nThe graphics (at least as far as I think) are a slight step down from OMD2, even on high settings. It's a little more simplistic, and they put more effort into the ambiance of the map and the nonplayable areas than the actual area you're in, and the actual traps you place and use.\n\nOverall, I'm underwhelmed.

It is OMD's spin on a MOBA! Too many reviews complaining about how different this game is than the first two...\n\nSecondly, don't pay attention to my lack of play time on steam... I've been playing this for almost a year and a half before it was released on steam! I am usually bad at MOBA's, but I really enjoy this game! They have really listened to their audience and adjusted the game accordingly.\n\nMy ONLY complaint was that they had such a low player base and since it's mainly PvP I stopped playing it for a while as I couldn't find people to play against. I felt like they barely advertised and most gamers I talked too had no clue this game was out or in open beta... I am extremely happy it is finally released on Steam and I hope that this will greatly increase the player base!","April 2","true","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Unchained\nThis is the story of all about how my life got flipped turned upside down, now I'd like to take a minute just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the Top Scorer of a map on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game called Orcs Must Die! Unchained\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ed myself over by downloading this game on the premise of fanboying at about 7:18, I yelled to my friends, "Hey stupid idiots, check this ♥♥♥♥!". I looked at my bridges, they we're finally burned and thats how I ♥♥♥♥ing ruined my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ life.\n\nIt was worth every penny I ever spent on microtransactions.\n\nAt the end of my time assessing what this game was I had quite a few negative aspects to complain about, only three hours in and it seemed like hell. I fumbled about a bit and got to a comfortable position where I felt it was time to write a review.\n\n\nMy feelings for this series are pivoted around my experience a few years back when Orcs Must Die! came out on the Xbox 360 arcade and my friends and I competed for score positions on the leader board. We felt cool and underground like a bunch of stupid middle schoolers, but who can blame us because we were the saddest yet most common example of middle school garbage to ever come out of north America. The game was great and even to this day I still enjoy how simple it is to just horde mode the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies, so I was extremely surprised when they didn't do that this time around.\nWhat I experienced was Robot Entertainments attempt at driving their arcade jewel into the ground and adding layer after layer of moba-like player leveling and account to UI features that tiered well enough for what it was. Even after seeing this I didn't throw a fit of rage because they made it all blend really well and displayed precisely what quality I look for in third-rate development groups. I got what I expected and a little of what I wasn't expecting, so I could in no way feel aggression towards this game.\nA huge part of me wants to rag on the "Hero" war mage rip off of champions from League formula they have going on but it fit the playstyle of the game so well I couldn't muster up the energy to bother.\n\nOverall this game was really well put together and while the prices of the microtransactions are outrageous, that is easily remedied by NOT buying them at all.","April 4","true","19.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

If that's not your cup of tea and you'd like to play the game with your friends (or alone), it currently dissolves into an attrocious grindfest. Yeah... how fun do you think it is to play through the same map over, and over, and over again just so you can get a single trap or level up so not to be overwhelmed in the next map? Top it off with the standard "keep coming back every day for free rewards" F2P gimmick to make the whole thing feel extra sleazy.\n\nReally liked the first two games. This one can certainly be fun at times, but has generally left me feeling unfulfilled and dirty every time I played it. You give me a good game, I give you money in exchange.

Its free and grind is just another word for "long time motivation" in the game business. If you had nothing to craft and farm for, you wouldnt play this game rly long cause there arent 1000 maps in this game, just a handfull.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing in this game, that you can't get for free! Even materials, that are marked to come only out of chests (bought for real cash or randomly given after games), can be dropped by specific minions. Thats being said, "specific" means that the drops aren't random at all: Kobold Tears are dropped by ... Kobolds, Ogre Humours are dropped by ... Ogre, just to mention some.\n\nThe biggest problem of this game is that the main audiance is rly young and that those players want to have everything served on a silver plate nowadays (and the general chat is more like kindergarden).\n\nIf your IQ is higher than 90, you should be able to get into this simple crafting system and the whole deck building in a rush. Every trap has an own video. Even if the placement in those videos is kinda stupid sometimes, it shows the function and possible output of those traps.\n\nI never had any connectivity issues at all, The game ran >100 hours totally fine. Maybe this was a problem in the earlier days ..\n\nPro:\n- all free, grindable\n- 3d tower defense with rpg and fps elements\n- free hero rotation and kinda diverse hero selection\n- different game modes played solo or as group\n- enough maps and possibilities for at least some hours of strategical plays\n\nCon:\n- Random Multiplayer < Sologame (matchmaking isnt great and players arent great and smart either , so play with friends or go solo style)\n- no report function or i just missed it\n- no PAUSE in sologames\n\nSP vs MP in detail:\n\nIn solo games you can just pick the champion you want, you can build what you want and where you want and you can remove the stuff you dont want any longer when the game progresses.\n\nIn the matchmaking version you end up with the kindergarden crew spoilered by the chat. They pick the hero you wanted to lvl, they got "your" gold, kill everything without combo before a gold generator can even tick and go afk after they placed 40 low cost tier 1 traps on a map with 85 traps max in a high lvl game. Every idea and strategy you thought of is ruined by the single existance of unknown players that just thought different or troll the hell outa this.\n\nThis can be a huge deal for a decission to play or not play this game. In my opinion, TDs are made for solo play, they are like a puzzle, a brain game, where you need the freedom to do, what you wanted to do and cause you can play OMDU solo and you even got the option to play it with friends, i will recommend it.

But there are somethings the game has that disappoint me. From the gameplay it looks like Robot Entertainment used the same old characters but made them so weak you can't progress without some assistence form other players. In OMD2 i remeber mowing down mobs of orcs with Max using his sword and crossbow. Also the game has a char(possibley 2) that cant fight without mana. So what happens when the characters mana runs out ? It's either "Hey my mana ran out, I'll just stand here like a fence post and let you handle everything" or it's making trips back and forth from fighting orcs to the rift. And the the workshop prices are insane. It's either grind for hours or spend dozens of dollars everyday.

This review is about the survival mode, which is supposed to be just like the previous games.\n\nThis game is a disappointment compared to OMD2. It can hardly be called a tower defense game anymore. You can barely place any traps at all, both because you don't get nearly as many coins as previous games relative to trap costs, and because the maps are designed to prevent placing traps in all but a few designated squares. Instead, they went for MOBA-style hero design and put a lot more focus on having you kill orcs manually with your hero (and kill humans too apparently?). Ironically, even despite the increased focus on heroes, fighting with them feels less satisfying than in OMD2, because the few gear options in OMD2 were way more interesting than all of the fluff in this game.\n\nMost of the fun of the previous games was making elaborate trap configurations. You cannot do that in this game. You can set up a small trap zone for a small amount of damage, and everything else has to be done by using your hero to kill things.\n\nThe 5-man coop is even worse, because the coins are split between everyone. You can try to work together on traps, but even if you coordinate perfectly, you'll end up with a lackluster trap configuration just like in the solo mode. More players does make it a little easier to cover more entrances with your heroes, but enemy health is scaled way up in coop, so not really.\n\nI'd rather just keep playing OMD2 than bother with this. Literally every single thing that is different in this game is worse. OMD2 was an amazing game, and the only thing that would have notably improved it is support for more players. This game does add that, but ruins basically everything else to the point that I don't even want to invite more friends to play it.\n\nPretty much the only thing this game has going for it is that it's free to try. But of course, that is accompanied by the F2P payment model, which is borderline pay2win. Traps, heroes, etc. can be obtained via grinding, but it's totally random whether you'll get the right materials to unlock them. Alternatively, you can just pay for them. You can also pay for more chances to get the mats you need to craft upgrades, making your character better. That is pay2win. The only reason I said "borderline" is because I am only reviewing the survival portion, and pay2win really only applies to PvP. I don't know if this works the same way in siege mode (PvP), but if it does, then this is literally pay2win at its worst.\n\nSo yeah, that said, it's a beta, so maybe they are open to fix some of this. But nowadays, "open beta", "early access", etc. are just excuses - just a term fanboys can point to in an attempt to nullify all criticism. The only thing that those terms excuse is lack of polish. Game design philosophy does not change at this point, and that is precisely what needs to be changed in order for this game to be fun. I don't mind the grind if the gameplay is fun, but the "less traps, more heroes" gameplay of Orcs Must Die! Unchained is not.\n\nTLDR; OMD was a game about trap placement, with a hero to do a little extra damage. Unchained is a game about using MOBA heroes to kill mobs, with traps to do a little extra damage. The heroes aren't nearly satisfying enough to make it work. Coop gets progressively worse with more people because you can do even less with traps.","April 3","false","42.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, I find that the gameplay itself to be lacking in excitement, the hallways of traps you create with friends or allies don't seem to nearly be as fun as they used to be, and I am left feeling like playing it just for the chore of grinding resourses that drop in the levels.\n\nThere are unlockable characters, traps, loot, etc, which can be purchased if you don't have the patiece for it, but you can also earn the upgrades and stuff through plaing the game like any other moba title.

There are a dozen crafting materials and getting traps requires a significant amount of grinding. Unlike the previous games, one can not simply pick a trap one likes and upgrade it over time to maximize its performance. One has to farm the particular crafting items over and over again using the same 5 simple and annoying traps to finally be able to craft this trap in the first place.\n\nB) There is little variation in the players' loadout because it takes ages to unlock a single new trap. Whereas it was possible to reset the loadout in previous games it is not possible any longer. Thus, one has to spend additional time in the game doing the exact same thing with the exact same traps to achieve a marginal level of trap variation.\n\nC) The free-to-play business model is frustrating. I'd rather pay money for the game to have an even battlefield in multiplayer. Currently people paying for the game have a significant advantage as they can skip a significant part of the grinding process and easily destroy people who spend an equal amount of time on the game simply because they were able to afford better items at lower levels (e.g. items granting brief invincibility).\n\nAll-in-all, while Robot did a lot of work to improve the game and to re-invent parts of it by adding a MOBA style multiplayer mode - I feel that there is little appeal to OMD players. The game feels like it is designed for a new customer group such as SMITE players and did not fulfill my expectations.","April 13","false","22.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Since this is currently in beta, if you see your team losing, there is absolutely zero reason to stay in a losing pvp match. Furthermore this game will almost certainly never be popular, so even when it is released people will just leave. Now you might argue that this is an issue with any online game, and I would agree, but for a less popular multiplayer game with only five players on your team, constant leavers will just grind on your soul until you give up on the game.\n\nThe PVE, as you may expect, was fine, although playing with random people will be an excruciating experience. I HEAVILY reccommend playing with friends over voice chat, as other random people will constantly walk into your lane and build in awful positions, ruining paths and mazes.\n\n\nThis game should obviously only be played for the PvE. If you do so, the maze/wall mechanics feel like a nice balance between the heavy mazing of Sanctum, and the very simple walling off of lanes from dungeon defenders. It did not appeal to me, but this may be enoyable for you.\n\n+PVE with up to four friends is the same fun, hectic experience.\n+More heroes to play gives more variation.\n\n-I do not foresee any future for PVP besides groups queueing up together to smash uncoordinated groups. It may be fun when these groups clash, but otherwise I believe the random people will slowly just DC from the game and leave one by one (this was the case in the games I played that it looked like we may lose).\n-Admittedly I did not play for an extended period of time, but the Crafting system where you pick up materials from fallen NPCs to unlock/upgrade your traps looks like it may take a long time.\n-If you gain 65 Hero crafting materials from dailies, and 25 from leveling, from dailies alone the process for a new hero (450) would require about 7 days of playing dailies. However, in my specific case, two of the dailies required playing 10 games on two different champions. After about 8-10 games I was getting bored for the day, since the base gameply is fairly repetitive. This means for semi-casual players, the grind to unlock your favorite champion you experience on free week rotation may be an arduous process.\n\nSomeone once said (I believe it was TotalBiscuit) that once a game starts charging money, such as microtransactions, the game should be considered as released. Seeing as the developers have no qualms about charging in the in-game store,  I will consider the main mechanics of their game complete, with allowances for connectivity issues. I'm kind of a first impressions person, and can determine in the first 30 minutes or so if I will enjoy the game. I preferred dungeon defenders over this game for a multiplayer TD experience.","April 2","false","11.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well, after playing the survival mode for a couple of games, I headed to the siege mode. What is the siege mode?\n\nThe siege mode is like smite combined with the older classical versions of Orcs Must Die. It's 5v5 and is one of the most immersive and fun games I've tried in a while. The game style is MOBA, with a slight RTS feel, due to the fact that you can control which minions you wanna spawn etc.\n\nThat being said, this is not your standard MOBA like game, you can choose to have the defence trait or the attacker trait in the hero select screen. These will give your a certain trait to help you do either, as the name implies. As far as I've observed there is a defence and an attack lane, personally I've only really played defence, since I love placing traps and making fun little routes for the minions to die in, I like building stuff.\n\nThe obejctive is as in most MOBA games, to reach the enemy spawn point and take it down. Reffering to League of Legends nexus and Dotas whatever (I have never really tried Dota, so I don't know what it's called). The game itself is third person.\n\nAll around a fantastic game, that just recently really opened to the public. I look forward to what this game is gonna offer.

I have already logged 53 hours and i'm not bored with it at all. I played survival mode for about 3 days then i thought "hey guys let's try siege mode" Me and two friends joined a siege game, and continued to play siege mode for about 5 hours straight. This game is amazing. Keep doing what you're doing developers! And remember, the more maps the merrier!!!!! :-D","April 10","true","202.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(as so far, 5 hrs of game play gathered less than 1% of special materials needed for upgrade any entry level game traps)\n\nThe fun: you get smash orcs in few different ways if you play single player. When you paly with multi-player mode, you will find your strategy is useless that people just randomly use up all the spaces. But still you can enjoy an hour or two of game element without feeling too repetitive.\n\nThe take home message is this is a hardcore game under a softcore skin. It is fun for a few hours but if you want to become any sort of pro or do well in MOBA element, you better prepare thousands of hours and some $$ ahead","April 10","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The difference is everything is obtainable for free. People who pay will MAYBE stomp in a few matches, have their MMR go up, then play against people who have put a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hours into the game. Suddenly massive skill difference. The character buffs from items that buff you up are pretty much all <13% increases to your stats and almost all of those buffs are conditional like + damage to a specific type of enemy, + whatever ♥♥♥♥ing stat when you're standing next to some specific thing. I've played for about 5 hours, I've crafted two traps and two items to use and am half way towards getting one of the expensive heroes. Noticeable progression in this is a lot faster than majority of F2P games, and even some games you have to buy and pay a ♥♥♥♥ing subscription to.\n\nNow actual gameplay and mechanics.\n\nBiggest differences I noticed were graphics, how good the controls are, and that there's no ♥♥♥♥ing wind belt. The way you move your character in the first and second games always felt a little awkward to me, I'm not sure exactly what they changed about it but it's a hell of a lot better in this. The co-op part of the game, survival, is basically the same as before. You gain level up and choose buffs in every match like MOBAs do. The unlockable weapons have been turned different heroes and active abilities which I like a bit more. Most of the old traps are still in this, there are a couple new ones and they can still be upgraded though I'm not sure exactly how to do it. Combat is nice, you're a lot weaker but larger team and stronger traps makes up for it. In co-op occasionally an enemy hero will spawn and they're actually pretty dangerous 1v1. Flying guys aren't in this but there are a few new enemy types to make up for it, my favorite ones are the bears that carry shields cause they're ♥♥♥♥ing bears with shields.\n\nPVP! I love how they did roles. Instead of having all the characters forced into specific roles, you pick whatever you want to play and set your role, which will give you a buff to whatever that role is supposed to do. There are still good reasons to pick certain ones over others but it seems to mostly apply to people that want to defend. So far I haven't seen a character that can't be played offensively very well. There also seems to be a bit more team work needed than MOBAs. This has all the basic things that MOBAs have like the lanes, item and character builds, neutral enemies, and ganking but there's also having to spawn your own minions, switching them to counter, and resource farming to upgrade them. The traditional tower thingies have been replaced by guardians. They function pretty much the same but fits the theme better. Combat between players is pretty satisfying, if you liked playing S/MNC, or Smite, then you'll probably like the PVP in this.\n\nAlso I don't feel like making a proper conclusion, If you really liked the first two games, don't dismiss this just because some people hate Gameforge. Give it a chance and maybe get addicted.","April 7","true","32.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Well, after playing the survival mode for a couple of games, I headed to the siege mode. What is the siege mode?\n\nThe siege mode is like smite combined with the older classical versions of Orcs Must Die. It's 5v5 and is one of the most immersive and fun games I've tried in a while. The game style is MOBA, with a slight RTS feel, due to the fact that you can control which minions you wanna spawn etc.\n\nThat being said, this is not your standard MOBA like game, you can choose to have the defence trait or the attacker trait in the hero select screen. These will give your a certain trait to help you do either, as the name implies. As far as I've observed there is a defence and an attack lane, personally I've only really played defence, since I love placing traps and making fun little routes for the minions to die in, I like building stuff.\n\nThe obejctive is as in most MOBA games, to reach the enemy spawn point and take it down. Reffering to League of Legends nexus and Dotas whatever (I have never really tried Dota, so I don't know what it's called). The game itself is third person.\n\nAll around a fantastic game, that just recently really opened to the public. I look forward to what this game is gonna offer.

Now I understand it's free to play so they have to do something to make money and extend the game life for the player. This is done by the fact it will probably take you 50+ hours to upgrade one trap.... One! And that's just to get it too lvl 2. I can't imagine how long it would take after that to upgrade it again... Your getting the picture here right? 100s of hours you would need to soak into this game just to upgrade a few traps so you can progress. Of course you can spend money to get resources if you wan't to...

There are a dozen crafting materials and getting traps requires a significant amount of grinding. Unlike the previous games, one can not simply pick a trap one likes and upgrade it over time to maximize its performance. One has to farm the particular crafting items over and over again using the same 5 simple and annoying traps to finally be able to craft this trap in the first place.\n\nB) There is little variation in the players' loadout because it takes ages to unlock a single new trap. Whereas it was possible to reset the loadout in previous games it is not possible any longer. Thus, one has to spend additional time in the game doing the exact same thing with the exact same traps to achieve a marginal level of trap variation.\n\nC) The free-to-play business model is frustrating. I'd rather pay money for the game to have an even battlefield in multiplayer. Currently people paying for the game have a significant advantage as they can skip a significant part of the grinding process and easily destroy people who spend an equal amount of time on the game simply because they were able to afford better items at lower levels (e.g. items granting brief invincibility).\n\nAll-in-all, while Robot did a lot of work to improve the game and to re-invent parts of it by adding a MOBA style multiplayer mode - I feel that there is little appeal to OMD players. The game feels like it is designed for a new customer group such as SMITE players and did not fulfill my expectations.","April 13","false","22.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The difference is everything is obtainable for free. People who pay will MAYBE stomp in a few matches, have their MMR go up, then play against people who have put a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of hours into the game. Suddenly massive skill difference. The character buffs from items that buff you up are pretty much all <13% increases to your stats and almost all of those buffs are conditional like + damage to a specific type of enemy, + whatever ♥♥♥♥ing stat when you're standing next to some specific thing. I've played for about 5 hours, I've crafted two traps and two items to use and am half way towards getting one of the expensive heroes. Noticeable progression in this is a lot faster than majority of F2P games, and even some games you have to buy and pay a ♥♥♥♥ing subscription to.\n\nNow actual gameplay and mechanics.\n\nBiggest differences I noticed were graphics, how good the controls are, and that there's no ♥♥♥♥ing wind belt. The way you move your character in the first and second games always felt a little awkward to me, I'm not sure exactly what they changed about it but it's a hell of a lot better in this. The co-op part of the game, survival, is basically the same as before. You gain level up and choose buffs in every match like MOBAs do. The unlockable weapons have been turned different heroes and active abilities which I like a bit more. Most of the old traps are still in this, there are a couple new ones and they can still be upgraded though I'm not sure exactly how to do it. Combat is nice, you're a lot weaker but larger team and stronger traps makes up for it. In co-op occasionally an enemy hero will spawn and they're actually pretty dangerous 1v1. Flying guys aren't in this but there are a few new enemy types to make up for it, my favorite ones are the bears that carry shields cause they're ♥♥♥♥ing bears with shields.\n\nPVP! I love how they did roles. Instead of having all the characters forced into specific roles, you pick whatever you want to play and set your role, which will give you a buff to whatever that role is supposed to do. There are still good reasons to pick certain ones over others but it seems to mostly apply to people that want to defend. So far I haven't seen a character that can't be played offensively very well. There also seems to be a bit more team work needed than MOBAs. This has all the basic things that MOBAs have like the lanes, item and character builds, neutral enemies, and ganking but there's also having to spawn your own minions, switching them to counter, and resource farming to upgrade them. The traditional tower thingies have been replaced by guardians. They function pretty much the same but fits the theme better. Combat between players is pretty satisfying, if you liked playing S/MNC, or Smite, then you'll probably like the PVP in this.\n\nAlso I don't feel like making a proper conclusion, If you really liked the first two games, don't dismiss this just because some people hate Gameforge. Give it a chance and maybe get addicted.","April 7","true","32.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's OrksMustDie in a nutshell and I would love to give it the thumbs up!\nProblem I have with it is the grind... Now I understand it's free to play so they have to do something to make money and extend the game life for the player. This is done by the fact it will probably take you 50+ hours to upgrade one trap.... One! And that's just to get it too lvl 2. I can't imagine how long it would take after that to upgrade it again... Your getting the picture here right? 100s of hours you would need to soak into this game just to upgrade a few traps so you can progress. Of course you can spend money to get resources if you wan't to... Dont do that!\n\nThat wouldn't be a bad thing, but the problem is you will get stuck on the same levels over and over again farming resources because you traps are not strong enough to kill the mobs in the higher levels. This makes the game repetitive and extremely boring as you use the same tactic to beat the same level over and over and over and over... It doesn't hold your attention. I have only 10hours in this game at the moment of writing this and the thought of going back to that grind makes me shudder...\n\nPlease lower the cost of upgrading traps... Would make the game so much better! I would considering going back to it if you did :P But for now I can't recommend it unless you really really enjoy grind games.

Is the game too easy? No problem, you can jump into level 12 as level 6 if you feel like you're up for the challenge.\n\nThe in-game crafting system and rewards are confusing at first, however they are handed out rapidly, so I've gotten enough rewards to progress and craft new items every 30-45min of gametime, which is about 3 games played.\n\nAs most other F2P games, such as League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite and to a lesser extent Hearthstone, you can speed up your progress through the shop. So far though, I really haven't felt like I had to. Even skins can be unlocked through crafting so progress does indeed seem a lot faster in OMD compared to Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends.\n\nThe few issues I have with the game, is the UI looks awful and it's not the best. Especially the crafting and inventory system could use a good makeover to make it a bit more convenient and obvious. I like the huge amoun of funny crafting items and recipes, but better descriptions and a better overview would be great.\n\nThe characters are fun, diverse to play - but what the hell happened to Maximillian? He turned from being an Arrogant, unknowing, ignorant and kind of a stupid person into 100% Obnoxious. It's kind of sad, I thought he was great in the previous games, but for some reasons, he's just really obnouxious to listen to in OMD U. However, a lot of the other chars are there, whenever I need a break from his handsome jawline and crazy comments.\n\nThe Siege tutorial is garbage though, it is as if it's a very impatient YouTuber who's commenting it, so I also hope it gets abit of a makeover before the release.\n\nOverall, I'd say get it! Ignore the shop, you honestly don't need it, even if you only play casual.

I like mobas and this game's Moba Matchmaking is really fun.\nA majority of the player base is really, really bad though. The original orcs must die is not like this one and the moba version is very confusing for average players with no moba experience. Concepts like pushing lanes, roations, jungling and even just understanding their basic roles are lost.\n\nThere is no reason an attacking should be defending a wave when they could be leveling up our minion gates.\nLike.. this happens far too often.\n\nPlayers are still unfuriatingly bad. Even when it comes to simple trap placements, extending the enemy's minion travel time.\n\nHas a lot of potential though. Skins and Loot are "FREE" but require a lot, a lot of grinding which is not fun.\nOnce there are balanced classes and the "hardcore" player base develops, I'll come back. I would even go as far as to play a ranked mode of this.\n\nIf you like dota and league, you will like this but at the current state of development it is not going to be your replacement.","April 11","true","23.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now I understand it's free to play so they have to do something to make money and extend the game life for the player. This is done by the fact it will probably take you 50+ hours to upgrade one trap.... One! And that's just to get it too lvl 2. I can't imagine how long it would take after that to upgrade it again... Your getting the picture here right? 100s of hours you would need to soak into this game just to upgrade a few traps so you can progress. Of course you can spend money to get resources if you wan't to... Dont do that!\n\nThat wouldn't be a bad thing, but the problem is you will get stuck on the same levels over and over again farming resources because you traps are not strong enough to kill the mobs in the higher levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schwickster/recommended/427270/","Schwickster","Schwick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Schwickster/","305 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTLDR; If you like coop tower defence games with a bit of action, this is game your game. It's like Orcs Must Die (OMD) 1 and 2, only online. the PvP game can be skipped if you like the PvE gameplay from OMD 1 and 2. I recommend the game. The game has a few issues with are mainly the grinding which can be boring.\n\nWhat is Orcs Must die Unchained (OMDU)?For those who haven’t played OMD 1 and 2 here’s a short description. It’s an action packed tower defence game where you build traps to defend against orcs. The gameplay is seen in third person where you control a hero. During the game you can shoot and use abilities. The game consists of two game types. PvP that’s kinda plays like a moba (only with OMD twist). In the PvP you build traps and lead armies to the enemies rift. There’s also a PvE coop part where you defend against a certain amount (or after level 80 endless) of waves. Each wave is more difficult than the other. You have to stop getting the orcs to your rift. Your rift only has a certain amount of health.\n\nProsFree to play\nWhy not just give the game a try? It's free! While the game has micro transaction it can be completely forgetting. Only things you have to pay for are the skins. The rest you can farm.\n\nThe game has good humour like OMD 1 and 2 has\nOften the Orcs are heroes will shout some stuff which are pretty funny one-liners. The orcs also sometimes die in the most funny ways. For example eye pop out when walking past fire.\n\ngraphics are cartoony and fit the tone\nWhile the graphics aren't something that will make your PC cry and ooze high graphic quality, the graphics look good enough. Coming from OMD 1 and 2 this is a step-up. The graphics look cartoony and fit with the tone of the game. The game isn't even high demanding in terms of hardware requirements.\n\nFrequent updates to fix the game and add new content\nAlmost every week we get a patch that fixes stuff. Almost every month we get new content.\n\nLevelling your account doesn't take too long\nAs of writing I played 46 hours so far and I'm level 55. Levelling up happens by levelling your heroes. Each level of your hero gets added up to your account. So if you have played with two heroes that are level 2, you are level 4. If you own a hero you get more XP which levels you up faster. With each level you get, you get rewards in terms of unlocks and loot.\n\nLoad times aren't bad\nI load a game within 20-30 seconds I would say. In-game you need to wait for other players though.\n\nHeroes are varied\nEach hero brings their own power, traps and gamestyle. There are even heroes that excel at solo-damage, trap building, magic, tanking, etc. There's a hero for each type of player. Each hero can be build each match up to 6 talents maxing at level 12 where you pick your last talent. Each week a new rotation is done to play a hero for free (but get less XP if you don't own the hero).\n\nVaried maps\nEach map brings it's own atmosphere, challenges and recommended traps. No map feels the same in terms of tactics. Some maps even give fun things like one map has swimming sharks. Once an orc dies the shark eat the orcs. Over time you revisit a map only this time the challenge goes up by having bigger, badder and more waves.\n\nTraps\nThe traps are the main thing about this game. It's fun to place traps and make various combinations. Just like OMD 1 and 2 you can place traps on ceilings, walls and ground. Each trap has it's own use and price. Some traps are better than other. You can upgrade traps to your liking and even customize them a little. Customizing comes in term of catering to your playstyle. For example you use a lot of fire traps? Then gives traps a damage boost when an Orc is on fire!\n\nUnchained\nThe main addition of the game is that combos gives unchained. Unchained gives the hero HP, mana, cooldown and damage boosts. It's fun to go unchained and see combos fly around.\n\nPvP\nThe PvP mode is a nice optional addition and gives a fun twist to the moba market. You lead armies and help your armie avoid traps and heroes. You can also build traps to help you defend your rift. I myself hardly play it because I find the PvE mode more fun. But the PvP mode is fun.\n\nCons\nFarm a lot\nAs many have stated the farming for items just is too much at the moment. You farm items by picking them up, levelling up, getting chest (you get them from time or you buy them), completing quests or completing daily quests. So while you do get enough chance to get items, it's just not enough. The item cost to get traps or upgrade them is just too much at the moment. I need to play like 10-15 games orso to get something. OMD 1 and 2 was accessible in terms of upgrades. Not to mention my bigger gripe with the game is that you yourself have to pick up items in-game. This can't be done because often you'll defend a lane. Items despawn after a round which doesn't make it easier. They do really need to make items pickup group based so everyone gets it. I feel that the farming of the items in this game is the biggest con and needs to fixed for this game to grow.\n\nQueueing is long and weird\nat the moment it's just screwed. Sometimes the game matches me with 2 other people for a map that is not balanced for 3 people (but balanced for 5 people). We always lose when this happens. Queuing also takes too long at times.\n\nEnemies destroying barricades\nAt the moment there are enemies in the game that destroy barricades. Barricades are needed to make a maze so that the Orcs walk a longer path. Some enemies however destroy the barricades within a few seconds. People in end-game have a hard time dealing with this. Heck the most of the game is figuring out an ideal path by placing traps and barricades.\n\nTrap limit too low sometimes\nOften people are struggling because the trap limit is too low. Most maps give you 120 traps to the max. This limit is easy to reach in the later levels. I would say 150 trap limit would be better and balances the game more.","May 5","true","87.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Anything can be crafted with materials that you acquire in game, and although I can see a lot of people complaining about how much grinding this requires, it seems that after the last patch the whole system has been reworked and changed, and it appears it's easier than before to craft stuff. There are of course microtransactions in the game but let's be honest, what free-to-play game doesn't have them?

Anything can be crafted with materials that you acquire in game, and although I can see a lot of people complaining about how much grinding this requires, it seems that after the last patch the whole system has been reworked and changed, and it appears it's easier than before to craft stuff.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/427270/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","This is a double review in a way.\n\n(and for the record, ive been in the beta for months, long before it was released on steam. I have over 30+ hours of play time long before I installed it on steam)\n\nAs a MOBA, OMDU is a visually appealing, solid made game, that can be fun, but often is just rather standard and average. At times it can even be frustrating due to the heroes having fewer abilities than many other moba games out there. This causes the heroes to feel a tad on the boring side, resorting in the games fun coming more from its other elements like the traps and large assortment of minion types.\n\nVery few, if any, of the heroes really make me say "Oooo, I really want to play this hero, I cant wait to get them". For a moba, this is a bad thing imo. The ones I do semi like, all have elements that make me not want to play them. A power management mechanic, or frustrating abilities, or that they are so situational, that they arent good to have in most games. I simply dont care to earn new heroes in this game, even the newer ones they release.\n\nAs a MOBA, id give this game a 5 out of 10 (5 being average). Its not great, and its not awful. It being free isnt anything new these days, and while its heroes and hero mechanics are a negative, the inclusion of traps and vast assortment of minions counter balances it, allowing the game to come across as luke warm. If you are looking for a fun 3rd person moba, there are better (free) choices out there.\n\n--------\n\nAs an Orcs Must Die game, Unchained is a HUGE disappointment. The only reason this game can hold the title "Orcs Must Die" is the lore they have carried over (things like the original characters and storyline) and the meager and neutered trap mechanics they have included. The gameplay on the other hand, is drastically different. Only about 20% of the gameplay of past OMD games has managed to make it into this game. The other 80% is an attempt at making a DoTA/Smite moba clone.\n\nHere are some of the disappointments from an Orcs Must Die 1 and 2 perspective:\n\n- Trap building is way too contained and limited. You cant really build "paths" due to extremely limited areas of each map that actually allow you to build traps on. Clever trap combinations for specific situations are gone too. Now its all about simply doing as much damage and slowing the enemies (to do more damage) as possible.  This is largely due to, again, the limited areas you can actually build traps in.\n\n- Traps in general are WAY too limited, even mid game. Because they went the Free 2 Play route, traps are one of the things that ended up on the "buy from the shop, or spend hundreds of years grinding for" list. Unlike the first 2 games, which allowed you to unlock newer, exciting new traps at a pretty decent rate, this simply wont be the case in this game. The currency (and crafting mats) you use to get new traps, is also used to unlock everything else, including heroes. (guess its a good thing most heroes are rather meh then right? heh.) Enjoy the first many hours of the game playing with the same, default set of traps that EVERY player gets. Enjoy how that even by the last round of a match, you have only managed to place around 10 -15 traps total because the game had to be balanced around 4 other players also placing traps.  If you loved the trap building and strategy of the original Orcs Must Die games, this game simply will not live up to that in ANY fashion.\n\n- Maps/Levels. While there are a moderate selection of maps/levels (seems like there are about 5 or so), it pales in comparison to the amount found in past Orcs Must Die games. Not only that, but due to the decision to make this game a Dota Clone, most of the maps layouts are limited to the "It has to be 3 lanes" concept, instead of the more creative and interesting layouts found in past games. Aside from the graphical difference, most of the maps feel and play nearly identical. Trap building areas are always a small section right behind a door, and right before the last doors guarding your portal. This leave little innovation for different strategies or clever and fun trap building.\n\n- Heroes. In past games your hero could acquire a pretty vast assortment of weapons and abilities. They have taken all of that, and split them off into separate unique heroes instead. And the combinations of these weapons and abilities may never truly meet your desires. Want a crossbow as your main weapon, and an amulet that gives you the ability to summon a golem? Too bad. the hero with the crossbow has X and Y abilities instead. The fun and very customizable way heroes were in past games in gone in Unchained, resulting in very static, and often simply not fun characters (despite the well done graphics and animations). The very limiting progression/level up as you play each map is also very lack luster. Every couple of levels you get to pick 1 option from 3 choices on how to improve your character. These upgrades are just all around meh. Often just giving you boring passive increases to things like resistances, regeneration, or cooldown reduction. NONE OF THESE THINGS FEEL FUN.  Very rarely is there an upgrade that actually adds new functionality to something, like making your fireball bounce from target to target (as an example).\n\n- The Free 2 Play mechanic. IMO this is NOT suited for an Orcs Must Die game (which is probably why they put 80% of the games design on it being a MOBA, not an OMD sequel). The F2P design mechanic on acquiring new traps, upgrades, and heroes is all designed around the concept of it being a really long grind, unless you pay money.  Id much rather buy the game, and earn these upgrades at a much more REASONABLE and balanced pace, like in the old games. Its what progression is all about. If its too quick (ie: pay money and get everything) then the game gets old fast. If its too long (ie: grind for it F2P style) then you get bored too quickly with how slowly the progression is and the staleness of the game.\n\n\nSo overall, why did I flag this game as Thumbs Down? For one, I wanted a TRUE Orcs Must Die sequel. This BARELY earns the right to even have the name Orcs Must die, let alone be a real sequel. "But its not MEANT to be a sequel!" you say. Fine. Lets look at it from what it was designed to be. A Moba/Dota type game. As a MOBA, the game is very lack luster. Gets old and boring very fast, and just doesnt encourage me to even care about trying to earn new things, or keep playing. The quality of programming that went into the game is high, and the graphics and sound are great, but the fun of the game, the over all gameplay, is just average and meh. It doesnt stand out in ANY way, and there are better options out there right now with the same price tag.\n\nThis is just another example of devs who couldnt resist the temptation to jump on the MOBA bandwagon after seeing how well its done (read: $$$$ ) for games like LoL, Dota2, and Smite. If the devs want any more of my money, they will need to make a REAL Orcs Must Die sequel.","June 2","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

When I installed the f2p client it gave me the US version (I had no choice). However when buying DLC it was credited to a European Robot Entertainment account. ¨DO NOT PANIC¨. This may happen if you change IP to different continent or your steam settings etc. If this (has) accours with you send an e-mail to Robot Entertainment with above mentioned information. They can confirm purchase on your steam account so make sure your DLC is credited there. If it isnt, go bug steam first! Note; they have informed me they are working with steam on a solution preventing this from happening. So ´coudos´ to RE for their assistance.\n\nCon:\nThis also means accounts are automaticly dedicated to certain servers. US players wont find their EU friends and vice versa. This can be circumvented by downloading the client directly from RE website however.\n\nAt the time of this review it is still in BETA stage. And the netcode clearly has not been optomised. People report long load times and lag/warp hickups. I dont doubt this will be resolved in due time.\n\nPros:\nNow for the game. Well unless you have been living under a rock for the pas 10 years you already know what f2p means. Many publishers ´confuse´ this with p2w. Alas many gamers do too. RE however does not. From what I can tell all stat carrying items can be obtained simply by playing. So its the old story of time vs money. Which will you invest. Of course the regular visual items (no stats) are obtainable with hard currency only. So if you like the game buy some!\n\nOMD-U is the third installment of the series. RE may just be attempting to cash in on their franchise but as far as I am concerned they doing a fair job of it! The 3rd release is a good followup with some new features installed, some old features gone (I still miss my weavers -sad face-) and of course accomedating the new economic system.\n\nIf you like tower defence and you dont frown upon FPS games youll enjoy this. I strongly reccomend buying OMD (orcs my die) 1 and 2 if you dont own them already. Do not be put off with them being single or 2 player co-op games. They really help imerse into the franchise!\n\nAnd as always with all f2p games. its free to try!

And you shouldn't judge a game just by the company that made it. That's not a con, even if they have a bad track record, they might do this game justice. Besides, it's free, so what do you have to lose?\n-Some people are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the MOBA game mode: I don't see how that's a problem. They still have the classic Orcs Must Die! game mode. There's nothing to complain about.\n- You don't feel as powerful as a hero in comparison to the other games: I can't say anything for sure since I havn't played another game in this franchise. However, traps are still a thing, Guys.\n\nThese are some of the DUMBEST complaints I have EVER seen. If you want to complain, find something worth whining about. This game is hilariously fun especially if you have some friends to get together. The game controls niceley and responsiveley, the Heroes differ in playstyle, so things are still kept interesting. Both gamemodes are fun, especially if you have a communicative team. This game is SEVERELEY underrated. So please, try this game out, it's seen enough nitpicks from people who don't know how to just oversee the small, and I do mean small, problems with this game. There are some problems, don't get me wrong, but none that are very big. I give this game a solid 8/10.","April 4","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However after playing it for some time I changed my mind very fast.\n\nFirst of all the MOBA part isnt that important, to tell you the truth if u will play moba only or mainly it you wont handle the survival game later on, becouse moba gives you good amount of xp but not enough materials, so still survival is main part of the game.\n\nSecond of all ppl complain it is more like fps rather than tower defense, in my opinion it is tower defense with addon which is fps game type, there is much more to do. It is not as boring as it used to be sometimes in my opinion.\n\nI saw what gameforge did to tera but this game has huge potencial and I dont want to waste it becouse of stiupid reviews of people who played the game for 1 hour.","April 12","true","35.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fortunately, the Staff was quite competent and helpful when I requested help, and I managed to get it running without any issues since then.\n\nRegarding what many people say about the Pay 2 Win system.\nI don't like it, specially when a player abuses it. The game right now is Free to Play and people can work for the resources (in game) nontheless. ( except for Hero Skins, and maybe other things I haven't seen yet )\nWe can see this mechanic here as a good thing for those that don't have the time for the grind, and wish to have some help in raising up their game. Here's an example: If I work 8 or 10 hours a day, I won't have the time for grinding, but I do have money from it, so I won't fear falling behind too much.\nThis is the only scennario which I can accept this. I won't question the developers if they made it for this same reason or not, and frankly, it's none of my business.\n\nNow, I am going to enjoy this game with my friends, hopefully, for a good amount of time.\n\nThis is just my say in the matter, everyone is entitled to their opinion.\nI like the game and I hope it will earn people's respect","April 12","true","210.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rather have payed 20-30$ for OMD3 with no underwhelming multiplayer mode.\n\nMultiplayer takes the same concept as other popular MOBAs and tries to fit it into the old OMD game. This is essentially OMD 2 with multiplayer added and less enemies per wave with higher health points to compensate.\n\nIt's expensive, too expensive. 100$ to unlock all of the near identical characters? This does not account for trap and item unlocks. Not sure what I'd get for 200$, but I'm not interested in investing 200$ because I had my doubts that this game will last. Feels like Dead Island: Epidemic 2. Nice game in "beta" with an over priced cash grab model.\n\nThis game feels like it makes all the same mistakes of Plants vs. Zombies garden warfare 2. Randomized cash purchases never really work, look at the most succesful MOBAs, you know what you're paying for. Sadly Plants vs. Zombies had 4 or 5 play types and no player base. Except for those 100 people that had sunk a ludicrous amount of time or money into the game.\n\nI don't keep going back to MOBAs because there's stuff to unlock, there's so many games I'm not interested in having to play every day. I usually go back because the gameplay is enjoyable and there's a decent player base.\n\nDaily logins, again i have other things to do. Most companies have caught on that this is a bad model and offer a solution that allows you to log in only once every 3 days and play a bunch of matches. Something based on 3 hours of play time per 3 days. At least if I only log in on the weekends an play 4 to 5 hours, I don't feel as penalized.","April 3","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is very fun, and slightly addicting. I really hope they add more playable heroes though because the list is fairly small, and the ability to play any hero in practice mode would really make a difference since crafting/buying heroes can be a very hard choice to base on playstyle if you cant test them all out.","April 24","true","24.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun characters with a good balance in different roles.\nRewarding when you beat back the other team, or kill another character in the midst of the battle.\nGood sound and ques when running around so its easy to stay up on what stage you're in at the battle.\n\nOnly thing I think needs to be added is a penalty for disconnecting or leaving a game; especially in siege.\nThe balance of even one person leaving can set a game to be a loss. Even more so if it is your attacker or defense.\nvery few games i've won after someone leaves if a pillager picks up the slack because they are getting the bonuses a designated atk or def would get.\nI imagine the inability to que for another match for 15mi lol learn to adaptns would be a good incentive for cry babies who don't get the hero or job the wanted, or are just sore losers. LOL learn to adapt and play all the roles as the come and you'll have plenty of fun, even if you don't have the best team sometimes.\n","April 24","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However after playing it for some time I changed my mind very fast.\n\nFirst of all the MOBA part isnt that important, to tell you the truth if u will play moba only or mainly it you wont handle the survival game later on, becouse moba gives you good amount of xp but not enough materials, so still survival is main part of the game.\n\nSecond of all ppl complain it is more like fps rather than tower defense, in my opinion it is tower defense with addon which is fps game type, there is much more to do. It is not as boring as it used to be sometimes in my opinion.\n\nI saw what gameforge did to tera but this game has huge potencial and I dont want to waste it becouse of stiupid reviews of people who played the game for 1 hour.","April 12","true","35.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fortunately, the Staff was quite competent and helpful when I requested help, and I managed to get it running without any issues since then.\n\nRegarding what many people say about the Pay 2 Win system.\nI don't like it, specially when a player abuses it. The game right now is Free to Play and people can work for the resources (in game) nontheless. ( except for Hero Skins, and maybe other things I haven't seen yet )\nWe can see this mechanic here as a good thing for those that don't have the time for the grind, and wish to have some help in raising up their game. Here's an example: If I work 8 or 10 hours a day, I won't have the time for grinding, but I do have money from it, so I won't fear falling behind too much.\nThis is the only scennario which I can accept this. I won't question the developers if they made it for this same reason or not, and frankly, it's none of my business.\n\nNow, I am going to enjoy this game with my friends, hopefully, for a good amount of time.\n\nThis is just my say in the matter, everyone is entitled to their opinion.\nI like the game and I hope it will earn people's respect","April 12","true","210.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fun characters with a good balance in different roles.\nRewarding when you beat back the other team, or kill another character in the midst of the battle.\nGood sound and ques when running around so its easy to stay up on what stage you're in at the battle.\n\nOnly thing I think needs to be added is a penalty for disconnecting or leaving a game; especially in siege.\nThe balance of even one person leaving can set a game to be a loss. Even more so if it is your attacker or defense.\nvery few games i've won after someone leaves if a pillager picks up the slack because they are getting the bonuses a designated atk or def would get.\nI imagine the inability to que for another match for 15mi lol learn to adaptns would be a good incentive for cry babies who don't get the hero or job the wanted, or are just sore losers.

It has a lot of the things which I like about OMD. There are still some issues, like the matchmaking putting smaller groups up against maps with far more lanes than they can defend or having to play the same map over and over because it won't let you pick what map you would like to play on using the matchmaking mode.\n\nThe game needs work balancing reward progression too. At this point it feels extremely slow to advance, I've got to the stage at which I can almost upgrade to level 3 traps but I've only barely been able to upgrade two traps to level 2. Nor have I unlocked all the traps yet.\n\nIt still seems like no-one has any idea how the game actually works (no-one understands how to set up traps for combos and they keep running off to fight things instead of letting them get into the killboxes). The only solution seems to be to keep playing until you out level people.\n\nIf you really liked Orcs Must Die and you don't mind a lot of grinding (or spending real money) and a little less skill then you'll probably love this game. But it still has a lot of issues (which I hope will get fixed as the game is in 'early access') that make it hard to unreservedly recommend.","April 3","false","59.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This means, that if you're a fan of OMD and is playing this game solely for the survival mode, you're stuck with the low level starter maps for quite a while.\n\nBut it isn't all just survival mode, for there is a quite nice and different moba style game as well. You maybe think "oh no, not another moba", but it's quite good, though needs more characters and refinement. So don't just play the survival mode, though that is what you may have come for, play the PvP mode too.","April 11","true","75.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, the gameplay is --FUN--!\n\nTruth is, a lot of people are being really overly-critical of this game, since it isn't exactly what the original game was, copy-pasted over again. So, ignore the "mixed reviews" thing, and really read through a few of the positive reviews. This game is good now and has the potential to become great. It just needs a bigger, more supportive community!

(And I mean, a Nikki Minaj size "but(t)" here).\n\nIf you haven't ever played OMD and you like mobas, you will like this game. A lot of people complain that it's a lot of grinding, but you CAN get every trap/character in the game without paying a dime. And that alone makes this game better than half a dozen other mobas I know of. Also, the gameplay is --FUN--!\n\nTruth is, a lot of people are being really overly-critical of this game, since it isn't exactly what the original game was, copy-pasted over again. So, ignore the "mixed reviews" thing, and really read through a few of the positive reviews. This game is good now and has the potential to become great. It just needs a bigger, more supportive community! The devs obviously wanted to try something new, and I think it's cruel of their fans to turn their backs because the game isn't a cookie-cutter cut-out of what the old game was. Just try the game.","April 30","true","66.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ive seen a lot of comments about the problem of grinding in this game, but guys open your eyes League of Legends is one of the most played MOBAS around and the game IS PURELLY GRINDING!!!!! just because you dont have items to farm but money instead it doesnt make it any better, not forgetting that the grinding on some games will actually give you a boost against enemie teams, well the DEV os this game had a really nice idea, why you ask? because all the items that would make the game unbalanced are only available on SURVIVAL mode wich is a co-op mode, making the SIEGE mode fair to everyone. Ive been playing for around 3 weeks now and i managed to get already a lot of traps , champs and so on... the DEV even came with a reward system that every other game they will give you a box wich can contain mostly anyhting!!!! Ive earned new minions, new traps , new comsumable FOR FREE... what grinding did i need to do on those? none cuz the game rewards you with it!!!! sorry but never in playing mobas have i seen something like this ( dota will rewars you with ocasional skin parts but thats it) so dont make the grinding stop you from playing this game because its not what it looks yes the survival might be more fun when you get everything unlocked but u can always go back to playing OMD1 and OMD2 but if u wanna have fun with a group of friends give it a change, ive managed to do maps wich shoudl be made with 5 people with just a friend and that was a thrill , but if its not for you try siege you'll love it and besides so far the comunity is far better then any mobva i've played!!!!!","May 23","true","79.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I even invested $20 into the game when it was in alpha. Sadly, the developers really missed the mark with this game. I loved the first game because of the traps, the combat, and the adrenaline rush. This game's traps are basically worthless, and the focus is more on hero abilities. It's basically just a third-person shooter MOBA. There's no more of the charm that the other OMD games had.\nIt seems like this game loses a part of its soul every time it gets a sequel. The first one was perfect, the second one wasn't quite as fun but co-op added some fun to it, and now that it's pure multiplayer with little focus on traps and the whole "puzzle strategy" of the originals, it's just without any charm at all.\nAlso, you kill humans in addition to orcs, and I can't figure out why.","April 2","false","0.4"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","0"

Let me say, they are mostly silly and unfair. Based on a single word: "microtransactions". Fun fact, the Devs are already fixing the dropping system with respect to the crafting system, on the base of what the players are telling them on the forums. 3rd day of Open Beta. How many games go this way?\nI don't know if those reviews are mass-suggestions, silliness, or sabotage. But their amount it's just unfair, for this game. Not even the worst game on Earth could get such a cruel judgement.\nI say, try it, play the game. It's a Beta, it has issues, it has Devs willing to fix those issues, as one can see on forums, before making a silly and "0.2 hours" review.\n\n\nEDIT 2 (60 hours). Let's see some further impressions :)\n\nNice and funny game overall, both Survival and Siege modes.\n\nDevelopers seem fair and helpful. OMD YouTube channel shows also some good testers.\n\nInitial character rush (choosing and locking): UNRESOLVED\n\nI hope all the Heroes are balanced; no pay-to-win one. UNRESOLVED atm.\n\nSome report/kicking options are needed; there are many players who aren't able to play co-op, as a team. Plus, Char Rush (see above). I think when the Staff will be larger (to check reports), those options will come :)\n\nNice crafting system; hopefully not necessarly pay-to-play. Already ADDED some nice fixes; more are expected (-> CHESTS).\n\nCustomization: Heroes, Skins, Guardians, Traps, profile/game pic avatars... That would be a good source of money, and totally not pay-to-win. Atm NO NEWS, and Heroes are still unbalanced (=P2W); but I trust the Developers :)\n\n\n\n*** *** *** OLD Review *** *** ***\n\nSince they are asking for feedbacks, here's my early (20 hrs) ones :)\n\nNice and funny game overall (referred to Survive mode).\n\nDevelopers seem fair and helpful.\n\nInitial character rush (choosing and locking): just annoying, making the game starting with the wrong foot, creating bad blood among players.\nChange in ranking/level order, or let "hero clones" (unbalanced?).\n\nMaps: can we possibly choose the one we want to play? Maybe after Players Matching, 3-5 options to vote?\n\nServers: can we see/know where are we playing? NA/EU... And possibly choose?\n\nI hope all the Heroes are balanced; no pay-to-win one.\n\nNice crafting system; hopefully not necessarly pay-to-play.\n\nCustomization: Heroes, Skins, Guardians, Traps, profile/game pic avatars... That would be a good source of money, and totally not pay-to-win.\n\nI think that if the game will proceed fine, I'll buy something even just to donate :)","April 1","true","105.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Yes, this game will obviously be a grind without paying actual money for materials, but everything that effects stats or traps can be earned. The rest is cosmetic. This is pretty common with this sort of game and uncommon for it to be any other way in a free to play multiplayer title. I hate to make the argument "well it's free" but, hey it's free. So as not to rant, I'll do the normal bullet point pros and cons.\n\nPROS\n- The game you love, Orcs Must Die, is here and still fun.\n- It is much easier than the last 2 iterations in the series to set up a co-op game.\n- You do not have to play the MOBA portion of the game\n- Working together is important and there is a lot of meta-strategy, but it's easy to get the hang of.\n- It looks better graphically than the last 2 and performs better on lower end systems.\n- The gamepad support is top notch.\n\nCONS\n- Sometimes games will boot you at the loading screen. You can hop right back into your game though, much like League of Legends.\n- The client is super glitchy. Sometimes your cursor does nothing and then other times buttons will refuse to load.\n- There really isn't a way to mess around with graphics setting. All you can do is change the ratio. This NEEDs to be fixed.\n- The pricing on the microtransactions are hardly "micro".\n- The drops rates for some of the crafting items are nearly non-existent.\n\n\nI think this game is getting an unfair rep and I'll revisit this review somewhere down the road.","March 30","true","5.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

OMD2 lost some of that luster, with its two-player co-op focus.  OMD:U abandons it entirely.

While this is very true and without paying it can take a RIDICULOUS amount of time I would like to point out that it is a free-to-play game and there does have to be some way to incline people to spend money ingame.\n\nHowever the gameplay is fantastic, especially the siege maps. The feeling of upgrading, attacking and defending all as a team with your own traps AND minions is a truly exhilirating feeling and makes for and excellent RPG/strategy/whatever game.\n\nI would also like to point out that, again progress is slow, but you do not need to progress to be good at the game and have fun. I have played a few hours and my favourite hero has to be midnight, one of the starting heroes. I find myself doing just fine using her against heroes that people have bought in the battlefield.\n\nIf you strike out on your own and fight a bunch of  enemies, yes, you are probably going to die, but thats how its supposed to be. The game is about teamwork and strategy and even if you're a tank character you're still not likely to succeed on your own.\n\nOverall the gameplay is very fun and I feel though it is still true to classic OMD gameplay it is well binded to the multiplayer mechanics and is truly worth your time if your considering playing. It is definitely worth money so you might as well try it cause its free.\n\nP.S.

But for some reason most of the time, the game says that the game is still active, puts me into it again, with only a black screen and a small blue lightning bolt. I've tried to screenshot it, doesn't work, also, it renders my computer useless. Nothing I do will fix it other than shutting it down, or restarting it.

RIGHT NOW!\n\nEDIT*\n\nOk.. now.. the real review. This game, is nothing like the first 2 games. I have been told taht the OMD franchise is amazing, and scince I curretly cannot afford OMD1 or 2, I decided to try this one. It was awful. My beast PC cannot play this game without lag. I don't know why is that, but it just seems to be like that, I even tried the lowest graphics.Also, this is nothing like a tower defence game. Its straight up a MOBA with a survival mode against minions. Traps do not matter except for having the ups in combat, because people get hurt in your traps and you get to have more HP than them (believe me, its a pretty tiny difference) .I overall do not recommend this game. Play smite if you like the MOBA part, play dungeon defenders 2 if you liked the trap and strategic part.","April 6","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harkael/recommended/427270/","harkael","Hams","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harkael/","246 products in account","I didn't spend very long with this game before reviewing it and I didn't feel like I needed to. There were three big reasons for me giving a negative review, things that immediately stuck out and made me want to exit the game and uninstall.\n\nFirst and foremost is the awful free to play model they've gone for. Something I really liked from the first two games was beating more and more difficult challenges to unlock everything. It felt rewarding! They've decided to replace that with a combination of extreme grinding and high prices. Take a look at the forums and you can see people already complaining about the grind.  What's even worse is that even if you do decide to dump $50 into this game that package doesn't seem to be enough to even unlock all of the characters, forget the rest of the stuff in the game that you may want. If you aren't sick to your stomach yet: The game is p2w as well. It seems like all the 'consumables' in the shop (which you buy with real money after suffering through 'exchanging' it for arbitrarily useless amounts of in-game currency) give distinct in-game advantages. Are you interested in spending real money to get a healing potion? This is your game.\n\nSecond, this game just doesn't 'feel' like an OMD game. It sort of plays like a shoddy knockoff. The graphics are either the same or worse than OMD2. In the couple levels I played your characters abilities just don't seem very impactful or interesting compared to earlier games.\n\nThird, and I realize this tends to invite a lot of controversy/babyrage, but for the most part I found the character design to be cliched and lame. Nearly every female hero is a ranged/stealth/magic archetype. They mostly have the same predictable 'pornstar' body type with equally predictable battle-bikini costumes. Throw in some infantilizing style choices for the non 'sexy' character and you've got a well rounded roster of gross cliches.  I didn't look at every skin for every character but it seems pretty obvious from the loading screen/promotional art what they're going for. The male characters have a huge range of ages, body types, and even species! One of the male characters actually is somewhat scantily clad, but given his bizarre proportions it seems to be a comedic choice rather than sex appeal. Maybe you don't care about this and think it's fine. Good for you, I don't want to hear it. It was enough to contribute to deterring me from the game so I included it.\n\nYes the game is in Beta, but they seemed to think it was finished enough to show to the public. Unless their development plans involve completely replacing the f2p model and redoing all the art, I don't think these problems will get any better with time.","April 2","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I spent a good 20-60$ opening chests and buying heroes but it's worth it! The problem for me is that there is a power scale and if you want to get to the top you're gonna have to spend 10$ to buy Zoey or Oziel, you could also spend 450 rift embers but it takes 10-50 matches just to get it! The chests are OK you could get them every 5 days and if you login every 20 days you get a reward (I actually never got it), I also don't like the fact that it takes 30 days to get a runebound chest! That's why I spent most of my gold purchasing chests! Those are only minor problems for me so I don't really care about it, that's why I like this game.","May 8","true","29.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have met few players who have paid real life money to get items in order to get stronger and it really was nothing fun.\nTanky character and getting 2 shotted within 2 to 3 seconds even if you try to do everything you possibly could.\n\nSum-up:\nDefinitely worth trying, but still pay to win.","April 28","true","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

A total waste of time in my opinion, and i know everyone only wants to play this game for endless but newsflash you have to be level 80, which will take you quite a while to reach. (dont even bring up winning since i've only lost one battle so its not the fact that i'm not winning, which makes it take forever to level up to level 80)","April 24","false","14.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

To get to a new trap or hero or piece of gear you really need to get a huge amount of games done. But the thing that really gets people is that the crafting mats are completely random, so it could take you anywhere from 30-100 games to get to a certain item.\n\nThis is largely frustrating because I feel like of you ignore that glaring problem the game is relatively fun, free-to-play and an okay succesor to the OMD franchise. I've had a good few laughs at the character dialogue, some great moments with trap combos and some very satifying wins with their PvP. It's almost enough to make up for the fact that past your first dozen or so hours of play you won't get anything worthwhile to add to your arsenal for a painfully long time.\n\nBut this isn't what made me stop playing. What made me stop playing was the game's level difference filter. To explain, if you group up with a friend (in PvE) who is 10-15 levels higher or lower than you you cannot que in the matchmaker and it'll just be the two of you. The level scales with number of players so it's not like the level is impossible. But what this does is that it prevents me (the higher one of my friend group) from doing anything without then making it harder for my friends to catch up. I was literally punished for playing the game if I wanted to play with friends.\n\nCombine this with the painful crafting system, several underpowered traps, slow hero balance and small hero roster my faith in Robot's capability to refine this game into a worthwhile experience (for the amount of time they're trying to squeeze out of you) has been eroded greatly.","May 4","false","60.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I spent a good 20-60$ opening chests and buying heroes but it's worth it! The problem for me is that there is a power scale and if you want to get to the top you're gonna have to spend 10$ to buy Zoey or Oziel, you could also spend 450 rift embers but it takes 10-50 matches just to get it! The chests are OK you could get them every 5 days and if you login every 20 days you get a reward (I actually never got it), I also don't like the fact that it takes 30 days to get a runebound chest! That's why I spent most of my gold purchasing chests! Those are only minor problems for me so I don't really care about it, that's why I like this game.","May 8","true","29.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Or perharps 10 if you like pvp? The game plays like classic OMD, target, shoot or swing, place traps, etc. Aim properly, dont get hit too much, play smart, and dont lose a single second!\n\nThe game is still in beta, open beta now. I started playin it in closed beta, while the previous system was active, you could buy everything with skulls (and or gold with the exeption of skin).\n\nNow the game has changed in how it implement its F2P, using an elaborated crafting system with multiple requirement, Skulls being the base. Some improvements over the old system seems to be in encouraging diversification of play and encouraging long term engagement, as well as some possible upgrade over nromal traps (waiting to test that). I have no strong opinion for or against it yet, i need to play it some more. Given that the game is free and all you need is time investment and to have fun while playing, it might be hard to claim (for me) that it is a big negative, maybe just a bit slow, but not the slowest ive seen. Plus you can always pay to get hero faster, skins, and a few random goodies. The system is still mosly the same: you need to play, and over time youll get enough for new..everything. You cannot pay to quickly earn anything specific (beside hero/skins) you want, but you could earn something random, by buying chests or from one earned during a game!\n\nThe gameplay always has been solid as far i played, direct, effetive. You can recognise the OMD franchise, especially if you like to play defence a bit.\n\nI haven't encountered any of the major issues some have mentioned, not before not now. For me the good far outweight the bad right now.\n\nThe game can carve a small niche in the MOBA market for being more than simple minions waves in lane, the traps and hero part is what make it work. Every investment, movement, action, can comeback and turn out to be a good choices, or bad. Did you leave to assist offence? surprise defense is being overwhelmed by an extra attacker themselves! Going back to try and help, could risk your entire offence! Maybe one of them is missing, lurking near your base hunting for someone? maybe they are rushing to get the second lane open to put more pressure and split the defender's ressources?\n\nAll in all, it's a solid game in it's own right, and i hope it will keep improving. As everything grow, so will this game future.\n\n-Lost\n\nEdit: and i just found out you can play solo survival OMD which also lets you earn components without stress, this is great!\n\nre-Edit: with the latest patch, the crafting just got simplified and survival feels even more like the OMD-OMD2 of old. The game keeps improving and thats what we want to see in a goos game! The game is still not P2W, and that's great!","March 30","true","88.3"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","18","39","2","0"
