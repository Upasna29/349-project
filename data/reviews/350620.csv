There's even a bit of RPG style character building mixed in in the form of skill points that you can use to boost your abilities after completing levels, but the main focus of the single player mode is on solving puzzles.\n\nThe game rewards creative thinking and patience in exploring your surroundings, and there are plenty of hidden areas and bonus items to uncover. It also doesn't hold your hand too much, which is great for people who like a challenge. The tutorial levels show you the basics and you get the occasional tips and pointers, but the game doesn't give anything away for free so to say.\n\nA special mention goes to the music, which has an old-school tracker sensibility with some spacy acoustic guitar parts mixed in. The multiplayer mode is also great for some good old team deathmatch games with the ability to build and dig ground and a variety of weapons that are actually different from each other.\n\nWriting at the time of release, there is still the occasional crash but it seems the developer is actively working on fixing those. Overall I'd say this game is easily worth the price if you like puzzle and/or FPS games.","May 5, 2015","true","12.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

It also includes a Final Boss and a Bonus level where we get a special addition.\nWe can use this extra feature to replay any level.\nIt also includes a Multiplayer Deathmatch oriented.\n\nGraphically isnt very appealing, but the strenght of the game resides in the mechanics.\nThe music is decent, some tracks are really good, some others are slightly out of place.\n\nOverall, a really entertaining puzzle game, with a cool gameplay system.\nHighly recommended to anyone that enjoys games like Portal, Qube or Quantum Conundrum.","October 13, 2015","true","24.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

But the mechanics are solid, and there's enough interesting puzzles and content for a good amount of hours yet.\nThe level I just completed was rather simple to finish, but had some more interesting puzzling to get the collectibles as well.\nIf you enjoyed the other games I mentioned, I think you'll enjoy this too. I paid sale price but wouldn't have been dissapointed at the regular price, it's so cheap anyway.\n\nAlso the mining reminds me of the glass house tech demo in the original Red Faction.","December 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/recommended/350620/","ARANimate","ARANimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ARANimate/","214 products in account","Sandmason is a first person puzzle game much like the Portal games, but instead of a portal gun you have a sand castle gun?\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward, you are a miner stuck deep inside a cave and must use your fancy pants mining tools to work your way through puzzles.\n\nUsing your mining tools you must dig through sand and avoid weird amorphous blob monsters. The catch is your mining gear has a reverse button. As you mine the sand you're actually collecting it. You then use your sand castle gun (or glove? I'm not sure. It could be like a Nintendo Sandcastle Power Glove) to creature beautiful sandcastles. Okay, not actually sandcastles. Though, you could make a sand mountain. You use the sand you've collected to build bridges, reach ledges, and flip some switches.\n\nAs you clear away the sand you will also find experience nodes that allow you to level up your abilities. So yay? I don't really see the point of the rpg elements in what is a pretty straight forward first person puzzle game. It's kind of pointless if you ask me, although I did only play about an hour of this game, so who knows. Maybe adding those extra points into mining speed and movement speed become super relevant? I doubt it.\n\nOverall, the game takes a new look at what Portal did with the genre by adding it's own puzzle mechanic in a unique way. It's enjoyable, challenging and the exploration is nice.\n\nI'll update this review with a video if I get the chance, the one I made originally had some problems =/\n\nFor more reviews and podcast check out - EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","May 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

All you have are your hi-tech mining tools. In order to get out of the caves, you will have to shape the dynamic environment to your advantage. You can also create force fields for different purposes. Roast enemies with the laser field or jump higher with the bouncy field.\n\nBy finding treasure you can boost your abilities, making your quest for freedom and a well-earned vacation slightly easier to achieve. Get a scanner to see through walls or a scifi version of the good old ninja rope to be the king of the rock jungle!\n\nAnd of course there's a story! Something weird is going on in the mines.

All you have are your hi-tech mining tools. In order to get out of the caves, you will have to shape the dynamic environment to your advantage. You can also create force fields for different purposes.\n\nWhat I think about this gameGame creates a unique sense of isolation. You are alone in an underground cave system taked with finding a way out by mining materials, building bridges with said material, and solving various other puzzles.\n\nThe game shows you what to do with the tutorial, but then throws you out in the cave system with essentailly no hints as what to do. You really have to think outside the box in this game.\n\nThe game has some outdated graphics. This may turn some people off, but I find the game to still be enjoyable despite it having older graphics.\n\nInteresting character skill point upgrade system. You can modify your mining tool stats (max capacity of materials, max mine radius, jumping distance, health, ect.). These are sort of optional, they do effect the gameplay, but you can do just fine without them.\n\nDid I mention, force fields?! That's right, your mine-tool thingy also serves as a force field gun!\n\nSoundtrack: hit or miss. Some of them are pretty good, others... not so much.\n\nAlso features multiplayer\nVery enjoyable first person puzzle gameHighly recommended for people who want to enjoy a good puzzle game that makes you think outside the box. Worth the $4 that it costs. Final score: 8/10","November 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
