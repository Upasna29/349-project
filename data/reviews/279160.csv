How much do you really enjoy retro platforming?\n\nEverything about this game is very well done: graphics, the Heavy Metal magazine heroine, and the fantastic soundtrack. There's even a good bit of replay value, which isn't always the case for platformers. The gameplay is... well, "retro".\n\nIf you've never experienced actual older games, or you tend to forget how many of them actually sucked, I recommend watching a playthrough of a game called Phantis, which this game is basically a remake or spiritual sequel of. With some exceptions, older platforming games often had slow, sluggish protagonists, with fast, incessantly spawning enemies, with awkward jumping and shooting controls. This game is no exception.\n\nSerena walks slowly. She has to stand still to shoot. There's a small delay both before and after firing the actual projectile. She can only shoot up at a shallow angle (perhaps 30 degrees), but not straight up. You get hurt from touching a robot's toe or a wizard's robe. Additionally, the delay in firing means that if you try shooting just before you land, you won't fire. Even her ship takes a moment to accelerate to full speed when moving up or down. None of these would be a huge problem by themselves, but combined, it can lead to some very frustrating moments.\n\nEverything else about Ultionus is improved over the older games; why not tighten up the gameplay too? There are also plenty of other "retro" games that actually have really great controls.\n\nAs I'm sure most can agree, it's more fun to challenge the game, not its controls. But if you love punishing gameplay, repetition until perfection, or just love all platforming games, then it's hard to do wrong by Ultionus. Even better, it's very inexpensive.","June 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 108 of 126 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","108","126","5","1"

Your character in this game controls like mud, and you cannot shoot vertically upwards for some asinine reason.  You literally can only shoot upwards at a 30 degree angle.\n\nThis was tolerable up to a point, even though there's no excuse for it.  The breaking point was an elevator level that went on seemingly forever, with a flying enemy with tons of hit points, who you have to shoot at (30 degree awkward shots) and quickly duck out of the way - except the animation time between shooting and ducking takes a long time, and that was when I put the game down.\n\nBad and slow controls make this a definite pass.","October 2, 2014","false","1.0"," 212 of 293 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","212","293","3","1"

I'm a bit baffled that this didn't land a better reception, but maybe its target is too niche--too old school, what with the not-being-able-to-move-and-shoot-while-hordes-of-enemies-fart-nightmare-storms-all-over-the-screen gameplay.\n\nOr maybe the combination of bad timing, artwork that is either grossly sexist or a poorly-explained homage, and an unattractive title did it no favors. (If the advertising focused more on the humour's self-awareness, I feel like some of these wouldn't have been interpreted so negatively.)\n\nIt looks (fantastic!) and feels like an old PC platformer you'd find before DOOM came out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/279160/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","TL;DR:  Retro-styled in looks, sound, and difficulty, this sidescrolling run-and-gun platformer with some shmup stages will slap you around a bit, but will still play fair.\n\nI'll preface this by saying I got this in the Groupees Be Mine 11 bundle.  And this is probably the first time I've gotten a game, downloaded it, played it, AND beat it all in the span of maybe a couple of days.  So with that said...\n\nUltionus is the story of a woman, her robot head partner, and a social networking comment that leads to a crash landing and a lot of things to kill.  As you can tell by the screenshots, it's a "retraux" game, a modern game made with retro-inspired graphics and gameplay.  You actually don't have a gun at the very start, so you need to rely on your bouncing robot head partner to destroy the enemies as you move to the left, and then you get a gun and can start blasting everything to death.  This threw me off at first, but that's what experimentation is for, right?\n\nI thought this game was pretty hard on Normal, but it wasn't unfair about it.  Our heroine can only take so many hits before she explodes in a shower of cartoon hearts and respawns at the last checkpoint or stage entrance.  You get restored to full health when you pass a checkpoint the first time or find a red heart 1UP.  Controls are fairly tight, though Serena is a little slow on the ground and especially while firing since she stops altogether.  You'll be spending most of your time in the air, and thankfully this game doesn't fall into "Castlevania 1 jumping" where you can't change directions mid-air.  Hitboxes seemed pretty accurate and there aren't really any fancy controls.  For the 360 controller, A could be tapped or held to change the height you jump, X and B fire your ray gun, Y doesn't seem to do anything, and the d-pad and stick both can be used for movement.  No movement faster than a leisurely walk, no sliding, no wall-jumping...simple stuff.\n\nThere are upgrades, but you not only have to find a special coin in each level, but also get to the merchant's door.  I'd also add "and have enough money to buy the upgrades" but you get money by killing everything you see, and you'll be doing that anyway.  You have to choose between offense and defense, and you can only pick one per stage.  If you find the coin and door that is.  There are multiple routes through each normal platforming stage, and the auto-scrolling vehicle ones obviously only have one route.  Get to the end of the level and you fight a giant enemy thing.  Die and you start the fight all over again.  Learn the boss patterns or you'll eat through your stock of lives (on Normal and Hardcore; Easy gives you infinite).\n\nI would honestly suggest trying this on Easy first.  It takes the pressure off of playing well and it'll allow you to go through stages by different routes and learn boss routines, even though running out of lives merely gives you a prompt to start the level over with 9 lives and all of your money, or exit the game.  I started on Normal, and I honestly game overed twice, though I didn't get the best ending (the bad ending spells out what you need to do to avert it though).  The dev has said on the Steam forum that playing on harder difficulties will unlock achievements for that and the difficulty level(s) below it.  So if you get the best ending on Normal, you get the Easy achievement too, for example.  There aren't many achievements but they're actually something to work towards.  Without trying, I got two for winning on Normal with the bad ending and watching the credits all the way through.\n\nGraphics are really colorful and the animations are quite nice.  You can pretty easily tell what would hurt you and what won't, and there's quite a bit of detail work done here.  You don't really notice the big border after a while.  I didn't really feel like I'd do better if I didn't see it at all.  The music's pretty catchy and I kinda wish there was a sound test option (or maybe there is one and I just haven't unlocked it yet).  I don't really have much to say about the sound effects.  They're there.\n\nI won't do my usual "I liked/disliked this" sections since there's not much to say.  I had fun.  My heart raced, I cursed, and I'm not only glad this is on Steam, but I'm glad I gave this game a chance.  It's short, but there's a little bit of replay value, and I can see myself giving this game a few more hours.  I've forgotten what it's like to actually have to learn patterns and get penalized by starting boss fights over when I don't.","February 28, 2014","true","4.5"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","49","66","0","2"

But... The gameplay is not quite bad but the design aimed for retro and ended up with unresponsive instead.\n\nYou can aim in only 4 directions, left, diagonal left/up. right and diagonal right/up.  It would have been better as an 8-way scheme.  Or even just up - I want to shoot up.\n\nYou can shoot or walk, not both.  And you walk slowly.  This may be a side effect but quickly swinging round to shoot and swinging back again seem to stick.  This is incredibly annoying when dealing with fast moving flying enemies.\n\nThe crouch animation is unusually long, you must wait for it to finish before firing or walking again.  Popping down to shoot and popping back up to jump and dodge stuff is not going to happen.\n\nAbout a fifth of your view is obscured on the left and right by the decorative interface.  This makes the dino-riding stage particularly vexing as you can't see what's coming.\n\nI cramped my thumb trying shoot fast - I haven't managed that since I had a Commodore 64.  Not sure if this is a good or bad point.\n\nI'm not recommending this but is a weak non-recommendation.  Learning from your mistakes is big part of the game and that's good reto but not having the space to see or control responsiveness to react is bad retro.  Games like Thundercats, Mask and Turrican all got this right 30 years ago - Ultonious really should have too.","March 7, 2014","false","2.9"," 109 of 168 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","109","168","0","0"

A throwback to where? To this Amstrad game called Phantis. After a few play-throughs of this game I checked out some Phantis vids. The protag is wearing a space bikini, there's an alien planet, a couple 2D shooter stages, and dinosaur rides. Wow it's like I'm playing a next-gen sequel!...Well if next-gen was DOS.\n\nThat's mostly what this game reminds me of. Those good old days of shareware, dozens of action-platformers, and command prompts. For the most part this game is pretty decent. It's rough at first, since the heroine has a pitiful gun and a measly three hit-points. Checkpoints are fairly frequent but the bosses are pretty brutal(pattern memorization is a must). Most of the time the trick to getting around is to simply jump a lot and fire downwards. It's a higher rate of fire, and should keep the screen fairly clear. The game can get overwhelming though, since regular enemies adhere to the Ninja Gaiden school of design. They respawn constantly and whenever you move so much as an inch off-screen. It's frustrating but hey, that's how it goes sometimes.\n\nUltionus strikes an odd balance between old-school hardcore and what we take for granted today. There are unlimited continues, saves, and extra-lives are fairly frequent. Everything else though is a lesson in pain. The hit-box is large, so Serena takes damage whether it's a projectile to the gut or an alien that just grazes the soles of her boots. Enemies also love to hang out on cliffs or appear just when you're trying to make a jump. There are ways to make the game easier on yourself, but they're not terribly obvious. In fact in your first play-through you just might miss them entirely. Four of the seven stages offer hidden armor or weapon upgrades. Once you grab the rapid-fire you're pretty well set, though armor upgrades mean more damage can be taken(plus it's fashionable!). If you manage to beat this game without any upgrades, subsequent play-throughs are gonna be easy peasy fo' scheezy.\n\nLess forgiving is that the Serena's ship is subject to inertia. Maybe that was a thing in older PC shmups but uhhhhh ehhhh ummm NO. Yeah sorry but when I stop moving my ship I want my ship to stop moving...INSTANTLY. The true final boss throws some bullets around and it makes those tight squeezes a bit too finicky. I'll throw this under nitpicking because I tend to get a little ornery about 2D shooters.\n\nOh and this game is short. Average play-through is about 30 minutes, 35 if you go for the good ending. That's in-line with Ultionus' inspiration, but it might not be enough for gamers today. I guess another one or two stages would have been nice. Perhaps these stages wouldn't be themed like the rest of the game. By that I mean Serena jumps and shoots through all too common environs. There's the Ice stage, fire stage, jungle stage, elevator stage, and you get the idea. On the other hand that extra stage could very well have turned out to be an underwater one, and that's just no bueno.\n\nUltionus does exactly what it was programmed to be; a pleasantly difficult retro-shooter-platformer. Yeah it's got issues but I dunno, I kinda like that it does. It makes for a more "authentic" experience. I've already got a billion games where the hit-boxes are perfect, the ships control flawlessly, and enemies stay dead for more than two seconds anyway. I can live on the wild side every now and then.\n\nOnce again, if you're the kinda person that buys a lot of indie bundles, you might already own this game. Give it a run-through.\n\nMusic is awesome btw.\n(That's no surprise)\n","September 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","36","48","0","0"

Each area is alright for the most part, but I'll cover it a bit more later.\n\nThe game has some truly gorgeous pixel art and it's one of my favorite looking games to date.

In fact, it is pretty much a reimagination of a legit 1987 title called Phantis / Game Over II (and originally featured artwork by Alfonso Azpiri, which explains the similarities between Serena and the famous Lorna).\n\nThe result of a game being based on something rather outdated is a title that needs a few minutes to get used to, especially when you were raised on japanese arcade/console platformers.

One could even say it's sluggish / awkward - but once you get the unusual timing (by modern standards anyway) down and accept facts like Serena's inabilitiy to move AND shoot at the same time, you will realize what an excellent game this is. There is a nice dynamic between the ever-spawning enemies and thus facing a constant threat and the limited movement forcing you to plan somewhat ahead- misjudge or mistime your actions and you will get hurt with the very real danger of dying (a lot).\n\nThere is a variety of power-ups that you can buy in hidden shops which do help you against the odds, adding a bit of replayability since you cannot get all of them in a single session. Furthermore, there a few branching paths and two endings, so there is even a slight exploration element to the game. To keep things fresh, you are not only doing platforming segments - there are SHMUP-like stages too (quite decent ones actually). Plus you get to fight some rather big, nasty bosses all nicely realized with simple but fun attack-patterns.\n\nConsidering it's a title which at it's core came straight from the late 80ies, it is also incredibly fair. There are plenty of checkpoints all around and you even get infinite lives on the EASY setting to learn the ways of Planet Phantis. As a bonus Ultionus features even a continue system AND a stage-select. Not that you would need those, since the game is nicely short. Once you learned how to do things - it's over in as little as half an hour. Which may seem short, but works perfectly for this title as far as I am concerned. In fact, the relative shortness was the main motivation for trying the game on harder difficulty settings.\n\nAll in all this is a very positive surprise, I highly recommend Ultionus to people that remember how "euro" action-games used to be like back in the days AND / OR fans of excellently realized retrogames - the pixelart as mentioned before is fantastic (and it's for the most part "true" pixelart with actual animations, none of that flashgame-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and I would pay money to own the soundtrack - it is THAT good.\n\nAn excellent addition to any retrogamer-library on Steam, and hopefully the first of many more fantastic games from "Last Dimension".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/recommended/279160/","Nitman99","Nitman99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nitman99/","2197 products in account","This is a good game! The first thing you may have noticed is the visuals, which look great in videos but are flat-out gorgeous running natively and fullscreened. It's super lush, and really evokes a 32-bit style, which is my personal favorite. And just like in a classic game, the enemy sprites are way better than the player sprite. Honestly the whole game feels really nostalgic; the controls are stiff like Castlevania or Ghosts 'n Goblins but way more responsive, letting you control your jump in midair and all that. It's a good blend of old and new. It also manages to fix a lot of old-school gripes: you don't get pushed back when hit, pits aren't bottomless, and the continue system is infinite, with the extra lives mostly there to give you more chances to figure out a boss (or on hardcore, to retry a checkpoint with full health). Enemies wander around aimlessly respawning; everything wants to kill you. The music may be the best part though, done by the great Jake "virt" Kaufman it's in a super nostalgic style that you just don't hear anymore in modern games. The soundtrack is free on his website by the way so go check it out.\n\nI can't really endorse the level or boss design, however. The game mostly comes down to navigating the mazes looking for any secrets you can find on your way to the boss, which you'll soon find out are only the shop key, the shop itself, and your buddy Balzac. It's pretty much the same thing over and over, with only a few new ideas and some autoscrollers mixed in. The bosses are also pretty weak; they look great but they come down completely to memorization. While it is satisfying when you can clear it without taking a hit, bosses that have a movepool that they draw from randomly with a bit more of a telegraph have always been cooler to me. The worst the game has to offer though is the upgrade system: for one, none of the upgrades are very tangible, usually they're just a basic shot or health up. But how you buy them is really bad: you spend your points that you've earned from killing enemies. That's not inherently bad but with no time system in place score is essentially infinite, which means very often you'll have to grind against infinitely respawning enemies until you have enough to buy it with. Why it wasn't a simple "pick one" is beyond me...I guess the balancing of score with spending it on items and clear time could make for interesting speed runs, but that's really the only reasoning I could see for it.\n\nThe game doesn't really start until you've beaten it, though. That's when you start working on achievements, which aren't too unlike other games but are still a lot of fun to plan and work through. The game is especially great on hardcore, as it doesn't just arbitrarily increase enemy strength but instead manipulates some of the established game elements like checkpoints and lives. It's really cool. I am convinced that it's impossible to beat the game on hardcore with certain upgrade paths so you may have to play it through a lot to 100%, but it's a pretty rewarding experience in the end.\n\ntl;dr: Play for the nostalgia, stay for the post-game achievement layer. The game itself is nothing special but that's ok.","June 11, 2014","true","13.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Everything is super detailed and highly polished, right down to the cabinet-style interface.  The authentic controls can present a bit of a challenge if you're more used to modern tight-handling games, but the implementation appears to have been well thought-out; there's no situation in the game that can't be handled with some finesse.\n\nThe level design is great, characters and story are silly, and the soundtrack[virt.bandcamp.com] by virt is brilliant.\n\nI just wish it were a little longer.

The graphics are superb and combine an eighties movie iconographie with Playstation 1 level quality. The gameplay is simple - get through th elevel by any means necessary. Unlike other platformers of recent years this is NOT a high precision platformer. Instead it is old school Spectrum style - slow moving, slightly sluggish, floaty jumps. Sounds aweful, but just imagine it as Resident Evil for platformers - the sluggish controls are the point. You are supposed to memorize the difficult areas (e.g. where enemies spawn on an elevator level). With that knowledge you position yourself before the enemies spawn, making it look llike an action movie.\n\nThe one downside is the game length. With less than 2 hours in a first run through there really isn't much content, so you have to judgea if the quality is worth it for you.

Awesome monsters and huge-frantic boss battles. Every inch of screen is full of charm and polish.\nExcellent FM-Synthesis-esque soundtrack (reminds me of Later DOS games) really brings everything together.\n\nThe level design is straightforward, but there appears to be multiple paths.\n\nThe dev probably needs to work on conveying game mechanics a little better, as it stands there are some things that aren't ever made clear or even mentioned in game. I got an achievement for beating the game without upgrading, and I didn't even know I could upgrade! Additionally, there are some "S" coins littered throughout the game that I still don't know what purpose they serve. I'd RTFM, if one was even included.  The achievements menu seems to convey more about the smaller mechanics than the game does itself.\n\nThe game is pretty tough, you'll probably die a lot more than you think you would based on the screenshots. I felt like this arbitrarily increased the games lenth a bit.\n\nThat last point being key because the game is very, very short. 7 stages, as it says on the tin. I've only played on easy mode thus far, but my total game time from first boot to completion was 55 minutes. I assume higher difficulty levels will increase this dramatically as easy mode has infinite lives. I'll be going back into the game's normal mode momentarily.\n\nThat being said, the game's actual quality is top notch, it's a ton of fun to play and look at. I see a lot of concerns about the "meme culture" in the trailer but rest assured it's mostly just for marketing purposes, I've yet to see any troll faces or anything of the sort in game. Only one Doge reference in the achievements menu, and I don't mind.\n\nPeople afraid of or disgusted by images of well endowed women should already know this game isn't for them from the cover art. I for one, have no problem there. Looking in the forums however, it would appear that this portion of the game did not filter out a large quantity of progressive type people.\n\nIt's definitely worth a play. 7$ is a bit steep for a single playthrough, but multiple difficulty mode, good and bad engings and so on makes this 7$ well spent.

Featuring a charming, brightly colored world with straightforward level designs, (ripped off from its fore-runner, Phantis, in places, but brightly colored and charming all the same) and bringing to the table a hilarious plot with extra funny perks for anyone who's ever wanted to reach through a computer and punch someone right in the giblets. Gameplay takes some getting used to, but in Ultionus' case it really feels appropriate to the overall atmosphere; it *feels* like a game from the early 90's in the sense that getting to understand how to take advantage of the way the character moves and shoots, and exploiting the enemy AI's moments of clumsiness, is actually part of the process of improving. You're probably going to attempt each level several times, but it's not going to be on account of a segment which can only be passed through frame-perfect timing or obstacles only visible after they've already killed you.\nAnother way of summarizing Ultionus might be to compare to an 8-bit or 16-bit era *game,* as opposed to an 8 or 16 bit *rom hack.*\nAnd I won't spoil the ending entirely, but will go on record as stating, it involves  the heroine's foot and someone's balls.","June 26, 2014","true","5.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

You lock in place when you attack, making it a commitment to fire. All this means is that you have to think about your actions before taking it. The level design is mostly set up in such a way that when you encounter a new kind of enemy or obstacle you have the means to observe it safely before engaging with it and then it'll be mixed into the standard array of things you'll be fighting, which is the smart way to do things.\nThe game is about as monotonous as the original Metroid in terms of dealing with a lot of the same enemy, but it's a lot more linear, with a sort of Metal Slug like level design, which might feel a little dull since the reason Metroid is kind of monotonous for a first player is because you're exploring, whereas this will always have you trawling through a bunch of the same foe that's barely worth fighting.\nJake Kaufman is a fantastic composer and I don't feel like I even need to describe that the music is both interesting by itself and fitting within the context of the game.\nUltionus may not feel like anything new but if you're looking for something that feels like an old SNES game or a cabinet game I recommend picking it up.","June 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the aesthetic, the music and the premise of the game. But I don't like playing it as I feel the game suffers from a severe case of artificial difficulty. I find the controls challenging in their adherence to early-90s play style (our heroine cannot walk and shoot at the same time), but that isn't where my issue lies. Rather, I think the game's "stage" is too small. I think that there simply isn't enough space between the player at the center of the screen and the edges of the screen to create a balanced gameplay experience. Either of these issues could exist in an otherwise fine game, but  together they conspire to make for an artificially difficult experience.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, I like the look and sound of the game. If you can deal with early-90s controls and a very up-close camera viewport, then get this game.

Since enemies spawn very fast, you'll be doing the stop-shoot-stop-shoot action over and over. I also dislike the fact that she can't run.

This game is short.  If you are an old school platformer/shooter fan, someone who laughs at Ghouls and Ghosts or Ninja Gaiden, this adventure will take you about an hour.  If you are...less skilled, it will take many replays, cause while the game isn't as tough as those legendary titles, it is pretty damn tough.\n\nThat out of the way, this game friggin rocks.  The graphics are very pretty and the enemies have charm and are very large and detailed.  The combat is super simplistic, basically boiling down to platforming and shooting with a gun.  There is some variety in stages that feature auto scrolling or shooter elements, but the combat is pretty straightforward.  You go from point A to point B to get through zones, though there are bonus areas in each to improve your weapons, which you spend your high score on, which is also your money.\n\nThis game is worth it for the sound track alone, which is supremely awesome and actually features a fully voiced song at the end.  And, while story is pretty much just framing device, it does manage to be pretty amusing, especially the ending, which is sweeeeeeeet.\n\nProblems with the game are enemies which respawn at a rapid rate, a very very weak weapon which you need to upgrade to even have a chance of finishing the game without a boatload of skill, you can only upgrade in the bonus areas, and some occassionally frustrating jumps.  Aside from that, it's a great ride.  Very pretty, great music, and the combat is kinda meh, but for an arcade-esque title like this, it works.\n\nIs this game worth $7?  Well, I think so.  The soundtrack is fantastic and the graphics added to that make it worth the price of admission, I think.  Give it a shot.","September 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Likable main character, great graphics, familiar play mechanics.  The shmup sections are actually a bit more forgiving than some of the old school schmups I've played.  They are still challenging though.  The platforming sections are a lot of fun.   Much like old school games of this type, once you learn the bosses' patterns, victory is pretty much yours.  In the platform sections you'll have to decide when to avoid enemies and when to shoot them.  Most take a few shots to kill, so you might want to just leave them behind rather than kill them all.\n\nThis game encourages multiple playthroughs the old fashioned way, through hidden sections that you have to unlock to reach, including a true boss ending.  The kind of thing you might have bought a guide for in the old day.  Honestly, though, you'll probably end up coming back to this one after a stressful day at work when you just want to unwind, even after you've pretty much seen all the hidden sections.  (It's not an extremely long game, but I don't really have a problem with that.  Some long games end up just repeating the same levels a lot anyway.)\n\nThe story is a nice change of pace, being based on the concept of petty revenge rather than saving the universe from the bad guys.  The whole Spacebook thing is humorous, and kind of fun for a game with such a 90's aesthetic (when Serena would surely have been using Space Geocities instead, eh?).  Serena clearly owes a lot to pulpy comic book heroines along the lines of Barbarella or Taarna from the film Heavy Metal.  (Though her story more resembles the goofy Captain Sternn from Heavy Metal or maybe one of Leela's adventures on Futurama.)\n\nAnyway, I'm recommending this to anyone I know who is currently drooling over a Retron 5, or is considering finally making that Ebay purchase of a turboExpress.

Steam is in dire need of neutral reccomendation option.\n\nIt is an almost complete rip-off of one of my favorite game series from my youth: Game Over / Phantis, that in turn is based on Milo Manara's space opera comics, as well as Barbarella.\n\nAlmost complete because it has (good) music, some scarcely animated backgrounds, is colorful (opposite to the almost-16-color-grayscale from the original) and the gameplay is faster and *WORSE* than that of the original Phantis.\nAfter playing this game for ~15 minutes, I went back to the original 256k MSX version emulated on a MSX2+ and played the full game only to compare.\n\nPhantis was slower in earlier machines, but enemies would need only ONE shot to kill. Then in machines with Turbo (overclock) capabilities (MSX2), the speed and gameplay from the original game was just... perfect. Fast and precise.\n\nThe need to fire 2 shots to kill most enemies is just plain bad. Then, I've never cared to find all powerups. Got disgusted enough with the blatant rip-off and worse gameplay at first sight.\n\nIf the authors wanted to actually improve gameplay (Instead of make it worse as they made), it would be better to insert a charging-shot 1HitKo when full from the start. Instead of the clumsy 25degree diagonal shots, that are somewhat useless and make the game less fun and less precise (Vide MEGAMAN!) than the Original game (That PLAYED more like MEGAMAN! When speeded up!)\n\nBut... Just for being a Phantis rip off, this game is somewhat special and worth it. To take a look at it, get filled with nostalgy, and then go find the 256k Phantis release to play on some emulator, with turbo on, and with a good playlist on my media player.","May 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

It absolutely excels at what it's meant to be, to emulate how a Snes game plays, feels, looks, moves and sounds. It's quite amazing and I've never played a game that does all of these things so well. More than that, the game also has the polish, level of detail and variety of a good, classic Snes game. I absolutely love this game.\n\nNow, there is the fact that a lot of reviews here are about how the controls are "unresponsive" and people write stuff like "you can't shoot straight upwards". This has caused me to break my hand and forehead by way of a massively violent facepalm, but now that I've returned from a lengthy, painful visit to the hospital, let me tell you people this: The controls are absolutely fine and simply not unresponsive at all - people who claim that have no idea what they're talking about. In fact, the controls are about as responsive and clear-cut as you can get with this type of game. You have complete freedom mid-air, the movement isn't slippery, your character only moves exactly as much as you press the direction button, there are no lost inputs, nothing like that. This is way easier to control than, say, Ghouls & Goblins, old Castlevania games, old Nes games that had weird momentum physics (the original Mario Bros. counting among them) and the like.\nAnd you can do exactly as much as you need to do with your weapon. It's actually mind-boggling for me to read people writing stuff like "you can't shoot straight upwards" when there's really no place anywhere in the game where that would be useful.\n\nI suggest anyone who has problems with the "controls" to put the game on Easy mode, get a turbo controller and also a Game Genie. You can easily beat this game on Normal in little more than an hour or so and not have any problem with the controls if you're not a dink.\n\nSo, I recommend this game if you like old Snes games and stuff like that and you're not a dink.","December 2, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Instead you must avoid them, but that sorts of defeats the player's ability to explore the levels which have multiple paths, because you are constantly jumping around avoiding everything around you. By the way, these enemies have no AI, the moment they spawn they have a path, and they just follow said path.\n\nThe bosses though, are an enjoyable experience, they act in pretty much the same way as the enemies, they have a pattern and they follow it without considering the player, but in thi case this decision makes much more sense as bosses usually confine you on a close space, multiple lives makes learning the patterns an accessible challenge and over all theymake a good job of teaching you how to defeat them.\n\nThe game has another huge problem though, it crashes very frequently, on my first 20 minutes playing, it crashed twice.\n\nAll that being said, the game's art is GORGEOUS, the levels feel very unique, there's a crazy amount of detail on everything, and the animations are great, nothing too complex, but not too shabby in any way either. Last dimension seems to come from a guy with experience in the industry, that is trying to go at it on his own. I can appreciate his efforts, however, his specialty, 2D pixel art, is still at this point his only forte, as far as this game shows me.\n\nLast Dimension needs a dedicated Programmer and/or Game designer, either that, or maybe it just needed this, in my opinion, failed experiment in order to get feedback and experience for a following project. Either way, while I cannot recommend this game, I can certainly recommend following Las Dimension's next efforts.

Since the original review was published i've gone and troubleshooted my way about the game. What seems to be the problem is that the engine used for this game just doesn't care for particular controllers and their drivers, mine in question is MotioninJoy and better DS3.

The music is fantastic and it has a "classic" level of difficulty, that being that it's rediciously hard.

It's very successful in looking retro without seeming wonky, cheap, or rushed. And, while I don't approve of the insistant usage of yet another scantily clad female main character with unrealistically drawn breasts, I'd be willing to forgive it if the gameplay was good. The gameplay is not good. The gameplay is not even mediocre. It's bad. The space ship sections are alright, if bland, feeling taken right out of R Type or it's DOS clone Xatax, both of which are a lot of fun, so while it doesn't live up to either of those games, these parts are passable. It's the platforming sections where the game falls apart. You see, this is not one of those awesome, tightly wound platformers like Commander Keen, Jill of the Jungle, Xargon, or Jazz Jackrabbit that you might have grown up with. It's a slow, unresponsive mess that substitutes endlessly respawning enemies (poor idea, absolutely ruinous execution) for actual level design. There's obvious Metroid inspiration here, but the game fails to even come close to living up with it. Shooting on foot is a chore, and that's all you're going to be doing. Walking sideways, shooting endlessly spawning enemies, occasionally falling into a new section of level that is nothing more than another corridor full of more endlessly spawning enemies. Occasionally you'll fight a frustrating and overpowered boss. Despite those complaints, the bosses are actually a stronger point than the levels, as they at least sort of work on the most basic mechanical level, which is more than I can say for the on-foot platforming sections. Ultionus plays like a poor phone game that was someone's first programming project. There's potential here, but the only way the game will live up to it is if everything other than the art assets is scrapped and started from scratch. Enthusiastically not recommended.\n\nAs an afterthought, the music is quite good as well.

This doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good game. I've played a megaton of NES games in my life and compared to those this game is very mediocre. Ultionus is not completely terrible as a retro blast but it's biggest merit must be the heroines boobs (if you're into pixel-girls). The gameplay is as stiff and unforgiving as NES games, playable but not for those that are accustomed to fluid and fast paced movement. Level layout seems a bit random and in the beginning I wasn't sure which way I was supposed to go.\n\nI managed to get to the second boss fight which seemed a bit tedious and luck based (for my quick gameplay) and stopped there. I don't think the game's too hard for someone with a background like mine but this game might seriously intimidate newcomers and younger people. Definitely not a childrens game.\n\nOverrall Ultinus: A Tale of Petty Revenge just isn't good enough. It's not bad but I recommend booting up Metroid on NES emulator instead.

Most of the time I just find myself running past everything, hoping those three hit points will get me to the next checkpoint. Everything seems to spawn faster than you can shoot so why even try to fight back? That just puts you at risk of getting killed by the soldier or alien behind the one you just gunned down, or perhaps an entirely different direction all together.\n\nThe boss fights are equally as mindless, providing nothing more than a basic memory game but without the proper animation tells to give you an idea of the pattern before you've blown through all your miserable lives. Clearly uninspired and phoned-in as an afterthought.\n\nNot all of Ultionus's problems relate directly to its gameplay; in my hour or so of playtime I found myself encountering a number of bugs, everything ranging from incidentally gaining the ability to walk in the air (harmless) to losing functionality of my d-pad after respawning requiring a client restart to fix (game-breaking). The game also suffers from framerate issues which, while one might construe this as intentional given the nostalgia factor, it apparently isn't according to the developer and his purported fix (disable gamepad support) doesn't do jack ♥♥♥♥ to help. The more likely reason is that Ultionus is built on the garbage-tier system that is GameMaker which to my recollection is known to be problematic for everyone involved on the distributive end.\n\nAll-in-all, Ultionus is a perfect example of why some game design mantras are much better left in the past because when it comes down to it, there's a pretty big difference between classic and dated and if Ultionus were an actual retro game? It'd fall squarely in the latter, no questions asked.","June 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Good level design and enemies variety, also the boss fights are nice and challenging.\n\nBut, the controls are bad. The character is so slow and she can't shoot while walking.\n\nSo, the game basically is: stop, shoot, jump over the enemy, shoot him from behind. Then, seconds after killing 2 or 3 guys,  stop, shoot the new enemies, jump over, shoot from the back again, walk, dull like that. And so on, until you find a boss. The boss fights are waaaay better and funnier than the average enemies fights.\n\nIt's not a bad game at all, it's fun to explore the levels and discover hidden stuff. The only negative aspect is the controls. Ultionus controls', in my opinion, almost ruined the game. It's not like the game is unplayable, but a lot of times is frustrating how easy you die just because of the lack of walking and shooting at the same time.\n\nI recommend only if you're a fan of the genre and old school platformers. Otherwise, it's better to look for other platformer games.","May 27, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I understand when people say the controls should be updated, but if you know what to expect, or are even eager, this is a really nice game.\n\nI've only had the opportunity to play and beat the first level including the boss on easy. If the visuals, audio, and overall presentation remain consistent, it was worth the $5 sale price even if it only lasts an hour or two.

And, at first, I was put off by the control scheme. But after almost two years I thought "what the hell", returned to the game and completed it on Easy difficuly first, and then on Normal with Good ending.\n\nI must say that this game should be seen primarily as work of art and not as something intended to "play" with. The art has to be consumed, and to do that, you have to learn keystrokes using try-and-repeat method. When it becomes almost automatic, you can concentrate on music, sprites and spectacular backgrounds. Which, in turn, makes completion of the game very satisfying.\n\nI want to thank the author, I will definitely buy his other game, Mystic Belle, and I will look forward for more titles from Lost Dimension. Keep on both doing the great work and having the fun!\n\nBTW, to the guys who complain that character can't move and shoot at the same time: you can shoot during the jumps as much as you want, and, as a bonus, jumping intead of walking allows you to survive longer.","June 5","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
