I've only played James's route so far, but the story was awesome and I can't wait to play the others.\n\nThe only negative I have for this game is the difference in art style compared to the first.

While I'm still navigating through endings, I can already say it's better than the first. Well done, Michalea. I am impressed, yet again.\n\nI do have one problem though: The Wives. I'm not sure if they were a kickstarter reward or something, but they feel pointless and irrelevant, regardless. The 4 remaining brothers bring their human (I'm assuming) wives to the demon world to rescue the other brother's wife from the demon world? What...? I may be missing something, but they just seem to take up space and that annoys me.\n\nI'm doing my best to ignore them, so I still think this is a great game.","May 25","true","6.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","1"

As soon as I saw this available, I had to buy it (and nope I couldnt wait until it was on sale). Ok but fangirling aside, I am in love with this visual novel (so far) as much as I am with the first game. The writing is impeccable and really well done (and seriously one of the best written visual novels in my opinion). And I have to also say the voice acting is great, especially K who cracks me up with her humor. I know I am not too far into my playthrough, but I will update as I go along. (And truthfully, I dont need lots of play time to know that I already love this game.) I have started with Diana's route, because hey who doesnt like bewbs (hey I am a woman who can appreciate both the men and women) ;) Which makes me wish they continued the protagonist's romances with her friends, Suzu and Naomi, and had routes for them as well.\n\n^^^EDITED: I just finished Diana's route and I have to say it was great...however it was incredibly SHORT (in my opinion) at least compared to the first game. So would i still recommend this game, heck yes but just be aware that it is short as it took me no time at all to get through one route. HOWEVER after completing Sam's route I want to say that his route is much longer than Diana's (which is a bit disappointing that her story wasnt as fully fleshed out as the brother's route).  MATTHEW's Route: At the end of the story, Diana had died, but when K did her little epilogue monologue somehow Diana was now alive? So there are a few discrepancies in the story which may have confused and irked me a litte.^^^\n\n***Will edit review once I get further along! I hope you all also enjoy this game as much as I am***","May 23","true","25.9"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","21","31","7","0"

Assuming you choose a different trainer each time, all the routes are 90% different with the exception of Diana because her route is completely different than the others.\n\nVoice Acting bloopers unlock when you've gone through all the routes and they are hilarious XD","May 31","true","26.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Samatura/recommended/461700/","Samatura","Samatura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Samatura/","51 products in account","After playing the first one, I can honestly say this is an outstanding sequel. It has so much to be offered, and the stories are all unique, over lapping only in a couple places, where the first game followed the same story with changes for each boy. Each of the incubi have their own routes now, very independent with different stories, and lots of detail and character development. The story is long but not boring, and you never feel like you're simply repeating the same story. In addition, choices matter here; there are good AND bad endings, and all are well written. Play the first Seduce Me to get the full story and experience.\n\nThe world of the demons is so new and broad, there is a lot to learn, and lots of new characters to interact with and learn about. If you're a fan of the first Seduce Me, this is a must have. The game devs out did themselves with this. Not only this, but there are tons of achievements that will leave you hunting for more content and digging deeper into choices you may have found unimportant.\n\nOver all, I'm thoroughly impressed by this. As a fan of the first game and one of the kickstarter backers, I am thrilled at how it turned out. Buy it, revel in it, and enjoy.","May 25","true","16.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I really don't want to spoil anything, but essentially you start where you left off with the boy of your choice, (or Diana) and due to a series of unfortunate events end up in the middle of a demonic civil war. will your love conquer all? will you be able to return home with your lover? WILL SOMEONE FINALLY EXPLAIN WHY ERIC PARTS HIS HAIR THAT WAY?? (the answer to this last question is no)\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nthey are true to their personalities from the first game, but new things are learned about all of them. the things the characters must toil through in the game only help them grow as people/demons/demoness'. they are all very likable and enjoyable as characters, although once in awhile they say something really cliche that makes you want to throw up, but that actually makes them feel even more like real people.\n\nSEXY STUFF\n\nwhile I love the story of this game, and it kept me on the edge of my seat at times, to be honest I'm a huge pervy weeaboo. a fangirl with a thirst for this kind of ♥♥♥♥. it's really hard to be in this situation, because there's very few otome games out there that offer anything ACTUALLY sexual with the male characters. I mean, I'm pansexual so I have a lot of other choices of the bishojo variety. but to see a game like this with actual sexual content makes a single steamy tear flow down my nerd face. if this category is the most exciting thing to you, PLEASE PLAY SAM'S ROUTE *heavy breathing*\n\nI would also like to mention as a side note that you don't have to actually participate in anything sexual to get the good endings, if that's not your thing, because like the narrator says "consent is important!" :)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nwhile it does sometimes fall into the common tropes and predictabilities of most dating sims, it's still a really good game with round(ish) characters and the experience is only enhanced if you are a fan of the prequel. also, you know in the first game I could never really get over how their eyes were like an inch higher then they should've been but I think the animation is A LOT better in this one, so you know there's that too.

The question is, was its sequel successful in seducing me?\n\nIn my opinion, after playing through three different routes, I find that this is a fantastic stand-alone game, as well as a great sequel, worth the complete full price - and i'll tell you why! (Ahoy, mild spoilers ahead! Won't spoil any end-game things though!)\n\n+ Story is infinitely better than the first. It has a more cohesive, fleshed-out plot rather than being all over the place like in the first. This sequel knows its beginning, middle and end and displays great pacing which makes the game feel wrapped up well at the end. It embraces the "Demon" storyline as a main factor in this game, rather than having it as a side aspect to speed up the relationship process. The story is insanely different in each route (I have played Sam's, Matthew's and James' stories, all vastly different and enjoyable). There is PLENTY of choice, and the story itself is really just so much fun to experience, with both love and war being the main topic. I have had so much fun playing this game.\n+ Art. The Art was a mixed bag, but I will talk about what I liked first because my thoughts on the art are mostly positive. It has greatly improved since the first game, and with this improvement the characters have changed slightly. I really loved this change - mostly. Matthew looked good. Sam, James and Diana look absolutely awesome. The backgrounds were lovely and I thought the game as a whole was easy on the eyes. There is better art in other VN's, but the art in these two games has a lot of personality imo.\n+ Voice acting is better than ever. Every voice actor, yet again, did an amazing job. I was sort of hoping that "Mika" would have a proper voice this time around, but to no avail. Anyway, waiting on that blooper reel, Michaela. Pls. Need more Jonah and green apples in my life.\n+ Replayability. I mentioned in the story section that there are plenty of choices, and there really are. Each story is so amazingly different, I found out so many different things in three different playthroughs, and I'm still not bored of the game. I still have plenty of achievements to unlock. The first game got incredibly repetitive. This one, while in some parts does still repeat, is not even on the same level of repetition.\n+ Those sex scenes doe. This game is like 80% fanfiction lemony smut goodness and it's just great. Love it. It's even better that you're granted the choice to avoid them completely - not that I'm going to do that ever - but you know, that's great for people who don't like that sort of stuff\n+ Characterization. The guys in their routes really shined once more, really grew throughout the story, showcasing their relatibility and flaws. The side characters were very interesting too when you selected their training, especially Saero. However, Diana is the character that truly shines in this sequel. She tugs at your heart strings and makes you feel the feels without even starting her route. If you hated her in the first game, you'll love her in this one.\n+  Music is on point. That piano? Christopher Escalante you are the man. I'm not a person that focuses on music, but every time that piano came on I would just sit and listen to it in a dreamy state. Action/fight music is also amazing and gets you so pumped up. Overall, the music was never annoying, repetitive or too loud.\n\n- Art - While I overall enjoyed the art, I had a couple problems. Erik's face was drawn well but his physique looked unnaturally thin, though this didn't bother me too much. What bothered me the most was Damien. Suddenly shorter and looking really nothing like what he is meant to, each time he popped up I got annoyed. His body looks weird. He looks 5 years younger than he did in the first. I assume this happened because he is in fact the youngest and they were trying to re-establish this but isn't Matthew meant to be the babyface? These changes made him feel like a different character. I suppose the same could be said with Sam, but I thought his change was for the better and was a vast improvement in comparison to Damien's.\n- The Wives. Okay, I've got to say it. I have no idea if this is true or not, but did some fans win a competition to have their OC's inserted into the game? Because this is exactly what it feels like. For majority of these wives, it feels like they were created by a 12-year-old on DeviantArt. They aren't explained properly. It's not realistic to think all the guys would be married in a mere two years. They have no substantial impact on any plot or dialogue. They are there, purely and simply for one reason: fanservice. The only wives I liked are Irene (Erik's wife) and Carrie (Sam's wife). The rest are painfully hipster and "unique", looking like they haven't started high school yet. Their addition was forced and broke immersion.\n- No art for MC. This game felt like it was trying to completely get rid of "Mika" Andersons' pre-established appearance from the first game. In three playthroughs I saw the back of her head once. I just didn't understand this. We know what she looks like, why not draw her instead of drawing one of the boy's from a provocative perspective? (Update: She is drawn in Erik's route, so apologies for this one. I think she could have been drawn more though)\n- There's bugs. Incorrect text from different playthroughs. I got some achievements that I shouldn't have got. Not a huge deal, I understand the game was rushed out.\n\nTL;DR: Overall, I enjoyed this story a lot more than the original. It was more entertaining and well structured than the first, definitely worth $10. It's 80% lemon. You get to fight things. There's lots of nipples for the whole family to enjoy.\n\n8.5/10 - It seduced me again.","May 28","true","17.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Now instead of worrying about which Incubae you want, you are fighting for your life in the demon war. While it is a bit fast it does have replay value. There are a lot of different ends and very funny scenes to look for. It\'s imaginative nd it has voice actors, which is above the usual VN experience. It\'s a wonderful game and the music is to die for, but try to make it out of the fight alive. ;)","June 1","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first game was good, but the sequel blows it out of the water! Each route is unique, which is the best improvement from game one I think. They each have completely separate conficts! My favorite so far might be the Matthew route. The secondary villain is voiced by Brittany Lauda! The voices are all stunning though, not just hers. The music is also very great! It is very emotional, and fits every scene well. The writng was beautiful, and definitely enhanced by the voice acting.

First my opinion will be mostly biased, because the first game was awesome. Having said that I only played through Damien's story also, so I noticed a few places where the voice actors words didn't match the ones diplayed, (Very rarely happened) other than that the story was very interesting and kept me on my toes for sure! The music was fantastic, I don't know what the name of one composition was but it literally brought tears to my eyes. The song at the credits was probably my favorite though, you have an amazing voice! The voice acting was great as always, I would have to say it greatly improved from the first game ^.^\n\nThere was one thing that made me nervous going into this game from playing the demo, but it worked out perfectly; I was concerned with the new character models and such being so different from the first game. But having said that I really grown over them and I like them the way they are.\n\nI hope you keep up the amazing work and I'll be sure to check out any future work from you and help Kickstart some more of your stuff!\n\n-Terry L'Heureux","May 24","true","10.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","0"

That in itself wasn't too bad. Co-opting a little more religious imagery to flesh out the universe isn't a bad thing, especially since "demons" and "angels" have basically become part of pop culture. Obviously these beings are no more related to Christian angels than the demons are to Christian demons (that is, not at all). That was my thought process, anyway, as I continued to play the story.\n\nAnd then the use of cross symbols started.\n\nI'll just go ahead and say it. I found that offensive. Extremely offensive. After all the consideration shown about trigger warnings and consent, to then use a religion's most holy symbol in such terrible ways... I couldn't believe it. And I was very disappointed, since until now I've loved just about everything in Michaela Laws' various games. I understand there was no malice here, only ignorance, or, at worst, a vague contempt for anyone who "takes these things seriously," but I still had to say something.

First things first, if you want a good voice-acted visual novel with awsome artwork, then THIS is the game. Seduce Me 2 is a direct sequel to the first game (which is free if y'all wanna take a look). In short, you play as a human girl that is about to be married to one of five incubi brothers (or a beautiful succubus princess ;D). Unfortunately, things don't go as planned and you get dragged into a Demon War that you maaaaay or may not have had a hand in...\n\nStory: Mmmm THIS is where games are a deal breaker for me, as I love reading and writing stories. SM2 is beautifully written and each path you choose is unique in its own way, which is a definite improvement from the first game. The choices your MC make are relatively open most of the time, and my favorite part about this is you don't HAVE to have sexy time with your demon to get a good ending. The SM team is very big on proper consent with your partner. You don't HAVE to sleep with someone just because they're a sex demon or etc. Not only that, but there are so many different endings you can get, to the point where sometimes it can get frustrating. For me, the hardest was Erik since I kept dying, haha. But it's really satisfying when you see every single secret and ending the game has to offer since you really have to work for your results.\n\nCharacters: You definitely see the character development throughout the game, and it was even more apparent if you also played the first game. Like damn, that's my other weakness in stories (I'm so proud of my green sinnamon roll). I was also very surprised with how all the new characters interacted with each other. Usually you'll have minor characters that are there simply for decoration or for a bit of extra dialogue. In SM2, each side characters has a story of their own and further expands the world of the Abyssal Plains. You'll spend a long while revealing secrets, such as who Diana's guard is, or why Sergeant's horn is broken, etc.\n\nSound/Music: YES! I loooove the music, so good job Christopher Escalante. Also to Jonah Scott too for sound design. It was a huge improvement from the first game and I found myself crying and laughing many times while playing. I'll admit that sometimes the music will suddenly shift in an awkward place, but it's not too distracting.\n\nArtwork: Not going to lie, when I first saw the changed art style, I had my reservations. BUT the more I played, the more it grew on me and I actually found myself loving it. The CGs are really well drawn/colored and the backgrounds are GORGEOUS. They really help paint the image of the Abyssal Plains while I play. The only complaint I have are some of the characters' arms are in awkward positions (especially noticeable when in demon form). Nothing huge and I can't fault the artist since it's better than having everyone in the exact same pose.\n\nBugs/errors: As with all games, we'll have our share of bugs and errors. Luckily I haven't had anything game breaking happen to me so far, but occassionally you'll get a strangely placed character when skipping a few lines. Before the recent update, some lines weren't matching up with the vocals, or if you did not poison someone, the end dialogue says that you actually DID. I THINK these were fixed in the most recent update, but I haven't had time to test them all just yet. But anyway, the bugs aren't that gamechanging.","May 31","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes a lot to get me to write a review on a game, and honestly, Seduce Me 2: The Demon War deserves it!!!

The boys\' routes have similar starting points but vastly different subplots that make each one interesting in their own right. Each character - the love interests and the new side characters - have wonderful development and are excellently voiced.\n\nIt feels more like an experience and less like a dating sim - not that I dislike dating sims, clearly, but the environment here is epic and grand.\n\nThe music is gorgeous, the art stunning, and the atmosphere all encompassing and engrossing.\n\nMy one criticism would be that I really wish we knew more about the wives. For those who haven\'t played or gotten very far, each of the incubi that you AREN\'T playing the route for has a wife, who is brought along with them on the journey to the Demon World. Personally, I loved having more female characters in the game and I really enjoyed the way the wives were drawn and the scenes where all ten of them (the incubi, the wives, and the MC) were bantering together. But with the exception of Sam\'s wife, we don\'t get any backstory on them. We don\'t know how they met their chosen husbands, how much or how little they know about the demon world and how they know it. I would\'ve loved more on them but I do understand that it\'s the MC\'s story, after all.\n\nAnd what a story it is. I highly reccomended this game. It\'s well worth the cost.","June 1","true","75.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every choice you make impacts the story somehow to the point you have to play though the game several times to find all of the hidden scenes and other secrets that help tie the whole story together.","May 31","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed how the stories were different for each character yet overlapped so well as a whole. The endings were amazing (and some were super sad!) but that just drove me to play more to get the good endings! The art style and voice acting are great too! I highly recommend this game!","June 3","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I give it a "boyfriend that loves me with all his heart" out of "my pathetic existence that has no love or emotion". I love how each boy has a unique story unlike the first one. So I give it a 9/10 (would wish to date one of the brothers in real life), why? Because Damien looks horrible compared to the first game (aside from the CGs).

Almost none of the wives are human, and they are going through their own trials.","June 6","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
