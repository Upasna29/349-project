That being said, if you enjoyed those games or are open to experiencing a mature and realistic story, you might find that you enjoy The Novelist as much as I did. You play as a 'ghost' (for lack of a better word) that observes and influences a family of three (Dan, Linda, and their son Tommy) during a summer spent in the Oregon countryside. The game is sub-divided into 12 chapters, each of which has a central problem such as a family member drinking too much, a death in the family, or a child's difficulties learning. Your task is to explore the thoughts and memories of each family member and determine how they would deal with the outcome in the way most desirable for them. Inevitably this leads to a prioritization of people that results in a lot of uncomfortable trade-offs: Do encourage Dan to spend more time on his novel at the expense of his relationship with his wife and son? Or, do you make the family spend as much time together as possible at the risk of their professional obligations? And, perhaps more importantly, which of these outcomes do you choose consistently?\n\nThis is a game that you may only get 2-3 hours of playtime out of, but I valued those 2-3 hours a great deal.","December 9, 2013","true","2.1"," 440 of 487 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","440","487","0","1"

I was expecting something akin to Heavy Rain (minus the murder mystery), with choices presented very naturally through events and conversations within the game. That's not what I got.\n\nThe Novelist started off as a quirky game that I believed could offer a few hours of enjoyment. For that first day, I was intrigued with my ability to  sneak around the house, observing this family while trying to learn from each family member what they wanted. However, by the end of the first day I found that my interactions with the family were limited to taking one persons side (or maybe finding a compromise). What this game boiled down to was picking up notes, listening to a few snippets of dialogue and then being offered the dreaded choice of A, B, or C (or red, blue, green if you prefer to see it that way). I didn't feel like I was involved with their lives. If they happened to see me, the only penalty was losing the option to choose a compromise. You don't feel as though you have any real role in their lives, except for making that one choice at the end of each day. This is something that gets repetitive very quickly.\n\nEven worse, you don't actually watch the family live their lives, you learn about it through notes. The sole role of the physical characters is to simply be there and provide (optionally) a watered down stealth mechanic. You don't interact with them, you don't learn about them from watching their routine, at most you get not even a sentence from choosing to listen to their thoughts. They may as well not even be there in the game.\n\nI have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed with this game (it hardly has the interaction to be called a game) and could not recommend it.","December 10, 2013","false","1.0"," 381 of 501 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","381","501","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/recommended/245150/","urganite","Urganite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/","233 products in account","I was briefly torn about whether or not to recommend the game, but after about five minutes of reflection, I can safely say that this game isn't worth buying. Despite having a great concept and being superficially well-made for an indie game, for the brief and predictable story, the asking price is extremely steep. The enticing story-and-gameplay concept is, sadly, completely and utterly wasted. This game could have been made between fifteen and twenty years ago as a college project and would be expected to be distributed for free.\n\nMost of the critique of the game will be about the story, so a bit about the gameplay first. As far as point-and-click adventure games go, this is one of the most simplistic. I've seen -more- simplistic games that I did play, but I can't think of any right now. There are no puzzles, nothing to figure out. You just find all the stuff that glows when you mouse over it, then sneak up behind everyone to see what they're thinking. Playing in stealth mode is a joke, no challenge (even for the minimally competent) whatsoever. The graphics are acceptable for the style (and one might assume, budget). The sound and music are pretty good, but they don't really seem to fit the mood of the game very well. It's sort of like matching up Silent Hill's music and sound with Casper the Friendly Ghost.\n\nThe main part of the game is its story, and while I'm not opposed to a cliche setting or starting scenario, sadly the story does not really progress beyond the starting situation. Which is a shame, because the voice acting was pretty good. I played in stealth mode, looked at every interactable object, viewed every memory, unlocked every story option, and was never seen by any of the family members. Finished the game in 2.8 hours, got an ending I would consider 'good', and I have no desire to play it ever again.\n\nInstead of really giving you choices that matter that actually branch out the storyline, the three maladjusted characters are put on a sacrificial altar and the player gets to decide who will get to act all pissy/mopey/whiney this chapter. Some of the 'choices' offered are split between propriety and a non-sequitur option. Not chosing the non-sequitur option has the same level of consequences for the affected character as failing to fulfill social/societal expectations. Additionally, the choices are made for an entire week at a time, but most of the life-altering 'choices' are things that might take anywhere between fifteen minutes and a couple of hours in most of the chapters, or wouldn't be mutually exclusive no matter how you looked at it.\n\nMinor Spoilers: Hilariously, despite being myself in a somewhat similar life position as Dan, I could not find him interesting or identifiable. He's mopey and non-commital, and if I think of Tommy's reading troubles as hereditary, that would explain Dan's writer's block pretty well. I found it so hard not to disparage Linda as a selfish, whiny bellyacher, that I kind of just did. Tommy is a static and boring character, even for a kid. He exists in the story to be the sacrifical lamb whenever you decide talentless Dan should do his job or do apparently incapable Linda's work for her, however more often than he seems neglected, he seems more like a spoiled and undisciplined crybaby with more cognitive deficiencies than poor reading comprehension.\n\nI have problems with the writing for the game, as the game's primary tension is the supposed marital problems between Dan and Linda, which are barely mentioned. The only problems I can see the two having are related to Linda being an implacable whiner who blames Dan for her lack of drive, focus, and ability for most of the game (for perspective, I still got what I would consider the best ending for their relationship). This is made worse by the half-hearted attempts to frame Linda's personality as creative and indepenent using her own words, which make her look hypocritical and even more selfish and listless. While this can be considered a negative personality trait written into the character, I can't help but feel the writer is tacitly implying that women expect their husbands to do everything for them. Personally, I can't stand her the way she is written.\n\nThere's never even an insinuation that Dan is writing the book to provide a living for his family, and given that zero of your decisions seem to change which or how the chapters play out, all the more reason for the player to never help him do it unless you think supporting his pride/hubris as a writer is important. The characters certainly never act like the book is at all important to their well-being. That said, Dan's choice is almost always about industriousness, the other two choices are usually about him satisfying the demands of his family, so it would make a lot of sense if you could 'lose' the game by failing to help him write a good book and meet deadlines. Several of the choices -seem- like they would be weighted to give you a better score with both the book and with the family, but that does not actually appear to be the case.\n\nFinally, I did not feel any of the decisions were particularly hard or weighty, and I feel I would not ever have made different decisions at any point in the game. The fully linear chapters and extremely repetative gameplay made my stomach hurt with frustration as I wanted and tried to hurry up and finish. The ending (as with all of the chapter plots) was mundane and predictable. The character outcomes were clearly linked to a hidden score and had no relationship to any of the actual decisions made throughout the storyline.\n\nIf I didn't get this game with a bundle, I would be extremely upset about having paid any specific sum of money for the product.\n\nAnd, there you have it, folks. A review that nearly took longer to write than the game took to finish.\n\nEdit: Clarified the intro paragraph.","January 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 71 of 79 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","71","79","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/245150/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","The Novelist is a story driven adventure game that takes place in a summer home. The main character, Dan, takes his family to this place so he can get away from the city and focus on his book. You don't actually play Dan, or any of his family members, you play some sort of ghost, who is trying to influence their lives.\n\nFirst of all let me adress a small issue. This game is what I would consider "Art". Therefore, there isn't much in terms of the standard definition of gameplay. There are definitely choices, and different endings, but you really aren't doing much. Your watching the story unfold based on your choices. Especially if you play in story mode.\n\nThere are 2 different types of modes. Stealth and story. In story mode, the family is unable to detect you, leaving you to be able to discover clues and read their memories with ease. This is what you would want to choose to just focus on the story. Stealth includes a stealth mechanic to the game, you must remain out of site. For the first time, I'd recommend using stealth. It makes it feel more like a game, even though without the mechanic I would still call it a game.\n\nOkay, the story. The story is great, and the choices, unlike other games that claim this, actually count. Your choices will reflect in the ending no matter which exact "ending" you choose. And I do not believe there is a perfect ending. No matter what, someone will end up disapointed one way or another. That's what I love about this game, because that is life. You can't make everyone happy. And when your in an outsider situation, that makes it even harder. The story isn't complex or epic, and it doesn't have to be. It's a simplistic story about a families life and problems. But it feels real, and I love it.\n\nI absolutely love story driven games, and I'm glad I spend 15 bucks on The Novelist. If you enjoy games like The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, and the sort, you will love The Novelist. I surely hope people give this game a chance.\n\nBuy At Full Price","December 10, 2013","true","3.0"," 61 of 77 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","61","77","0","4"

You move among them in a first person view and have to avoid detection if you want to help them in the most effective ways. The movement in itself can be entertaining as you stalk the family and zip from light fixture to light fixture.\n\nThe game also has quite a bit of content to explore, especially if you want to (probably out of intense guilt) revisit the family and see how things might have gone differently.","December 3, 2013","true","0.2"," 166 of 247 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","166","247","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/245150/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account",""Human beings are born solitary, but everywhere they are in chains - daisy chains - of interactivity. Social actions are makeshift forms, often courageous, sometimes ridiculous, always strange. And in a way, every social action is a negotiation, a compromise between 'his,' 'her' or 'their' wish and yours." - Andy Warhol\n\nThe Novelist is a story driven narrative exploration game that strolls around quite loaded terms like choice, goals, drives, relationships, priorities and compromise. The concept that the game revolves around - influencing social dynamics to observe the result of interrelated choices and their consequences - is an interesting and hard to accomplish one. Sadly its presentation within the game both in definition and execution, is definitely flawed.\n\nHere, we take a quick glance at the Kaplans - a family of three going through a though time. Dan is an author who's stressed out to complete the novel that he's been working on, Linda has some worries about her marriage and family ties - also struggles on going back to being a painter. Tommy, their only son is having some adaptation and learning difficulties who needs his parents' attention and support full time. At the beginning of one summer, the Kaplans decide to pass their vacation in a rental villa by the seaside to have some quality time and possibly work through their problems, a villa that YOU reside in... In this detached little game, you are a ghostly entity - who's presence within the house will never be explained properly. You have the ability to stalk, observe and influence the Kaplans, thus deciding the story of this specific family in the end.\n\nThe game has two distinct modes: Stealth or Story. In Stealth Mode, you have to avoid being seen by the Kaplans if you'd like to explore everything. If you are seen, they get nervous and focus on their annoyance rather than their actual problems. You are capable of travelling through possessing light sources within the house while you hide from their perception. This mode quickly gets annoying and breaks the immersion of the storyline that you are trying to reveal quite fast. In Story Mode, you are free to roam as you wish without worrying for them to see you, but even excluding that limitation, everything becomes boring and repetitive. You are stuck within the same house with the same tense mood and you basically memorize the possible locations a note may spawn after the second chapter. They never change or surprise you. It is not possible to miss something. You roam around, read notes, watch some memories, whisper what you decided to Dan while he is sleeping and you are done. Another chapter conquered. You only decide whose need is a priority and see the accumulated conclusions in the end.\n\nIn each episode - there are 9 in total - you are presented with a couple of conflicting desires of family members. Everyone got different priorities and you must choose one specific desire to influence and accomplish, and maybe another one to half way accomplish through "compromising" which leaves you with one desire completely ignored. This is where things get a bit ridiculous. These 9 encounters oddly end up defining the whole being and interdynamics of a whole family! The definition of compromise in the dictionary is "a settlement of differences by mutual concessions; an agreement reached by adjustment of conflicting or opposing claims, principles, etc., by reciprocal modification of demands". Here, there is no middle ground between parties, no given opportunity to work on different needs, there is basically no settlement. Even real life doesn't work like this! We surely either act selfish or make sacrifices on things little or grand, but a human being is capable of undertaking more than one deed, feeling or accomplishment in a timely manner.\n\nA human being comes with dimensions - which is another huge flaw in this game. The Kaplans are obscenely selfish - without much appreciation for sacrifices or understanding of shortcoming. Their personal desires never seem to even coincide with the desires of others. It is not possible to sympathize with any one of them. Heck, they even do not talk within the same house hold! You are a ghost, stuck within their household for his/her all being and never see them talk more than a couple of automated remarks and some memories. They seem to communicate through written notes scattered around the house. I mean, what kind of family does that?\n\nI surely do understand the limitation of the developer team, thus I won't mumble much about the scenes, the environment and chapters being dull, stolid or repetitive; but I cannot accept the term "compromise" being misused for "forced priority and selfish desire". No remotely eligible father of a small boy would be so consumed with his ongoing artistic pursuit that he'd end up not putting together a toy car that would take 3 hours to assemble for 3 months! This really is ridiculous! So, I personally think this game comes with a possibly good concept executed without much sentimental or even practical depth. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for narrative exploration. I actually love games like Gone Home if they are capable of presenting the echo of an emotion, an idea or at least a state of being. In its current state and price, The Novelist surely doesn't deliver. Wait for a huge sale to satisfy your curiosity if you wish.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 3","false","6.3"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","9"

All the kid ever wants to do is play, so, shocker, when you dont play with him he gets depressed. So what? Why am I suppose to care about the kid at all? The game doesnt give you any reason to like any of the characters.\n\nAnd we are suppose to believe that Dan is so busy he cant do anything else with his wife and kids but. . . hes not. He sits around the house all day, goes camping, fishing. In one chapter they show a schedule. It has 8 hours sleep, 1 hour break, 2 hours decompression. Really? Thats 11 hours where hes doing nothing. Real busy people rest half that amount on any given workday.\n\nI really hate to hammer an indie game. But it has a steep price tag so people should know what theyre in for. And for what it gives you there are better options out there. Gods Will Be Watching is a brilliant game about choices and consequences, with much better dialogue and characters that felt. . . alive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/romskeeone/recommended/245150/","romskeeone","Erotic Electrocutioner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/romskeeone/","111 products in account","Long review ahead.\nTo me, it is a banal, trite and nothing out of ordinary story-driven Peeping Tom/creepy ghost simulator. Pretentious and full of itself for no good reason. But before you dislike the review, let me explain myself.\n\nThere are a few moments that I'd like to point out about the game, as followed below and which explain why I wouldn't recommend this game personally:\n\nFirstly, the game tries to create relatable characters. But (and that's one big "but"), characters themselves remind more of a "lemming" type of humans from another awful indie game "Godus" than of human beings with at least some presence of any common sense and human emotions. They don't even talk with each other, they communicate via notes on the walls and the door of the fridge, although according to the game they aren't in a fight or anything, so that must be their usual way of communicating with each other. That's not your average family connection to say the least. And all that makes relating to them that much more difficult than it should be in the game of this genre.\n\nSecondly, the game is all about compromise and it makes you either choose compromise between only two out of three characters or to not make any compromise at all, and it just isn't logical or realistic at that task: I always saw ways of making every single one of three of them at least somewhat happy, or even making them all happy completely. For Gods sake, according to this games's plot, they are staying at some country house for -three months- and not single one of them has a job to do or go to. The father is a writer and only writes about 2-4 hours a day (if writes at all, which he frequently doesn't), mother is painting ~2-3 hours a day and drinks wine/talks to her friends the rest of the day, and the child is... well, a child, so his day is completely free. You have three months of not doing ANYTHING, anything at all, every single day of those three months you have beautiful 24 hours to do anything you wish, and you tell me you can't find time to satisfy everyones needs? And not very time-consuming needs for that matter. Really, game? That just doesn't make any sense. Logically -and- time-wise.\n\nLastly, and that's what has disappointed me the most: this game doesn't understand the message it tries to get to people. At all. It tries to tell you that you can't satisfy everyone, but forgets the important shades of it — the message should be "There may be indeed times when you can't satisfy everyone completely, but there's ALWAYS some way to satisfy EVERYONE at least partly, and that's the thing you should never forget". This game tells you about compromise, but doesn't understand the meaning of it properly. Compromise is a situation when everyones desires are evenly satisfied and not satisfied at the same time to the extent that everyone gets at least something, as opposed to the situation where only one person gets what he or she wants and the others get nothing. That's what compromise is, and this game just isn't about compromise. I'd like to point out that it's still a good try, we honestly need more games about everyday decisions and routine, a whole lot more, to be honest, we really do, they just need to pay more attention to details and subtleties of it, nuances of it, if you will. This game just... doesn't. That's why it's such a big let down to me.","July 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoneSSS/recommended/245150/","JoneSSS","sayler_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoneSSS/","2879 products in account","As for the beginning i should mention that i'm a highly emotive person but cold-hearted at the same time, who could watch any emotionally disturbing events and never blink an eye if circumstances demand so, however this game didn't even bother to try me. I'll probably get assaulted by some who presumably were tackled by the emotiveness of this game, but i'll take my chances since, frankly, there is no single reason why i would give it a thumbs up.\n\nIt is indeed a game which tends to appeal on emotions, but it fails this part too, except a few occasion when it manages to touch the player, and further on i'll explain why. First of all, it's almost one year after release and the game is still buggy. You can see that for yourself in the 2 screenshots i've posted on the game's community hub. Characters can sit on invisible chairs, type on invisible typing machines or read books while their heads are stuck in the table, etc, and all of that in less than 4 hours of gaming... Also, Dan, the main character developed a habit to close the doors of his office when he needs to rest or focus on the book he's writing, and doesn't want to be disturbed by his family. I got stuck in his office for quite a few times, having nothing to do, just waiting and wondering when will he finally open the doors so i can get out. At first i relied on the fact that me being a ghost, i'm not supposed to be seen opening doors, but imagine my surprise when i saw for the first time his wife walking in the office right through the closed door, and walking out through the other one. I was like "WTF? I am the damn ghost in this house or this this family who clearly posseses more supernatural skills than i do ?!"\n\nLeaving all bugs and glitches behind, the whole purpose of the game is to find out what the family members wish for, and try to make them all happy, or at least feeling less miserable, by choosing somebody's wish and make a compromise with other member. Problem is the choices are sometimes ridiculous. For example: the mother wants to go camping on some place far from home, the father wants to go camping somewhere near by, and the son wants his father to help him launch his toy rocket. You choose father's wish to go camping somewhere near by and try to reach a compromise with his wife based on the fact that he's behind the schedule with his work on the book. Done. The son remains unhappy. WHY ?! Even if the father is so ridiculously busy at home, why can't he just take 5 minutes and help his son launch a toy rocket while they were camping for almost an entire day? And this is only one example from an entire list of unrealistic stupid choices one has to make.\n\nWhat else made me be so cold-hearted towards this game's attempt to appeal on my emotions ? The almost empty house, the dull environment, the repetitive actions of the characters which walk from a part of the house to another over and over, and mostly the lack of any active emotions between them. Upon the interaction of the characters in the house you'll just hear "Hi mom" and the answer back "Hi darling", and that's all, after which they all go do something different, mother watches TV, the son plays with a toy, and the father drinks by himself in the office or sticks his head again in the table and starts to read. Does that look like a busy family to you where they presumably can't find the time to satisfy each other ?\n\nThere are many other things i could list, but looks like my review is becoming too long, so i'll just stop here. The overall experience felt boring and tedious. There is no way i could recommend to anybody this clearly overpriced and overrated game.","November 2, 2014","false","5.1"," 99 of 160 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","99","160","4","7"

Ever since getting married about a year ago, I've had to "grow up" and realize that my choices are no longer my own, and that I must think of the greater interest of my wife and family in general as we both make decisions together.  Now as we get ready to give up our established jobs and prepare to move overseas for several years, where we hope to make new friends, raise any future children, and find new jobs, our choices become more and more crucial (and intimidating) than ever before.  These feelings had me anticipating The Novelist even before I played a single minute.\n\nSome have accused me of enjoying 2Deep4U games a bit too much; while it's true that mostly indie games topped my list of games I most enjoyed last year (Swapper, Gunpoint, Brothers, Guacamelee, Rogue Legacy, Stanley Parable), I've managed to maintain a cynical stubbornness against games that I can appreciate but otherwise just do not enjoy (Proteus, Papo & Yo, Dust).  After completing The Novelist, I can unfortunately say that my verdict of the game lies squarely in the latter category.\n\nThe Novelist appoints you as a ghost in a house where you voyeuristically observe the life of the Kaplan family: Dan, Linda and their son Tommy.  The house is littered with notes, letters and drawings (Gone Home-style) which you can read to discover the daily problem du jour.  Thankfully, there is more human interaction than Gone Home, since you can also watch the family members live their lives and enter their memories to hear their thoughts.  After finding enough clues and thoughts, each member has an "item" that you can possess to convey how they would want to end their day.  If you find enough clues, you can also make a compromise possession with someone else, but at least one person will always have their daily wish unfulfilled.\n\nFrom what I can tell after two playthroughs, the first choice will always carry the most weight.  The compromise choice, if selected, seems to either mildly satisfy the family member or merely hold status quo.  The member whose choice you ignore will fall into worse and worse shape.  Each playthrough can offer days in random order, but the days themselves are the same and have no variety.  I didn't like this as you never see any ramification of previous choices in future days, besides some thoughts here and there.  Everything is eerily distilled into simple black and white scenarios and outcomes.  I'll avoid any spoilers, but the daily, monthly, and eventual final decision results left a lot to be desired.  Also, the final outcomes are incredibly disjointed, with certain distinct epilogues given for each character that hold absolutely no relationship to other members' decisions and epilogues.\n\nActually, I think that's what annoys me the most.  For a game whose prime selling point is the idea of making hard choices and compromises for the greater good, the fact that your choices have no interrelation between members seems completely unrealistic and disappointing.  If I, as a father, take time out of my day to affirm my wife's hobbies and spend more time with my son, how does it make sense that I treat them the same horrible way depending on one of my one (father) choices, versus when I completely ignore them and put my priorities above all else?\n\nIn a game that prides itself on difficult decisions, I can give one clear recommendation on choice:\n\nDon't play The Novelist.","January 19, 2014","false","4.1"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","0"

The idea that you are a ghost and you affect someone else's story in a good or bad way is really appealing. Unfortunately, for The Novelist, gameplay variety was lacking, the story (which is the main part of the game) was boring and predictable, and the voice acting was meh.\n\nBASICALLY how the game plays out is this: there are three people in the house. The Father, the Wife, and the Son. The Son wants to do stuff with the Father. The Wife wants to pursue art and have more family time, and the Father must deal with that crap while also trying do his work. Every level, something each character desire changes a little bit, and it is your job to find out what everyone wants, and which two people will get what they want.\n\nAlso, you must never be seen by any of the residents or else you will not be able to make them happy. So you get to teleport from light fixture to light fixture. The problem is, you can almost get anywhere without going out of a safe-zone light. This makes the game TOO EASY. Though I wouldn't really expect it from a game like this, there is isn't any sort of progression for your ghostly character gameplay-wise, so your ghostly powers stay the same throughout the game.\n\nThe plot is boring and uninteresting as well. Half-way through the game, I realized I didn't care for the characters at all. Everyone is so unhappy all the time, and even if you fix all their dang problems, they're just sad in the next level with more problems to fix. It's honestly most fun to just "level up" the dad and make no one else happy. Then his after story makes him a world renouned author who drinks his nights away in misery because his Wife left him and took the Son. You can go through the game and try to make everyone happy by balancing out their wants, but the game part of it is dull, and the story is predictable.\n\nAnd also, it doesn't look that great either. If for some reason, you are waffling between this and Dishonored, get Dishonored instead. It also has a predictable story where you can mildly affect the outcome, but the gamey side of it is just so much more fun and enjoyable.\n\nFinal rating: Meh/10","February 25, 2015","false","7.9"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","20","28","3","2"

It forces you to search every square inch of the same 8 or so rooms over and over.  Once you do, there is no catharsis.  Every ending is happy and sad.

You have to balance the father's career as a writer (side note: as a writer myself, Dan hit a little too close to home), the mother's stalled career as a painter, and their son's emotional turmoil--or you can fail miserably.

Working is hard. Having a family is hard.\n\nThe Novelist tells the story of The Kaplan family during their summer break. To which through playing the game you can heavily influence the events of that summer.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nYou are some sort of ghost that when not inside a light bulb you are probably slightly more opaque or corporeal than what the traditional notion of a ghost is. You can either play the game having the Kaplans react and cause you to fail upon discovery or just throw it into story mode and become invisible and focus on the objectives. The ladder is what I did.\n\nThe game revolves Dan, his wife Linda and their son Tommy. You explore the home WASD'ing around and teleporting between lights. You must find notes, pictures, documents and items laying about the house; additionally being supernatural (I guess) you can delve into the memories of the characters as well and see what they are thinking at any given moment. Each chapter you'll find clues of what each characters desires are and how they want to go about moving forward. You will choose which (by this I mean whose) outcome you want each chapter and possibly working out a compromise with one other character. My only complaint is that this really, more or less, is just a walking simulator; It might have been served better as a text adventure to be honest.\n\nTHE GIST\nThe outcomes will be very different based on who you decide to “resolve” certain situations with, as well as (if any) you compromised with. I'll tell you right now. Granted, I did not try my very best to keep everyone happy however one aspect of one characters life went exceedingly well. While the rest of that characters life among the rest got sorted out in a very mediocre (almost realistic) but very depressing in its delivery sort of way. Perhaps it was due to summarizing future decades into a few paragraphs. Though to be honest, I guarantee there are far worse endings than I got.\n\nYeah, its one of those sticky indie art games that you've already made a decision if you like or not. However, this is one of the better ones yet its still not stellar. Its interesting.","December 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","1"

It is never explained. There’s a family of three and the entire game takes place in a small cabin in the woods. The goal? Make decisions for the family.\n\nGameplay is.. lacking. All you do is move about the house while trying to avoid being seen. Each chapter you need to find a certain amount of items, over and over. Once you’ve found all the items, you can enter the memories of the family members to find three memory snippets, again and again. The items aren’t very well hidden, nor are the snippets which can easily be tracked by listening. This cycle repeats itself for the 9 chapters it counts.

Or not? Mama Bear, Papa Bear and Baby Bear all have down-to-earth aspirations and wishes, but that is all that is normal in this summer home. For you become the sneaky little "Goldilocks" of this household with your stealth abilities to possess flickering lamps and pendant lights, making invisible bounds across the entire Kaplan abode honed over decades of haunting the inhabitants of this house. As the resident ghostly entity minus any ghoulish intent, your new arrivals, the Kaplans will be your brand new pet project. To them it's their lives; to you it's another day at the office helping those unknowingly in need of your insightful guidance. Not only do you gallivant from room to room while becoming some variation of a peeper, you own a penetrative ability which allows you to delve into the minds of family members and look into their recent memories.\n\nNot as bleak as I'd worried it would turn out to be from other reviews, especially by the second month, it was an interesting look into the varying perspectives of individuals making up a family. Though it doesn't provide the depth that such a game could, it did succeed at igniting the interest I had lost for more inanimate genres where clicking objects and reading excerpts from newspaper clippings and diaries to progress a set storyline had become too routine to enjoy. This is especially a great change of pace for those who often spend time playing point and click adventure games and visual novels alike. The stealth aspect adds a light edge to the boredom and personally this vanquished the tedious norm, apparent in similar games, completely. I'd also expect this to be fun for do-gooders like myself who enjoy volunteering their own points of view and choices to others in an attempt to be an aide. Every choice and chapter requires a good deal of sacrifice and has sure consequences. Decisions are difficult and this adds most greatly to the overall suspense and amusement.\n\nGameplay in Detail (v. mild spoilers)\nGameplay is simple enough though the tutorial offered will help accustom you. Across a period of three months, chapters will open up spanning within a single day where you will be greeted with shining letters and blinking objects on various surfaces (truly easy to spot) to click and read/look at so as to get a grasp on the recent affairs of the Kaplan gang. Something will always be of issue and this is reflected in the chapter titles, aptly typed at the beginning of each episode. As you check each clue that has opened up in a new chapter, keep an eye out for single objects which stand out as you will be asked to search for object words for each character later on (becomes a bit of a hidden object game if you don't keep an eye out).\n\nAs everyone goes about their lives you will drift from one hanging fixture to the next, making sure not to be spotted. Each family member has the ability to spot you if you are not possessing a light. Every time you are spotted there is a split second to dash to any visible, switched on light you can get to (trickier as you progress). Once you are spotted for longer than a millisecond, the tag suspicious pops up next to the relevant character in the tab menu* and you cannot move to a light and must flee from them and hide till they can no longer see you. If you are spotted again by that same character repeatedly in that episode, they will be spooked and there will be ramifications in relation to the choices you can make. Going through the house successfully in the shadows (or more so the light), you will notice moments during the day when each character will have their back turned so as you can creep up behind them cautiously and peek into their memories with that spectacular penetrative ability I formerly wrote of. Tommy is especially swift so after you peek into his memory it’ll help to be ready to pounce on a nearby lamp as soon as you exit it or he’ll see you. This is as thrilling as The Novelist will ever really get but for a laid-back genre of its kind it is a welcome touch which most players will appreciate.\n\nAfter this initial accumulative stage, you move on to check the thoughts of each character and receive an object word. With the clues found in a chapter you'll decide who you'd like the story to move in favour of and this is done by clicking the object in relation to this decision. At this point the day will be over and the Kaplans will go to bed.\n\n*The tab menu is a helpful resource to keep you on track of where you are in the game even if you stop halfway and come back and I found that many features in this game focus on keeping the story and immersive qualities intact, their priority.\n\nNight time for the Kaplans is the only time you can walk around without need to be stealthy though you can opt to start the game in story mode instead of stealth mode where stealth is not used (not advised as may end up boring). This felt like a subjectively delightful part of the game as the player is free to stretch and move around the house, reading a new set (two) of letters or journal entries from that of past residents which open up more story for yourself, the entity that has been here long before the Kaplans came and will stay for long after they are gone. It was unfortunate that this wasn't built up on though that would have lengthened the game too much. The house was more detailed than I'd initially expected as it is superficially bland but has strong attention to the minute details (as is important to the story). So it did become a slight compulsion for me to walk down to the kitchen each night and stand by the fridge, listening to the familiar whirring of the motor then stepping back to listen to the heavenly crashing of the waves right outside the door which I lamentably could not open.\n\nSimulation sickness tip\nWhile playing I was happy to note that though I am usually hypersensitive, I experienced little nausea with The Novelist. The lack thereof was mostly due to the fact I was hiding in the lights and moving through them which meant a lot of the whizzing about/motion was less dominant. Even at night I would gravitate through the lights at a prompt pace as opposed to sauntering up and down the stairs and around landings as that was invariably sluggish yet still induced ever so slight giddiness.\n\nThe idea of a visual novel or point and click adventure game with stealth as the main game mechanic seemed intriguing. It was ironic that stealth could make such games more interactive as well. This was a game I'd waited to go on sale for a while and was intent on playing despite the indifferent reviews, then nabbed as soon as I saw it during the Humble Spring Sale. I expect it has several endings more than the one I stumbled upon but I was satisfied enough with mine in which I kept the choices rounded until the end and then went with Tommy which automatically found a compromise for Linda but didn't end badly at all for Dan (you'll see what this means if you play). It was gruelling to watch the Kaplans jump for joy only to be let down after the next chapter or repeatedly depressed from the choices you make for them and I was constantly trying to find a balance without knowing whether it’d hurt or help. The narrative in this game is well done and immersive but I didn’t enjoy the voice acting for Linda as although Linda seems sweet, I didn’t expect her to sound as young. I may play again in the future to have a go at some bad endings if there are any as I have the devious mind to make Dan a world famous author and live the crazy, disorderly life of the single divorced dad with young university freshers bowing down at his feet.\n","May 11, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","3"

Nothing really dramatic happens, and for most of the cases the individual desires you have to support or not with your actions are somewhat stereotypical and repetitive; basically the child wants to play, the wife wants attention and the husband wants to succeed in his work. At least for me, the choices were not very difficult, in the sense I did not perceive them as very strong moral dilemmas.\n\nIn my opinion the game can be tried at a low price; it is an original idea and it constitutes an affordance for some kind of phisolophical reflections on the impact everyday choices have on life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/245150/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Reviewed for my website: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/the-novelist-game-review/\n\nThe Novelist is a completely story-driven adventure in which the player takes on the role of a supernatural being that decides a family's fate. I'd even go as far as branding it as an interactive story. It was an excellent narrative experience nonetheless.\n\nThe gameplay is offered in two different flavors: Stealth and Story. In the stealth mode of the game, you're challenged to not be spotted by the family throughout the entirety of your playthrough. This is easily done, but there were a few scenarios where I made a few of the characters "suspicious". Upon the characters catching your appearance again, they become "scared". Once they're scared, you're unable to choose a compromise for that chapter (more on that later). The story mode of the game is for those that just want to experience the story, without the element of stealth playing a role.\n\nEssentially, you're tasked with finding each character's own desires through their thoughts and objects they've interacted with (drawings, writings, etc.). The majority of the story is told through these writings and drawings. The game is laid out in a series of chapters, covering the events during a summer in the character's lives. The player is the one that decides what will happen during this summer. At the end of each chapter, you make a decision based on the three family member's thoughts. You cannot please all three characters, but you can select up to two outcomes, called a "compromise".\n\nA compromise can only be accomplished if you have learned what each character wants, well, the characters you want to choose an outcome for. Upon selecting an initial outcome, you can then select another one. This is a nice addition and doesn't make me feel so bad about the terrible choices I made throughout my playthrough. The fact that not everyone can be happy is hard to accept and The Novelist truly shows this. Makes me wonder if it is really that difficult to manage a family. It was painful for me to always put down Tommy's outcomes, but they were simply not as important as the other outcomes offered, at least, to me.\nThe Novelist employs a very anguishing story. It's simply... depressing, the way events played out. It is very difficult to get a great outcome for the family, without at least one member being very dissatisfied (and in my case, two). The game does show how difficult a family can be, but I never realized it could be this degrading, although, the family in this game is placed under a lot more stress than what you'd expect from an average family on summer vacation.\n\nThe game's graphics were great. The style reminded me of Borderlands, but the name of this style escapes me. I believe it's called "cel-shaded". The music in the game was also excellent, although I am a sucker for game music, heh. The voice acting was top-notch, very well done. I enjoyed having the writings read to me, but a few of them (the writings from characters that you're never introduced to) had no voice to them, which was somewhat disappointing, but understandable.\n\nThe Novelist was an excellent story, easy to immerse yourself in. I highly recommend it for anyone that plays games for the story, not so much for the gameplay. It truly is a fascinating game, if played by the appropriate player.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXUmOZcWZQE","December 11, 2013","true","7.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There are multiple outcomes and it's fascinating to see that so much time has been put into the individual storylines.\n\nBut as a game, it's a bit flawed. Gameplay is pretty much non-existent except for finding stuff to read and recollecting memories.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call it a game, and I think it should only be played purely for its story, but it's interesting nevertheless.\n\nIs it worth the price ?

I would say that the game starts slowly at the beginning, and then follows a safe line not trying to be too initiative on trying something new over the time. As I've already said, really lackluster experience, especially at the end given that the actions and gameplay focuses on you doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nThe game sums up in: you trying to figure out how to help people and overcome their obstacles whether publishing a book or painting or going on a trip. You can't please everyone, hence why your actions will have different effect on people around you. Mechanics that this game tries to implement and force are nothing too astonishing, and will often be recognized as tedious after a while.\n\nI would say that this game is a solid 5/10, nothing too special, but enough to get you intrigued in this 2-3 hours long journey. Definitely worth picking up when it hits the bigger discount, but bare in mind that this game focuses heavily on story and your actions on the progression, rather than gameplay and whatelse.\n\n\n\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

This occurs at the end of each chapter and it is impossible to satisfy all of the characters wants and needs which ultimately makes your decisions hard to make. The effect of each decision is designed to draw you emotionally into the characters. For example, if your decision leads to making a character unhappy, if you feel empathetic and sorry for that character then you will try and make sure in the next chapter that your decision will make that character happy.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay element is interesting at first as you get to discover the memories and needs of different characters by wandering around the house and finding clues. For example, finding a drawing or walking up to a character and viewing their memory. However, at later stages of the game this mechanic of gameplay becomes repetitive and all you feel like doing is rushing and finding out what the character wants and progress with the story. To make the game less boring in this sense, you can activate a mode in which you have to be stealthy and not be seen.\n\nConclusionAlthough the gameplay aspect is somewhat lacking, it certainly makes up for it in the story telling department. With the many different possible endings as a result of your decisions, this is an incentive to go through multiple playthroughs to find out what can possibly happen to the different characters. For the full price of this game i would say that it probably isnt worth it if you aren't into story driven games, however if you pick up this game on sale or in a bundle i would certainly recommend playing it, even for one playthrough as it is a relaxing experience :)","June 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Alongside Papers Please, the best use of moral decisions and a branching narrative I have participated in. These both games allow you to use real world logic rather than in most videogames where you're trying to game the system to get the best rewards. Even though I'm not married or have a family yet, or am an author, I could still relate to all the pull-and-push of a family life and how compromises can be made but not all parties will be satisfied. How tough it is to maintain a work/life balance. I feel this game will be even more relevant further down the line in my life.\n\nI have to applaud how solid the gameplay loop was (clues->memories->compromise), considering it could've been a much simpler tourist-y game like Gone Home. It definitely is still in familiar territory with the notes, diary entries, light stealth, and it's nice to see established gameplay mechanics can still be used for effective storytelling rather than resorting to cutscenes or QTEs. Also, you can still tell an emotional story without a grand tragedy, which I believe is the shorter path to create drama. Or maybe I have to replay to find out!\n\nOne criticism is for the stealth stuff, it never really ramped up in challenge when earlier the game mentions that lights will start being made unavailable to possess. I didn't really use the flicker distractions that much. But that didn't take away from the game's message, just solidified that it was going for a more laidback, introspective atmosphere.

If you are looking for a game where the choices can make a large difference, or it provides anything beyond narrative, you’ll be vastly disappointed.\n\nLong version:The Novelist is a lightweight choose-your-adventure story about a family of artists: a novelist father who is struggling with his new book; a painter mother who tries to get back to work and save her marriage; and a son with great artistic potential, but serious learning difficulties.\n\nAll nine chapters follow the same pattern: each family member has a problem where the solution just happens to contradict the others’ needs. You play as a “ghost” reading aptly placed notes and peeking into their memories, then you must choose one of them who gets their wish fulfilled, one that gets a half-solution, and leave one of them hanging.\nSo, in essential, all family members have a good, a neutral, and a bad outcome. This is true for the entire game: no matter what you did in the individual chapters, the final “score” determines their individual fate, which makes the core mechanic of the game largely pointless.\n\nThe narrative itself is great and the chapters randomise at each play through, yet the replay value is still quite low. So, if you don’t mind paying this much money for what is essentially a 2-hour story about a Hallmark-card family and their completely storybook problems, you won’t regret playing it.

Then you tell the title character, Dan, which choice he should make, which moves the story into the next segment, with a brief update on each family member's progress.

The story was a little anti-climax, as some of the other reviews have already mentioned. The game could use a bit more mechanics like save-and-load or view-all-possible-route/achievements. The note reading and mind exploring gets repetitive and boring if you try to play the game more than two times, it's my personal opinion that those mechanics could help.\n\nI got the game while it's on sale so I'd say it's worth it, the game itself holds a great concept to be explored. Although I might not have gotten the game at the full price.","May 25, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamingjune86/recommended/245150/","flamingjune86","flamingjune86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamingjune86/","37 products in account","I love narrative-based video games, and I strongly encourage developers to continue on that track; however, I cannot honestly recommend The Novelist simply because it falls in that category.  Though The Novelist is a creative effort and tasks the player with some interesting decisions, it falls short.  The following three aspects were the biggest trouble areas for me:  dull and repetitive gameplay, unrealistic family dynamic, and unsympathetic, flat characters.\n\nEven in video games with a strong narrative focus, gameplay is important and should be given the proper amount of time.  In The Novelist, the player acts as a sort of friendly spirit who spies on and makes decisions for the Kaplan family over the course of nine chapters during one summer.  The player reads letters, looks at lists, checks out drawings, etc.  In fact, he/she even has the ability to explore bits of the characters' memories and read portions of thoughts.  The player can play the game in stealth mode or simply explore the characters' house freely, a decision that makes little difference in the experience.  After determining the desires of each character per chapter, the player must decide whose wishes come first, with the opportunity most chapters for a "compromise."   These various elements of the gameplay may sound intriguing.  After all, perhaps you enjoyed exploring the house in Gone Home or reading minds in Divinity 2.  Unfortunately, these elements sound better than they actually are in the game.  As the player, you look at the same things in the same places in the same rooms throughout the entire game.  You only hear snippets of the characters' thoughts and memories, and this makes the game drag on, even though it takes less than two hours to complete.\n\nPerhaps the dull gameplay wouldn't be as bothersome if the story made a little more sense.  I'm not talking about the fact that you play as a spirit; I can suspend disbelief for that.  No, I'm referring to the flawed family dynamic.  Dan, the titular character, is supposedly responsible for the decisions over the course of one summer that will determine the happiness of his whole family for the rest of their lives.  What?  First of all, in what world does the way a family interacts, in normal everyday life, during one summer impact them forever without the possibility for change?  I understand that this game wants players to think about how their decisions in real life affect other people, but I don't think this family was portrayed as realistically as it could have been.  I know that the main conflict was Dan balancing his writing career with his life as a family man, but why does that make him responsible for meeting every desire of his wife and son?  Apparently there had been some strain between Linda and Dan prior to the summer, but resolving that conflict should not be solely on Dan's shoulders.  I could see how that would make more sense if I had played as Dan, but I was a third party, so it seems as if resolving family issues should be a family effort rather than the task of one person.  Even if the player was put directly in Dan's shoes, shouldn't the other two characters, specifically Linda as an adult, shoulder some responsibilty?  People have free will, and everything in life is not so black and white; there are many shades of gray.\n\nIf the characters of The Novelist had been more sympathetic and truly dynamic, I think the unrealistic nature of the narrative would have been easier to ignore.  The player finds information about the three characters from various notes, letters, drawings, etc. lying about the house.  In addition, the player can read partial thoughts and memories.  Other than that, the characters are portrayed merely through text and drawings at the end of each chapter.  The character interactions are shallow, and there is little depth given to any of the characters.  Mostly, Dan, Linda, and Tommy come across as selfish and/or pathetic depending on the circumstances.  Of course, everyone is selfish to a degree, but it made me wonder how Dan and Linda ended up together in the first place.  It is pretty obvious that neither of them fully support each other's goals, yet Dan seems to be the only one made to feel badly about trying to pursue his.  I found that strange.\n\nAs I said before, I love narrative games, and I would even consider giving this one a second playthrough, despite my issues with it, if the gameplay wasn't so cumbersome.  Though I have an interest in seeing the effect of different decisions, playing The Novelist didn't connect with my emotions or affect me in any deep way.  Watching a video of the various choices and consequences probably would have had a similar effect.  My only hope with this game is that is opens doors and inspires people to continue making narrative based games.  I think that is where the true potential lies.\n\n","January 3, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Through the lives and thoughts of the three Kaplans, this constant give and take becomes apparent, as does the internal back and forth between their own personal needs. The player is then put into the position of deciding both whose desire will win out and also what individual needs are going to have to go unfulfilled that week. Then they must stand back helplessly while their choices play themselves out. Due to the stress involved, it's likely that more game time will be spent deliberating than exploring or interacting with the Kaplans, which is a good thing as the actual act of playing gets rather repetitive and dull. There is only a single cabin with a handful of rooms to search and an explicitly limited number of things to uncover per chapter. The experience of playing as a whole quickly changes from pleasantly defined to restrictive and joyless.\n\nIn addition to guiding the Kaplans, the player is also given the opportunity to learn more about the previous inhabitants of the haunted cabin. Those vignettes, however, end up falling equally flat as they seem to avoid any real answers to the mysterious nature of the player's ghostly presence. But those shortcomings are easy to forgive, and forget, due to the slow-forming, but genuine emotional bond with the Kaplans and how their tangled lives turn out. That is the focus after all, and unless you were taking notes, that's likely all you'll remember about this flawed but brilliant game.","December 24, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/recommended/245150/","gamehoard","Jeremy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamehoard/","173 products in account","To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]\n\nGameplay\nInterestingly, the game offers you two different modes at the beginning, Story and Stealth. Although the core gameplay is the same, in Stealth mode the family can see you and you must remain hidden in order to be able to influence them. You accomplish this by hiding inside light bulbs, for some reason that is never explained. Unfortunately, both modes get tedious. In Story, the game has no challenge to it and it's basically just a mix of "walking simulator" and choose-your-own adventure gameplay. In Stealth mode, you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out in lightbulbs, waiting for family members to walk to another room.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of you reading notes and letters left by the family members to find out what they want. You can also read their thoughts and explore their memories. Ultimately, you find out what each person wants and then select who gets their want by touching the object associated with the want. Gameplay then shifts to nighttime mode where you read more notes left by the house's previous owners and can choose a compromise for another family member to at least partially get their want.\n\nThere are a lot of unique ideas present in this gameplay loop that I really like. The problem is, what I have just described is the whole game and you have to repeat it for nine chapters with very little variation. What feels very fresh and interesting at the start of the game feels way overplayed and boring by the end, even though the game takes only 2-3 hours to complete. In the end, I felt that the game only really had about 30 minutes worth of ideas and the game felt very stretched and empty as a result.\n\nPresentation\nThe game has a great cell-shaded aesthetic and the family members all move about and act in realistic ways. I found it immersive in this way where I really did feel like I was observing a real family go about their day. Unfortunately, the graphics suffer the same problem as the gameplay, as being confined to a single house with three characters for several hours means that you are looking at the same boring rooms over and over again.\n\nSound Design\nThe music does a good job setting the tone but isn't anything to write home about. On the other hand, the voice acting is great, which really carried the game since it's mostly about listening to the internal monologues of these characters. The actors were very convincing and were able to put a lot of emotion into their lines without hamming it up.\n\nStory\nEssentially, the family has moved to a remote summer home so that the father/husband can focus on writing his novel. The mother/wife is unhappy in the marriage and an aspiring artist. Their son is struggling with bullying and schoolwork. It's not the most interesting story but it is very human and the characters feel like real people. It is interesting to see how decisions made in one chapter effect the rest and what ending you get. Also welcome is a "The story so far" feature when you load up the game.\n\nRecommendation\nOverall, I felt the game just got very stale by the end but it's still a unique experience that you may like if you want a non-violent, non-competitive game focused on family drama. If you like the "Aspirations" part of the Sims games, you may find something to like here. For most people, however, I think the experience may fall a bit flat.\n","March 31","false","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuskyHuskyTumblr/recommended/245150/","HuskyHuskyTumblr","June","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuskyHuskyTumblr/","175 products in account","Today I found myself sitting at my computer, bored senseless, wondering what to do. Then I see this game's banner appear on my steam store page. It intrigued me, so I decided to watch the trailer. Needless to say the game looked interesting, and I decided to proceed to purchase it.\nFrom the minute I opened it up and from the minute I finished my playthrough, I was completely immersed and hooked into this interesting story that developed around your decisions. I have not played many games like this, but to me it seemed like an original idea, and not some kind of sims clone.\nThe art in the game is a nice touch as well. Its sort of Borderlands-y which really attracted my attention since that cell shaded art is a kind I really enjoy.\n------Spoilers may lurk below.------\nThe story mainly consists of acts in which there are around 9. These acts each have 3 destinctive endings which you as the main character find out infomation about them and then decide wether to go with the Father's, Mother's or Son's choice.\nHowever, it doesn't just stop there, these acts intertwine with each other and change the story as they go. For instance, during one playthrough I decided that I wanted the son's outcome and told the Father to fix his toy car, since I had been slightly neglecting him throughout the recent acts. After this had happened, the car remained fixed through the duration of the rest of the game. However, during another playthrough, I found myself in the same dilema, and decided against fixing the car. Throughout the rest of that game, the car remained unfixed. I thought this was a really nice portrayal of how these decisions affect things in the long run, even if it is only for small things such as a background prop. It gives the story a little bit more dpeths and the idea that your decisions do actually matter in the long run.\nAnother interesting idea that was given throughout the game was the idea of compromise. This was when you find out another family member's wants, and decide to compromise it with another family want. E.G The father wants to work on his novel some more, but his wife wants to spend time with him. The compromise you can select is where the father works on this novel and the next night they share a small but important drink together to help them stay connected. I thought this was a really good idea since it seemed to reflect real life a bit more, giving that idea of realism. However, you can only compromise with two characters, leaving a third disappointed.\nDuring my first playthrough and more memorable playtrhough of this game, Dan got the novel finished, accepted the job in the Uni and won an award for his book. Linda developed a stronger bond with Dan, and although she didn't go to Arts of all, she didn't give up on painting and lived a generally happy life together. Tommy was my downfall, where his decisions did not seem that important to me as he was still quite young, he became isolated and was bullied. He then found himself bouncing from dead-end jobs constantly around his 20s.\nSaying this game is difficult would be an overstatement. It's not. But the choices are where the difficulty meter kicks in. At the end of the day your decisions help affect this families future, and by doing so the consequences are also yours. It's whether you get so inbedded with the game that you begin to feel sympathy with them. This isn't the same for all people though.\nThe game does also have its downsides, such as the "space bar does everything" rule. It doesn't, of course, but a majority of the buttons require this space bar, and sometimes things can become jumbled. For instance, during one scene a character was so close to a light that it was very difficult to click on her rather than the light, which was annoying since I was playing on Stealth. Another thing is that sometimes when you click on a light, your game will begin to have some sort of mini-seizure, cause your screen to go black and then re-open itself. It doesn't close but it does get annoying to deal with if it does happen.\nThe bottom line to this review is if you like this type of game. If you are into more story driven, stealth based games then this is down your ally indefinitely, so more RPG based. However, if you arn't into that kind of thing, and prefer FPS and action based games, I wouldn't buy this, you would get easily bored.","December 11, 2013","true","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The Kaplans are a family of three, each one living through their own struggles; the writing is very effective in letting their dilemmas resonate with the player: if you've ever had to make a difficult decision, prioritizing one aspect of your life to the detriment of another, there's a good chance the Kaplans will click with you.\n\nIf you've liked The Walking Dead, you'll probably like this game too, even though the tone is a lot more domestic and down to earth, more slow burning than the life or death choices or gut-wrenching moments TWD has. It's also an excellent game for introducing new players to first person games, for a variety of reasons, some of which are explained below.\n\nPlaying in Stealth mode is very easy, but adds a little tension I appreciated, and I'd recommend keeping it on for a first playthrough, while Story mode (which will let you explore unhindered) is probably more suited to replays, should you be interested in finding out how your decisions could have shaped the story differently.\n\nThe interactive sections will have you looking for 'clues' in order to advance the story, are not challenging at all and work well to break up the game in different sections that support pacing and the sense of time passing. However, there is a degree of repetition in them, and your enjoyment of the game will likely be greater if you don't try to finish it in one sitting (two worked well for me).\n\nThe music is minimalistic and fits the game very well, complementing and lending extra power to the writing, the voice work is also well done. The visuals are a little sketchy, and the environment limited, Gone Home this isn't, but it's obvious the budget and the size of the team were very different (The Novelist is a one man project), overall the artstyle works well for this game IMO, and there's just enough detail to support the interactive sections.\n\nTwo thumbs up from me.","March 16, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Thankfully I got both! I was also surprised to hear some rather good voice acting that I hadn't expected to find in this game, but it really helped set the immersion.\nThe game "was" short, but it was very fulfilling, especially having done it on Stealth-mode. Being short, I feel I can even play it a few more times to see what the results will be like if I make different choices.\nSome of the choices were easy to make, some were minor, but there were a few VERY tough choices. I beat the game in a few hours, but the choices, story, and affect from the characters made this feel like it went on for days, but in a VERY good way. I'm hoping for a sequel, given that there is room for it, but I don't even feel like there's much need for any change outside of making a new story and maybe a new environment.\nIf I had any negative comments about the game, it would be reading up on the former entries of those in the house. They were great stories too, but I felt like they didn't explain much beyond that the ghost helped people who lived there. I was hoping to find out who the ghost is or learn more about one person at a time. It seemed the stories of the past got rushed by a bit.\nAll-in-all, I highly recommend this game. Very easy-paced, simple, and enjoyable. A nice break from more intense games or a tense day.","November 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The idea of a branching narrative based on the decisions made by the player, interestingly a novelist, is something that has tremendous promise and has generally been carried out well in Telltale Games. Here, in the Novelist, the choices the player makes do, in fact, guide the story though it does so artificially. I say that because the choice the player is faced with are usually those that pit the various family members against each other in situations that would not necessarily present themselves as opposing ideals. While the no-win situations presented in The Walking Dead make sense thematically and situationally, the ones presented here just feel forced.\n\nI do like the idea of the game, and think that this game is actually very well done, despite some of its false feeling delivered by the decisions, and the ultimately tough outcomes the player will receive. Regardless, the decisions you make do create some interesting situations.

Needless to say that even going away from home with family members will still bring it's own distractions as the family members each have specific things that they want to do whilst they are away, which don't generally include just letting Dan get on with his book.\n\nThere are two ways to play this game - story mode, or stealth mode. I chose to play the game in story mode as I just find stealth generally too frustrating, and I believe that from what I got out of the game's story-telling, I definitely made the right choice personally to remove the stealth element.\n\nYour role within the game is to observe the three family members. From your observations you will find out what they each want from a particular moment in time, and from there you can choose your preferred outcome for only one character, and if you have the time and inclination to do more investigation around the house for each remaining family member, you can potentially choose a compromise for another character who didn't get their first preference. Your decisions will have an effect on what happens in the future so choose wisely, and obviously someone will always end up being disappointed.\n\nYou play as a ghostly presence within the house - one that can either walk around the house in plain sight (being careful not to get spotted, if playing in stealth mode), or one that can possess the lights/lamps within the house to travel without being seen. You can only be spotted by the family a small number of times in stealth mode per chapter, and after that you lose your ability to influence the choices the family make; however in story mode you can walk around at will which I found to be a much more enjoyable choice for how I wanted to play the game.\n\nIn order to find the outcomes for the family members each day, you do this by reading notes/books/pictures that are strewn around the house, and by reading the memories of each family member and walking around the house playing as each character in turn finding clues as to what they would like to achieve.\n\nI found this game to be incredibly atmospheric. From the music to the cell-shaded visuals, it gives a sense of isolation in the big house on the cliff. Seeing how this (almost) visual novel plays out from your own choices I found to be a very personal and emotionally engaging process. I would also praise the voice acting as it really adds to the personality of the characters and the ongoing story.\n\nIt is a little frustrating at times having to walk around the whole house at least 6 times if you want to find all of the outcomes/compromises for the characters, particularly when the family are all walking around doing their own thing, but in general that still didn't spoil the atmosphere for me. There were a couple of moments where the outcomes and compromises that I had to pick seemed a little bit unrealistic in terms of how quickly the family could seemingly start to fall apart, but I managed to pull it together enough for each character to get a mostly positive ending for all family members.\n\nThis certainly isn't a game for people who want something action-packed, but if you want to be engaged with somewhat challenging decisions, character relationships and atmosphere, this would be a game I'd recommend trying, though I'd maybe wait for a sale to pick this up, as this is a short 2(ish) hour play-through for a £10.99 price-tag.","May 8","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Novelist allows you to play as some sort of ghost/spirit thing, that haunts (that makes the game sound cliched, but its not) the house that a family of three have decided to stay in for the entirety of their summer. You have to find different clues about each family member's thoughts on a situation, each chapter covers a different situation, such as Tommy (the son of the family) experiencing severe learning disabilities, or deciding what to do with Dan's inheritance when a family member of his dies. It is possible to choose one decision or to compromise and combine two, and making each of the people less happy but happy enough. There will always be at least one family member left dissapointed, and thats what makes the game great, it really makes me care about the family, and thinking that I need to do more to assist them, such as getting Dan to do some work as opposed to getting him to make sandcastles with Tommy. (I do this all the time, now Dan is about to lose his job and is on the brink of divorce, at least his son likes him) Different clues to the history of the house can be found whilst the Kaplan family are sleeping, and it is possible to explore the memories of the different family members. I strongly recommend the game.","December 11, 2013","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baarho/recommended/245150/","Baarho","Barho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baarho/","198 products in account","The Novelist is a indie, story rich game that revolves around the Kaplan family. The members of the family are Dan and Linda, and their son Tommy. They move into a vacation house for the summer, where Dan is looking forward to the peace and quiet of the seaside so he can write, while his wife Linda is excited about the scenery of the woods and the sea. The player takes on the role of a spectral phantom-like creature who watches over Dan and his family,  learning about their thoughts and memories. I liked this game A LOT. The descision making was well thought off. But it was so hard to make the descisions. I tried balancing everyone, but the story just got more and more depressing over time, that every descision wasn't just going to dissapoint the other 2 people, it was going to crush them. The artwork was very beatiful and simplistic, showing off some beautiful lighting and a very tensioned ambient.\n\nTo summerize this review:\n\nGraphics: Simplistic, wouldn't want them any different.\nSounds:  Realistic, annoying at times.\nCharacters/Character Development: Very good, every descision alters their thoughts.\nStory: Super rich story, well-thought of and you can tell the author dedicated himself to it.\nGame lenght: This isn't a really long game in itself, but playing through it makes you realize that it's not too short, and not too long.\nMechanics: Not bad, the phantom mechanics weren't too good, or too bad. They could have been improved though.\n\n\nFinal thought: I just think that this game is awesome, and everyone should give it a try. It gives you a new perspective on life, and on how one has to balance himself between his work, his wife and his son. You're not the one telling the story, you're the one shaping it. It's a pretty depressing game, but seeing one of the characters happy for once makes it worthwile and rewarding. All in all, I give this game a 8.8 out of 10.","November 12, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Obviously, these guys lack understanding for real social intercourse, let alone true family life. I'd like to point a few things out:\n\nWhen you were a kid, what did you want to do all the time? Think about it, silly. Play. Yep, thats what it was probably. All the time and under any circumstances. Or, at least, have some genuine fun (to be honest, thats what I'm seeking in my life even today, otherwise why the heck would I be playin' games instead of being productive in the traditional sense?).\n\nBut did that really mean that you just wanted to simply 'play'? Wasn't there something 'deeper' going on in your head at the time? Maybe feeling your parents love or making a great experience with friends and family, something you would share for a lifetime? Building a secret hideout with your best friend, observe the people passing by and feeling all secure cause they appear to not notice your hidden cave? Showing off your new toys to your dad, silently hoping he would be just as amazed by it as you were? You tell me. I, for one, did have this kind of feelings. Although it may have looked all the same from the outside, there were some pretty amazing stories hidden beneath these 'superficial' "Come on dad, I need to show you something!"s. And if you don't get these emotions, you either never went through childhood or you're the best example of our self-alienated, objectified masquerade which we're used to call 'culture'.\n\nThe outcomes of the choices you make in the game are in not in the least bland or predictable. Of course, due to technical limitations (the whole story happens in just this one house, you don't get to see animated visuals of the outcomes etc.), the emotiveness of, in some cases, life changing decisions has to fall short of ones expectations. But in the end, the important connections between the events and the complicated nets of relationships in a family and its acquaintances have to be something you cannot but ponder on for hours. Also, it simply wouldn't be in favor of the game to try and 'show off' anyone and everything. Sometimes it's just better to not let one more supernumerary walk onto the stage. He's just an psychological element in the protagonists mind and therefore should be presented as such.\n\nIn the end, the game did present a spot on realistic emotionality. It's not as daydreamy as in 'To the Moon', which's story is extraordinarily compelling, but which on the other hand lacks some interdependency between the real world and the alternative, parallel-universe. There are connections between these realms and as such they have to affect unto each other in a dynamic sense. This is exactly what 'The Novelist' does just right. Every character in the game broods over his very own feelings, stares into nothingness, pondering his/her possibilities and doubtfully asks the 'What if..?' question. But at the same time, the chars are actually aware of their presence in the actual situation, with all the barriers and complexicities you set up for their lifes by making tough calls. To me, 'The Novelist' presents a piece of completeness that, aside from technicalities, could hardly be topped in any way.\n","February 17, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you are looking for action - it's not for you.\n\nI've completed the game just now, and I would say that I am freaking amazed how a simple idea can make such a wonderful, soul-soothing, but at times - heartbreaking experience. It is a wonderful story about a family, the story that is shaped by YOU. You are a ghost, indeed, but it is not really about that. The game is called "The Novelist" because, despite the fact that Dan - the father in this family - is trying to write a book, you are actually the one who is writing a novel. You are writing a novel about the life of this family, and you make actions that are shaping the story, and I am sure this game has multiple endings, depending on what choices you make.\n\nDan is trying to write a novel, his wife Linda is trying her luck at painting pictures. Their kid Tommy is trying to adapt to the new environment in new school and tries to deal with dyslexia. You choose who gets the momentum, and who will be dissapointed with their days. Sometimes you will try to make VERY TOUGH descisions.... Thats how the gameplay works, and your actions will lead to different branches of the story...\n\nI cried in the end, most of the actions I did were trying to help everyone... But that is not always how it is in real life. I cried in the end because I am going through the exact moment of my life right now. It's either my career, or my family. And in this game - i chose family. And now I am quite sure that this is what I am going to do in my life.\n\nI salute you Orthogonal Games for writing and developing such a good, mesmerising story that could actually make me think about my choices, and maybe think about life and family in general.\n\nI am giving this game 9 out of 10 for creating one of the best emotional experiences i've had in a while. This game made to shed a tear even though I am a grown man. *<[:D  I will take 1 point from this game because I didn't feel the gameplay gave me just a little bit more freedom to explore the house or the outsides and sometimes it felt a little bit repepetive and very straightforward. I felt it could have a bit more on the visuals, i mean the outside terrain could be improved (sometimes i am very picky on details) But other than that - it is amazing.","November 1, 2014","true","2.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You play as the ghost of a vacation house in the countryside. Your guests are a family of three: the novelist Dan Kaplan, his wife Linda and their son, Tommy.\nThe game is subdivided into twelve chapters, each of which is characterized by specific problems the family faces, such as a death in the family, a drinking problem, or scheduling visitors. For each chapter, Dan Kaplan has to make a decision. You as the ghost spend your time figuring out what the family members want and desire by wandering the house and the family's memories. You then have to influence Dan by telling him what he should do in his sleep.\nThe mechanics of the game are easily understood and executed. The difficulty of the game rather lies in making the decisions for the family, as you will see that they affect the rest of the characters' lives. As you can turn different ways in each chapter, the Novelist is a game that can be played over several times.\nThe game is an affectionately told contemplation about our life choices and what we sacrifice for our family, for love, for our dreams.","May 6, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On top of that the voice acting is bad enough to be immersion breaking on its own. But by far the most infuriating thing about this game is how often i feel like it's insulting my intelligence. Like, it's painfully obvious what each character wants just from reading their thoughts, seeing their memories, and watching their behavior, but you're REQUIRED to search all around the house for multiple scraps of paper they left lying around for some reason, that tells you what you already knew.

If you wanna check it out, here's the first part of the game that I played.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/OzzDBhvsZHc\n\nAnyways, if you are in the market for a game that presents itself in an original manner with a quite emotional storyline and choices that must be made wisely, I urge you to get this game because it kindof made me cry... Even though I played about 2-3 hours of it which is basically the length of the game, I think it was a few hours well spent :) Baiiii!","May 18, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you co-exist with the family you can go through their journals, look at their letters and even read their minds in order to get an understanding of their mindset.\n\nDan is a novelist, married to Linda who is a keen painter and together they have a young son, Tommy. The game requires you to understand these characters and help Dan make choices that can have profound consequences. Every action has a consequence and in the Novelist these consequences can be far reaching and have lasting implications. This motivates a player who is even remotely invested in these characters spend time exploring the house, find every journal or letter and consider their choices carefully.\n\nIt is not a particularly long game, however the length is appropriate for the limited gameplay. While your main objective is to investigate the house you must also not been seen by a member of the family. To achieve this, you are able to move around the house out in the open or you are able to jump between light fixtures without being seen. As the game progresses, lights are turned off making it more difficult to remain incognito.\n\nThe variety of choices will result in every player having a different experience with the Novelist. The story moves on at an unhurried pace which may be offsetting for some. Likewise despite the relaxed pace it seems to end quite quickly. I finished the game in two hours and have no immediate intention to play it again. I am sure there are many who will question whether the price of the game is worth two hours of gameplay.\n\nI, for one, think that it is. The Novelist is a gameplay experience like no other with a unique premise, interesting characters and difficult decisions that will help engage you.","May 5, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game focuses on one particular family which you "haunt" to try and discover (and ultimately influence) their life story.

In _The Novelist_, backstory is not window-dressing to make you care slightly more about (say) running down a hallway shooting bad guys; instead, backstory *is* the game.\n\nThe tensions and tradeoffs in this little family really rang true to me, especially as someone with a career, a wife, and a child, and all of us trying to juggle and find balance, just like the game's characters. My wife watched me play through one of the chapters, and she ended up crying (but in a good way). Like me, she was a bit floored at how "real" everything felt.\n\nMy one nit is with the forced-choice mechanic employed in each chapter. At "best," you can make one of the three characters very happy, make a second character moderately happy, and leave the third character out in the cold. I understood and felt how the game was trying to really force me into the mindset of limited time+resources where I had to make hard choices for the family. But by the end this particular mechanic seemed itself seemed a bit forced and forumulaic. I would have loved for the game to mix it up a bit, be less predictable, and find some other ways to present me with hard choices where not everyone gets what they want.\n\nStill, it was a great experience overall, and I highly recommend the game to anyone who's looking for a few hours of contemplating family, work, life, and all the cracks in between.","May 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But not at the normal cost of $16.99. I understand that it was made by one man, with limited resources, hence the cost. But you will most likely only get a few hours out of the game, so you should wait until it is on sale.\n\nThe game that is here is great. The story is that the titular Novelist, Dan Kaplan, has gone to a cabin for the summer alongside his wife and son, to help him with writing his book. However the amount of time being devoted to writing the book takes time away from his son, and prevents him from helping to support his wife's career as a painter. Your role, is that of a ghostly figure, sneaking around the house, reading memories, letters, diaries, etcetera, in an effort to figure out what each of the three characters want. Then while they are asleep, you whisper to Dan what he should so and you find out about the consequences.\n\nDo you have Dan spend an afternoon playing a game with his son, ignoring the work on his novel and neglecting to spend an evening with his wife? Do you have Dan focus on writing his novel and getting it finished, leaving his wife to fend for herself when it comes to organizing an art show, and not taking his son to the beach? Do you decide, as a family, to go camping, have a beach campfire, or take Tommy to an astronomy camp that he discovered was free?\n\nThe stealth element of the game comes in the form of compromises; you can choose one of the other characters outcomes and somewhat satisfy them, but if they see you and get scared you cannot do this. The game does feature a 'Story' difficulty which removes the stealth aspect altogether and just allows you to enjoy the story, however this isn't recommended as it makes it feel like less of an actual game.\n\nThere are nine chapters altogether in the game. Each one does play exactly the same way. But if you're playing this, you aren't playing for the gameplay, you're playing for the story. It's a lovely title, and a far cry from slaughteing aliesn, bandits, pirates, and whatever else you might be doing with the rest of your library. But if strikes your fancy, give this a go.

The family consists of a father who is a novelist and came to this remote location to get past his writer's block and reconnect with his family, a mother who loves painting but hasn't been able to focus on it after becoming a mother, and finally a son who gets bullied at school and doesn't have very many friends. The father has become quite neglectful of his family because he is way behind schedule on finishing his novel, and through the course of this game you see him struggling to manage the progress of and ultimately finish his novel as well as keep his family happy.\n\nThe gameplay consists of stealthing around the house by possessing light sources in order to find and read diary entries or letters written by or to the family members, as well as read their thoughts and explore their memories. After having found enough of these for a character, you can see what they want and choose that as the resolution for this chapter, disappointing the other two characters. But if you managed to also find out a desire of at least one other character and haven't spooked them by getting detected by them, you can choose their desire as a compromise for the chapter, making two characters happy. To finish a chapter, you whisper your decisions to the father in his sleep, which makes him execute the choices you made. Well, in most cases at least.\n\nThere were plenty of things which bothered me about this game, such as having choices I made conflict with others when they really didn't have to, characters just not doing what I chose for them to do or all characters' desires to be small and trivial enough to all do in one night but still being forced to only make up to two happen, and so on. Yet in the end every character's outcome was just as I had hoped, even though it felt pretty awful being forced to disappoint at least one character over and over again, and because of conflicts and such I didn't always get the outcome for a chapter that I had hoped for. I can't tell how much my choices even mattered in the end, if at all, but I like to think they did because the outcome I got in the end was what I was trying to achieve. I can definitely see one of the final choices allowing for drastically different outcomes, but since you can't start from specific chapters I won't play through it all again to see if it actually does, especially since I'm very content with how it turned out.\n\nVerdict:\nThis game isn't the best when it comes to its narrative, and especially not when it comes to its gameplay, which gets very repetitive. But when it comes to teaching players a valuable life lesson and delivering an important message, this game is probably one of the best out there. For example, having to decide on whether the father should continue writing his novel which is already way behind schedule, write an ad for his wife's art exhibition so she has a bigger chance to break through and achieve her dream or spend a good few hours every day tutoring his son who is behind on a school subject really captures the fact that life is all about making sacrifices and that no one will consistently get what they want. Another messages that this game delivers really well is that you should never take your family for granted, and  that having a nice and functional family requires effort from everyone involved. Other than that it also emphasizes how stressful it is to try and contribute something that lasts to the world and make your existence matter, and that you should never give up on your dreams.\n\nIt was quite a reality check for me, making me think about some things I usually don't or haven't before, as well as an inspiring experience overall.","October 2, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It felt like a real family. My choices didn't have the impact I thought they would have, like having Dan drink didn't hurt their relationship at all. He had all the symptoms of an alcoholic, yet it caused little to no problems. I guess their overral happiness was the deciding factor. I just thought the ending could've been darker. I assumed the "ghost" failed at his previous attempts at helping the family, so I expected that it shouldn't be possible to have good endings for everyone, yet it was fairly easy. In any case it's an amazing game.\n\nIn a way, it felt a lot like Papers Please and that's really saying something.\n\nI loved how real Tommy was, he reminded me of my own childhood. Since I am not a father myself, thanks to this game I can sympathise and understand my parents better. I can now understand why I couldn't spent as much a time with my father as I would like, and why my parents fell apart.\n\nAlso, as an aspiring author this game gave me courage to continue writing.

It confronts you with interpersonal situations you will encounter in your adult life (or have encountered yet). It is about taking responsibility, making decisions and achieving a balance in a family's needs.\n\nYou play some sort of a poltergeist observing a family on vacation in a secluded house. The family consists of Dan, father and writer who is facing writer's block and has to finish his latest novel; there also is Linda, Dan's wife and former artist, trying to get a grip on her marriage with Dan and to start over her working career; and there is Tommy, their little boy struggling with grapho legasthenia and the need for playmates.\n\nNow, in every chapter you read their thoughts, find out about each of their needs and have to decide which sounds the most important to you to have this character make a progress. At the same time, the other two will be disappointed. As you can choose another one for a compromise, you might soften negative aspects for one further character.\n\nEventually the player is absolutely free in his decisions; you can push forward only one character, letting both the other two drop badly; you can try to make them all happy; depending on what you choose the story developes further.\n\nAnd that is why I would recommend the game: How would you decide? What is your priority? And, in the end, how would you rate your decisions made?\n\nReally worth the price - and even more the experience!","February 27","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it’s a shining example of a step in the right direction for “walking simulators”.\n\nIn the game you observe a family via possessing lights and eavesdropping, reading personal items, and occasionally entering their memories. Each day/chapter you gather as much or as little information as you like and then at night you must make a choice of which character will get what they want. The whole spying/influencing system keeps the game undeniably linear, but being able to choose whose desires will get fulfilled gives the player just enough control to make the story mean so much more than just watching a book. There is a mode (I believe it’s called stealth mode) where the family can see you, so you truly have to be sneaky, but personally I don’t think this mode adds anything to the game. The narrative itself along with the developers method of delivery make this title an absolute pleasure to dive into.\n\nIf the whole “walking simulator” genre has left a bad taste in your mouth, give The Novelist a chance to clean your palette.

Of course, it's actually more of a commentary on life than it is a computer game, and understanding that makes it better. Essentially, you're a ghost of sorts whose job is to read the thoughts, memories, and desires of the family that comes to temporarily stay in your house, and then helps the father to decide what choices to prioritize in his life. Play your cards right, with balance, and everyone in the family ends up really happy and successful, or if you sacrifice a character's needs too much, they may end up miserable. I do think the endings were too preset (not really being directly linked to the precise decisions you make), and that some of the "bigger" decisions could have been weighed more heavily in favor of that character's happiness. Yet, still, I found myself replaying the game a couple times to try for different endings. I do think it would have been better if done on a bigger and more realistic scale, and yet it is pretty impressive for what it is.","May 11, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These all represent a certain aspect in the life of Dan Kaplan (the father).\nHe himself represents his work, he is trying to make it as a writer and wants to write a book that gives him a legacy. So people will remember his name.\nHis wife represents family life, she always wants to do stuff with her husband despite the fact that he is always trying to work. She wants to save the family from a divorce.\nThe child represents responsibility, he wants to do stuff with his father but he never gets the chance. as the game progresses and you stop choosing his side his drawings of him and his father will become bleaker because he can feel the gap between him and his father getting bigger.\n\nThis game speaks to me as a person who comes from a broken household, I do not have a preference to whom I'd choose in this game to compromise with. Seeing the impacts your decisions have on the family keeps you thinking. The biggest thing about this game is your thought pattern expanding and you keep thinking "What if". This is the first game ever that made me pause the game and made me think about the consequences my decision might have.\nThis game has a lot of impact on people who have been in this situation. Or trying it and putting yourself in the shoes of the people in this game.\nWill you let the father finish the book? Will you let the mother have her family back? Or will you let the son have a lot of quality time with his father? And of course "What would have happened if I choose that in stead?"\nThis game is worth the try and it is clear that the developer poured his complete heart and soul into this game.","May 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The Novelist is story-driven narrative adventure about a family ending up on summer vacation. By collecting  clues around the house, reading thoughts and exploring memories of three family members, you need to decide the course of their vacation, but also a course of their future. Dan is a struggling writer, Linda is his wife and upcoming artist and Tommy, their son - well, he's a son and he has some problems and he's in dire need for some parently love.\n\nCan you make Dan write his book without pushing away people he loves?\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are interesting at first, and by ''first'', I mean first twenty minutes of your game time. You collected 3-8 clues placed almost on the same places in the house in every single act, you read thoughts by entering heads at the same locations throughout the game and by the end of second act (nine acts in total), you're shutting down stealth mode and playing story mode which differ in Kaplan family abbility to see you. The concept of using lights to hide away from Kaplans is interesting, but since their AI is not challenging at all, it gets pretty frustrating in a bad way. So you shut it down, move like a real ghost, collect clues by clicking, reading and listening and you're done after 1.5-2 hours.\n\nThe story should be the selling point of this game, and let's be honest - it's not. It's cliched, emotionless and dull. Although at first I've truly wanted to feel heartbroken when I didn't fulfill wishes of a family member, I've discovered I didn't care about any of the characters at all - they're shallow and uninteresting. Game deals with some usual questions - work vs private life, alcoholism, priorities, ego vs your kids, but The Novelist doesn't have to offer anything revolutionary nor new in any way. I've wanted to play it again to discover new endings (if any), but the characters and gameplay are so dull I'll just not do it. And I'm sorry, but I can't force myself into loving it.\n\nNow, to be honest - It's hard to recommend or not recommend this game. Quite certainly, I don't recommend it at all with this price tag - 2 hours of pretty thin story and non-memorable characters, with flaw and repetitive gameplay can't really justify 14 €.

I would say the game is worth it based on just how much I cared about the characters. This game is definitely a must play if you're a fan of adventure games, or just a fan of a strong narrative.\n\nI did not choose to play the stealth mode the first play around because I wanted to avoid missing out on the compromises, which allowed you to do just a little bit more than otherwise. There were a few things that were not readily apparent, but I did skip the tutorial. My second play through was much more productive and I feel like most players if they have trouble the first time around the second will be a lot more forgiving once the stealth mechanics are down.\n\nTo sum up, this game is great you should totally give it a go.","January 8, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quasipedia/recommended/245150/","quasipedia","quasipedia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quasipedia/","63 products in account","A nice game from somebody who's probably not (yet) a father...\nFirst of all, let me clarify that despite this review focusing on the shortcoming of the game, I wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Then let's dive in:\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nThe game is essentially a narration/exploration game (think "Dear Eshter[dear-esther.com]") with the notable exception that in "The Novelist" the player has to solve moral dilemmas at the end of each level.\n\nIn particular the game follows a family during their summer retreat, and each chapter of the story ends with each family members having a different, conflicting desire.  The player must choose which family member's desire gets fulfilled.\n\nHowever - and this is the strength of the game - the stakes are hight as each family member's preferences contribute towards important, existential points (writing the book that may change the course of the man career, saving the relationship between the two adults, supporting the kid in overcoming being bullied and having difficulties at school).\n\nThese are usually very well balanced dilemmas and the choice is never merely strategic: it is all the times phylosophical/moral: there is never a "correct" answer, just one that resonates more with each player's sensitivity, and that will influence the remaining of the story/the final outcome in a specific way.\n\nIn that regards, the game is brilliant: it elicits emotions and reflections that overflow the context of the game and invite the player to think to their real lives.\n\nTHE LESS GOOD\n\nI'm pretty sure (given the credits) that the author of the game is married, but does not have (yet) kids.  This shows.  The relationship and emotional dynamic between husband and wife in the game is very credible.  The one between the father (or the mother) and the kid - although described with care and attention - is not as authentic.\n\nParents truly "feel the joy" of their kids.  Even when they have to give up something of their personal life, parents are sincerely and completely happy for their's kid successes.  There is no regret nor second thought once the choice to prioritise your kid's needs over yours is done.  It's a very different feeling than that of - say - giving up something important for making your partner happy.\n\nIt is difficult to put this difference in words (let alone in a language that is not my native one), but while an adult is happy for their partner's happiness, a parent tends to be happy with their kids.  It is not a better or more intense joy, it's just... different.\n\nSo, my only (minor) criticism of the game is that it does not render this difference properly: the narration does not sound as authentic as it does in describing the relationship between spouses.\n\nAnother (again: very minor) criticism I'd like to make is that the game is framed in a very "man-centric" way: in order for the player to choose the course of action, they have to "tell" the man what the family as a whole should do (why not telling it to the woman?).\n\nAlso in the summary of the events as they happened in previous chapters, the sentences are all constructed in such a way that the man is portrayed as the decision-maker, and the woman and kid subjects of the decisions.  Again: this is an extremely small detail, but it stands out enough for an attentive player to notice.\n\nTECHNICAL REMARKS\n\nThe game is clearly the single-handed work of love of its author.  There is degree of identification between the man in the game (the novelist) and the author of the game which is apparent in many passages of the script and openly revealed at the end of the game.\n\nBecause of the limited human resources on the project, many technical choices have been a compromise: very simple and naive AI of the characters, a tiny-tiny world (in fact a two-bedroom house!), low level of garphic detail.\n\nHowever the author not only stroke a good balance by investing on the things that make the game good, while ignoring those that would make it merely more "shiny"; he also put great care in the delivery, so that the game feels simple from a technical perspective, but also very well executed.  More importantly one can feel the care the author put in its creation, and that makes you feel as the recipient of something beautiful.\n\nAgain: the game is not perfect, but it deliver a strong memorable experience, and I wholeheartedly reccomand it to anybody, although - perhaps - an adult gamer will appreciate it more than a young one who hasn't a family on its own yet.","December 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Basically you will hear them complain all the time (the writer because he can't find ideas, the wife because her husband works too much and the child because he wants to play).\nThey all annoyed me after 5 minutes (which is extremely problematic when the aim of the game is about keeping a family together + when the game is mostly story driven).\n\nBut well, it can happen...maybe my problem...tastes and colours.... I still gave it a try for 40 more minutes before rage quitting.\n\nBasically, everything is black and white. For instance, if you satisfy the child then he will be happy but the dad and his wife won't be happy - then the next day if you satisfy the wife, she will be happy but not the two others...Can't the child remember that his dad did something for him the day before and be more neutral? No! Their memory last for one day and the day (chapter) after, blank, everything starts again, they have no memories of what person X did to person Y. WHICH is extremely problematic for a game making heavy references to memories (you can read old memories of the characters but yet they can't remember what they did few hours ago?).\n\nOf course with such system, your don't have the feeling that your choices impact the game that much. Which goes against what this game claims to be when they pretentiously advertise it as "The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.".\nWorst, you don't even care about choices you are going to make because issues the family is going through are banal to the extreme - it is more whines than real family issues.\n\nMy overall feeling is that this game is extremely pretentious - from its excessive price, fake description (your choices don't impact that much the game), and its "pseudo-intellectual" vibe.","November 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Overall, the game delivers the desired emotional effect but some of the weaknesses in character development make it difficult to fully engage with some aspects of the narrative. The game would have benefitted from a little more backstory. Ultimately, the game is a great vehicle for reflecting on one's own decisions and priorities as well as broader matters like family, career, and (maybe) freedom.\n\nThe game revolves around a family's three-month retreat. Dan, the main character, is an author who is negotiating the demands of family life and the challenges of creative work. Similarly, his wife, Linda, who is herself a painter, struggles to balance life as a mother and wife with her desire to develop her artistic career. Lastly, Tommy, is Linda and Dan's child. He is mostly occupied by the preoccupations of any average child: the desires to make friends, please his parents, and to explore new possibilities. The player's task is to make decisions, through Dan, that try to take into account everyone's priorities.\n\nThe Novelist is more narrative than gameplay. Yet, unlike other games in the same spirit, the Novelist does attempts to integrate gameplay into the narrative by offering the player the option of whether they will engage with the narrative on a "story" mode or a "game mode." The game mode requires that a player stealthily navigate the house while finding clues to progress the story. Exposing one's self to the family may cause story options  and decisions regarding how the family should proceed to dissappear. Alternatively, playing in story mode removes the elements of stealth and gameplay, allowing players to focus solely on developing the story and unlocking as many options for developing the story as available. The developers did a good job of integrating traditional elements of gameplay with the newly-developing narrative style.\n\nThe Novelist does a good job of capturing the impact that apparently mundane decisions can have on the present and future lives of individuals. Nevertheless, the narrative has some weaknesses particularly in the development of Tommy's character. Unlike Dan and Linda, whose career and family challenges feel more genuine from the start of the game, Tommy's concerns do not feel as important until later in the game when he is dealing with his relationship to his father, friends at school, and academic success. I think the writers could have done better by emphasizing the relationship between Tommy and Dan from the beginning and developing his psychological status in the same way that the writers did with Dan and Linda. Ultimately, Tommy's character is a weakness and not a flaw. I don't get the sense that the writters didn't try to make a complex character, only that the complexities did not emerge as successfullly as those of the other characters.\n\nOverall, I found the game to be worthwhile. The novel approach of the game made it a useful platform for reflecting on my own priorities in life as well as broader philosophical questions. To the extent that players approach this game as a reflexive experience, I think the Novelist will find a special place in your gaming heart.","December 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is very similar to Dear Esther and others in that genre. It is not going to appeal to everyone. The game focuses on choice and consequences of the decisions you take in the game. The choices will resonate throughout the entire game, affecting the dynamics of the family.\n\nSince you play as a ghostly entity in the house, there are 2 game modes. One which involves stealth, meaning you can not let any of the family members see you. The other focusing on story, which lets you freely wander around the house with no one being able to spot you.\n\nThe game is relatively short. However if you enjoy games similar to The Novelist then you will highly enjoy this game. You will be torn between trying to appease everyone in the family, sometimes you will be upset that even with compromises; there is someone who is going to be upset with the choices you make.","December 15, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story tells the tale of the Kaplan family - Dan (the novelist), his wife Linda (the artist) and their son Tommy. Interestingly enough, the player controls none of these characters but instead controls a disembodied entity (essentially a ghost for lack of a better word) whose exact origin or purpose is left intentionally ambiguous. You control said entity in the first person, exploring the Kaplan's new vacation home while simultaneously trying to avoid detection (thus spooking a given a family member). To help in this endeavor, you can possess lights and even make them flicker to attract the attention of the Kaplans, adding a stealth aspect to the game; it does, however, offer a 'story' mode where you are immune to detection as well.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent, upon the Kaplans arrival in threir new summer home, that things are not going well for this family. Thus, for reasons unknown, it becomes your job to dig up the proper clues to help resolve various conflicts between family members. This is done through exploration, a form of mind-reading, and the ability to enter the memories of individual characters for further discovery. Stay out of sight, find all the clues, learn the secrets, and then use this knowledge to influence the situation by way of subliminal suggestion (you literally whisper suggestions into Dan's ear while he sleeps)!\n\nAll in all this is a really unique and interesting game which offers plenty of fun, as well as a really engaging story-driven narrative. Especially for that low, low indie price! If you enjoy adventure games, especially the more artistically expressive types, then definitely do yourself a favor and give it a go - if not, who knows, you may still end up enjoying it anyway!","December 13, 2013","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whether it's the Sierra On-Line Quest adventures of old, the whimsical originality of LucasArts or the classic Bioware RPGs, I've always welcomed games which draw me into a mythology, a complete, hermetic tale. It never mattered what the subject was - classic fantasy, pirates, post-fallout apocalypse. Quality and consistency of dialogue and character were always the watchwords.\n\nYet, as pretentious as I claim to be and as much as I love the games of yesteryear, I rarely finish the story-driven games of today. I guess, over the years, I've become as impatient as all those console gamers who dominate the market. Games like Dear Esther - while I recognise their superb quality and importance in today's market - actually just bore me. As much as I want to like them, I grow dissatisfied too quickly.\n\nThe Novelist is not such a game. I was compelled from the outset to continue. I think the real world setting had a lot to do with this: the story grips you from the outset because it's completely REALISTIC. It feels like you're peeking into people's real lives. The three main characters are so wholly, so beautifully represented, that it's easy to imagine that they're your neighbours.\n\nIt's rare for a game to offer a sense that your choices really matter. This is one such game. And I know this is probably, single-handedly, the most oft-used and yet eminently inaccurate characteristic reviewers like to ascribe to RPG/adventure games. But having just completed this game, I can tell you it's completely true: I know I could go back and select different choices in order to elicit a totally different outcome.\n\nThere are so many peripheral touches that round out this experience, too. The gameplay is inspired: you can choose to dive, freestyle, right into the story without hindrance, or you can spice it up a bit with a stealth element that you just wouldn't expect in this kind of game. The sound mechanics are excellent and actually add to the gameplay, as you follow various audio cues to advance the story. The voice acting is credible and mature. And the game's author even makes the credits totally readable by paying tribute to each person's contribution to the overall game.\n\nThis is my first review on Steam, and I'm glad that The Novelist is what drove me to write it. Whether through Steam Greenlight or other avenues, we need to support developers to make more like this. They're the future of PC gaming.","February 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After the 1st chapter I found myself already getting wrapped up in the game. You truly become a part of the family and really bond with them in a way. You begin to feel attached to the characters, some more than others. To make this easy, I'm going to break down the game into a few parts...\n\nGameplay-While gameplay isn't a huge part of this game it is cool how you can jump from light to light and sometimes they turn off certain ones to make it harder. It is also cool how if you choose the "Stealth" difficulty you have to be careful to stay out of the families sight so you don't scare them and blow your cover. Going through peoples memories and finding certain interactions they had done previously was a very interesting concept as well that was executed rather well. There are also clues for each family member around the house that shows what they want. After you find out what each family member wants, you can choose one to be the priority and then you can choose one more of the family members wants and leave them, sort of happy. The 3rd family member... well they're not the happiest people in the world. The game could get a little repetitive sometimes I must say.\n\nStyle-The game is beautiful in its own kind of way. I really like the cartoon look it has with it. I feel like it fits the game very well.\n\nVoice acting-The voice acting was very good and seemed to fit each member of the family rather well. You could always sense emotion in the persons voice which really helped you figure out what was going on with them and what they wanted.\n\nStory-The story was absolutely amazing. It made up 100% for the repetitiveness of the game. The story brought me in so much that I forced myself to beat the whole game today. It gives you a lot of hard choices to make. It shows that no matter what you do there will always be consequences. The message, "You can't make everyone happy is very strong in this game." The choices you make can also tell a lot about yourself which can be a little scary at times.\n\nLength-The game is not very long. After I explored everything and completed the story line I had about 6 hours logged. I would say for the $15 price tag, it's well worth it!\n\nThere's so much more I could praise this game about. There were very limited downfalls with this game and overall the story made it well worth it.

As an experience, I am willing to offer it some credit due to its well executed narrative, but all you do is walk around a fictitious island for no longer than an hour before the credits roll. That is not a game; that is a digital story, and those arguing the opposite possess a thwarted view of the medium that is stripping gamers like me off their money.\n\nWhy would I bring up Dear Esther in this review? Because just like it, The Novelist is a digital experience that shoe horns gaming elements in order to reach the wider audience on Steam. Art nuts will raise their fists at me preaching the advancement of the gaming culture, while I berate them for supporting such flagrant experiments with little to no gaming elements.\n\nThe Novelist is a simple project that puts you in control of a specter, floating around a house to uncover the stories of all its three occupants: A father, mother, and their son. Each of them is looking to fulfill a need, and it is up to you at the end of each chapter to choose who actually pulls it off. Should you choose an outcome that has the father focus on his novel, his wife will get lonely, and his son will get depressed because he is not spending time with him. There are compromises that you may offer characters you did not support, a pacifier to pamper their low self esteems and lack of will, by choosing to cater to them after your desired intention is completed. If you chose to support the father’s novel, for example, you will get the chance to support one of the other members: Instead of spending the day with your son, you sit with him and read, or instead of fully assisting your wife in promoting her art gallery, you help her with copy at the end of the day. These are all do-it-yourself story elements, and do not compromise a game.\n\nHad The Novelist been on offer for a couple of dollars I would not be ranting, but when an experiment like this is sold for $15, with no mention anywhere that it is a non-game, I lose my ♥♥♥♥. If you like digital experiences the likes of Dear Esther and Gone Home, then you may enjoy The Novelist for what it offers; otherwise, stay clear away and save your money for actual, deserving indie games.","December 18, 2013","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Overall, the game delivers the desired emotional effect but some of the weaknesses in character development make it difficult to fully engage with some aspects of the narrative. The game would have benefitted from a little more backstory. Ultimately, the game is a great vehicle for reflecting on one's own decisions and priorities as well as broader matters like family, career, and (maybe) freedom.\n\nThe game revolves around a family's three-month retreat. Dan, the main character, is an author who is negotiating the demands of family life and the challenges of creative work. Similarly, his wife, Linda, who is herself a painter, struggles to balance life as a mother and wife with her desire to develop her artistic career. Lastly, Tommy, is Linda and Dan's child. He is mostly occupied by the preoccupations of any average child: the desires to make friends, please his parents, and to explore new possibilities. The player's task is to make decisions, through Dan, that try to take into account everyone's priorities.\n\nThe Novelist is more narrative than gameplay. Yet, unlike other games in the same spirit, the Novelist does attempts to integrate gameplay into the narrative by offering the player the option of whether they will engage with the narrative on a "story" mode or a "game mode." The game mode requires that a player stealthily navigate the house while finding clues to progress the story. Exposing one's self to the family may cause story options  and decisions regarding how the family should proceed to dissappear. Alternatively, playing in story mode removes the elements of stealth and gameplay, allowing players to focus solely on developing the story and unlocking as many options for developing the story as available. The developers did a good job of integrating traditional elements of gameplay with the newly-developing narrative style.\n\nThe Novelist does a good job of capturing the impact that apparently mundane decisions can have on the present and future lives of individuals. Nevertheless, the narrative has some weaknesses particularly in the development of Tommy's character. Unlike Dan and Linda, whose career and family challenges feel more genuine from the start of the game, Tommy's concerns do not feel as important until later in the game when he is dealing with his relationship to his father, friends at school, and academic success. I think the writers could have done better by emphasizing the relationship between Tommy and Dan from the beginning and developing his psychological status in the same way that the writers did with Dan and Linda. Ultimately, Tommy's character is a weakness and not a flaw. I don't get the sense that the writters didn't try to make a complex character, only that the complexities did not emerge as successfullly as those of the other characters.\n\nOverall, I found the game to be worthwhile. The novel approach of the game made it a useful platform for reflecting on my own priorities in life as well as broader philosophical questions. To the extent that players approach this game as a reflexive experience, I think the Novelist will find a special place in your gaming heart.","December 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story tells the tale of the Kaplan family - Dan (the novelist), his wife Linda (the artist) and their son Tommy. Interestingly enough, the player controls none of these characters but instead controls a disembodied entity (essentially a ghost for lack of a better word) whose exact origin or purpose is left intentionally ambiguous. You control said entity in the first person, exploring the Kaplan's new vacation home while simultaneously trying to avoid detection (thus spooking a given a family member). To help in this endeavor, you can possess lights and even make them flicker to attract the attention of the Kaplans, adding a stealth aspect to the game; it does, however, offer a 'story' mode where you are immune to detection as well.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent, upon the Kaplans arrival in threir new summer home, that things are not going well for this family. Thus, for reasons unknown, it becomes your job to dig up the proper clues to help resolve various conflicts between family members. This is done through exploration, a form of mind-reading, and the ability to enter the memories of individual characters for further discovery. Stay out of sight, find all the clues, learn the secrets, and then use this knowledge to influence the situation by way of subliminal suggestion (you literally whisper suggestions into Dan's ear while he sleeps)!\n\nAll in all this is a really unique and interesting game which offers plenty of fun, as well as a really engaging story-driven narrative. Especially for that low, low indie price! If you enjoy adventure games, especially the more artistically expressive types, then definitely do yourself a favor and give it a go - if not, who knows, you may still end up enjoying it anyway!","December 13, 2013","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The main character, Dan, takes his family to this place so he can get away from the city and focus on his book. You don't actually play Dan, or any of his family members, you play some sort of ghost, who is trying to influence their lives.\n\nFirst of all let me address a small issue. This game is what I would consider "Art". Therefore, there isn't much in terms of the standard definition of gameplay. There are definitely choices, and different endings, but you really aren't doing much. Your watching the story unfold based on your choices. Especially if you play in story mode.\n\nThere are 2 different types of modes. Stealth and story. In story mode, the family is unable to detect you, leaving you to be able to discover clues and read their memories with ease. This is what you would want to choose to just focus on the story. Stealth includes a stealth mechanic to the game, you must remain out of site. For the first time, I'd recommend using stealth. It makes it feel more like a game, even though without the mechanic I would still call it a game.\n\nOkay, the story. The story is great, and the choices, unlike other games that claim this, actually count. Your choices will reflect in the ending no matter which exact "ending" you choose. And I do not believe there is a perfect ending. No matter what, someone will end up disapointed one way or another. That's what I love about this game, because that is life. You can't make everyone happy. And when your in an outsider situation, that makes it even harder. The story isn't complex or epic, and it doesn't have to be. It's a simplistic story about a families life and problems. But it feels real, and I love it.\n\nI absolutely love story driven games, and I'm glad I spend 15 bucks on The Novelist. If you enjoy games like The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, and the sort, you will love The Novelist. I surely hope people give this game a chance.\n--\nEnd of Quote","December 24, 2013","true","2.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyanWells/recommended/245150/","RyanWells","The Hitman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RyanWells/","677 products in account","The Novelist is about the summer of writer Dan Kaplan, his artist wife and mentally challenged kid. You play as some kind of spirit, that follows the family's actions and helps steer them on the right path. You get information about what is going on by exploring the house and reading their notes and a few other things. You also get information by seeing flashbacks. These flashbacks are pretty bland, and often only a 1-2 sentences. The game appears to be set sometime before the 80s, as Dan uses a typewriter and paper instead of a computer, and Tommy, your son Tommy, has no high tech toys. For the most part, exploring the house for clues is interesting. What isn’t interesting is the somewhat failed attempt to throw in some half baked gameplay. They tried to throw in some stealth element, where you travel between lights so the family doesn’t spot you (the spirit). As to why they even included this, is a mystery to me. Although at least they included a option to easily turn off the stealth and make it a straight up walking simulator adventure game. After you explore the house, and watch the flash backs for each day, you choose what you want to do. This is a game all about choices. Each family member wants to do different things, and there simply isn’t enough time. So you have to compromise, but still one character always gets left out. The game is broken into three chapters, and each one has about 5 acts. A act is a few days, maybe almost a week, and each chapter is equal to one of the three months of summer. Each act has a different sub story, and something's always going on. Things like deadlines for the book, art shows, vacations, or even a funeral. A few of the acts are pretty interesting, but i’d say about 50% of them are kind of generic. Not necessarily bad, but just nothing special. This is really a game about relationship building and task management. Your marriage is falling apart, your son needs more attention due to his disabilities, and you have a very stressful career, where meeting deadlines is always difficult. In this game you have to prioritize, and just do what you think is right for the family. Each chapter heats up in the later acts, where they throw a pile of problems together. All of this is great, and it seems like your choices do matter. Except the ending ruined it to a certain degree. The choice you make at the end of the game renders almost everything else pointless. All the work you did, building relationships, getting that book done, can be reverted or changed to something completely different by the ending. When i got done with the game i was happy with the ending, but it left me wondering why i even bothered taken the road to get there. Im pretty sure i could have just messed everything up and ended it on the same happy note. One other inclusion that bothers me is the side story about the family before you. It’s really pointless, and from what i gathered all it was there for was to show you how haunting beautiful the house was, or maybe some other high brow pretentious message that went over my head. The music and sound effects are pretty good, and the voice acting for Dan and his wife are particularly good. The graphics are nothing special, but they aren’t gonna make your eyes bleed either. Overall, the Novelist is a solid adventure game, and if it wasn’t for the ending and some of the idiotic design choices, it could have been so much more. Being that i came out of it disappointed, i kinda struggle to give it a thumbs up, but i think my expectations might have been too high for a indie adventure game. It’s certainly not a bad game, but i probably wouldn’t pay more than $5-$10 for it. You could certainly do worse, but just don’t expect to get your socks blown off.","November 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While there technically are no "wrong" or "right" decisions, I couldn't help but find myself to choose the more, erm, "sound" ones. But either way, depending on what you do, the story changes and I really enjoyed that. The extra stories of the previous tennats were a nice addition. I found myself at the end of the timeline almost in tears and that is a good thing. I've only done one full playthrough, and the fact that there are so many different choices to make with so many different outcomes makes me glad to have purchased this game.

I have no doubt that my ending would be better or worse for others and that's what really makes this game enjoyable. Watching the story unfold, wondering if you made the right choices and then going back again and playing to see if a different choice would have made a difference. Since the game presents the sequences out of order, each choice really is unique. In real life, you're stuck wondering if a certain path would have lead you to something greater. In The Novelist, you can explore those own questions about your life through the Kaplans. In a nice, safe environment that can be turned off when the questions start to bug you.

You must make decisions in order to maintain a happy marriage, family and try and produce a book to advance your career. While this is an excellent idea for a game it lets you down in a few moments along the way especially in regards to its rigid structure of the choices. There is no room for compromises it is all dealt in absolutes which is rather unfair but In the gaming world that is all that matters.

You have to figure out how to juggle three things: releasing your novel, maintain your relationship with your partner, and be the best father you can be. How can one simply do that? This all relates to life... We all go through stuff like this and have to make sacrifices. Dan's sacrifices can affect either Linda or Tommy and could have its own consequence. This game will personally touch you in its own way.

The gameplay is a little lacking (more on that later) but the story is superb, and I found myself caring for these characters more than  certain dead relatives of mine  most characters in any other game (the obvious exception being Thomas Was Alone). I went into it knowing the basic concept of the game (being able to read thoughts, jump between light fixtures, and having to find out how to make each of the Kaplans happy), and I was mostly right. However, I was also expecting to have to pay attention to the story,  having to work out what each character wants and how to get it for them. The game is a bit hand-holdey when it comes to that.  For instance, in the first chapter, you have to get Dan his notebook, Linda a bottle of wine, and Tommy a board game. These things were not at all mentioned in any of the clues, and yet when I found the clues, I was able to read the minds of the characters and find out.  The game is good, but it sometimes feels like a 3D, stealthy eye spy game. However, if you can get past that and are just in it for the story, this game may be worth a buy.\n\nIf you liked this, you may also like:\nThomas Was Alone\nGone Home\nThe Stanley Parable\nPortal series\nTrine series\nThe Binding of Isaac\nCapsized\nLittle Inferno\nPapers, Please","January 16, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I highly reccomend this game to anyone who like a good storyline and plot more than slashing some zombie's heads off.\n\nIn each chapter of the game, you are faced with a major dilemna. If you choose to fufill a character's wish, you could upset the other members of the family. However, in each chapter, you can find a comprimise with one additional family member, but you're always going to upset one character.\n\nThe story is deeply moving and even made me rethink some of my current relationships. It often left me craving for more.\nThe over-all length of the game is about a 2 1/2 hours playthrough (if you're going fast) I took longer because I wanted to value each minute of it and explore everything the game has to offer.\n\nThe price is a bit high in my opinion, and never went on sale in the 2013 blowout sale (sadness), but hey, if the developer wants to get rich off of this AMAZING game, more power to him! I think the price is well worth it just for the experience--OH! and did I mention those amazing graphics?

I really appreciate what this game is doing and I quite enjoyed its nonviolent stealth mechanic and its storyline.  The graphics were nice, the voice acting was good, the music was nice.. the whole thing was a little too ..nice.  The storyline was about making the tough decisions between career and family, something many of us find resonant, and there were no easy answers to some of the dilemmas presented.  Someone else compared it to the first Assassin's Creed and that's not too far off - a promising concept and core mechanic that needs a little more time to mature.\n\nSpoilers follow.  The player is a ghost but that entire plotline (via the journals visible only at night) did not resolve - am I K--- ? Or am I an older spirit that inhabits this house and K--- was a person that I drove to suicide?  Or redemption?  Have I as the ghost been haunting this house and helping the various visitors with their life problems since 1948?  Or earlier?  It's not made clear.  Maybe I missed a journal or two.  Considering how the other story beats were hammered home so repeatedly (including The World's Most Obvious Children's Drawings) this was needlessly obscure.\n\nMy other problem also involves the storyline.  Sorry, it falls back a little too much on cliche for me to really get invested in the characters.  A struggling writer with an alcohol problem and an ambitious spouse feeling stymied is the stuff of a million short stories.  As soon as I saw that whiskey bottle on the kitchen counter I knew what I was in for.  It wrapped up a little neatly and yes, while I chose the best outcomes I could, I felt the story needed a little more drama and conflict.   Maybe I'll play it again but make the wrong choices.  Or go with Tommy's wishes every time.   Just to see what happens.","January 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have to admit that this is the first time I have found such a game amazing and emotionally connected. It might be because I can relate to the Novelist as a writer where I am a indie game developer. The struggle of juggling family, friends, work and everything else all the while trying to meet deadlines and realize a passion and dream.\n\nSo you play as a "Ghost" whos purpose is to "help" one of the three characters which the writer, his wife and their child. They are on vacation in "your" house. You explore their memory and observe their day to find clues to their problems and solutions. You can only pick one solution every chapter, which progresses the story and unfolds the tention between the family. Will the marriage break? Will he finish the book in time? Will the kid hate his father?\n\nAs the ghost you move from light source to light source, you can flicker the light to create distractions and if you wish you can leave the light source and become more physically visible. But you can't be seen, if you get seen more then twice something happens.\n\nSimilare games: Dream, Journey and Dear Esther.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS:\nExample of interesting mechanics: If you flicker the light too much and often, they will write to their rent owner that something is wrong with the light. And other stuff happens later depending on how you play and your choices.\n\nIf you got seen they write in their diares about it and things happen there too.\n\nSo I recommend this game if you want a different experience that is less game mechanic driven but more story/narrative and emotionally driven.","January 12, 2014","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An interesting 'proof of concept' for ways in which games can be different, but in a world where 'empathy games' are breaking further and further into the mainstream conciousness, there are better options out there.

Very glad to see it now on steam because it is quite good.\n\nThe Novelist is a game that is all about it's story. The game play is essentially walking around the main character Dan's house (or possesing light bulb to light bulb) and discovering what each person living in the house wants. Ultimately you get to decide the fate of the family and of the Novel that Dan is writing, and that is why the game works.\n\nYour desicions mattter. It's that simple, but you get to decide the course of the game and that was what made it fun for me (and play it twice). Do I want Dan to write a really good novel, family be damned? Ok, that's possible. Or I can get his family stronger than ever. Or just flat out ruin all of their lives. No matter what you choose to do, the game tells a good, realistic story with  consequences for your actions. Also it tells the story with a nice graphical style and eerie soundtrack.\n\nI reccomend this game, consider it on a sale or if you really like story driven games","December 23, 2013","true","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While the premise of all life–affecting decisions that affect the family being made by the titular male character is a bit offensive to modern sensibilities, given the game's setting in a era of manual typewriters and hand–written letters, it's forgivable, I suppose. The game is structured in a way that makes me suspect that there is no truly "good" ending—I think that someone (one of the game's three characters) will always be left with the short end of the stick, and while that may be a bit contrived, it achieves its intended purpose.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game, even to so–called "non gamers"—it's more about observation, experience, and choice, then about gameplay mechanics.","April 23, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play a ghostly presence that lives in a summer getaway house, inhabited by a struggling novelist, his wife and young son. Gameplay is minimal, limited to spooking around the a house by possessing lightbulbs, taking care not to be seen by the family.\n\nAs you flit around the house, you investigate clues left by the various members of the family, which you can use to influence the novelist's decisions and the future of the family.\n\nThe game lasts about 2.5 hours if you dig into everyone's stories, but that's not counting replays to get the various endings. It is well written and the characters feel believable (even if the fact that they hang around the house all day doesn't feel particularly realistic!).

A huge part of it is that it's tough to link to the sympathy of the character difficulties because its all based on what is, ultimately, feeling like some sort of rich/upper-class background where the choices center around one character a professional writer, one character wanting to be a professional artist, and the needs of their kid. The choices that have to get made at that point just start to feel ridiculous. Each week there's multiple days off, they're traveling to have a summer 'off' working, and so to be in that situation and still not being able to manage compromises like "read to the kid and work" just feels ridiculously absurd to me.\n\nBeyond that, the whole game just gets repetitive. Each time is walk around, find all the clues, making a fairly arbitrary choice, and then repeating the whole thing another dozen times. It wouldn't be so bad if that changed up location each time, but for being in that location the whole time, the limited scope and repetitive motions got tiresome. The controls for getting around also were pretty frustrating, as there's an interesting attempt at using lights as a way to jump from place to place in the house, but it really didn't work well and often got in the way. It really could have benefited from better control design, so that space wasn't required for everything, and sometimes even to carry out different actions on the same things.\n\nThe lasting disappointment for me is that there was an indication that there's an underlying backstory to the game that was never resolved, and hinted at something interesting. Instead, the game ended with a "where are they now" type ending that felt far too overblown, and stems from that same mindset going into the character backgrounds, that they can't just be moderately successful, but that it had to be to some grandiose extent. It just comes across as overdone, and not exploring something that could've had a lot more potential.\n\nReally couldn't recommend it, it drags along without packing much punch.","January 28, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ostrava/recommended/245150/","ostrava","Itharius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ostrava/","243 products in account","Allow me to preface my review with this: I very much enjoyed the time I spent with The Novelist and I think that it signifies a good first step for Orthogonal Games as a developer. However, I cannot recommend the game at full price (at the time of this review said price point is 14.99 USD).\n\n\nThe environment takes on a simplistic and limited asthetic, confining the player to the workspace of a small two story house. Despite the house's intended purpose being to signify a new beginning for Dan and his family I couldn't help but feel that the house was in someway devoid of life. My first instinct was to blame the very "samey" colour pallet that The Novelist employs. However, the more I think on it the more I believe it has to do with the fact that the characters simply do not interact with the environment around them; save for very minor things such as Dan using his typewritter. The house is a stage, but the actors refuse to make use of the props.\n\nThe system of making choices is thankfully simple, however, so too are the choices themselves. Many of the choices felt as though they were not meaningful in the long run. There were a few occasions where the choices did not conflict with eachother or could easily be done in conjunction with eachother; which is counterintuitive to the very idea of only being able to make one choice and a halfhearted compromise with another. As a result of the simplicity many of the choices outcomes, and indeed the overarching story's outcome, were entirely too predictable. In fact, the bits of story that I found most interesting were the short moments spent discovering the history of the house.\n\nThe stealth mechanic gets in the way of the game's strongest asset: The story. However, there is not enough occuring during the segments of the game where the player is allowed to freely roam that keep the game interesting without it.\n\nThe story, and indeed the writing itself, are of a simplistic nature and are somewhat interesting. However, the characters themselves felt more like fassades for the player to toy with than fully fledged individuals. As a result the story, at times, feels rather dull. There are interesting directions that the game could have been taken that were simply ignored or declined.\n\nOverall The Novleist culminated into an interesting and somewhat enjoyable experience. However, as stated above, I could not recommend it at full price. With a steep sale? Certainly.\n\n\nAnd as a personal aside: You absolutely do not have to be a parent to "get" this game. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from having a child of your own that you would not get otherwise. The greatest benefit I could see coming from having a child of your own would be a slightly stronger emotional connection with Dan. However, should you not be living a life blessed by comfort and ease at every turn, you should find it easy to make this same emotional connection if you do not have a child of your own. The most significant conflict in The Novelist is the act of balancing the many facets of a person's life, not the arbitrary ideals of what it is to be a parent.","January 4, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It captured this interesting feeling of being a phantom, watching others live their lives and dropping hints into it. The big flaw is the boring story, which lacked any meaningful conflict or stakes. I kept waiting for the writer to get too drunk and hit the kid, or the kid to set something on fire, or the wife to pick up heroin as a hobby that could enhance her art. None of that happened. It was a mostly vacuous story of very insipid lives. The most interesting thing was that one weekend the writer guy's friends might drop in while the artist wife's parents were in town, possibly down on their luck; the kid wanted to have a sleepover, too. I couldn't find how I could pick all of these to happen, so I went with the wife's parents stopping by, with the guy's friends on the side. The friends didn't come and the parents were pleasant, apparently loaded too. At least the snorefest happen offscreen. What a flaming giftbasket of upper middle class defecation. It's basically a fantasy game for poor writers who need a little wish fulfillment. I don't know if I should recommend it of not.

You walk through the house searching for clues to figure out the "dilemmas" of the family. Then you are able to read the thought of a person he has right in this moment and when you press Space you enter the person's mind and have to search for 3 memories he has. The game is split in 3 parts, which consists of 3 parts on their own.\nThe game even started nicely, he has a writing block, the boy got bullied in school and she, well makes everyone problems to hers. The choices in the beginning made sens and were connected together, so it was logical that choosing one, made the other not possible. But later into the game the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Not only you are annoyed of the whiny attitude of the man, no the choices were more and more on their own and choosing one didnt make the other impossible. But the developer found it okay, that choosing to help the boy, made it impossible for the woman to wear a sweater, who just lies on the very bed she is sitting on. And if that is not enough, she seriously gets upset because she "couldn't" wear the sweater and of course her mother calls, she "hears" that her daughter is upset, but well her mother is cheap and didnt want to talk about.......she not able to wear a ♥♥♥♥ING SWEATER.","December 17, 2014","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdlang/recommended/245150/","jdlang","Jonko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jdlang/","274 products in account","TL;DR: Not a particularly great or fun game, but an important step for storytelling in games nevertheless.\n\nThe Novelist is about a small family that temporarily moves to a rented house somewhere in the hinterlands to resolve several personal and professional conflicts. The player has to weigh their needs against each other and ideally find good compromises. The choices you get, however, seem contrived - I've frequently found that I could easily have come up with compromises that would have made everyone happy. This is not about the limitations inherent to branching storytelling, but about how few paths there were, and how they were implemented in a repetitive manner that left no room for actual creativity and problem solving.\nEven worse, throughout the whole experience I kept asking myself, "What's the point?" There are stories with such narrow scope (most of them stage plays, as The Novelist is essentially one) that actually manage to have some kind of significance, and through the small cast and their individual problems hint at greater social and cultural dynamics. Of course, it wouldn't be fair to compare this game to the works of authors like Tennessee Williams, but nevertheless, I was disappointed that The Novelist really has nothing to offer in this area. It's just an isolated story of three people and their very mundane problems that I found hard to empathize with. To be fair, it does introduce the conflict between family and art, but the way this was done feels forced and just not very 'alive'.\nSo, why am I recommending The Novelist? There simply are too few games that manage to implement a convincing proof of concept for the combination of story and gameplay. There are the Walking Simulators, and while I like those and the nonlinear storytelling they make possible, they are still very basic in terms of interactivity. Other attempts to implement more traditional gameplay in story-centric games often seem forced and ultimately ruin the experience for me.\nThe Novelist is, at its core, a stage play that lets the viewer participate. This concept has been implemented in actual plays (for example Night of January 16th by the infamous Ayn Rand, which had its premiere in 1934), but the medium of the computer game gives it more depth, and The Novelist hints at what might be possible. The ability to move through the scenery, watch the characters in their natural habitat, and make relatively complex choices (compared to a stage play, where the actors would have to memorize a separate script for each part) makes this an experience that wouldn't be possible in any other medium.\nDecades after the medium's invention, storytelling in games is still in its infancy, while we marvel at the ever prettier pictures, the cool explosions, and the realistic physics simulations. It's not that it's not possible, but that somehow, there are few developers who have the right mixture of courage and vision to live up to the medium's potential. The Novelist is a tiny step in this direction.","November 13, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not in a bad way, I'm just a deeply selfish person.  My wife and I would rather soend our money on holidays, games and cats than anything serious like bringing up a child.  What's the point of this surprisingly personal and seemingly irrelevant disclosure?  Well, despite my shortcomings as an adult human, I loved The Novelist.\n\nThe Novelist is a game that will mean something different to every person who plays it, depending on their point of view.  The way the game plays is that a small family have rented a house for the summer - the father sees it as an opportunity to work on his book, the wife sees it as a chance to rebuild their failing relationship and it is supposed to be a chance to address the problem the son has at school.  You play as a spirit that haunts the house and it is up to you to influence the father at the end of each day as to how to handle an event (or events) that will affect the family.  You do this by gathering information on each person's take on the event and coming to a conclusion as to how best to handle it.  Find every piece of information, and you will be allowed a compromise at the end of the day, meaning that one person will come away happy with the result, one placated and one potentially unhappy.\n\nThis is all simply done, and can be played as either a casual point and click style game of (admittedly limited) exploration, or as an stealth-lite game that has you trying to avoid the family seeing you, and thus becoming spooked and denying you the ability to come to a compromise with them.  Playing this way is actually quite engaging and adds a light air of tension added to by the lack of saves during the day, meaning you have to live with your decisions and mistakes.\n\nAlthough I found myself drawn to the characters, it wasn't necessarily through their actual interactions.  If anything, that would be the weakest part of the game.  The characters' personalities are all explored very well through diaries and journals, but doesn't come across in the world of the game.  It can be argued that it adds to the otherworldly feel to the game, but I think a lot would be added by the characters showing more... well... character.\n\nAnyway returning to my opening paragraph - I felt when I started the game that I would absolutely be on the father's side.  The game is called The Novelist, he is earning the money in the family and the house was rented to allow him to work on his book.  So, fine.  Cut and dried, let's get this book printed!  Well, no.  Reading the wife's personal thoughts and fears about how close to divorce they are without him realising was actually quite scary.\n\nOK.  Let's focus on the relationship and put the book on the sidelines, the kid will be fine.  The outcome of my first decision showed that the child was disappointed and I could live with that.  What I couldn't live with, was seeing him devastated at the next outcome screen.  So, well done, game!  I felt bad and went about actually making decisions for the good of the family as a whole.\n\nAs I played, it actually took me back to a holiday where my own father had to take time to study through it, something I haven't thought about in years, and realised that the developer absolutely nailed the scenario.  I actually found myself sympathetic towards each member in the family.  I wasn't working towards some winning gamestate at the end, but toward a scenario that would make everything OK for them all.  I was drawn in completely.\n\nI obviously had a deeply personal connection to the game, so would it stand up without that?  I don't see why not.  It is short enough that it can even make a nice talking point if you play with another person as well.\n\nOn the whole, it is easy to recommend this game - I won't deny that you need you need a degree of empathy and maturity to fully apreciate it, but that's no bad thing.","November 16, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not in a bad way, I'm just a deeply selfish person.  My wife and I would rather soend our money on holidays, games and cats than anything serious like bringing up a child.  What's the point of this surprisingly personal and seemingly irrelevant disclosure?  Well, despite my shortcomings as an adult human, I loved The Novelist.\n\nThe Novelist is a game that will mean something different to every person who plays it, depending on their point of view.  The way the game plays is that a small family have rented a house for the summer - the father sees it as an opportunity to work on his book, the wife sees it as a chance to rebuild their failing relationship and it is supposed to be a chance to address the problem the son has at school.  You play as a spirit that haunts the house and it is up to you to influence the father at the end of each day as to how to handle an event (or events) that will affect the family.  You do this by gathering information on each person's take on the event and coming to a conclusion as to how best to handle it.  Find every piece of information, and you will be allowed a compromise at the end of the day, meaning that one person will come away happy with the result, one placated and one potentially unhappy.\n\nThis is all simply done, and can be played as either a casual point and click style game of (admittedly limited) exploration, or as an stealth-lite game that has you trying to avoid the family seeing you, and thus becoming spooked and denying you the ability to come to a compromise with them.

Each chapter in the game presents the player with three desires, one for each member of the family, and you are asked to make a decision based on these desires. I personally enjoyed exploring the house to find all the clues to each family member and I also enjoyed going through their memories to learn more about the situation as well.\n\nHowever there are several problems I have with The Novelist, the chief one being that the story in and of itself isn't that interesting. It's a typical story, Dad wants to work on his novel, Mom wants to save the marriage and get back into a profession she had to give up when the kid arrived, and the kid wants to play with Dad and is struggling in school and is bullied. We've all seen stories that use these elements elsewhere, and they used them a lot better there. Another issue I had was that the individual chapters didn't seem to be all that connected. Each chapter felt more like variations of the same 3 or 4 issues and the decisions made in the previous chapter seemed to have little influence in other chapters.","April 17, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a depth that most of the big games just cannot obtain.\n\nYou play a "Ghost" who's only objective is to follow and learn about a family (Dan, Julia and Tommy) throughout their summer holiday. In doing so, you will learn about their wants and needs, through notes, diaries and by reading their minds. Then you have to make a choice about which option you wish to follow and by doing so, you impact the families life beyond the summer.\n\n\nI bought and played this game for the story and in doing so I found it a worthwhile play. Definitely worthy of the two awards it almost won, but sadly didn't.\n\nI do love how there is a comprimise option available, it allows you to give a quarter (i think) of "Dans" time to someone else without impacting the main choice (I'm glad it dosen't split it 50/50).\n\nThe ending I enjoyed, as it actually took into account the choices I had made throughout the course of the game and actually does tell you what everyone did with their lives post "Ghost" interference\n\n\nThe only things I had annoyances with about the game were first of all, Tommy's drawing (In his head). Even after I had spent a whole day doing what he wanted and another two days of a compromise it didn't change, he just seems to feel a little distant with Dan if you're not with him 24/7 (which may be what they learned after researching how children react to certain things, If so, I apologise to the creators).\n\nThe other annoying thing was Dans doors. In one mission I chose an option, which made Dan close his doors to work on his book. The part about this that annoyed me was that you can't walk through the doors, or jump to another light to bypass it, you're stuck waiting for him to come out and let you in. Or if you're unlucky you end up stuck in there waiting five minutes for him to open the door. Not a big one, just time consuming and slightly annoying.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nPros+\n+ A story that makes sense and is fun to experience\n+ Character interactions that are very believable\n+ Nice charming music\n+ A Branching story that effects the whole game (maybe only in subtile ways)\n+ Controls are simple (Only w,a,s,d for movement and space and e for interactions)\n\nCons-\n- No action or excitement, just a nice story.\n- The models aren't amazingly graphic (but really, they didn't have to be)\n- What people think in their heads about a situation are silly and sometimes foolish (but isn't that something all humans share)\n\nTotal Score = 9.5/10\n\nTo conclude, I would recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys a good story or an interactive story. My only negative that I can think of when recommending "The Novelist" is the price tag, $15 is a huge amount of money for a game that lasts no longer than possibly 2 hours. I would like to suggest that if the creators are reading these reviews, that they drop the price to maybe $10 or even $5. A little low I know and possibly stupid you may think, but sales will go down unless your prices do too, just a suggestion.\n\nOther than that, beautiful game, beautiful story.\n\n\nAnd FYI, yes my writing isn't the best and neither is my grammer, you don't need to tell me :P","April 20, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A huge fan of exploratory/narrative games, however, I did enjoy my 3-4 play-throughs of the game. It doesn't capture the voyeuristic feel quite as fully as Gone Home and doesn't have a story quite as deeply touching as Actual Sunlight; rather, The Novelist falls somewhere between the two as a somewhat memorable, very relatable, and surprisingly touching experience as a voyeur into regular family life. It's a decent game, and although it certainly isn't mind-blowing, it has enough to be worth a play or two.\n\nYou play as a spectre living in a house that the Kaplan family decides to move into for a summer. Essentially, you "ghost" around the house, reading minds and notes, and help the father (the Novelist) make decisions regarding his family. There really isn't much in the way of gameplay (other than a half-hearted and arguably useless stealth option), so the game could be seen as somewhat of a modern Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel. Where the game shines is how sincerely and authentically the writing in the game reads: in fact, by the end of a playthrough, you really do care about what happens to the relationship between the mother and the father. It's because of this emotional investment that I found myself playing the game through several times, wanting to find out what would happen to the mother if I did this, or that.\n\nOf course, while The Novelist did manage to get me emotionally invested (which, admittedly, is not a difficult task), it does fall short on a few too many things to be considered a memorable or truly laudable game. Off the top of my head, the game failed terribly at getting the audience to care about the child, the "stealth" mechanic was almost laughable and mostly obstructive, and several playthroughs of the game would reveal the endings to be somewhat shallow. Most importantly however, where the game could have been fantastic in its realism, it ended up backing itself into a corner by trying a little too hard. The problems Dan Kaplan faces that summer are very real, but by stressing that "the decisions Dan made that summer would come to define his life" (or something similar), The Novelist almost invites cynicism and throws away any chance it could have had at feeling truly authentic.\n\nAll in all, The Novelist is a decently good game for what it tries to be. Although nobody is likely to remember it a few years from now, it's a promising first foray into narrative indie game development for Kent Hudson.","April 22, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still has some good things in the game.\n\nThe game length was terribly short. I finished the game at only close to 2 hours and buying this game at about $10 does not seem to be all that reasonable (That is the discounted price. The original was close to $20 in SGD) and the gameplay becomes repetitive: Find clues for each character's desires, make a decision, see the outcome and then repeat again. It gets more boring and despite attempts to make things slightly more exciting, it only gives way to 1 or 2 intense moments.\n\nDespite that, the story line is extremely flexible. The story is right below, in the description. The rest of the story is pretty much in your own hands. Each decision will even make the character's thoughts or insights different and has the possibility of impacting the ending.\n\nWhat it does good as well as that it is impossible to balance the time and sacrifice is a need. When you make a decision, you affect others in a bad way. It actually forces you to keep questioning if whatever the character is doing is so important and whether another event is more important than the other. You will find yourself spending time on one of them and yet all at the same time, forsaking relationships.\n\n3.8/5 It's most unfortunate that the game's story cannot hold out the repetitiveness of the game and the length or it might have been better :/ Until the, get this game only at a discounted price. 75% discount would be better.","April 8, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A hypnotic, slow paced story about conflicting interests in a troubled relation. You get to choose their priorities and witness the fallout. It's most definitely not a game for kids. Though it lacks any kind of graphic detail, there's just no way kids can relate to this game. I did however find some objectionable aspects of the game. First of all, moving around the house is very, very slow. You can jump between light fixtures to speed things up, but having the simple option to move faster would make this game 200% better. Secondly, finding the items that tell the story can be frustratingly difficult at times. Thirdly, though the script is surprisingly complex, the characters are annoyingly self centered. For instance, Linda, the wife, does not seem to be working for the sake of taking care of little Tommy. She is economically dependent on Dan, the husband. Yet she cannot let him work to bring home the dough. If she had the option to be the breadwinner, this would be fine.

The message is apparently clear: if you want to fulfill your dreams, your descendents won't be heppy, and if you make them happy, you will have failed at your path, ensuring they will fail at theirs when their time as parents come in an eternal cycle of self-denial.\n\nOr not :) What remains is that you, the player/presence, whose actions touch so many, seen from time to time creeping right behind someone loved, whose presence is felt thoughout history and with the power to change the minds of the occupiers, you will still be alone and hiding, never really living a story of your own - not until you get out of the house.","December 2, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are actually given the freedom to compromise on tough decisions that most other games lack. There's enough variability that any two people who play this game are going to get different endings AND different experiences in getting there. As an added bonus, almost every decision is difficult. Your marriage is faultering right off the bat, your son is already struggling in school, and you're going to go broke if you don't do well with your novel. Every single decision matters, and the impacts are felt in the way the characters behave the rest of the game. When you fail you will feel it, even if you you were just trying to make the best possible decision at the time.\nUnfortunatly the actual game mechanics simply aren't fun. As a ghost that can jump from different light sources your movements are slow, interactivity is sparse, and the process of finding clues and memories is repetitive. The house is the only level in the game, and while there are changes to it based on past decisions oftentimes 'gameplay' winds up just being checking the same spots every day. Some rooms are so rarely utilized they just kind of sit there as window dressing. Few if any clues are genuinly hidden so there's no real sense of discovery in searching for them again. As interested as I am in trying different decisions and seeing different outcomes I really don't feel like slogging through the gameplay again to get to them.\nStill, the core concept works. As repetitive as the gameplay itself may be the decision making always feels like it matters and the game fulfills its promise in making sure it DOES matter, creating an emotional and personal connection beyond what most games can achieve. I'd still recommend the game, despite my qualms.","December 2, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of that time is spent crawling all over the same map, over and over again, searching for "clues" while trying not to get detected by the humans.

You find 135 bits of trash and make nine decisions, choosing each time from six possible alternatives. That is the entire "game;" much like To The Moon, this is a visual novel, not anything a normal person would describe as a game. Frankly, I don't see why this has gotten such accolades.\n\nThe execution is plodding to say the least; when I said most of your time will be spent "crawling" over the map, I wasn't kidding - the player's movement speed is agonizingly slow; learning to blink most effectively from one light fixture to the next is necessary just to pick up the pace a little.\n\nAs one tabletop gamer's wife once observed, "it's twenty minutes of fun packed into four hours."","April 29, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Coming out of the gate, it's an exhilarating storytelling experience that really gets you engage in the game. The chief issue is that the further you play, the more repetetive and almost rote the gameplay becomes. Add to that some fairly contrived-seeming conflicts of choice, and it falls a little short of the mark that it sets at its outset. However, that mark is so high that what you get instead is still a really worthwhile experience. Part of me wants to replay the game and see what different choices result in, but there's no way to do that quickly, so I'll have to wait until there's more time. I won't be surprised if I do some day return to it, though. If you have any interest at all in unique gameplay and game-based storytelling on a personal level (dealing with ordinary people's lives rather than having to guide the Chosen One to defeat the Emperor of All Evil), then you owe it to yourself to play this game.","April 30, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of iam a really really big fan of cel shading, love it. Then the gameplay, instead of the overpriced walking simulator you have actual stuff to do. You walk through the house searching for clues to figure out the "dilemmas" of the family. Then you are able to read the thought of a person he has right in this moment and when you press Space you enter the person's mind and have to search for 3 memories he has. The game is split in 3 parts, which consists of 3 parts on their own.\nThe game even started nicely, he has a writing block, the boy got bullied in school and she, well makes everyone problems to hers. The choices in the beginning made sens and were connected together, so it was logical that choosing one, made the other not possible. But later into the game the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Not only you are annoyed of the whiny attitude of the man, no the choices were more and more on their own and choosing one didnt make the other impossible. But the developer found it okay, that choosing to help the boy, made it impossible for the woman to wear a sweater, who just lies on the very bed she is sitting on. And if that is not enough, she seriously gets upset because she "couldn't" wear the sweater and of course her mother calls, she "hears" that her daughter is upset, but well her mother is cheap and didnt want to talk about.......she not able to wear a ♥♥♥♥ING SWEATER.","December 17, 2014","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A huge part of it is that it's tough to link to the sympathy of the character difficulties because its all based on what is, ultimately, feeling like some sort of rich/upper-class background where the choices center around one character a professional writer, one character wanting to be a professional artist, and the needs of their kid. The choices that have to get made at that point just start to feel ridiculous. Each week there's multiple days off, they're traveling to have a summer 'off' working, and so to be in that situation and still not being able to manage compromises like "read to the kid and work" just feels ridiculously absurd to me.\n\nBeyond that, the whole game just gets repetitive. Each time is walk around, find all the clues, making a fairly arbitrary choice, and then repeating the whole thing another dozen times. It wouldn't be so bad if that changed up location each time, but for being in that location the whole time, the limited scope and repetitive motions got tiresome. The controls for getting around also were pretty frustrating, as there's an interesting attempt at using lights as a way to jump from place to place in the house, but it really didn't work well and often got in the way. It really could have benefited from better control design, so that space wasn't required for everything, and sometimes even to carry out different actions on the same things.\n\nThe lasting disappointment for me is that there was an indication that there's an underlying backstory to the game that was never resolved, and hinted at something interesting. Instead, the game ended with a "where are they now" type ending that felt far too overblown, and stems from that same mindset going into the character backgrounds, that they can't just be moderately successful, but that it had to be to some grandiose extent. It just comes across as overdone, and not exploring something that could've had a lot more potential.\n\nReally couldn't recommend it, it drags along without packing much punch.","January 28, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are haunting the cabin of the blandest family possible. There is hardly any characterization or interaction in this story driven game. Your objective is to fufill the desires of one single person either the writer, the mother or the child. Once there desire is fufilled, it is revealed that the lives of the other two family members will take a negative turn; though it doesn't really matter to the player because of how generic each character is. Everyone is devoid of any personality whatsoever. The writer just mopes around never really writing a book the whole time he just fiddles around with an outline that isn't even finished. The mother paints unimpressive scenery. The child only scribbles crayon drawings of his father with himself either to the left or to the right of his father.\n\nOn the subject of interaction, there really is not any between the player and the world or for that fact the non playable characters and each other. Every character avoids everyone in the immediate area to the point that they have developed this anti social habit of leaving notes all over the cabin to communicate with eachother.\n\nGameplay consists of reading enough notes so you can use your ghost powers to read a persons mind so you can find a physical object. Once you find that object you finish the quest by entering a characters bedroom at night and whispering boring suggestions into there ears to influence them into living life in a predetermined way.\n\nGraphics are horrible. They remind me of this unfinished free game called "Facade" which is a much better game in every regard to "the novelist" and pretty much is the exact same type of game. The only difference is that Facade actually lets you interact with everything in the area and not only is there consequences for the NPC's but for the player as well. Which makes it a fun replayable game unlike the novelist.\n\nBottom line The Novelist is recommended for people who want to buy gifts for people they hate.\n\nRecommendations for people who want an actual game with a proper story and game play; "To The Moon" it's like a 16 bit RPG with puzzles instead of random turn based battles.","January 4, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, the game that carries this story is dull, repetitive, and mechanically simple.\n\nDan Kaplan is a writer who has taken his family on vacation in the hopes that the experience will allow him to overcome writers block.  Oh, and he also needs to save his marriage and connect with his son.  Some vacation!\n\nWhile the game never outright explains what you're playing as, the best label I can slap onto your role is 'Ghost'.  Besides traditional first person movement, you can possess lights, make them flicker, and seamlessly move from one light to another via a direct sight-line (similar to the security cameras in Watch_Dogs).  The Kaplans will get spooked if they see you, so you have to spend a lot of time hiding in the light fixtures.\n\nThis adds some very interesting stealth gameplay... provided you don't wuss out and pick the 'Story Mode', which renders you completely invisible to the Kaplans.  It's completely unnecessary, since I never once got spotted during my play-through.  The game does try to ramp up the difficulty a little by having some lights turned off in the later game, preventing you from using them and forcing you to actually foot it between certain rooms.  It's more of a minor annoyance than a major game changer, however.\n\nThe actual meat of the game involves you using your ghostly powers to guide choices made by Dan in regards to both working on his novel and spending time with his family.  Each chapter starts with a brief plot point, followed by you exploring the house for clues related to what each family member has on their mind.  The clues often take the shape of diaries, notes, drawings, letters...\n\nWould now be a bad time to point out that developer Kent Hudson worked on Bioshock 2?\n\nYou also have to collect memories from characters.  Doing so requires you to get into their heads, which you do by getting sneaking up and possessing them.  Once inside, you explore... the exact same house, except now you don't have to worry about getting spotted while looking for yet more clues (now in the form of the actual characters, frozen in time).\n\nOnce you acquire all the clues and memories related to a character, you'll find out what they want, and can then complete the chapter by finding a specified object and whispering a suggestion into Dans ear while he sleeps.  If you're a real keener (and managed to avoid spooking them), you can find out what one or both of the other characters want, which will give you the option of reaching a compromise.  This allows you to satisfy two characters, while only leaving one disappointed.\n\nThe entire process starts to become routine by the third act.  You evade detection, collect clues, search for memories, and then make a choice.  Repeat for each of the nine chapters.  You can always rely on clues being concentrated in the same few rooms, often on the same desks and tables, so you never have to look too hard.  By the seventh act I was just looking forward to the game ending.  Not a good sign.\n\nWait a second...\n\nEntire game takes place within a single house.\nMajority of gameplay is reading diaries and letters.\nFormer Bioshock 2 developer.\n\nThis is Gone Home, but with actual gameplay!

Each chapter in the game presents the player with three desires, one for each member of the family, and you are asked to make a decision based on these desires. I personally enjoyed exploring the house to find all the clues to each family member and I also enjoyed going through their memories to learn more about the situation as well.\n\nHowever there are several problems I have with The Novelist, the chief one being that the story in and of itself isn't that interesting. It's a typical story, Dad wants to work on his novel, Mom wants to save the marriage and get back into a profession she had to give up when the kid arrived, and the kid wants to play with Dad and is struggling in school and is bullied. We've all seen stories that use these elements elsewhere, and they used them a lot better there. Another issue I had was that the individual chapters didn't seem to be all that connected. Each chapter felt more like variations of the same 3 or 4 issues and the decisions made in the previous chapter seemed to have little influence in other chapters.","April 17, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, you'd have to be really silly to actually get punished for failing to do a good job with the gameplay, I feel. Still, it's enough to keep you actually playing the game while watching the story unravel according to your actions.\nThe game highlights some of the same existencial issues that 'To the Lighthouse' does: it highlights family and relationship issues in day-to-day living, and the problems balancing work with the two. It also shows that the lives of all people invovled are transient and fleeting, and all that's left of us afterwards is our art: whether it be the books we write or the paintings we craft. The shared symbol of the lighthouse and some of the shared activities of both families gives them both the same ambiance, I felt.\nRegardless, definitely look into this one, as it leaves you something to learn and ponder about your own life.","November 22, 2014","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You won't find another diamond like this one.\n\nPros:\n1) The story and theme are crafted to perfection. Everything makes logical sense. The characters are simple to understand and grasp. You're intrigued at every time whether it's by curiousity, suspense, hard choices, and/or personal reactions to the result. There are backstories that don't affect the main one which increase morals taught and entertainment. I personally joyed over the latter effect obviously. To avoid spoilers, I won't go further.\n2) The graphics are great and there is no lag. Even though the game itself is more important than graphics, this can be a good plus.\n3) The controls feel comfortable and reasonable.\n4) Anyone who aided in making this creation seemed well credited especially advisors and programs.\n\nCons (Sorta?):\n1) The stealth may feel repetitious if you're not interested into the story, but I must say it's a bit fun, and it makes sense when the video game is based more on story than sneaking; otherwise, it wouldn't have been as great. A harder challenge feels worse with a terrible reward.\n2) It involved a lot of reading, but I definitely enjoyed myself when the pace was mixed with stealth.\n\nOverall, I have no regrets. If you want to hear an excellent story while pacing the reading with sneaking, buy this game. In the case that you are purely looking for a stealth game challenge, then I would reconsider. I hope the dev continues making games as great as this one, and even if he didn't, at least he created The Novelist.","November 9, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed the compromise system because it added a little weight to the game that otherwise would have been too simple.\n\nThat said the constrains of the gameplay system made it difficult for me to relate to the Kaplan family. Unfortunately it ended up making them all a bit unsympathetic. For example, I would think in a real family when the mother's relative passes away unexpectedly, your child wouldn't respond to a change in plans with a screaming and crying fit, especially not at ten years old. Also I didn't understand why Mom and Child couldn't leave Dad alone until his novel was done. The deadline is set and it will be a finite project, so stop asking him to play and all that until he's done! Or when you have the option of taking the kid to a fair, the mom on a trail hike, or dad to a campfire. The mom goes on the hike if you don't compromise with her, but she twists her ankle and isn't able to complete it. This makes her angry. It just felt way too codependent to me then, like go on the hike by yourself and enjoy it!

Most of the gameplay is just going from lamp to lamp, going around the house without being spotted, though there's also an option to turn it off and just play for the story. Either works fine though you might want to have it off as while the stealth mechanic is immersive, it's mostly a way of keeping it more interactive which is weak enough already. It lives in an interesting fashion in this way.\n\nThe story itself is much stronger as you have to make small decisions which will help Dan with his writing career, keep his marriage together, and put some time aside for their son as well. If you spend time learning about the whole story you can make some good decisions, though more often than not you'll have to make painful compromises leaving few happy though proper planning and reaction can bring a happy ending for all three members of the family. I didn't, but I got close. All the while rather sad atmospheric piano music plays in the background making everything a lot harder than it needs to be. Oh, and every playthrough randomizes the different events that occur in the household which livens things up a bit.\n\nSo overall it's a good interesting engrossing yet short game.

On the other hand, the story difficulty has no difficulty at all, and it feels like the game is missing a component, so I recommend that people choose the stealth difficulty.\n\nThe game is very similar to games like Gone Home (well, to be honest, I suppose these two games sort of form a genre, as I can't think of any other games like these).\n\nThe game tells a story. You can slightly affect the story, but the actual gameplay is simply to explore the story.\n\nUnlike in gone home, you have some influence in this game, and need to make some decisions.

At its very core, it is a game about choice that defies simplistic morality models ("tap the blue text to be GOOD, tap the red text to be EEEEVIL").\n\nWith apologies to excellent games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, the decisions you are presented with in The Novelist cut against such black and white notions of the world. Each choice you are faced with is microcosmic. Each one lacks that "save the world or watch it burn!" weight that seems second nature to games. Not that this nature is bad. I only say this to bring attention to the fact that, while the decisions in The Novelist appear on the surface to be so small-scale, they feel incredibly impactful. This game is, on many levels, proof that the big, dramatic moral decisions in many choose-your-morality video games today are the EASY decisions.\n\nOn another level, this is a game about..playing a game. Rather than take on the central characters as avatars, you float around in a demi-god mode, critically affecting their lives as you go. This distance between you and the characters is brave in and of itself because playing through that distanced demi-god mode makes you choose just how close to or estranged from these characters you wish to be.\n\nMechanically, the game is sound and easy to control. The eccentricities of the challenge involved in "stealth mode" (where you must go undetected by the family) do not impede enjoyment of the game (it is always very fair). The voice acting is not amazing, but it is good. And the art style is pleasant to look at without obvious glitches or whatsthats that might pull you out of the game.","January 9, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The decision to do anything in life is at the expense of countless other potential activities, which is the fundamental struggle I deal with while playing video games all the time. Where will you invest your free time? Your writer's block? Your broken marriage? Your needy son? You can't do it all.\n\nThe Novelist is a game about family, priorities, and compromise.\n\nPerhaps the game's most brilliant coup is casting you in the role of a ghost. It would be easy and incorrect to assume that the player character is the novelist himself. You, the ghost, work behind the scenes as an observer of the experience and can only help to influence the thoughts of the novelist. You the Player decide where he invests his time, and that decision (made at the end of each chapter by whispering suggestions into his ear while he sleeps) affects his wife, his son, and his career.\n\nWhy is this so brilliant? It's a question of agency. If you controlled the novelist directly, you might get frustrated by the family's inability to communicate successfully. In fact, you might feel that frustration anyway, since each character begins the game with wildly different needs. "Aren't I working on my career for the sake of my family?" you might ask yourself as the novelist. "Can't my family accept that a few months to myself will pay off in the long term?" "Why can't I make compromises that please everybody?" "Why can't my wife and son spend time together without me?" These are all valid questions....but you are not the novelist. You are just a ghost. This is the rare game where your limitations as a player work within the context of your character, and your limited and indirect effect on the game world makes total sense.\n\nIn the end, while you can only set the stage and watch it unfold, the way the game makes you think remains powerfully human. How do I take care of my family? How do I balance my goals and their needs?\n\nWhat will make me a happy person?","January 19","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The husband is the titular novelist, the wife is attempting to get back into painting and their young son  has a slight learning disability . Both the child and wife wish to have more family time (amongst other things), whereas the dad is under pressure to complete his current novel in an attempt to meet deadlines. There are also many other events that happen (all narrated via text or background image+text) but I won't go into those to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe basic gameplay is fairly simple:\nTeleporting from one active lamp to another (stealth) in your field of view. This is disabled is the difficulty mode called Story. You are suggested to be stealthy so that you have increased story options.\nGoing into people's memories to encounter small "clues" regarding what the character wants.\nInvestigate different objects in the household such as reading notes, diary entries and seeing drawings made by the little boy.\nMaking choices regarding whose desired outcome should play out (the husband's, wife's or child's). There is also an additional option for compromise on one of these outcomes (I think this is not available if you are seen by the family member, but I'm not too sure because I was never detected). The compromise is not always a positive thing, so it feels like a different option not just a second desirable outcome that makes one more family member happy.\nAt night--when everybody is asleep--you can explore the house for clues related to it's past. This is always in the form of diaries or notes that glow.\nWhat I liked: The story choices have some genuine emotional impact, at least for me. You may read some of the other reviews which do not agree with mne on this front.\nThe gameplay is simplistic without making small mistakes like too many collectibles, over-dramatic scenes, frustrating/inconsistent stealth mechanics. Some of the other reviewers had issues with bugs but I didn't have any issues (I have completed the game once).\nThe voice acting is very good, and most (if not all) the notes and diary entries are narrated if you enable that option.\nThe Story mode difficulty option is a good choice if you want to introduce the game to a non-gamer.\nWhat I misliked:\nThe characters do not have any real in-game chatter/conversations. This was a real bummer but I can understand why this decision was made; if you are in another room, you cannot see the body language of the characters as they talk.\nThe short story arcs of the history of the house do not really tie in to the main story and are way too short to evoke a genuine response. While the shortness is explained in the context of the story (the house has cheap rent and few takers because of its past tenants' short stays), I think that the brevity robs the stories of genuine emotional impact.\nThe gameplay gets repititive after the 2-hour mark or so. Thankfully the game doesn't overstay its welcome by much.\nOther notes:\nThe "About This Game" says that: The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself. While ymmv, I think this was true in my case. There is no one solution makes everybody happy (in a family) and this comes out beautifully in the game.\nI think at the end of the game, you should have been shown a tree showing the branching decisions you've made and the results of each so that you can look at the ending in a clearer context.","December 20, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You come in as Casper the friendly ghost who solves all their problems and yet they still act like spoilt brats and pout all day. In the end there's no real sense of completion since you know they'll just basically go back home and make each other miserable again.\nIf playing God is what you're into, go get yourself a copy of the Sims.

Story Cliches and Unlikable Characters Abound.Genre: 1st Person Exploration Narrative Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Orthogonal Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nWhile this particular title dodged my radar last year, I gave it a try this year after seeing a review of it and being intrigued by it. Controlling a ghost following around a family and giving them directions on their life seemed like a pretty good idea for a videogame to explore. But was the execution solid? Read on.\n\nOverall Gameplay\nEach day is repetitive stream of the same tasks with slightly different flavor text. (Gather clues about what’s bothering each family member, see their memories then choose which solution you think is best all while avoiding being detected). The stealth is basic and is more a chore than fun as you just jump from light fixture to other light fixture, getting out of them only briefly to read some more text. The game even lets you turn the need for stealth off which I would recommend doing, if the story itself was more interesting.\n\nMy main problem with the story is that it uses way too many cliches with too many forced emotional scenes. To the point of finding myself detesting the game the longer I played it. There are choices that get way too unrealistic. There’s one part where a grandmother dies and the Novelist has to make the choice to either go to a book signing or go to the funeral to support his wife. The company he works for claims they can’t reschedule the book signing and that it would be very bad for him to miss it. I...I have a really hard time believing that they couldn't reschedule it due to a family member’s death. Even if I could buy that being a real situation, there’s another example that I found downright silly. It boils down to: Wife wants to camp far away and Son wants to camp close by. And if you don’t choose correctly, someone’s unhappy. What?! That’s like whining about getting two chocolate cookies instead of three. It feels like it was put in just to get an emotional reaction where all I could think is: “these are some real narcissistic people”.\n\nCharacter flaws\nWhich is then followed by the worst problem this game has: we don’t have well fleshed out characters here. They are nothing but cliches. Despite spending quite a few intimate hours with them, I didn’t get any real connection with them.  There’s a writer who’s suffering from writer’s block. There’s a mother who wants to be an artist again. There’s a son being a generic kid. That’s all I remember about them. I will admit, that having cliche characters for us to project ourselves onto them may have been intentional game design. But I find it to be the experience to be less for it.\n\nPC Settings\nMost of the PC settings are there. You’ve got resolution, AA, V-Sync, subtitles, difficulty and voiceover reading if wanted. Graphically, the game isn’t all that impressive. It’s a weird pseudo CGI/Realistic style that is somehow lacking in detail. If it’s intentional, I’m not a fan of it. The soundtrack is a “depressing” solo piano that tries to bring emotional oomph to the game. However, it falls into the cliche area of soundtrack design and comes off as extremely flat when I played it. The game’s coding is solid, there weren’t any bugs, errors or crashes during my playthrough.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI have a hard time recommending this game. I’ve already hammered on the story quite a bit but I didn’t dig the cliche story, the cliche characters and I definitely hated the forced emotional moments caused by no-win choices by overly narcissistic characters. If you’re in a similar situation to the Novelist (struggling artist with a family), the game might speak to you and you might get something out of it. Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 7, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're basically a ghost in a house where a family moves in for the summer, and you can 'strongly suggest' what path should be chosen by whispering to the people in their sleep. Each day you can only satisfy one desire, and optionally try to find a midway solution for one other person, leaving the last one frustrated.\n\nThe writing is all too realistic in representing the fight to try to balance a carreer and a family, dreams and immediate needs, aspirations and desires. You are facing writer's block on a deadline. Your son wants attention and needs support no to fall behind in school and have enough self esteem not to get bullied all the time. Your wife is looking for an outlet for her artistic ambitions as well. So little time...\n\nMechanically you listen to them, see their memories, find enough elements to be able to make an impact on their decisions while they sleep. There's not so much "gameplay" in here except basic exploration of the same little house each day, unless you enable the mode where they can see you and you have to keep hidden behind them or in the lamps. I have not tried it but that sounded really annoying so I stayed in purely story mode when you're totally invisible to the humans around.\n\nThis game can be haunting, especially if you're an adult with kids.

Gameplay-wise this means finding letters and memories to find out what each family member wants and then finding a specific item in order to fulfil that want. However, you can only please one person each time, compromising with one other which results in there always being a third that doesn’t get their wish. Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay, this becomes very repetitive, quickly turning into a hidden object style game. Where the game hooks you though is from the responses of your actions from each character. Each action’s consequence can be felt emotionally from them and a connection between them and the player is formed. As this is seemingly a rather rare occurrence within the medium, this was a delightful thing to happen. Hopefully future videogames can draw on this and help to create more connections between their players and the characters in their game.\n\nThe small scale of the story and the before-mentioned repetitive gameplay will put many off, but for those that can look past those points then there is something worth experiencing here.\n\nRead My Other Reviews\nCheck Out My Curator Page","October 10, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Help Dan decide… if he even decides at all, or is it just you putting ideas there?\n\nA short, fast game but definitely worth a replay to see how things would turn out differently when you favour one character over another.\n\n7/10\n\nI wouldn’t say it’s worth $17 CAD but a good game to get on sale!\n","July 20, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Coming out of the gate, it's an exhilarating storytelling experience that really gets you engage in the game. The chief issue is that the further you play, the more repetetive and almost rote the gameplay becomes. Add to that some fairly contrived-seeming conflicts of choice, and it falls a little short of the mark that it sets at its outset. However, that mark is so high that what you get instead is still a really worthwhile experience. Part of me wants to replay the game and see what different choices result in, but there's no way to do that quickly, so I'll have to wait until there's more time. I won't be surprised if I do some day return to it, though. If you have any interest at all in unique gameplay and game-based storytelling on a personal level (dealing with ordinary people's lives rather than having to guide the Chosen One to defeat the Emperor of All Evil), then you owe it to yourself to play this game.","April 30, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play some sort of ghost or spirit that inhabits a house which a writer named Dan and his wife and son rent for the summer so that Dan can focus on working on his next book.  The game is divided into several chapters as the spirit you have to move throughout the house reading letters, reading the family members thoughts and exploring their memories to find out the desires of each family member. You do all this while trying to remain undetected (though if you want to focus on the story you can turn the requirement for stealth off).\n\nWhen you've uncovered each family members desire you have to pick one and whisper it to Dan so it is acted upon. The family member who's desire you picked will be happy but the other two will not. At the end of the chapter after you've made your choice you get to see the outcomes on each character and it is quite difficult to see the negative outcomes as you do end up feeling sorry for them. It's a pity the game doesn't have more solutions that would satisfy more than one character so your decision can become an agonizing choice.\n\nThe real strength of this game is the story it weaves about the family. You get to know each character and how they feel through their memories and the letters you read and while the story this game tells about them is the typical trials and tribulations of a family, it's done so well that you do end up caring about them and that makes the choices you make that bit more agonizing.\n\nThe only downside of this game is that the exploration side where you move about the house trying to find letters and look through the families memories gets boring after a short while as it gets repetitive doing more less the same thing in every chapter.\n\nOverall though this is a great story based games that will please people who enjoyed games like Gone Home and Dear Esther. It's a 7/10 from me.","February 19, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it straight through, and I won't tell you the ending I received, but it's probably obvious.  I would imagine that Jesus had to take time for himself.

Sadly, the game that carries this story is dull, repetitive, and mechanically simple.\n\nDan Kaplan is a writer who has taken his family on vacation in the hopes that the experience will allow him to overcome writers block.  Oh, and he also needs to save his marriage and connect with his son.  Some vacation!\n\nWhile the game never outright explains what you're playing as, the best label I can slap onto your role is 'Ghost'.  Besides traditional first person movement, you can possess lights, make them flicker, and seamlessly move from one light to another via a direct sight-line (similar to the security cameras in Watch_Dogs).  The Kaplans will get spooked if they see you, so you have to spend a lot of time hiding in the light fixtures.\n\nThis adds some very interesting stealth gameplay... provided you don't wuss out and pick the 'Story Mode', which renders you completely invisible to the Kaplans.  It's completely unnecessary, since I never once got spotted during my play-through.  The game does try to ramp up the difficulty a little by having some lights turned off in the later game, preventing you from using them and forcing you to actually foot it between certain rooms.  It's more of a minor annoyance than a major game changer, however.\n\nThe actual meat of the game involves you using your ghostly powers to guide choices made by Dan in regards to both working on his novel and spending time with his family.  Each chapter starts with a brief plot point, followed by you exploring the house for clues related to what each family member has on their mind.  The clues often take the shape of diaries, notes, drawings, letters...\n\nWould now be a bad time to point out that developer Kent Hudson worked on Bioshock 2?\n\nYou also have to collect memories from characters.  Doing so requires you to get into their heads, which you do by getting sneaking up and possessing them.  Once inside, you explore... the exact same house, except now you don't have to worry about getting spotted while looking for yet more clues (now in the form of the actual characters, frozen in time).\n\nOnce you acquire all the clues and memories related to a character, you'll find out what they want, and can then complete the chapter by finding a specified object and whispering a suggestion into Dans ear while he sleeps.  If you're a real keener (and managed to avoid spooking them), you can find out what one or both of the other characters want, which will give you the option of reaching a compromise.  This allows you to satisfy two characters, while only leaving one disappointed.\n\nThe entire process starts to become routine by the third act.  You evade detection, collect clues, search for memories, and then make a choice.  Repeat for each of the nine chapters.  You can always rely on clues being concentrated in the same few rooms, often on the same desks and tables, so you never have to look too hard.  By the seventh act I was just looking forward to the game ending.  Not a good sign.\n\nWait a second...\n\nEntire game takes place within a single house.\nMajority of gameplay is reading diaries and letters.\nFormer Bioshock 2 developer.\n\nThis is Gone Home, but with actual gameplay!

Most of that time is spent crawling all over the same map, over and over again, searching for "clues" while trying not to get detected by the humans. In nine chapters, you will search one single confined map as many as 36 times for roughly 135 clues - and that's the entire game. You find 135 bits of trash and make nine decisions, choosing each time from six possible alternatives. That is the entire "game;" much like To The Moon, this is a visual novel, not anything a normal person would describe as a game. Frankly, I don't see why this has gotten such accolades.\n\nThe execution is plodding to say the least; when I said most of your time will be spent "crawling" over the map, I wasn't kidding - the player's movement speed is agonizingly slow; learning to blink most effectively from one light fixture to the next is necessary just to pick up the pace a little.\n\nAs one tabletop gamer's wife once observed, "it's twenty minutes of fun packed into four hours."","April 29, 2014","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The husband is the titular novelist, the wife is attempting to get back into painting and their young son  has a slight learning disability . Both the child and wife wish to have more family time (amongst other things), whereas the dad is under pressure to complete his current novel in an attempt to meet deadlines. There are also many other events that happen (all narrated via text or background image+text) but I won't go into those to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe basic gameplay is fairly simple:\nTeleporting from one active lamp to another (stealth) in your field of view. This is disabled is the difficulty mode called Story. You are suggested to be stealthy so that you have increased story options.\nGoing into people's memories to encounter small "clues" regarding what the character wants.\nInvestigate different objects in the household such as reading notes, diary entries and seeing drawings made by the little boy.\nMaking choices regarding whose desired outcome should play out (the husband's, wife's or child's). There is also an additional option for compromise on one of these outcomes (I think this is not available if you are seen by the family member, but I'm not too sure because I was never detected). The compromise is not always a positive thing, so it feels like a different option not just a second desirable outcome that makes one more family member happy.\nAt night--when everybody is asleep--you can explore the house for clues related to it's past. This is always in the form of diaries or notes that glow.\nWhat I liked: The story choices have some genuine emotional impact, at least for me. You may read some of the other reviews which do not agree with mne on this front.\nThe gameplay is simplistic without making small mistakes like too many collectibles, over-dramatic scenes, frustrating/inconsistent stealth mechanics. Some of the other reviewers had issues with bugs but I didn't have any issues (I have completed the game once).\nThe voice acting is very good, and most (if not all) the notes and diary entries are narrated if you enable that option.\nThe Story mode difficulty option is a good choice if you want to introduce the game to a non-gamer.\nWhat I misliked:\nThe characters do not have any real in-game chatter/conversations. This was a real bummer but I can understand why this decision was made; if you are in another room, you cannot see the body language of the characters as they talk.\nThe short story arcs of the history of the house do not really tie in to the main story and are way too short to evoke a genuine response. While the shortness is explained in the context of the story (the house has cheap rent and few takers because of its past tenants' short stays), I think that the brevity robs the stories of genuine emotional impact.\nThe gameplay gets repititive after the 2-hour mark or so. Thankfully the game doesn't overstay its welcome by much.\nOther notes:\nThe "About This Game" says that: The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself. While ymmv, I think this was true in my case. There is no one solution makes everybody happy (in a family) and this comes out beautifully in the game.\nI think at the end of the game, you should have been shown a tree showing the branching decisions you've made and the results of each so that you can look at the ending in a clearer context.","December 20, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A huge part of it is that it's tough to link to the sympathy of the character difficulties because its all based on what is, ultimately, feeling like some sort of rich/upper-class background where the choices center around one character a professional writer, one character wanting to be a professional artist, and the needs of their kid. The choices that have to get made at that point just start to feel ridiculous. Each week there's multiple days off, they're traveling to have a summer 'off' working, and so to be in that situation and still not being able to manage compromises like "read to the kid and work" just feels ridiculously absurd to me.\n\nBeyond that, the whole game just gets repetitive. Each time is walk around, find all the clues, making a fairly arbitrary choice, and then repeating the whole thing another dozen times. It wouldn't be so bad if that changed up location each time, but for being in that location the whole time, the limited scope and repetitive motions got tiresome. The controls for getting around also were pretty frustrating, as there's an interesting attempt at using lights as a way to jump from place to place in the house, but it really didn't work well and often got in the way. It really could have benefited from better control design, so that space wasn't required for everything, and sometimes even to carry out different actions on the same things.\n\nThe lasting disappointment for me is that there was an indication that there's an underlying backstory to the game that was never resolved, and hinted at something interesting. Instead, the game ended with a "where are they now" type ending that felt far too overblown, and stems from that same mindset going into the character backgrounds, that they can't just be moderately successful, but that it had to be to some grandiose extent. It just comes across as overdone, and not exploring something that could've had a lot more potential.\n\nReally couldn't recommend it, it drags along without packing much punch.","January 28, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Typical Hallmark-esque tribulations of a fading marriage, childhood innocence, and a writer-protagonist so stereotypical that leaves the player wondering how boring the actual writer of this narrative actually is files this sappy indie title under "do something else with your morning".\n\nWhat's more, The Novelist serves as an example of why game mechanics simply cannot be bolted onto a story and the final build be thus christened a Game. It's odd that the designer opted for a "spectral" approach to experiencing the narrative. In other words, why is the player banished to look on the game's character as a non-character herself? The shoddy "novel within a novel" justification for the third person gameplay decision at the game's conclusion is a poor one at best.\n\nI'll save you yelling the "so-♥♥♥♥ing what?!" question at your monitor and instead, tell you to throw your extra burrito money at The Fullbright Company.","June 28, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the gameplay is just going from lamp to lamp, going around the house without being spotted, though there's also an option to turn it off and just play for the story. Either works fine though you might want to have it off as while the stealth mechanic is immersive, it's mostly a way of keeping it more interactive which is weak enough already. It lives in an interesting fashion in this way.\n\nThe story itself is much stronger as you have to make small decisions which will help Dan with his writing career, keep his marriage together, and put some time aside for their son as well. If you spend time learning about the whole story you can make some good decisions, though more often than not you'll have to make painful compromises leaving few happy though proper planning and reaction can bring a happy ending for all three members of the family. I didn't, but I got close. All the while rather sad atmospheric piano music plays in the background making everything a lot harder than it needs to be. Oh, and every playthrough randomizes the different events that occur in the household which livens things up a bit.\n\nSo overall it's a good interesting engrossing yet short game. If you feel on the ropes about it you should probably wait for a sale. Otherwise it's definately worth a play/read.","July 1, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story Cliches and Unlikable Characters Abound.Genre: 1st Person Exploration Narrative Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Orthogonal Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nWhile this particular title dodged my radar last year, I gave it a try this year after seeing a review of it and being intrigued by it. Controlling a ghost following around a family and giving them directions on their life seemed like a pretty good idea for a videogame to explore. But was the execution solid? Read on.\n\nOverall Gameplay\nEach day is repetitive stream of the same tasks with slightly different flavor text. (Gather clues about what’s bothering each family member, see their memories then choose which solution you think is best all while avoiding being detected). The stealth is basic and is more a chore than fun as you just jump from light fixture to other light fixture, getting out of them only briefly to read some more text. The game even lets you turn the need for stealth off which I would recommend doing, if the story itself was more interesting.\n\nMy main problem with the story is that it uses way too many cliches with too many forced emotional scenes. To the point of finding myself detesting the game the longer I played it. There are choices that get way too unrealistic. There’s one part where a grandmother dies and the Novelist has to make the choice to either go to a book signing or go to the funeral to support his wife. The company he works for claims they can’t reschedule the book signing and that it would be very bad for him to miss it. I...I have a really hard time believing that they couldn't reschedule it due to a family member’s death. Even if I could buy that being a real situation, there’s another example that I found downright silly. It boils down to: Wife wants to camp far away and Son wants to camp close by. And if you don’t choose correctly, someone’s unhappy. What?! That’s like whining about getting two chocolate cookies instead of three. It feels like it was put in just to get an emotional reaction where all I could think is: “these are some real narcissistic people”.\n\nCharacter flaws\nWhich is then followed by the worst problem this game has: we don’t have well fleshed out characters here. They are nothing but cliches. Despite spending quite a few intimate hours with them, I didn’t get any real connection with them.  There’s a writer who’s suffering from writer’s block. There’s a mother who wants to be an artist again. There’s a son being a generic kid. That’s all I remember about them. I will admit, that having cliche characters for us to project ourselves onto them may have been intentional game design. But I find it to be the experience to be less for it.\n\nPC Settings\nMost of the PC settings are there. You’ve got resolution, AA, V-Sync, subtitles, difficulty and voiceover reading if wanted. Graphically, the game isn’t all that impressive. It’s a weird pseudo CGI/Realistic style that is somehow lacking in detail. If it’s intentional, I’m not a fan of it. The soundtrack is a “depressing” solo piano that tries to bring emotional oomph to the game. However, it falls into the cliche area of soundtrack design and comes off as extremely flat when I played it. The game’s coding is solid, there weren’t any bugs, errors or crashes during my playthrough.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI have a hard time recommending this game. I’ve already hammered on the story quite a bit but I didn’t dig the cliche story, the cliche characters and I definitely hated the forced emotional moments caused by no-win choices by overly narcissistic characters. If you’re in a similar situation to the Novelist (struggling artist with a family), the game might speak to you and you might get something out of it. Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","March 7, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The family are good people, but they've got problems.  Your job is to try to figure out what's going on in their lives and subtly influence their story by whispering to Dan (the dad) in his sleep to influence his decisions.  Then you get to see what happens.  Will you be able to keep their troubled marriage from falling apart?  Will their son grow up to be happy and well-adjusted?  It's up to you.\n\nThe coolest thing about the decisions you make, is that they are seldom "good" and "bad."  Like in life, you've got to set priorities.  What's more important: Dan's career or spending time with his son?  Letting Dan's wife pursue her passion or letting his son pursue his?  It's impossible to make everyone happy, and you'll have to make decisions that make you a little sad.\n\nPros:\n* Unique.  It's nice to play something different once in a while.\n* Story-driven with lots of depth and realism\n* Like watching a movie where you get to influence the character's actions\n* There's a certain hard-to-describe beauty about the whole game and experience\n\nCons:\n* Could be boring for more active gamers.  This is **not** an action-packed game.  It's about story.  This can partially be helped by playing on Stealth mode, which means you have to stay hidden so that the family doesn't know they have a ghost, but even so the game requires patience and thinking, not button mashing.\n* The mechanics do start to get repetitive, as every chapter follows the same formula.\n* The game is quite short.

After that you probably have a good idea what happens to different people if you choose to change who you help, and I don't think it would be worth tediously replaying the game to look at the different outcomes. Not the strongest recommendation, but at the same time it's not a bad game for what it is.","June 13, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like this method of story telling, and it was nice to have an effect on the story itself. The character's concerns made sense, and I was particularly interested in the history of the ghost that you play as. That said, I'm not sure it did all that it could have with the concept. I didn't feel super connected to the characters as people, which made the whole puppetteer of their lives thing a little weird for me. Plus, as a person who's played Gone Home, I know that the digging through people's things method of storytelling can be done so much better than this. By the end, finding the clues became more annoying than exciting, and very rarely were they illuminating enough to feel worth it. There was at least one chapter where the inability to make everyone ok with the situation didn't make much sense to me. I got this from a Humble Bundle that I only spent a dollar on so in that sense I'm totally happy with it. It was nice to float around helping someone get their life together as a break from real life, but I cannot say I would spend more than a couple bucks on this. I did not play on stealth mode though so maybe it's a more interesting mechanic when you're trying to hide from the Kaplans.","June 13, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Typical Hallmark-esque tribulations of a fading marriage, childhood innocence, and a writer-protagonist so stereotypical that leaves the player wondering how boring the actual writer of this narrative actually is files this sappy indie title under "do something else with your morning".\n\nWhat's more, The Novelist serves as an example of why game mechanics simply cannot be bolted onto a story and the final build be thus christened a Game. It's odd that the designer opted for a "spectral" approach to experiencing the narrative. In other words, why is the player banished to look on the game's character as a non-character herself? The shoddy "novel within a novel" justification for the third person gameplay decision at the game's conclusion is a poor one at best.\n\nI'll save you yelling the "so-♥♥♥♥ing what?!" question at your monitor and instead, tell you to throw your extra burrito money at The Fullbright Company.","June 28, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/245150/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","The Novelist is a game that falls into that bucket of games that aren't exactly interactive experiences like Dear Esther, but still not nearly as involved gameplay wise as the majority of mainstream FPS games.  The title sees you patrolling the Summer home of a frustrated author and his single unit family as some sort of "presence" or "ghost".  There are two distinct game "difficulties", in the first you can patrol the house on foot (I assume its on foot, the player's avatar is still a bit of a mystery reserved for hints found in the notes scattered through the levels) without the NPC's noticing you.  The second takes on a more stealth-based approach, requiring you to hide from the family as you peruse through their thoughts and belongings.\nBasic gameplay involves you searching through the house and possessing the thoughts of the family to determine what the hopes, needs and feelings are of each family member.  You can navigate through traditional walking or via possession of light fixtures.  After you discover enough information to continue, you can either stick around to get the rest of the missing information, or make a decision on how to influence the father's thoughts.  After a you commit to your choices, the house switches to night, where you can discover notes relating the experiences of past denizens of the house and finally pass your decisions on to the father.\nThe story threads hinge very much on which characters you choose to make happy at the end of each day, and the choices directly effect the NPC's moods and relationships with each other as the Summer progresses.  You can go the route of making everyone as happy as possible, or focus only on the needs of a single family member depending on your decisions.  The house looks pretty and has just enough detail in it for you to have to search for clues during the day without getting lost in the clutter.  For a game that depends a lot on moods, the characters have somewhat blank painted-like faces, a smart decision on their part as now the characters con convey their mood via body language instead of heavily involved face posing.\nAs someone entering the working world trying to balance time between family, career, and hobbies, the game really clicked with me conceptually, and though its very subtle in its pace and approach to gameplay, I still found myself enjoying it for the duration of a Saturday afternoon.  Length (~3 hours) may be a consideration for some, so waiting for a discount might make it more of a bang for your buck.","May 13","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since this isn't typically the genre of game that I play, I added it to my library and promptly forgot about it. Just a few days ago, upon noticing the game in my library, I installed it with the intent of farming some steam trading cards and deleting it afterwards.\n\nAllow me to say that I am *SO* glad that curriosity got the better of me and I decided to give the game a try. In complete honesty, I can say that I don't think I've ever become so emotionally invested in a game's fictional family as I did with the Kaplans.\n\nThis being said, I would recommend that anyone playing this game should play it in Story mode as opposed to Stealth mode. The stealth mechanic can get a bit annoying and clunky, while also making the Kaplans' stories that much less immersive than you building/observing their lives free-rein. This puts a greatter emphasis on the game's "Story-Rich" tag, and less on the "Stealth" tag, which in turn--I believe--plays to its strengths.","May 17","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
