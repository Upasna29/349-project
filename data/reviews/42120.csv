This game is purely based on multiplayer with team objectives and just plain old gun shooting to kill the opponent and grab the loot\n\n\nOverall: Lead and Gold: Gangs of the Wild West isn't a Battlefield Bad Company 2 multiplayer and it has it's lag issues. However, you can still find a fast paced, enjoyable multiplayer experience in this game. Plus with the objectives and the pure joy of shooting down your enemy and the achievements you can unlock, chances are you will spend many months combing the old west with your old friend, the Negotiator.","April 17, 2011","true",""," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Short answer: NO.\n\nLong Answer: I bought this game shortly after it's release, and it was very fun and it was a different concept of 3 person shooter PvP. It became annoying when i realized that the Bots were incredibly stupid and glitchy and also the multiplayer was so bugged and laggy.\nGame servers were SO F**KING BAD. They crashed all the time and it would take so much freaking time to get into a good game. Even if you found a good server, it would take either several attempts to join or it would never connect, and finally, the worst part: THE LAG... OH MY GOD THE DAMN LAG... it was sooooo awful. They promised they will fix it, never did.\n\nThis game was killed due to the fact that it was glitchy and poorly developed. Developers NEVER released any kind of update to this game or at least fixing the awful and laggy game server. This HAD great potential and they ruined it by not listening to the players.","December 14, 2014","false","6.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I think it was the first game that I ever made an entire group of steam friends in.  I swear I lived lead and gold in the few years that it was at it's peak.\n\nIf I could relate my experience in any way I'd say it was like the first time you played "The oregon trail" in school with your classmates.\n\nAll this being said this is a review and no matter how I love this game I must say this game is dead...\n\nNow don't go away just yet! I know this game is for all definitive purposes "dead" but I want to give insight to why and to tell you that the game isn't plauged by the problems that I believe killed it in the first place.\n\nThe reason lead and gold is a proverbial ghost town was because of it's matchmaking and the fact that it was overlooked by it's target audience I feel like it could be revived and yes I may be saying this straight from my nostalgia Gland but I do.\n\nSo please don't simply overlook this game I'd ask that you do some research look at gameplay videos see if it's something that interests you and then maybe put it on your wishlist until you hear that it's come roaring back if it ever does.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1. FUN!\n\n2.Tight controls\n\n3.Great old western atmosphere\n\n4.Several gamemodes to choose from\n\n5.BONUS FUN!\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1.Low to No Players playing on servers (Dead Servers)\n\n2.Slim variety of game maps\n\n\n\n\nIn ending I hope people start playing this great game again.

There are different characters in the game to play with and each one has its perks and traits to play with and use to your advantage. The graphics are really fun and creative to look at. The downfall to this game is that it can sometimes get really hard to play online with people so there is a small learning curve to get good at this game. It has been really enjoyable to play the different multiplayer gameplays. Its a great western shootout game.

Lead and Gold's an addictive multiplayer focused third person shooter that is very immediate, visually impressive, besides being remarkably cheap. I like that the class balancing is spot on for the most part, being fairly flexible moving between play styles aswell, unlike Monday Night Combat in contrast. Lead and Gold's trump card is solid tactical play and teamwork, game modes rotate largely between Attack and Defend playsets which are not to be played in a straightforward manner like in any other multiplayer game. Yet on the downside, Lead and Gold is overshadowed by a poor lobby system and community. Inviting friends into a match, any match, is hard work and there is no clear way of balancing or switching teams without calling for a democratic vote in scrambling teams. Not many players on Lead and Gold will admittedly play fair either, with spawn camping and noob hunting being common sport in matches. Keep this in mind if you consider buying the game.","July 27, 2011","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then I unfortunately couldn't access the game anymore (it was on my friends account which I shared with him) and just forgot about this game. When I came back in 2014 the game was just bad.\n\nHackers, griefers and extremely low amount of players. Only 1-3 servers to play in which have the ping around 100-200. The ping is manageable and doesn't bother that much but when it comes to griefing, well, that's nightmarish. Maps are unbalanced and let you pretty much grief in any map and in any spot.\n\nI could actually recommend if they would update this game and maybe do it free to play.

It's a fun game, when it's not utterly chaotic. You can spawn on top of a flag that teammates carry around the map, which is both an interesting mechanic, and very frustrating, when enemies pop up in your face with a shotgun in the middle of you focusing on something else. Explosions, one-hit kills, and anyone able to pop up anywhere (there are no choke points in any map) can make for a very random, hectic, and skill-less battle at times.\n\nBut if you can put up with it's unforgiving, crazy nature, it's rewarding. Unfortunately there are just a lot of games that do this style way better.

Gameplay is awesome (as long as you're on a dedicated server or one with no lag), and there are enough gametypes to keep things interesting for a long time. In some modes, it's a little too easy to play one side or another, but then the teams switch, so you always have a chance to recoup your point losses.\nEach class is pretty distinctive and has its own strengths. Play to those strengths and you'll probably do well. Some maps favor a certain kind of class over another, which is a little annoying if those classes aren't your favorite, but in this game I find it kind of hard to pick just one favorite. (Three cheers for the Trapper and the Gunslinger!)\nUnfortunately, the game has seen a decline in players over the past few months, so if you're just picking up the game now, your best bet is one of the dedicated servers that's still active.","September 30, 2011","true","37.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

After some simple text explanations 4 bots spawn in and bum rushed the spawn point, this in turn allowed them to continuously and repetitively killing me over and over again until I just put my hands up after I'd had enough of it- this is not good game play.\n\nIn multiplayer if you're on the winning side it's sadistically fun to pin the enemy in their spawn and just pick them off (of course) while they try desperately to gain a foothold.

While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and eventually China. At first, the prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. More sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today's dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with little more than they had started with."\n\nthis is 49er fever in effect... thievin and murderin for gold in them thar hills!!!","July 3, 2011","true","3.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"

The game itself is highly dependent on an active community since it’s a multiplayer only game. In the rare event Lead and Gold gets a temporary player base boost due to sales, the game quickly loses play value. The maps are extremely imbalanced with “op” spots that can quickly rage quit the uninformed.

Not a great way to attract people to a floundering community.

However, I'm not going to lie about how great the game. When I first bought the game last summer, it wasn't popular so it was hard finding a full server. The combat system is rather unique for each of the four classes, but abusable in some regards: faster than humanly possible shooting is the only thing that really breaks the game. I haven't tried this game in months, and I doubt I ever will since it's not cup of tea, but I certainly recommend it for Western fans. The developers may have turned the game around, fixed bugs, and balanced weapons and such so give it whirl, but I'd visit the forums first to check how active the player base is. I don't regret buying this, I just never found it interesting enough to keep playing.","January 12, 2012","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The multiplayer servers are all dead though. No one is EVER ON THEM! That's why i've hardly played it, because there is no way to without multiplayer. And no-ones even there, so what's the point?\n\nThe game is a really good one though! It is a third-person western shooter game, which I adore. I love western games, and third person shooters on these kind of game just 'fits' it. It's got plenty of modes and they are well thought out as well.\n\nIf anybody has this game and wants multiplayer, please add me so we can play!","August 7, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
