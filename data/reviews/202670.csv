The town layout and the stories behind the characters added to the game and I think that it was fast paced and interesting. I would recommend this game and I think it was one of the stronger games of the Nancy Drew series.","June 20, 2014","true","7.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It was awesome being able to switch between Nancy, Bess, George, and Ned while solving the case, and there was a nice twist in the plot compared to the usual games.  The puzzles were fairly simple, but still gave a challenge.  There were a lot of places to explore, and many different people to talk to.  I played it straight through and it took me about 7 hours, but I'm sure based on experience with the games that would vary.  I would definitely recommend this game to a first time player, or someone looking to play a different Nancy Drew game. 10/10.","January 13, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Turns out it's honestly much better than I'd expected.\n\nNancy Drew has been framed for arson and, stuck in jail, it's up to her friends to go harrass the people hanging around the fire and clear her name. The mystery is actually pretty solid and most of the cast is entertainingly written with solid voice acting (Nancy still sounds like a robot, but what can you do). The game's at its best when you're just walking around talking to people.\n\nUnfortunately, as is too common with these things, it tends to fall apart when it tries to be an actual game. The interface is dreadful, particularly for the inventory, a collection of tiny indistinguishable icons with no labels or tooltips or anything. Puzzles tend to be poorly placed and are tedious and overcomplicated. The idea of multiple characters is interesting, but ends up being more of a hassle than anything, with each character locked out of certain tasks and a need to call Nancy between each and have her call the next person to take the case.\n\nStill, for all its problems, it's rarely a hassle for long and drops entertaining new conversations on you often enough to keep you going. There's a lot to like here, it just sometimes takes a little while to get to it.","July 4, 2014","true","7.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Alibi in Ashes took me back to the books I read as a chld.  Being able to not only interact with Bess, George, and Ned but being able to play as them was a wonderul feature.  I spent si straight hours playing this game and I regret nothing, it was wonderful.  If you're going to get a Nancy Drew game, get this one.  You won't be disappointed.","January 8, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really appreciate the fact that Alibi in Ashes has an overlay that works, unlike some of the older titles. There's nothing more annoying than when I want to reply to a message or  look up a cheat and find myself locked in the game.\n\nOne bonus is when I encountered parts I found boring, such as having to listen to all the witness statements, I could open up the overlay and google something instead, all without pausing the game itself.\n\n♥ Love the plot.\n\nI remember when my friend and I first played this. We were appalled at the idea of Nancy Drew being framed and wanted to work together to solve the case. That was a couple years ago and when I saw Alibi in Ashes in my library, I decided to replay it.\n\nThe attraction to the plot remains the same...I enjoy how Her Interactive adds a refreshing appeal to each game instead of having them all blend in with one another!\n\n♥ Who did it?\n\nI have no idea . . . !\n\nI always appreciate how the Nancy Drew games make it somewhat difficult to know who the guilty one is. In this case, certainly not Nancy, however as you'll find out none of the suspects have clean hands. The evidence points multiple fingers, a fact that left my brain aching, and my fingers rapidly clicking in order to find out more!\n\n✘ Switching characters becomes tedious.\n\nFast. While the idea of being able to play as Bess, George, Nancy, and Ned is exciting at first, I quickly became less than enchanted with the idea.\n\nIf you're playing as Ned and want to play as George, you'll need to call Nancy, become Nancy, and then call the character you want to become. I found this annoying after the tenth time of having to switch off...especially when it comes to tasks that require two or more characters to complete it. I wish they would have let you simply call the character you wanted to become to switch places.\n\n✘ Have a good memory.\n\nSwitching characters require that you keep track of each one, along with their tasks, inventories, and actions.\n\nFor one inventories cannot be shared between characters, a fact that I understand only after I had glitched the game, having Bess and Ned carry quest items that required the other to work. Because of this, I had to restart from my last save, and lost quite a bit of progress.\n\nSo if you plan on playing as different characters (indeed some characters will only talk to Ned instead of Bess, etc. and some tasks fit one character over the other) you'll have to keep track of their inventories, tasks, etc.\n\n✘ Confusing.\n\nUnlike other nancy Drew games, I found this one to be a bit scattered, along with tedious. The map you use to drive to new locations was a puzzle in itself, blah. Additionally I found there were times when say, Ned would be 50% into the game, while I would have to move Bess and George up into the same progress.\n\nIt didn't help that tasks seemed to be a bit all over the place, especially when you have to catch up one character, have the second distract this character, have the third with a certain item do a certain task, etc.\n\nIt's a bit like playing a co-op game meant for four people by yourself.\n\nOverall I wish that there was a middle button between yes and no. If you don't mind having to be an organized player, perhaps if you have a friendly cat at your feet, or parrot on your shoulder to take notes, then go for it!\n","June 5","false","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

The setting seems pretty cool at first but gets repetitive traveling by car from location to location. The locations you do go to are fairly small with not a lot to do, most of the game is running between 3 different locations, retreiving one item, going back to the police station to drop off the item for Nancy, have Nancy analyze it, then trade off to another character... You are Nancy's errand boy in this game. The running back and forth (you use multiple characters outside the jail, and one can be more capable than another at certain tasks) makes the environment less immersive than past games. I prefer the more exotic locations, not boring suburbia.\nWhile at first the ability to play multiple characters  outside of Nancy (Ned, Bess, George) sounds new and different, I agree with a previous review that it gets very tedious very quickly. You have to go through Nancy everytime to make a switch, you can't switch freely between characters.\nThis game had less puzzles than previous games, and was furthered more by conversation/dialogue prompts. Add that into the fact that you have to leave each location, get in a car, watch the car travel to a new location, and then talk to the character at the location...it becomes boring.\nOverall I'd say the plot and environment of this game is weaker than others. This is probably my least favorite ND game that I've played, and was shorter than some of the others.\n$6.99 is not a terrible price for the game however, and if you're a fan of ND and want to try it out anyway, you should.\n\nLastly, the puzzle in Alexei's shop murdered my eyeballs. Thankfully after enough tries it just stops timing you. How you could possibly complete that by the top time I have no idea...","May 12, 2015","false","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the idea behind playing multiple characters is nice, it doesn't really feel nessicary, and the fact taht you have to go through Nancy for every switch is tedious.\nThe game is majorly lacking in any sense of adventure or even mystery. There's nothing really at risk, and that plus the very VERY dull setting makes me actually regret the buy.\nThere is also no awesome food-related minigame that i've found.","August 7, 2014","false","4.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I hate the fact that to change characters you have to call Nancy every damn time.  It got to the point I had to mute my game because their voices started to make me grind my teeth.  I got stuck halfway through and have no idea what to do now.  Every time I call someone (as each person) or talk to a suspect (as each person), I just get the "Hi"... "Bye".  I've gotten all the items, the only thing I can think of is I went out of order or something, and if thats the case, thats ridiculous seeing as you can be 4 different damn people, there should be no way to go out of order. I've gone to every location as every playable character and... nothing... so **** it, I dont even care.
