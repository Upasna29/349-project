So so tired of low-rez walking sims full of pretentious emo BS. Slow paced, pretending to be deep, or 'psychological'... full of fake 'mystery'... You know what's REALLY getting old? bloody walls full of eyeballs, especially when they LITERALLY MEAN NOTHING.\n\nSo, you think this game looks interesting? Might be worth your time? Hey, it's free right? Let me save you 90 minutes of your life.\n\nThis is a game about a breakup.\n\nNot that you'll figure that OUT until the very last minute of the game. And I do mean minute.\n\nThis is one of those games that tells you absolutely nothing about what's going on until you click on something, then it dumps a bunch of text on you that ALSO means nothing. It will string you along with 'mystery' that doesn't actually lead anywhere. Literally. You enter a mysterious catacomb that literally goes nowhere. Your character acts like he's living in a house he's never been in before when it turns out it was the HOUSE HE GREW UP IN ALL ALONG!!11 There's a mysterious tall man that keeps reappearing and spouting surreal garbage that literally means nothing and then he literally goes WELL IT WAS FUN I WON'T BE SEEING YOU and disappears from the story from there on. and then it turns out you were a whiny emo guy the WHOLE TIME\n\nIf I could have set my own pace I would have finished this game in about 16 minutes, barring the unnavigable 'maze' and the obnoxious addition puzzle. instead I was bogged down by a slow walking speed and fixed text crawl which made one word sentences linger on my screen for a quarter of a minute each.\n\nI'm not going to bother looking at the other ending. Presumably it has something to do with the character's relationship with his dad, which is another thing.\n\nDear 'indie dev' hipsters, we really don't care about your ex-girlfriends and your daddy issues. Make a game about a murder mystery! Make a game about a power plant accident! Make a game where you can freakin run and jump and shoot monsters, and isn't IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE ATOM BOMB or whatever. Also WE ARE SICK OF YOUR CRAPPY POETRY, we wouldn't want to read it in a book, why would we want to play a game with it?\n\nAs a person who actually HAS gone through a breakup which sent me into a severe depression, I couldn't relate to this story about a guy who went through a breakup which sent him into a severe depression. I was just annoyed by it. Annoyed by it and a thousand other boring stupid games exactly like it.","October 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 76 of 96 people (79%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","79","76","96","14","6"

In this case its a 2D side scrolling psychological thriller where you jump between worlds at night through the use of a light bulb. That's if you can get immersed in the game, because to others it could be considered just a game where you're stuck in a house and every time you're out of the house its in a dark maze. Its a game about tediously looking for the next place and scouring everything you can before near dumb luck stumbles upon the solution.\n\nThe story begins with you trapped in a long dark room. Walking to the right reveals a wall and a sound behind you. Moving to the left leaves a mystery as the room is getting smaller. Soon after going back and forth your character awakens from a dream in his hotel room.\n\nHe's on some sort of journey that leads him to a stay at a vacant house. The house has two bathrooms and two bedrooms, a kitchen, a cellar, an attic, a balcony and a few other rooms. They're each small, but provide for some space for you to have a look around.\n\nThe 2D and psychological thriller work against one another. Think of it more as a low fidelity 2D point and click adventure without the clicking. The resolution is just a few pixels that leaves for little detail so the psychological part comes in the form of numerous text boxes that describe things, thoughts and feelings. Since its such a small locale that spans a house and little else, your character walks slow, but flailing his heels as he moves.\n\nEach night you go to bed and that's when the game transforms between a blend of nightmare and memory. You'll find a light bulb that when used in the menu you hop between realms where you are yourself, but in a different clothes or a different era entirely. Here in this new dimension you have eyes looking at you. When you collect scattered diary pages, the eyes grow in size after you're done. Its a way of saying that you are being watched.\n\nFrom time to time you'll meet a towering butler that explains things in cryptic ways. I would say he's the narrator, but he's more of a way to keep you on edge as to how strange things can get. Is the butler even real or just a hallucination brought on by strange discoveries?\n\nWith the darkness contrasting the daytime they do set two completely different moods, but they're still the same tone thanks to the game's piano music in the background. Its a simple loop with a sense of mystery and an effective way to keep you on edge.\n\nOne of the only facets to your character beyond having dreams that take him into another dimension is the fact that he refuses to do things. Is the attic locked? No. He says he doesn't want to go there and then adds he doesn't want to get there. It makes me think that he's too lazy to crawl up a ladder. There are other times he refuses to do things and his descriptions of things are his own thoughts that lead me to believe he's antisocial and prefers the isolation of the house.\n\nThere is a lot of darkness in the game with plenty of lights to flip on. You can still see in the dark and lights are never a requirement, so your character can read through books in a room with no light source. The character can even tell he's talking to a woman when I saw nothing. Perhaps that's his real Nyctophilia. He can see in the dark better than the game elaborates.\n\nIn some moments of extreme darkness there's a light emitting from your character so you the player can see. I would say there's a lighter guiding the way, but a lighter is never shown so I can assume its the light bulb in your pocket, but then again the light emits before you get the light bulb.\n\nThe game gives you tasks and lists them, which is great, but I had done the tasks before they were mandatory. When I was told to wash up, I was confused trying to use the downstairs bathroom. I then scoured the entire locale looking for the other bathroom. I checked the yard, a second bedroom and various other places until the last place I looked was the second bathroom with the soap. That's when I was told to have a look around the yard, the second bedroom and other rooms.\n\nIts the wandering around and checking everything until I stumble upon the solution that takes me out of the game. Having to look all over the house for the wind that the game tells me is a sound. I could hear no sound. I checked everything several times even burdened with the character's slow movement. Until finally, I found what I was looking for and while everything is marked with an interaction button, this had no indicator. I had walked by it several times and even tried to do something with it long before I was ever supposed to. Therefore in my eyes it was just a part of the background.\n\nThen there's the underground maze that you need to explore. This labyrinth is dark with black holes in the wall. Its a place so easy to get lost in that you'll get a map that lets you warp to the beginning again. The only problem is that after the labyrinth, using the map can cause the game to crash back to the desktop. At that point my mind just checked out of the game. We had a good run, got lost, frustrated and angry looking over a house. Now with a crash it symbolized that I should give up on the game, because it pads out its time with complex switch puzzles and dark mazes.\n\nYou'll find little in the way of settings, only two languages and its keyboard only. That's no issue since the game is so basic and requires left and right, X for interacting and tab for menu things.\n\nThere's a relaxing, calming mystery here for those that want down the rabbit hole bad enough to find it. For the rest of us, its a game with issues. Its a good start for a better game in time.","October 3, 2015","false","1.7"," 45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","45","59","4","0"

I'm enjoying the game so far, mostly because it is presenting the main character very realistically as someone struggling with mental issues.  Choosing whether or not to let the protagonist forget to bathe, eat properly or take his medicine adds a lot of realism to the backdrop of the overall story. The biggest problem I can see so far, is that the English isn't written particularly well. Not that it's bad writing, I can just tell the developer's first language may not be English. If they ever happen to read this, I would be happy to offer myself as an English proofreader. Improving the grammar and writing might help the game reach more people.","October 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","22","26","4","0"

Really, I did. But this game is truly a masterpiece of it's own.\n\n-For one, the English translation is incredibly bad. I know the person who made this didn't have English as a first language, but if the effort was put through to cater this to an English audience, at least take the time to have an English proofreader. Despite that though, the grammar errors are probably the most redeeming part of this entire game! No joke. Though it is meant to be a horror game, the broken translation, especially in the first bit of dialog is the most riveting conversation ever. So if you're looking for a laugh, then there you go.\n\n- Secondly the puzzles are FRUSTRATING! The initial game mechanic is pretty clever, but then there comes...the MAZE. Sure, they give you a "map", but it doesn't even function! I didn't even bother going past this part because of how absolutely abominable this one puzzle was. Plus with nothing chasing you or any threat whatsoever, what could've been a maze to reach the goal with an obstacle turned into a horrible "Get Lost in the Caves Simulator". And no, it's not fun.\n\n- Finally, the controls and animations (if you can call them that) are nonexistent. The main character, f***ked if I know his name, has only one speed: slow. This, along with a rather large house, becomes infuriating to navigate. He responds rather well to the controls (standard WASD or arrow keys) and you can make him rave out if you hit "x" fast enough over a light switch while tapping the left or right arrow keys, but that's about the only entertainment you'll get from him.\n\nDespite the serious lack of attention and detail, it's definitely not "bad", but more of a time-waster, if anything. I honestly thought this would've turned out well, like some of Scriptwelder's games (such examples are "Don't Escape" and "Deep Sleep"), but I was incredibly disappointed.","September 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","25","39","7","0"

One of the biggest is the translation. its terrible, pretty bad English, so that definitely needs some work.\n\nThe game itself is very slow and not to say boring, but I felt like it kept starting to go somewhere then petered off and got slow again, the entire game you feel like "oh whats going to happen now!

Nyctophilia runs somewhere along those lines, but it's not entirely clear whether you should be where you end up, either.  A tale of parallel lives and mental mysteries, this game provides a bit to chew on mentally despite its rather short play time.\n\nIn Nyctophilia, you assume the role of a young man who doesn't entirely want to return to the game's primary setting, a house from his past, but who seems to have little choice in the matter. Over a series of days, you explore the house and what was left in it, including shadows of the past that grow increasingly menacing. At the same time, you explore the main character's past, only to find why the game's called Nyctophilia in the first place.\n\nAs a caveat, I need to point out that I played this game back when the English translation was rather rough, and things were a bit buggy; I had a game-ending issue about 1/3 of the way through and had to replay the first day or so. Even then, I enjoyed what was presented, getting enough out of the translation to sort of know what was going on, and probably wondering more about the rest than I would have with a straight translation. There was enough weirdness going on to creep me out, though the sudden shift in location and direction toward the end threw me off a bit. I'm eager to give it another go with the updated translation sometime soon so I can figure the rest out.\n\nThe game itself is rather short, taking maybe an hour or so to finish, but it's still not bad for free. I particularly enjoyed some of the quips your character makes upon inspecting things around the house; these change each day, so be sure to try interacting with everything. I also liked some of the more trivial-seeming options, such as what drink to start the day with. Personally, I'm a kegs and eggs kind of guy, and I'm glad that was available (and I didn't run out).\n\nSo yeah, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it's free and it's only an hour.

I read the other reviews and it doesn't look like I'm missing much, but still I'd like to be able to actually play the game myself and make my own decision. Would I recommend what I did play so far?

It definitely had some good aspects, but other games present them better.\nIt had too many flaws while playing.\n\nFirst some positive things: I really liked the background music and the graphics. The walking animation of our protagonist could have been done a bit better. It looks a bit strange and if you walk very slowly or just tap a bit on the keyboard then the guy doesn't really walk but kinda floats over the ground. But that's just some small aspect, otherwise these points were done well.\n\nNow to the aspects that were negative in my point of view:\nIn general the game was very slow-paced. TOO slow. The walking speed was too slow, the story could have been told faster and the section with the catacombs were annoying and slow.\nThen the thing with the eyes on the walls... That is just overused now and here it doesn't even have any meaning. It ain't creative. Well, and the story... Definitely was 'weird' as the summary promises. But there are too many questions left open and it's too confusing. To be honest I won't play it again to see 'the other side of the story'.\nThe english is okay, there are still some mistakes but I can live with them. It's not that bad.\n\nThe end was actually good, as it tells you how you can reach the other end. It makes you want to play the game again. Well, it COULD if the game overall would have been done better in those aspects I mentoined. As it is now, I doubt many will play it again just to see the other side of the story.\n","December 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I get the feeling it isn't supposed to be. (I only have 20 minutes in so far, so I don't have much to say yet.) To get some idea, check the screenshots I've recently posted (Activity feed or Community Hub.) Reference is made to "the crusts of books" , and "I don't need ♥♥♥ to burn". (I can't be sure non-English versions are as fascinating.) Goals are as exotic as "Explore closet", so be sure you have your doctor's approval before playing.\n\nFEATURES\nWeird and crazy dark story\nPuzzles about different realities\nWatch your condition. Don't forget about food and hygiene\nHouse tells its own story\nTwo endings. Each of them tells you one side of story\n\nNot NEARLY enough hygiene-based games.\n\n"Nyctophilia"'s controls are simple enough: left or right arrow, tab for tasks or inventory, X for acknowledging EVERYTHING, including menus. I sense the game is about dreams, and darkness and night (thus the title.) You have a car, and obscure references are made (I think) to going into town, so no doubt the game gets REALLY exciting later.\n\n"Nyctophilia" is FREE, so do NOT miss this opportunity to play this mysterious game.","September 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","16","32","8","0"

However, if you just pretend that the main character in the game is actually a Russian immigrant who actually speaks that way with a strong accent, this game becomes much more enjoyable!

To start, the design of the game is Pixelated. Not a bad thing, as many pixel based games can be great. You start in a nightmare where the walls close in on you, and wake up in a hotel. You leave to a house, which is not really explained why you went there. You decide after JUST leaving the hotel, you need another nap!\nThis game is badly structured. The goals are terrible and lack any information. Examining things will reveal very little. The written script for this game is terrible (No offence to the creator, as English clearly is not their first language) but for future reference, a translator could be of assistance. Often times, reading a sentence just won't make much sense. The story is a jumbled mess to me, as I had no clue what was going on.

Then I spent all of day two looking in rooms (that I had already walked slowly to once already) then went right back to sleep which was very lame. Day 3 I spent about 15 minutes walking the catacombs losing my mind because it takes forever to walk anywhere (Can you tell I hate the walking speed?)

Yea I've never heard that in a game before. I gave up on day 4 because I just don't care.","October 24, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I might as well be talking to a toddler, because I would be able to understand what they are saying. They at least understand the fundamentals of English to the extent that I am able to determine the broad region of what they are attempting to define, unlike this game. "Installed descent into barn, but not tell family." What the hell? Where are the direct objects in this sentence?\nThe storyline cannot be interpeted well because of the pure desecration of the English language within this game. It's not like they're writing intense paragraphs or books, either. The majority of the mistakes are in basic, one-line descriptions of common, household objects, like a bathtub.\nAlso, I am not really a fan of psychological games, but I endured the slow-pacing of the game because of curiosity. It seemed the game was reversely paced, however, because the first area you arrive in is a house. I immediately explored and examined all of the house, only to find out my first objective was to read a diary, and then go around the house and inspect every individual room and aspect. So I was forced to go back and explore every room again. The game purposely punishes you for exploring, because due to the slow limp the character walks at, it takes another five minutes of your life to enter each new room and gain another new, pointless line of dialogue.\nI liked the pixel art, even though the strange semi-jump the character does while tranversing a linear plane is constituted as "walking," the backdrops were well done. The artstyle was unique in the way that it accurately depicted what areas were safer and what areas were neutral or negatively-filled. The sound track was also well-developed, except for the unholy screeching at the beginning of the game that filled my eardrums with blood for a solid minute. I wasn't even in the game yet, and I already wanted to quit because of this hellspawn trying to voraciously ravage my ear canal.
