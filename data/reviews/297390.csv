If you love the world of Fifth Element or played any of the GTA games only to drive people around, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\nI played it previously on Desura and I can say that it handles much better now.\nAlso, it's bright. And cyberpunkish. And you drive (fly?) a flying taxi.","November 26, 2014","true","0.9"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

The missions vary from fast paced races to bank robberies, all of them which are timed. You can spend your hard-earned cash by spending it on upgrading your car/weapons.\n\nThe visuals are nice but could get confusing sometimes with all the bright neon lights, the big HUD does not help either.\nOf course, you should not expect AAA graphics from an indie game.\n\nOverall, Collateral is pretty original and kinda fun for a while. Currently it's still in Early Access, so I should not be too hard on the game.\nSo, why will I not recommend this game? Simply, because of the game's price tag. I doubt Collateral will ever be worth 23 bucks, even after the game is finished, so let alone now. If you can find the game in an indie bundle (like I did) or if the game reduces it's price till max 5 bucks, it might be worth it, otherwise you best spend your money elsewhere.","May 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

It feels a little dated at times and the missions as they are currently are a little repedative I am sure as the Early Access continues it will become a much more expanded game.","November 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/recommended/297390/","Whiterabbit01","Whiterabbit-uk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiterabbit01/","7727 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe game feels rather dated, with graphics  that although pretty to look at, dazzle you  with   bright lights and neon colors;  also  much of the scenery  feels  haphazard, and a little blurry at times.  The  vehicles look like  they were created a decade  ago.   You can play Collateral  using either  a  keyboard or game controller.  If you are familiar with the former,  I strongly advise you use it because the keyboard controls are not very intuitive;  for example, to decend or ascend you need to press a combination of two keys for each action.  Being able to do these two actions is  important because  to gain missions you have to move through rings that are often at a different altitude and parallel to  your vehicle.   As a  left handed player whose never liked controllers  I found it  quite difficult to accomplish  this task using the keyboard controls, often overshooting   the rings or missing them completely.  Once you fire your weapon   you'll attract several police vehicles, who will attempt to shoot you down. Their fire is pretty accurate  and they are likely to  shoot your taxi down quickly unless you can escape them.  This is quite easy, but if you are on a mission, you'll most likely fail due to the time  limits.  I found it was better to avoid using your weapons, at least  initially so that you could complete some of the easier missions and use the money you earn to upgrade your vehicle and  get better weapons.  The games HUD is quite cluttered and in combination with the busy  scenery,  and,   if you are firing your weapons, can lead missing your targets.\n\nI played Collateral for around  5 hours  over  three sessions.  Each time I had to give up because the movement in game  gave me eye strain and  made me feel a little  nauseous after  a while.  I tried adjusting my mouse sensitivity and lighting in the room, but that didn't cure the problem.  Playing it in shorter  sessions  will probably sort the problem out for me.\n\nAs mentioned above to earn cash  and  thence to upgrade  requires you ro  complete missions; trouble is,  you get very little time to complete missions, at least in the early stages of the game.  They count down either  in dollars or time, the longer you take to complete the mission the less  you earn and therefore the   longer it takes to upgrade your  vehicle or weapons.   The coundowns go fast, so, unless you  are very  adept at the game, it's going to be hard going  progressing very far without getting  bored.  I failed loads of missions whicch was offputting.  I found at this stage of development the game wasn't holding  my interest for very long.\n\n\n\nWhat the game needs is different environments   and   possibly a new graphics engine as well as a selection of different  taxis to drive, each with their own advantages.  I'd also  consider changing the rewards system, so that   you can take much longer to complete missions, or at least give the player the option to toggle an easy mode that gives you longer.  At least then  no one need fail.  What's the point  if you're going to fail more times than  completing a mission.\n\nIf this was a budget   indie game I'd  say  okay, go and buy it as it would be worth around £8/$12  to £10/$15, unfortunately, the release price  of £18.99  (approx $28) was way too expensive for what you get (IMO).  Granted it's an early access game, so we may  get   updates that vastly improve the  game in the future, but from  my experience with  early access games; not many have delivered as yet.  I hope the developer proves me wrong as I  love the  basic idea of the game; it just needs a lot of improvements before  it's released  as a completed title.\n\nIf you are  undecided about buying the game, i'd recommend you wait till it inevitably goes on sale.  Judging by  other recently released games that have then appeared in Indie Bundles (including Early Access) or   gone into the  weekly sales  within several weeks post release, you probbably won't have too long to wait.\n\n\nYou can see a video of game play HERE","November 25, 2014","false","5.1"," 31 of 52 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","31","52","0","3"

There is absolutely nothing else like this on Steam.\n\nUnfortunately, the game's high price is a major downside, and likely the only reason it has never gotten the recognition it truly deserves.\n\nDespite that, it's still a fun little game that I would highly recommend anybody pick up, albeit at a lower price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/297390/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUpdate: After giving this title more than 8 months and not seeing a single promised update I've changed my recommendation to No and updated my review throughout, including better comments relating to Early-Access.\n\n\nDiscovering Collaterals' incredible style and visual design, the punky and dystopian world and writing, and the fairly unique Crazy Taxi-esque gameplay with weapons and customization to boot are all the wishlist points of any good video game nerd. While Collateral does offer a stunning city scape which is, for a short time, very pleasing to explore and look at, it's ultimately limited by shallow gameplay, no story, and more technical problems than Microsoft ME.\n\nHighlights\nThe main appeal and the thing that this title does best is the gorgeous visual design and immersive styling. It looks and feels incredible and driving around what little of Bedlam City exists is already genuinely interesting and exciting. The rich depth of satirical advertisements, varied vehicle styles and hidden graffiti make for a real pleasure in just casually exploring the cities vertical architecture. In my first 10 minutes I found myself avoiding missions because I just wanted to drive to some landmark I could see behind a carpark, or drop down to read some graffiti scrawled on the side of a hotel, only to catch a vehicle duel reminiscent of block wars from Judge Dredd blasting away above a lane of traffic overhead. It honestly has some very brief moments of visceral immersion that are cool to witness.\n\n* The factions and their presence in the forms of vehicles and the buildings that make up their small sections of the city, be it Big Larry's blocky in-your-face industrial complex or the Strippers' smoggy narrow streets in the Red Light district help add character to the map and make good landmarks♥♥♥♥♥♥ence points.\n\n* The witty writing and little hidden extras like sexy billboards, blunt satirical advertising and things like a UFO hidden in a shipping container in the cargo hold all show a sense of humour and slight detail that helps add a little more.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nBedlam City, despite being beautiful, interesting and showing promise of increasing in size, is currently extremely limited. I completed a circular lap of the entire map in less than 3 minutes, and with an engine upgrade I'm sure you could drive from one side of the world to the other in a little over 2 minutes. Granted, there's vertical depth to take into account, and being the type of game that involves relay means you're going to be retreading the same areas a lot, but it's still just a ridiculously small world compared to other city driving titles. The developer is currently working on a commercial district called the New Bedlam District or NBD, which promises canals and boulevards, and may be larger than the current regions, but there's only another one region planned after that for a total of 4 small regions of Bedlam, and it's hard to see this game offering enough space and exploration to justify casual exploration for more than the initial few minutes of each area.\n\nSo the focus then is on the gameplay, which is where Collateral falls down. There are 10 mission types, including Group Races, Taxi Fares, Package Deliveries, Search & Destroy, Bank Jobs, Prison Breaks and Story Missions, but they all fall into just 3 categories: Fetch & Return missions, Point A to B missions and Destroy Target missions. Only Races really stand on their own as different, and even those are as bland and boring as 3D racing gets. Cash and items do provide reasons to keep playing and completing missions, but they're all far too repetitive and similar and until the story/campaign additions, gameplay is overall flat.\n\n* There are some really big problems with FPS stuttering, rendering times and lag in general, though a developer has alluded this to the Unreal Engine 3 and suggested a redevelopment involving AI and other functionality is planned towards Unreal Engine 4, which should help reduce the graphical and framerate problems.\n\n* The price deserves special mention for being, frankly, ridiculous and is further put into perspective below.\n\nEarly Access Specific\nThe developers have promised a lot, “a story-rich campaign, animatic cutscenes, fully-voiced passenger dialog,.. a complete city of 4 unique major districts, and [more] upgrades and weapons for customizing your taxi.” but with a planned release within the 2015 that only leaves another 2 weeks of development at the time of review, and it's hard to see anything other than an incredible story campaign or miraculous increase in world size significantly affecting gameplay for the better.\n\nThe development blog (available from the Steam Community Hub) is very frequent and regularly posted with fun art design, but after 3 quarters of a year of owning this title, I haven't seen a single update and the Steam reviews touting developer abandonment are starting to look a lot more like accurate prediction.\n\n* The price is set to increase after launch, which does at least provide some small incentive to buy now, but it's already very overpriced and given the other issues and lack of updates it doesn't make sense for most of us to take a risk on this title.\n\nRecommendations\nCollateral is priced at £18.99/22.99€/$24.99 at the time of review and to put that in perspective I can pick up 3 and a half copies of Crazy Taxi, or the entire Grand Theft Auto III trilogy including 3 different complete cities offering several powers of magnitude more gameplay content than this title delivers. This game currently matches Saints Row IV, Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition and other Triple A titles in price, and if that isn't enough to turn you away, they intend to increase the pricetag on release.\n\nIn short, Collateral is a rip-off for what's currently available. If it wasn't for price, I could honestly forgive the lack of content and some of the problems I have with this title and the gorgeous city would be enough, but for now it should be avoided for anyone but those with plenty of faith or plenty of money.\n\n* The games Quarantine and Quarantine II - Road Warrior are strong inspirations for this title, and amazing games with thick history (and with huge flaws) in their own right. They're available as Abandonware on various sites including Abandonia[www.abandonia.com].","August 7, 2015","false","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But as it is, there isn't a lot to do other than three basic types of missions and some upgrading. I really feel like I'm missing something, because the game is fun, but it's lacking to such an extent that I really think I might not be seeing the whole game.\n\nPros:\n+Flat learning curve: It's very easy to pick up the game and understand the mechanics of it.\n+Simple fun: With the learning curve, it's such a simple, fun way to pass the time.\n+Visuals: I really like their take on the visuals. It's really arcade-like and keeps things fresh.\n\nCons:\n-Minimal soundtrack: It sounds like there are two songs in the entire soundtrack and it can get very repetitive.\n-Limited missions: Missions fall under three basic categories. Race, deliver, and destroy. The actual number of different missions ends up coming out to around 12 at best, and these are all that you have to choose from.\n-Upgradability: Not a lot to choose from. You can't even upgrade to a different taxi altogether.\n-Maps: You have two. That's it. Both are cool, both are unique, but two can only keep someone entertained for so long.\n-Awkward UI: I'm mostly refering to the map, which when you bring it up, it covers the entire center of your screen and makes it difficult to navigate.\n\nI understand the game is in Early Access, so I'm hoping the devs take the potential this game has and push out an amazing product. Until then, however, I really don't think it's worth the pricetag of $25.","April 2, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
