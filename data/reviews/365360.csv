His stats were usless although his bow skill was average, so I gave him a bow and he was still pretty useless.  He somehow leveled up so I gave him the +20 percent exp perk and eventually he became max level.  Now Alfgier is one shot-in shieldless young orc and always hitting the enemy.  I rename him to Alfgier the Usefull and he quickly becomes my favorite battle brother.  Late in the game I was going against an undead army with 4 vampires, Alfgier is in the back sniping when the vampires start teleporting to him, he pulls out his arming sword and cuts one down, but the other one cuts his head off.  RIP Alfgier, once a lowly useless begger, to the best archer a merc company could have.","June 30, 2015","true","188.1"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","96","65","68","20","2"

From my nine brave mercs, two survived the battle to tell the tale....\n\n\nThis is surely not for the player who can´t lose some of his men, the difficulty is very high and one (un)lucky hit, can decapitate your main warrior. Besides the high mortality rate, this game is a unique mix (i would name Mount & Blade from setting and map movement with a bit of Darkest Dungeon regarding the characters .. and their likeability to die ;) ) with many possibilities to establish your merry band of mercenaries.\nThe characters are randomly generated but with enough background to make them unique enough, also if they live long enough there are different experience paths to take. The combat is strategic, turn based. The story, as far as already implemented is nicely written too.\n\nThat said there is still much left of the game, many features which are already in the official list, as well as some usability ones, which hopefully will be implemented. Also you will have to like the graphic style, which surely is not for everyone.. and sometimes makes it hard to differentiate on the battlefield imo.\n\nConclusio i´m really looking forward to how this game will envolve and i´m sure that i will send many more mercs to their deaths.. and hopefully some to riches ;)\n\n","April 30, 2015","true","27.6"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","74","83","6","6"

It's immersive, actions have weight (both in combat and overarching), and characters all have their own distinct personalities, both through flavor text and their dynamic achievements. It's also one of the few early access games where the devs really care about the game and its community - especially surprising when they have comparatively few sales so far.

I love Darkest but i always come back to BB. Watching what this game has become from when I bought it about 10 months ago ( I could be wrong on my dates but its been well over 6 months) I have see massive changes to the amount of enemies back stories to the contracts you get.\nIf you enjoy turn based and RPG with sandbox work then this game will not let you down. and for 20 bucks its well worth it even if you just play one weeken you have you moneys worth. (grammar and spelling police at a red rocket)\n\nUpdate after release. This game is A must have for anyone who enjoys Turnbased and Rpgs, and is looking for a more realistic style of fantasy rpgs. I have supported this game since day once and will play for weeks on end then let the "Devs works their magic with new updates" and Updates are weekly)\n\nThe Devs listen to the players and  it feels as if not only are they making a game for us but for them as well.\n\nI highly recommend this title support these guys I even went so far as to upgrade the package I bought as the Devs really are polishing a game that will be played by me for years to come.\n\nKepp up the amazing work guys you havent let us down yet.

You can tell the developers are really putting as much part love as they are effort into the development of this game.\n\nYes, it's early access.  No, it doesn't feel like early access.\n\nWhy should you buy it?  I'll tell you!\n\nThe game has a level of polish that you rarely see in Early Access, let alone a finished game.  Even for Early Access there is enough to do to get your money's worth out of it.\n\nYou start with three mercenaries, and you recruit more as you go from city to town to city to castle.  Want another mercenary?  You see some possible recruits hanging out in the city center, and you read their back stories (because they legitimately have back stories, and you better read them carefully... their stats are tied to them!), you find one possible recruit who used to be a butcher, but he wants more excitement in life... so you recruit him.  His stat bonuses look pretty good!  He's got +melee skill and +fatigue and no negatives, heck, he's even loyal!\n\nYou outfit your crew with the available gear at the blacksmith... switching some items around because they're just too heavy for some of your new mercs to wear... gotta work on that fatigue!\n\nWith weapons in hand and armor girded you choose a mission and head out into the countryside to fight the Open Graves of the Heimlands Battle.  It's deadly to hit it head on, so you wait for roaming bands of undead to pour forth and engage them one at a time.\n\nAfter many battles a few of your mercs have learned new tricks, and skilled up.  Your former meat carver looks like he's doing well.  So, you engage the open graveyard head on... it doesn't look so bad now.\n\nThe battle is bloody, and you find yourself outnumbered 13 to 5.  The fighting is fierce, and your heroes are only alive because of the new armor you had obtained for them... which is now in tatters.  Shields broken, weapons failing, the last of the undead is slain.\n\nSurveying the battlefield you note your old friends are still alive, and one of the new recruits... but the butcher has fallen.\n\nHis memory won't be lost.\n\nTime to return to the town and claim your bounty... it better be worth it.  You've got gear to fix, wounds to heal, and a new recruit to pick up.\n\nHopefully this one won't die on you.","May 14, 2015","true","94.8"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","64","75","5","3"

They outnumbered us easily 2 to 1. After they swarmed the spearmen, the archer was charged and killed. We were well equipped with good armor and helmets.\n\nThe melee started out well, no damage taken and some given, but the arms of men grew tired and heavy. We were unable to keep up the shield wall, and sometimes unable to even to do any more than defend the torrent of claws. 4 men became three, three became two. Some beasts were felled, some fled, but they were still to many. In time, one man stood before 4 werewolves.\n\nHe was unscathed, but he was exhausted. He was scared, but he could not flee. He was surrounded. So he fought. He killed one, but his armor and helmet were shredded beyond usefulness. He stabbed at the wavering wolves, as if he could fill them with fear by filling them with the cold steel tip of his spear. He killed one as it turned to flee, killed another that got the same idea. More -- one, two, he couldn't know -- howled from the nearby darkness. And one stood before him, flailing at him with its claws, the claws found flesh, and he bled, but he continued to fight.\n\nIn the end, Emmerich stood alone, buried his friends, and walked alone to the nearest town with bloody spears, claw-torn shields, and seven large black wolf pelts.","July 12, 2015","true","8.7"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","43","45","8","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AcidFluxMx/recommended/365360/","AcidFluxMx","AcidFluxMx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AcidFluxMx/","689 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhy do I recommend Battle Brothers, why did I buy the supporter's Edition Upgrade and why I'm not playing Dark Souls III Deluxe Edition (already on my Library as you can see it) and rather playing this game?\nLong was the time where trully a game made me feel attached to characters without having to develop a huge background or lore for each character such as in Final Fantasy. Mercenaries here are not lovely or memorable characters because of what they did or what they are, but for what they will be able to do once hired in your company, allow me:\n\nThe first town. You buy some food, weapons (if you can call a Farmer Fork, a Club, a Butcher's Cleavers a weapon...), dream to hire a decent Militia mercenary one day, but get a Killer on the Run instead.\n\nIn the first fight the Killer on the Run saved a badly wounded Battle Brother armed with a mere Club from inminent death by slicing a Bandit's head with a Butcher's Cleaver swing.\n\nIn the next town a Beggar joins the army due to lack of funds (you needed bandages, tools to fix your worned armor and weapons, and of course more food). Soon you realize that every time during a fight when he shoots with a damaged bow you provided to him (thinking he'll die soon anyway) he proves he's a resourceful man as he almost never misses and therefore becoming a killing machine, he gains levels and thus, earns your respect... and the Battle Brothers' as well.\n\nDuring the next weeks a random event/cut-scene while camping made you decide wether to wait and see what figure will arise from the shadows or instantly shoot a bolt to it... you are grateful you didn't shoot since an Adventurous Noble called Sir Balduin wearing a nice set of armor joins your ranks after a cut-scene describing what he was doing wandering the lands alone and quickly becomes the main man of your company together with the Beggar, until some raidings later he succumbed to an arrow that pierced him right where armor didn't offer protection. "So much for an expensive armor. At least we still have the Beggar" you and the Battle Brothers think.\n\nYou've started spotting Orc Scouts in the borders from the furthest town and the far mountains you've never dared to venture in (yet), and deciding not to engage those steroidal ugly enraged Greenskns for now since they look more than a capable opponent for your company. Some days later you come back with a "Wildman" on your ranks and, heck, leaving him naked (no armor at all for Role-Playing purposes) and watching him swing that two handed Axe like that by Slicing and Dicing Orcs on his path is trully inspiring for you and the Battle Brothers... Hooray!\n\nSuddenly when you thought all was going fine, another random event/cut-scene made some of your Brothers sick and only when you thought you might be on the losing side of the path, another random event/cut scene while camping for recovery let you know what are the thoughts of your men, your Battle Brothers, about you. Boy, that was some really encouraging words they spoke!!\n\nNow more than ever, you march proudly bearing your banner and name you've chosen for your company's in the beggining. Remembering the Brothers that have fallen and feeling so glad for the ones that haven't... yet.\n\nOne day, one of the many jobs you got from towns directed you to a far from civilization - deep forest who in turn made you discover that what you hear on taverns about werewolves were not merely a drunken man's delirium. You and the Brothers prepare for combat in a spot where dense trees don't allow you to form ranks for Shield Walls, prepare Arrow/Crossbow Volleys from a far distance, nor can you see your advesaries, nor where they are going to attack you from. Before you lose your grip, you thank God you've visited a Kennel and you can send some Scout Dogs to try to search for them before they find any of the Brothers caught defenseless. But still you don't feel victory is at grasp. Suddenly the dogs find one of them and they got instantly killed. Not a good sign. Then, on next turn, one of the wolves jumps direcly in front of the Wildman and the Killer on the Run chopping their heads off. Morale is really hurt for you and the Brothers (means it's a real factor/stat in-game and a factor in RL as you feel strategy's being compromised due to these deaths making you feel a mixture of rage, nostalgy and desperate emotions at the same time; you must regain that grip, commander!). You realize it's the Beggar's turn. You prepare yourself to shoot the first arrow to the closest-menacing werewolf. You really don't know if the arrow will hit it or not... "Will it die? Would this creature at least be damaged? What if I hit for not a single scartch? Is this our doom?"\n\nMany questions, only one answer...\n\nThe rest (not the end) of the story it's yours to discover. The question is:\n\nDO YOU DARE ? ? ?","April 16","true","46.3"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","43","45","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaje85/recommended/365360/","kaje85","Kaje","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaje85/","313 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I first encountered this game via the Bay12 forums, I was instantly hooked.\n\nAfter following the development for a number of months, I simply had to beg the guys at Overhype to let me test the game in its pre-Early Access state - and I have not been disappointed.\n\nDevelopers -\n\nWhilst this is the first offering from Overhype Studios, even in it's very early state, Battle Brothers feels polished and well-loved, with care not even AAA developers put into their titles these days. They listen and respond to feedback and criticism, and have to be the most dedicated updaters I've seen for a long time - as soon as a bug is reported, they're determined to squash it and patch it as quickly as they can - something that teams ten times the size of Overhype should learn from! Not only are the developers knowledgable, passionate, and creative - they also have that rarest of attributes for Germans; a sense of humour!\n\nGraphics -\n\nI must confess to being astounded by how beautiful the sprites are in Battle Brothers. Each weapon, piece of armour, mercenary, enemy, and landscape have been lovingly crafted with a dark edge. Even when wandering along a country path, or fighting amongst a forest of lusious trees, you're always aware that these are dark lands in desperate times. There are even little flourishes such as clouds and birds flying high over the map, just extra little things which help to suck you into a beautiful but dangerous world.\n\nStory -\n\nIn the Early Access release, there isn't a storyline to follow as such - you are left to make your own adventures. I've had a lot of fun doing exactly that - from being given my first three mercenaries, fighting my first set of bandits, and then losing all but one man to a pack of wandering Orcs and having to work hard to earn some coin to replace my fallen comrades and their equipment - usually through spotting a heated battle between wandering factions, and looting from their dead!\n\nAs development continues, a larger story will be added with goals and decisions to be made. Until then, there's still plenty of fun and immersion to be had - and I still feel a twinge of sadness every time one of my men is downed!\n\nSound -\n\nThe beautiful music, ambient sounds, and sounds from the heat of battle, are superb and do everything to draw you into the world.\n\nGameplay -\n\nEven at this early stage, the gameplay is superb. I have lost countless hours (more than my Steam profile suggests, as I played a pre-Steam version too) immersing myself in these lands and doing my best (and failing) to keep my band of mercenaries alive. At first, you are given three random mercenaries with a backstory and associated traits - some positive, some negative, and a small smattering of equipment and coin. Your first task is to spend a little to acquire better equipment, and maybe even hire a fourth mercenary from the available list (changes at each town, each mercenary has a backstory and perks) before taking your first contract from one of the townsfolk. These contracts range from delivering a message to another town, seeking out a particular landmark, protecting a caravan as it makes its trade journey, or obliterating a nearby enemy encampment - be it Orcs, bandits, or ...other things. Each completion provides coin, and in the case of battles provides an opportunity to loot new equipment from the dead, or to simply loot items to sell at the nearest town.\n\nThe battles themselves are turn-based, and set on a number of beautiful areas (depending on the terrain type your party was on at the time the battle commenced) with each character taking it in turn to use their action points. Height can provide advantages or disadvantages to your characters, as well as the enemy, and there are a number of strategies you can employ depending on your choice of weaponry. Fancy lining up a row of archers behind a row of spearmen with your standard swords, axes and maces in between? You can totally do that. Feel like rushing in with a heavily armoured beast of a man, armed with a great axe, to destroy enemy shields before your swordsmen move in for the kill? Yep! I have had so much fun trying different strategies against different enemies, and I'm sure I'll find more ways to win - and die horribly - as I play through development. But each battle, even those I've lost, have been fun and frustrating - but there's nothing more satisfying than seeing your newest recruit, with barely any armour, strike the final blow against a dangerous enemy!\n\nYour experience gained in battle can be used to improve your men, through applying stat points and also through choosing perks. Each level provides you with a perk point, and these range from improving hit chance, boosting your health, reducing fatigue, and even giving you extra AP points when killing an enemy. All are extremely useful, and there are plenty to choose from to enable you to tailor your characters to the role you want them to have!\n\nConclusion -\n\nI have been throroughly impressed with everything Overhype Studios have done with Battle Brothers so far, and I know that I will continue to be impressed with the upcoming additions to an already fantastic game. I'm proud to have been a part of the test, and I can guarantee that when my test copy runs out, I'll be buying this. It's worth every damn penny.","April 27, 2015","true","31.5"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","48","54","0","2"

Although, you have to be very tactical and there is no allround tactic or armory which will get you through every fight.\nEver tried to take down an Orc Warrior with a spear? With untrained mercenarys this may take a while, if you are still alive after a few minutes.\n\nNow for a goblin is small and hard to hit, a spear gives a bonus to hitchance, you might want to switch from your armor breaking wepaons you used for orcs in the battle before to weapons which may make less damage, but have a better chance to hit.\n\nGameplay at the real time map:\nNow, that you won a battle you find your company in the open world. For every game you start, the worldmap is automatically generated. Wait, no no, don't think somethink wrong! You may think this can't go well, a automatic generated world. But I can tell, you it works, and it works pretty well!\n\nOn the worldmap, you can move to settlements, places to raid, or just venture through the area and search for roaming enemies, or not, you are free to do what you want.\n\nWeapons, armor, wardogs:\nYes you read correct, wardogs. Now a wardog isn't a very strong fighter, but it is extremely fast and can move further than your mercenaries. Perfect to catch fleeing enemies. Dogs need something to chew on to.\n\nWeapons;\nWell I can tell you, there are already quite a lot and the devs plan even more.\nPersonal favorites: Crossbow, Billhook, Greatsword and Noble Sword.\n\nArmor;\nSame as with weapons. Personal favorites again: Nasal Helmet with Mail, Padded Kettle Hat, Direwolf Hide Armour (it's as awesome as it sounds), Mail Hauberk and Reinforced Mail Hauberk.\nAs this is an early acces review, it will probably be updated later on.\n\n----\n\nAnd now something besides the game itself, the community here on steam, as well as on their website, is a kind one, as far for now, I did not encounter trolls, spammers, or aggressive and unfriendly people.\n\nSo: Keep up your excellent work and I already see this game in the future in a "Hall of Fame". :)\n\nAnd at the end:  A special compliment for the two chaps of BreakdownEpiphanies for their amazingly awesome music which they create for the game. :)\n\nKind regards,\nZensalin.","March 11","true","76.6"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","0"

But now here I am playing it for the second day straight and loving every second of it. In this Review I'll discuss the Pros and Cons, as well as perhaps maybe what I think would be great to include/change about the game.\n\nPros\n- AI is very simple, yet very well done. AI actually responds to the happenings of the battlefield, causing the enemy forces to employ new strategies.\n- The character backgrounds/traits, OH MY GOD. YES, MORE, PLEASE. While you expect to lose characters in the game, it's always nice for them not to be clones of each other, could do with more names though. >_>\n- A nice, simple (and hopefully to be expanded upon) selection of weaponry and armor to pick from.\n- Resource Management is a constant, but isn't hard if you know what you're doing.\n- It's good to know you can run to a town/tower/castle/city to get some backup in the form of ally troops in case you're outmatched, soldiers've saved my company numerous times.\n- The diversity in the quests thus far is small, yes, but they're similar yet just different enough to not make it repetitive and boring.\n- The skills/level system legitimately does show when in combat, and it's worthwhile to really try to preserve those veterans.\n\nCons\n- Lost Souls, if there's more than five of them, all they seem to do is wail, and make everyone flee regardless of how brave they are. This basically makes a supposed Puny fight so annoying, and so friggin' hard.\n-Very hard start off, as there's no real 'sanctuary' from the roaming bands of enemies, and they follow you everywhere. Savescuming is an all to present temptation, on top of that, they keep pace with you regardless of how small your party.\nDaily pay is very annoying, and sometimes escorting caravans to long-off cities can bankrupt you if you do it as a starter mission.\n- Fleeing enemies do not leave the map, instead they just hide somewhere, causing your group to have to play hide and decapitate with them, for an upwards of possibly ten minutes.\n- Orc Youths are probably smaller and weaker...right? So why can they charge and stun my characters like the Warriors/Berserkers? When you're facing a massive Orc force, your entire party can become insta-stunned by a line of shirtless prepubescent Greenies.\n- Outside of the friggin' Lost Souls, the other undead seem woefully under-powered, and there's just not enough of them to even it out. Even if there's Fallen Heroes and Necromancers in the group. I'd love to see some Zombie-Knights that basically are complete tanks, or something.\n- Citys/towns that are objectives of missions for say, Escort or Delivery, are seemingly at random, causing you to only get 140 Crowns for an across-the-map trek, or 1360 Crowns for going to a town literally half a minute away.\n- Lack of overall places-to-be, it would be nice if there was more to do in the towns.\n\nSuggestions\n- One thing that would be awesome? That party limit? Yeah, add an option to turn it off, perhaps have multiple levels of it too? As I am a major RTS fan who enjoys large troop counts, and I feel like it would add a new perspective and difficulty to the game in itself (managing a company of 12 men is /waaaaaaay/ to easy after maybe ten minutes of grinding). Besides, it's 2D Graphics, there can't be that much resource-drain on having a 50 v 50 battle (good golly, Ms. Molly), I'd think.\n- Undead gaining numbers as they wipe out caravans and perhaps Bandit/Soldier parties? It'd be cool to see that.\n- Other Mercenary Parties to interact with. Why not, right? Could be fun if you made a rival, or trusted ally, or crap, just picking a fight to see who's top dog. Mercenaries ain't really that civil, yo.\n- Weapons, Armor, and lots of variations! I'd love to see a greater diversity, although the current amount is nice too, but after a short time you seem to get the best stuff (except Coat of Plates armor....can't find that at freakin' all, sorry Alvar.)\n- ......A....private.....settlement/Castle that can be purchased? Let's you store soldiers there, perhaps levy taxes and such, also a local place/safe haven to rest, recruit, and who knows what else?\n- Rival Kingdoms? Allows you to perhaps pick a side, raid and pillage and plunder as Mercenaries did, while under the banner of a king.\n- Different race mercs. It'd be nice to be able to find some Orc Berserker slogging down drinks and hire him, rather than just seemingly commit genocide on his entire race.\n- Different races in general?\n- While I guess it could be put under the whole 'weapons' suggestion, Muskets/Arqeubus? Slow reload time, but devastating damage, perhaps multiple ammunition types.\n- Random Events! A damsel in distress! A friggin' village fire! A chest found in the middle of a forest!

The basics:\n\nYou are a mercenary captain in a low-fantasy world. You yourself don't get involved in the fighting. You start out with three mercenaries and some gold crowns, some food, some medicinal supplies and some tools.\n\nYou travel from place to place on a strategic map that is procedurally generated. You look for work from nobles or from the elders of each settlement, or if you like, indulge in more criminal acts such as robbing trade caravans or peasants.\n\nYour goal in essence is to survive, nothing more, nothing less. The world is unforgiving. Battles, especially early battles, can be brutal and death comes with shocking abruptness.\n\nYou salvage what you can from your defeated enemies' corpses and move on. Early in one game, I found myself overjoyed at finding a patched mail shirt pulled from the bloodied body of a bandit. Metal armour, yes! No glorious warhammers of +5 Mary-Sue-age here.\n\nIt is this that is the core gameplay. You are running a mercenary company, and just enough of that task is abstracted, presented by a UI that makes extensive and thoughtful use of tooltips, that it never feels like a spreadsheet simulator, yet also doesn't feel like a grotesque oversimplification.\n\nYou have to make sure you have enough food (which spoils), enough crowns to pay your men, enough medicinal supplies to treat them and enough tools to repair and maintain their gear. The nice thing is that you don't have to micromanage any of this - if you have the relevant supplies, your men just use them, but it takes time to make repairs or heal.\n\nAt the settlements, you can hire new people with different backgrounds to join your company, give them some equipment and hope they make it through the next few skirmishes. I've found myself hiring an ex-militiaman simply because he had a passable sword and I didn't have any spare. I've even hired a beggar because he was willing to join for next to nothing. I was desperately short of crowns but I needed an extra man in the battle line. I left him in his sackcloth clothes and gave him a wooden club. He died horribly in the very first fight. The game does a great job of incentivising the kind of ruthless desperation of getting by as a mercenary leader.\n\nThe movement on the strategic map is simple. It's in real-time but is pausable. You simply click where you want to go and your company starts moving there by the quickest route, using roads where possible. It's very similar to Mount & Blade's strategic map. You find contracts at settlements, but you can meet any number of things on the roads, such as peasants, supply caravans, bandits, orcs, goblins, werewolves... sometimes even undead. Go off the roads and you can discover abandoned ruins, concealed camps, lairs. You can play without taking a single mercenary contract, by just simply plundering such places, if you're able to kill or drive off their inhabitants. There is a day/night cycle that has real implications (sight range is much less during night time, you move slower, and certain... things... come out at night).\n\nRandom events can happen while you are travelling, with dialogue choices for how to deal with them. These are generated as well, but are usually contextual to where you are, or to certain traits your mercenaries might have.\n\nThe battles are turn-based on a hex grid, but the map is generated from the underlying terrain on the strategic map and the time of day. Height advantage, morale, initiative and fatigue are all pretty elegantly represented, and the equipment you have given your mercenaries makes a huge difference - different types of weapon have different attacks. Every battle feels like it has weight, because the consequences carry through onto the strategic map. If you only just win a battle, and your men are horribly wounded, you find yourself trying to find the nearest town to rest and heal - or do you set up camp out in the wilderness and hope your fire doesn't draw more trouble down on you when you're all hurt?\n\nThe art-style is 2D and deliberately stylised. There's no traditional animations, but every character is represented as a playing piece, from the waist up on a base. There's a lot of beautiful design choices here. If they're facing right, they're yours or on your side. If they're facing left, they're hostile. Attacks are clearly represented each time they happen, with clear visual feedback for the results - armour gets ripped up on the figure, helms get battered and the faces and bodies of the wounded get progressively more messed up. Blood sprays when health damage is done, leaving persistent spatters on the ground. Also, everything is represented - when someone dies, their body is left and you can pick up their surviving equipment mid-fight. When arrows miss, they stick in the ground and remain there for the rest of the battle. Shattered shields lie on the ground. By the end of a fight, the once pristine battlefield can look like a charnel-house yard.\n\nThe art in general is extremely beautiful, looking lovingly hand-painted. The overmap looks fantastic, with drifting clouds and flocks of birds. There are different colours for identical pieces of equipment which is a lovely touch.\n\nSound is similarly excellent, with pitch-perfect music to suit the mood, melancholy sometimes but with a strong medieval theme. The battle music is outstanding, keeping up a thread of tension and excitement without becoming overbearing and suited to the opponent (fighting undead is creepy). Each action is contextualised by sound too - each attack and the grunts or cries when they hit. I love the sound design on orcs and goblins. In the overmap there is ambient sound depending on the surrounding terrain, most especially in the settlements.\n\nThe sense of progression is the heart of it. Your men level up, and you can improve their skills and give them perks. Once you have a well-equipped band of hardbitten mercenaries (I love Deadly Slicers), you don't just get a sense of achievement, but of narrative too - and that's the greatest thing. Stories emerge naturally from the game, and eventually your mercenary company has a story you shaped from the start. The procedural element means every game tells a different story.\n\nI also want to specifically single out the writing. The writing of everything, from tooltip descriptions, to random events to the dialogue when taking a contract, is exceptional. It isn't just good. It stays in context and always serves the atmosphere of the world. The writing is also beautiful simply as writing. It's genuinely outstanding and for me is a possible contender for the best in any videogame.\n\nMy only criticisms of the game are relatively minor.\n\n1. Currently, clicking around on the map to pursue another party can be fiddly - it would be nice if you could simply click on the party while paused and then your company simply pursues them along the currently quickest route without further intervention.\n\n2. When you mouse over a target in battle, you have to know the icons for the stances, for instance Riposte or Spearwall. Some text would be helpful.\n\n3. The game needs female characters, as until then the world feels weirdly half-made. I absolutely agree with the devs' decision to make sure their backgrounds suit how a quasi-medieval world would treat them, so they want to put them in properly. I think they'll do a fantastic job - and I hope they add NPC's too - say a noblewoman who asks you to find her husband who has disappeared and now she's desperately trying to hold the lands in lieu of her husband against predatory rivals, or a lady or village elder in her own right.\n\nHowever, the game is still early access and the devs have already stated they intend to implement number 3. So frankly, these minor quibbles are likely to be addressed.\n\nAll in all, a near perfect example of the turn-based genre. Deserves to become a classic.","April 8","true","93.7"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","3"

It is one of the few games in the last 5 years that have brought me actual fulfillment, fun, and a sense of immersion. I still find myself saying "OOOOooooo!!" and shaking my head whenever a critical hit destroys a bandits helmet and leaves his face bloody and battered. The sound effects, graphics and music are all amazing and give Battle Brothers an unmistakable feel that is uniquely its own.\n\nThe Devs are great guys and care very much about their game. They are constantly working on it and their ideas are quite novel and innovative. I absolutely can't wait for the full version of this game.\n\nSome little details that really stand out:\n\n-Decisions actually matter. The strategic elements are so well implemented that a few careless decisions or ingenious tactics can be the difference between dominating your opponent or getting crushed.\n\n-Different and random battle wound graphics. There are different animations that appear on your men determined by the extent of their injury. A light battle wound may give you a cut on the cheek, a black eye, or a bloody nose- but become severely injured and you will be swollen, battered, drenched in blood and looking like you have lost every ounce of courage.\n\n-Speaking of courage, there are morale checks! Morale during battle is an actual factor in chance to hit/defend as well as chance to flee.\n\n-Zone of control- another great implementation that adds to strategy by preventing units from leaving the proximity of engaged enemies without getting swung at.\n\n-Hexagonal grid. Why surround an enemy on 4 sides when you can surround him on 6?\n\n-Randomly generated Mercs to hire. Speaks for itself.\n\n-Permadeath. Adds so much to the immersion of the game and gives each battle a seriousness.\n\nThe game is early access but the core mechanics are so solid that you will find yourself easily investing 60+ hours into it. And when the finished version gets released? There's not a single reason NOT to get the game at that point. So support this awesome game and the Devs and get the Early access, hopefully the game will be so successful that we will see multiplayer and DLCs in the future.\n\nIf you are at all the slightest fan of Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre I highly suggest you buy the game.","October 26, 2015","true","16.5"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","0"

I fell in love with this game back when it first had hit Steam's Greenlight section.  It wasn't much more than a battle demo back then, but the developers shared their dream for Battle Brothers through a very detailed description on their website.  The amount of thought and foresight into what they had planned was impressive.  I've been a fan ever since.  I've checked out all the videos they posted on their road to early access and I've been anxiously awaiting it's arrival on Steam.  I have to say, it doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe best way I can describe Battle Brothers is a tactical turn based strategy RPG with roguelike elements and party management.  I think the closest thing I could compare Battle Brothers to would be Mount & Blade with Turn-based fighting.  You have the Strategic World Map and then the tactical battle maps.  You control every aspect of your party.  From hiring, outfitting, and using each one in combat, to leveling them up, chosing perks, and finally what type of fighter they will be.  In addition, you get spoils after each battle which you can use to fill in gaps in your own equipment, or sell for a decent chunk of crowns, which in turn could mean you get to hire that Knight who was so expensive, or buy that suit of chainmail to give you the edge.\n\nDid I mention that much of the game is proceedurally generated and, as such, no two playthroughs will be exactly the same.  The game is brutal and very difficult at times, but if you stick with it, choose your fights carefully, and mold your mercenary company the right way, you may become unstoppable.  There's a pretty big difference from fielding a group of farm hands, millers, butchers, and jesters to fielding a group of sellswords, knights, and squires.  All things in time.\n\n***Updated***\n\nThe developers at Overhype Studio should be commended.  Within days of their release to Steam Early Access they had squashed nearly every bug.  They worked exceptionally hard to get the game working for everyone.  Additionally, they've been churning out updates and working tirelessly at improving and moving Battle Brothers closer to their envisioned completion.  They do not update small simple things every week or add small updates all the time.  What they do is address any issue right away and then work hard to get a big update out that adds a ton of bonus content and it's quite game changing.  The world before goblins was somewhat scary, the world after goblins, WAYYY more terrifying.  Thankfully they've scaled down the goblins just a bit and it's slightly less horrific.  The next big update is scheduled for February 2016 and it will be a game changer again!\n\nThis is my most anticipated game of 2014-2015-2016 right now.  I'm so glad I have my hands on it finally!  Even with it being Early Access and no where near complete, I can't recommend this game enough.  GO!  BUY!

Edited 5/21/2015\n\nTwo pieces of its inspiration are X-Com and Mount and blade. The devs make no bones about that, and its stated outright on the store page. The game has high aspirations, but a few shortcomings when compared to these two titles.\n\nHere's the difference. In xcom, every lost soldier is a sacrifice towards a clear goal;  equipping the survivors and getting them ready for the end game mission. Battle Brothers lacks that end-game goal at the moment. What this means is that the player is pushing his mercenary company to be powerful for as long as he/she can sustain the group before a bad fight forces him/her to start over again from scratch. There is no goal in the current build worth building up to.\n\nThat wouldn't be quite so bad, but the world and its relatively small map gives the illusion of depth where none exists. Towns are identical and feature identical quest givers that sometimes give the exact same quest in the exact same town. The roster of quest variations given are limited to about 4-6 types. Neither towns nor castles nor caravans can be raided or interacted with outside of taking or fulfilling the same few quests. No factions exist to join. This means that towns and castles cannot be besieged to change who controls parts of the map. Mercenaries do not exist without wars to fight, and people waging war to pay them. That requires factional strife.\n\nTo put it shortly, the map and its moving pieces appear detailed and complex, but opportunities to interact make the experience one-dimensional.\n\nThe game has its strong points. Combat is addictive and visceral. The models change to reflect the state of armor, weapons, and the health of the unit bearing them. Building your surviving mercenaries into battleground brawlers to avoid another roflstomping like the one that cost you your front line and your favorite archer is fun to do.\n\nIf the game is ever on sale for 5$-14$, I would recommend it in a heartbeat even in its current state. It's not a bad game.\n\nEarly access supporters roll the dice whenever they decide to support projects like this, and I cannot in good conscience tell you the reader that this is worth 20$. That's a full 3/4th's of a tank of gas in some car models. That's a used game at your local grifter- i mean gamestop. That's a laundry list of well loved games that are just a few years old here on steam -  including a few of the games that inspired this one. That's almost 17 bags of gummy worms (I hate you sales tax). That's enough to bribe me to stop listing what else you could get with the twenty bucks spent on this game.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Battle brothers is a ton of fun. I'm going to keep playing it because i find it enjoyable. I wish the developers the best of luck and can't wait to see where the project goes. The problem is that In a sea of early access titles that never achieve the level of polish that developers promise starry eyed consumers; a buyer would be paying a fair chunk of change for a product that comes up woefully short in providing the amount of satisfaction that other titles do.\n\nTldr: If you understand that you are taking a risk in funding an early access project, and don't mind sinking 20 bucks into an unfinished product to help fund the studio, then please buy the game. It's got potential and i'd love to see it succeed. If you're looking for a game that has a set goal, and does more than just a single thing well, then hold onto your money, and wait for a full release.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe above lack of goals and the game being unfinished still apply. If you are looking for a game with set goals that can be completed and finished, then don't get this game. That being said, I've had more fun with this unfinished product than I've had with quite a few AAA titles. It's still a gamble to put 20 bucks into an unfinished product but if you're a sucker for turn based tacticals, then BB is worth the money.","May 17, 2015","true","270.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

Think Darklands + Mount & Blade with a very attractive graphical presentation. Hand drawn procedurally generated world maps, spiffy looking characters you can dress up with a huge variety of weapons and armour, and, of course, hats. Medieval German low-fantasy tactical hat simulator.\n\nThere is also RPG-style character progression for each of the 12 members of your mercenary company, complete with talent trees, making it all the more painful when your favourite guy's head gets chopped off by an orc cleaver. Brutal, brutal permadeath, but that's okay because there's any number of gravediggers, rat catchers, farmers, hedge knights, beggars, and all kinds of other adventurers waiting to be hired. Did I mention there's a whole pile of character backgrounds? Complete with various other traits that will give benefits or penalties in combat, the whole setup vaguely recalling the character traits from Crusader Kings. For example, Cowardly will mean that the character will never gain high morale in combat, while Loyal will mean that the character will be far less likely to desert your company should your funds or supplies run out, while a character with a Houndmaster background will gain bonuses when handling dogues. Loads and loads of others that will incline the character this way or that, and it's up to you to build them in a way that will take advantage of those traits.\n\nWhile the strategic gameplay is great, where the game really shines is the excellent hex-grid turn-based tactical RPG combat. Here, think X-Com + Final Fantasy Tactics (or so I've been told, not being privileged to have played FFT). Lots of depth in setting up combos with the aforementioned weapon variety and RPG-style character builds. Bonuses for high ground, standing behind trees for defending against missile fire, and so on. Each type of weapon has its own unique active abilities. Here, think GW2 but greatly simplified since you're not controlling only the one character. So, for instance, a shield will give you a bash and a defensive shield wall ability, blunt weapons like maces will have a basic attack and a stun, a warhammer will have a basic attack and an armour-break, a sword will have a basic attack and a defensive riposte, and a greatsword will have various AoE abilities that chop bandits up real nice.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm greatly enjoying this game, can't wait to see where they take it, and I'd venture to warmly recommend it to any fan of any of the above-mentioned influences as well as tactical RPGs in general.","December 28, 2015","true","44.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

The basics are really REALLY GOOD battling is solid and tactical, I've battled alot in this game as its the most fleshed out aspect, like taking your starving beaten squad making your last stand on a hill for the height advantage, having 40 Bandits surround you, managing to kill one of the strongest bandits with a crossbow and watching as the rest of the bandits start waivering and eventually after some luck and judgement coming out the winner, its very satisfing if not fairly unlikely, You could play the same battle and have completely different outcomes depending on what you choose to do, its GREAT. Also being able to equip your soldiers with bows at the beginning of a battle and then switching to shield and spear as the enemy advance and combining different abilities and perks together is a very nice touch so much scope for tinkering, I've come across very little in the way of bugs or problems, I had so many battles with one particular character that it be nice to know how many kills hes had, as hes probally had almost a hundred hopefully stats will be added in future updates, he will mostly likely be wiped before that happens (EA of course) wiped but not forgotten.\nI can almost feel the love and care in this game, your little guys level up you can re-name them choose what they wear which then shows on the character, theres a unique way of recruiting soldiers reading their back story which then has a bearing on their stats, good stuff.

Set in a low-fantasy medieval world, you are tasked with leading a company of mercenaries whose sole purpose (atleast in the EA game) is to attain and complete contracts for coin, which can be used to buy more companions, more equipment, or more provisions. Moving from one town to the next to aquire and complete these contracts, you may be beset upon by werevolves, vampires, greenskins or ghouls. One such event occured when I was accompanying a trade caravan from the city, set upon by horde of undead, my band of brothers rallied to one anothers side. Many a Hugo fell... and rose again. Ferdinand, a Gravedigger in his former occupation, shined on the battlefield, bringing down countless foe and former-friend alike. The losses were felt however, one of the original members Gerold, had been bludgeoned to death after being surrounded. But such is life in Battle Brothers, brothers will die, and die gruesomely, your job is to overcome that loss, to lead a company that bards will sing songs of by the time the game goes gold.\n\nBasic Review of the EA Game\n\n+ Turnbased strategy rpg at its finest. Each weapon confers certain abilities to the battle brother. To this extent there is not a strict class system. A brother can change weapons on the fly, and the weapon he weilds determines the role he will have on the battlefield.\n\n+ The art in this game is phenomenal. Despite very little animation, this game is a 2D delight. Its beautiful to look at, and the attention to detail is incredible (from flying heads, to arrows sticking in the ground, corpses and the detailed and unique faces of the battle brothers and enemies alike). This, accompanied by an excellent soundtrack and sound effects leads to a very immersive and enjoyable experience (even in the early stages of EA)\n\n+ This game has potential, so much potential. Most of the core features are in the game, but the devs have so much more content planned. The game is very much a sandbox at the moment, which I personally love, but certain story elements will be added down the line. More monsters and factions, weapons and contracts, tactical maps and unique locations will also be coming too. Theres alot to look forward to with Battle Brothers, and alot to enjoy now.\n\n- I have to wait for the rest of the content that is planned.

It's a game that has combined systems of others and has managed to create a fresh new gaming experience.\n\nYou are the leader of a mercenary company. Your job is to simply do what mercenaries do best: take on dangerous jobs for sweet, sweet money. You'll face goblins, bandits, undead, and orcs. There are perils aplenty, and to combat such things, you have to create a team that can be versatile in all combat situations. This is where the game shines, in the freedom of creating a strategic team that can survive any situation.\n\nYou can buy gear, hire more mercenaries with unique traits, and devise tactics to overcome your foes. In combat, it all pays off. But beware, for the game is brutal and unforgiving. Such is the life of a mercenary, to live and die for glory and gold.\n\nThe music is beautiful and crafted wonderfully, and the art-style of the game is charming and very fitting. What I love a LOT about the game are the small little descriptions of mercenaries you hire. They all have little backstories which helps me live inside this randomly generated fantasy world. I love it because I can create my own stories in the absense of a campaign. The writing is also simply superb and well-written.\n\nThough it is early access, it is worth your time. I am looking forward to all of the updates that will be rolling out throughout 2016 and beyond. As it stands, Battle Brothers is worthy of praise.","January 6","true","7.9"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","1"

This game is essentially a 2D, turn-based version of Mount & Blade, with absolutely top-notch artwork and music, and great writing. The artwork really is above and beyond a great majority of indie titles (particularly the detail - I was amazed that changing gear actually changes your appearance with artwork this good).\n\nEssentially, this is a Robin Hood simulator of sorts. You lead a band of 'brothers' or mercenaries across a beautiful landscape. You drum up money by buying-low and selling-high based on different town/village/city sizes. Its all fairly complex, with layers of learning as you go. The band consists of up to 12 men, all with their own level-ups and past histories (that determine fundamental buffs, etc.). You take on quests.\n\nThe combat system really shines here, and is hella fun once you learn the ropes. I mean there is a ton of strategy with how you equip your men, how you go about formations, and how you actually fight. The turn-based nature of the combat is super smooth and makes great use of intuitive keyboard and mouse controls.\n\nPros:\n+Probably one of the most active developement teams I've seen.\n+The game is very polished as-is, and feels finished.\n+Artwork is of some of the highest quality I've seen.\n+Music is very fitting.\n+Intuitive control system.\n+Learning curve is steep enough to offer plenty of depth in the game, yet you can figure it out in probably 2-5 hours depending on you.\n+Maps are randomly generated, although main quest line is the same every time.\n+Its fun!\n\nCons:\n-If you don't work through the learning curve and really figure things out, you will feel frustrated. It takes some time. Maybe this is obvious, but it needs to be stated. One thing that really stuck out to me is that most reviews had like tens-of-hours of playtime, which I was impressed by - time flies when you play this game. It will be easy to get your money's worth here.\n-Performance could be better. I play on both a gaming rig and an older laptop. Sometimes its a hair slow on the laptop.\n-I would like to see a statistics screen in order to look at whole-clan profiles and statistics.\n\nThis certainly seperates itself from other games, and is a must-have if you are into anything like Mount & Blade, or if you like turn-based strategy games. Its worth full price in my book.","March 16","true","13.3"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","2"

It's in Early Access (and will be for the next year or two), but the game already delivers a fair amount of entertainment.

I definitely got my money’s worth. I bought this game over a three day weekend and dumped hours and hours into it. Following are some the points I like and dislike with this game, which is still an early access game.\n-Love the customization of the Battle Brothers, and other RPG elements mixed in with the tactical gameplay.\n-Choice of what contracts to take and the ability to drop them (Although a reputation system would be nice. I.e. negative repercussions for dropping a contract. Add a reward system with that. Better the reputation the higher the reward. Maybe even a few contracts that call for unsavory things. All depending on reputation. With this, I also wish the player could be notified of the difficulty of the contract. (Many times I would pick a contract only to see the area I was to raze was rated as impossible.)\n- The permanent death of soldiers is a neat take on it since you can easily replace brothers with cannon fodder or with higher quality troops. The only problem is that when your troops die you tend to lose their expensive armor and items. This was supposedly fixed as of 8 September 2015, but I haven’t noticed a difference after multiple character deaths.\n- Choice is types of weaponry allow for strategic troop set ups. I like having a shield wall of spearman forming a spear wall. Really satisfying when the AI has no choice but charge the wall. I do wish some more weapons and armor choices were added.\n-The only real problem I have with the how the game currently is has to do with how ranged combat takes place. The AI archer will nearly one hit kill my troops with about a 70% accuracy to hit. I find it really frustrating going into a battle with even one archer in the AI’s army. Basically means at least one of soldiers in full armor is going to die in the second round because the AI hardly misses. More than one and you are going to be stuck in a round of retreat and load the auto save and hope for crappy computer rolls until you can make it out with acceptable losses. I’m actually going to stop playing this game until this is fixed. Way too frustrating in its current state.\nI do really enjoy this game and would like to continue playing and even donate to help see its completion because I just really enjoy this game. 10/10 would buy again. (Fix the freacking archery! It’s the real reason I’m even doing this review. Please somebody on the development team read this. I just couldn’t besmirch a good game without saying how much I enjoy it because it would give somebody the wrong impression.)\n\n(Edit 8 December)\nArchery seems to be fixed. Doesn't do as much damage as once did but is still enough to add some challenge. Back to hoping Orcs don't get their moral up and whipe out my best men.","September 8, 2015","true","91.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Just bear in mind that parts of this review will likely become outdated the further along the development of this game progresses.\nFirstly, Battle Brothers, for being an Early Access alpha game, is very stable and polished. Bugs are rare and seem to be fixed rapidly. The game mechanics themselves are already solid and well implemented. As long as development of the game continues, I'd have to say Overhype Studios is doing a fantastic job and is a trustworthy developer.\nThe game mechanics are typical, but done very well, for this type of game. It's standard fare turn-based combat with a mild amount of role-playing elements. Overall, I'd compare the game to a mixture of Expeditions: Conquistador and Mount & Blade: Warband.\nBattle Brothers is brutal. Your troops will die, you'll find yourself frequently frustrated, and sometimes overwhelmed. The game is set in a dark, low-fantasy medieval world, and every battle, no matter how small, is gritty and deadly. If you're someone who doesn't enjoy challenging games, then this isn't really a game for you.\nThe art and look of this game is awesome. Some people probably won't like it, especially the "game piece" way units are presented on the battlefield. Personally, I like it, and I think it's done exceptionally well. Damage and condition are viscerally and clearly shown on each unit, as well as what armor and weapon they currently have equipped. You can essentially tell how any of your battle brothers are doing just by how they look. It's very cool. As is the fact this is all hand drawn and not your typical indie pixelated mess.\nAll of this having been said, Battle Brothers does currently have a few issues. This is an Early Access game, that means not everything is implemented yet. Eventually, I found myself bored with nothing to do. It's really only the first few hours that are the most fun. Starting a company, getting through that critical period of making money, buying equipment, barely scrapping by - it's challenging, fresh, and exciting. However, for me, the game tends to hit a point where it begins to feel stale; you're in a limbo where you've cleared much of the map, have a full company of battle brothers, and plenty of equipment and crowns (money). I hope the devs add more long-term and "end game" content to Battle Brothers to alleviate this. There's also another issue I have with this game.\nMuch of the game is procedural. The map layout, the three battle brothers you start out with, quests; almost everything. This adds replay value to the game, but it also makes it unpredictable in some not so good ways. For example, it's possible to start out with three battle brothers that suck, on a map with towns spaced very far apart, near a city that offers a bad mix of recruitable troops. If you're not experienced with the game, this can prove very frustrating. So, be warned. You may, or may not, like the randomness of the game.\nUltimately Battle Brothers is a solid, challenging, and fun game. It already has a great foundation and shows a lot of promise.

Even after watching a few gameplay videos I wasn’t that excited by it and planned on giving it a miss (as much as I loved the rest of the concept).  I was a little surprised to see a demo being offered (as it is rare these days) so I decided to have a look at it and I am glad I did.\n\nThe combat system is very enjoyable and feels quite polished already. There are enough subtle nuances to support a range of tactics (depending on equipment and enemy faced..!) and the design is quite well done.\nDemo link:\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/downloads/\n\n\nCombat:\n-	Characters are represented by busts only, no animations. Don’t let this put you off… the artwork is incredible (armour getting damaged, units getting bruised and bloody etc) and I think it actually fits well with the abstraction of turn based combat.\n-	There is no facing/flanking taken into account (allied units always face to the right, enemy always face to the left). While this seems like a significant downside initially, the overwhelm mechanic is actually a relatively elegant way of dealing with this.\n-	Fatigue. In addition to action points you also have fatigue (actions add to total fatigue up to a characters max, total fatigue is reduced every turn). If you can’t ‘afford’ the fatigue cost of a move, you can’t do it. Wearing armour reduces your max fatigue, the heaver the armour, the bigger the reduction. This is something that some people don’t like but it is a feature I love. It is a great way to add a little more (abstracted) ‘realism’ to the relatively familiar turn based AP combat system.\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/tactical-combat-mechanics/\n\n\nStrategic map. Very well done overall. Will be familiar if you have played Mount and Blade but includes day/night cycle.\n\nInteresting points:\n-	A lot of the game is randomly generated so locations and strengths of enemy factions, towns, outposts etc will vary each playthrough.\n-	A town’s prosperity depends on trade with other towns. If a town’s caravans are continually getting ambushed and/or the town is raided often, it will directly affect the support they can give you (eg. Equipment available)\n-	The above point also extends to the games ‘quests’. There are the generic ‘filler’ quests (eg. I need this token package delivered to X town) however the real contracts are based on the towns actual ‘needs’. Eg. If a town’s caravan is continually getting ambushed, they will ask you to escort it (while a town with safer routes won’t offer that contract because they don’t need your help). You can also get contracts to deal with enemy locations (eg. bandit hideouts etc) however it isn’t a static quest; if a force from the local castle/outpost knows about it they may deal with it first.\n-	The stronghold/outpost tasks also dynamically evolve based on supply levels/resources, manning, knowledge etc.\n-\nThere is a very interesting video on the world map and simulation here:\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/dev-blog-36-strategic-worldmap/\n\nMore info about world map worth reading\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/blog-post-7-worldmap/\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/dev-blog-17-progress-update-villages-daynight-cycle-banners-and-more/\nhttp://battlebrothersgame.com/dev-blog-19-on-worldmap-locations/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very solid game and leagues ahead of what most games break into early access with. While the final game content isn’t in there, it is a perfectly functional game as is already (and many ‘sandbox’ games have been released with less).\n\nThe devs are quite active in the community and maintain an ongoing dev diary. If you are remotely interested in this game, grab the combat demo straight up and check it out (note it is a bit outdated though but does give you a good feel for the combat). Read through some of the other reviews and dev diaries and if you are still intrigued, grab it.\n\nA great purchase; no regrets. (I am actually upgrading to the supporter tier purely for a bit of extra support for the devs.)","July 26, 2015","true","12.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The game explores a low fantasy setting with punishingly hard battles and permadeath, but it's focus on the group rather than a single character makes this work and work well.  While losing a hardened veteran hurts, it's often an opportunity for your group to grow better, picking up some of those experts or novices with great potential that are impossible to afford at the start.  Leveling up is both frequent and meaningful and you can build even unskilled vagabonds into the stuff of legends, although not quite as legendary as that hedge knight with the enormous battle-ax,  taking some of the sting out of his inevitable death.  Interesting and unforgiving battle mechanics, fun and accessible party management system, still lacking in a few areas; perks are limited and extensive prerequisites tend to railroad you into the same build,  procedurally generated content tends to spiral out of control as time goes on (it's not really fun to fight 50 orcs at a time when your capped out at 12 dudes who die forever when their hp hits 0), the quest system is a bit samey and generic, and there's little unique story content at this stage,  but we are still in early access with plenty of time to get them worked out.  Even if it gets released as is, it's still better than 80% of the games I've played.\nPlease note, this game is and always will be a turn based tactics game, if your not a fan of that format best to ignore the above and look elsewhere.","May 29, 2015","true","331.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Good concept. Build a mercenary company from the flotsam and jetsam of a war torn land then try and stay alive. I think it would help if you were one of the characters but death does come quickly so that might come with some wrinkles of its own.\n\nPlenty to still be developed in terms of frills and nice to haves but the core game is sound.\n\nIf you enjoyed xcom, the early fall outs and jagged alliance then the team building aspects of this should appeal. Graphics are clunky but the immersive quality is there in terms of ownership. You develop your own unit and you need to look after and protect them (well some of them not the cowards, disloyal or morbid grave diggers obviously)'. Protecting them is hard, especially with the random nature of deployment prior to a battle. Maybe that adds a touch of realism but it would be good if you could deploy as you preferred or even set a battle order.\n\nIf the team keep working on it and improve some of the features and graphics ( I found woodland battles a bit cumbersome) then this could be a classic. Certainly feel I've had value for money and intend getting in some ideas for how it could improve with relatively little devlopment ahead of any release e.g the early troops you are set up with would benefit from you selecting from a list of available characters rather than the blind random generation which can deliver some real no hopers.\n\nAll in all, an excellent tactical mainly turn based game (the wider map operates in realtime with pause) with plenty of opportunity to indulge in RPG and character development even if they do all look the same with their helmets on :)\n\n\n\n","June 12, 2015","true","183.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Being a fan of games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, this hit a strand and stuck with me.\n\nThe frustration when you have your combat line in formation, archers/crossbows in the back sniping enemies and your foes have one of your men pinned with many wounds and may die at the next hit. There are twice as many enemies on the map and you have only killed a handful. The line holds this mass of troops back but your one brother has been with you since the first day. Do you break the line to rescue the weakened brother but risk being overwhelmed and attacked on all fronts or do you want to take the risk of watching him dodge attack after attack and may see him fall one turn, never to rise again as that man you once fought with.\n\nIn the beginning it can be frustrating, not having the man power nor the equipment so you leave every battle with a loss or two. Later on, its even more frustrating when you have well armored troops who have fought and bled alongside one another for days fall to a chance arrow.\n\nThe game does have elements of fantasy, werewolves, goblics, orcs but they are each a separate force with different skills, tactics, and abilities. The human enemies are just as powerful against an underprepared company.\n\nOn top of this, weapons have wear which takes time to repair. Health can be healed but after a long period of rest. Plus you carry food and arrows that dwindle with time and  battle AND random occurrence. You need to pay your men(I think maybe they could change this part to once a week) and if there is not enough food/money they desert and leave.\n\nI like the realism, the feel of the game, how gritty it gets. Each battle has me on the edge of my seat because I honestly don't know how it can go. An "easy" battle may have one chance arrow that hits my best fighter in the face and I have to watch him die.\n\nOf all the early access games I  have bought, this one is indeed worth the $20 price. It doesn't have half as much as I could want but at its current state, this game fulfills a need that isn't well addressed in many games today. I actually do feel like a commander of a fierce company which has to pick and choose battles due to realistic limitations.\n\n","September 5, 2015","true","26.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

No fancy out-of-this-world fantasy high power name. No sir. Battle Brothers is as fitting as it could be given you will be playing a game about brothers in arms that will fight and survive together, for the dead are better be forgotten.\n\nIt is still being developed mind you, and still it already delivers such a relaxed and maniacal game spirit never seen since Jagged Alliance and Mount and Blade were delivered to us.\n\nAnd why JA and M&B ? Exactly because. Imagine the relaxed tabletop stuff, with figurines and turn based combat. Now add to that a high medieval setting with a taint of fantasy ( not too much, just orcs and other interesting creatures ) and you are set for the fight of your life.\n\nThe artwork is very very pleasing. No shiny false reflections, no colour degradation nor explosive orange FX. No no. You get hand painted artwork. Digital it may be but everything is hand drawn/painted. From the map to the chest up figurines.\n\nMusic. Fitting enough and quite easy on the ears after 30 hours. Mid way between GoT main theme and Pillars of the Earth soundtrack. Not too much heroic nor too dull or offensive on the ears.\n\nMechanics. Pure fun. All the figurines are represented chest up and show EXACTLY at all stages all the stats of the shields, armour, weapons and state of mind of the characters. So they can have chainmail bursting across all seams, a shield barely hanging together and wounds across their face and torso. On top of that, and depending on their will to fight they can be grinning, with a rage face, or in pure shock.\n\nThis simple visual effect almost dispenses any need for HP bars, morale levels and whatever UI that can distract you from the main purpose - kill them all !!!!\n\nVery few games also managed to code fatigue. Battle Brothers makes it a ESSENTIAL tactical element so deployment, equipment, initiative, etc and fatigue are things to manage throughout the battle. And I am not kidding that when in the worst moments your guys can be so fatigued that they barely can hold up their shields or even swing their weapons in any coordinated fashion...\n\nBut the best part, which I find extremely important, is this - everything is procedural. From the backgrounds of the henchmen you can find and hire to the map and battle locations.\n\nThis leads to the most awesome combinations and multitude of characters imaginable with the most interesting traits, which relate a lot to their own biographies. You can find Knights of course, but also Fanatics, Farmers, Flagellants, Miners, Thiefs, Assassins, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton more. Traits vary from the normal Coward to the more interesting Asthmatic so you can start to guess where it all might be going.\n\nIf you played the Jagged Alliance, XCom stuff like a power gamer you won't even appreciate the beauty of this game.\nGreat part, if the not the whole part, of it is going with the flow and trying to wok with what you are offered, be it mercenaries for hire or missions to accomplish.\n\nLet me say that one of the least promising meat bags I hired - you start with three Founders ( also totally generated ) - and then hire other guys to die for them ( literally, you do not want to have a Founder dead... a puppy drowns every time one dies... ) - as I was saying, Imagine being ambushed by a ♥♥♥♥ ton of raiders... your band is full of gluttonous fat asses or asthmatic shield draggers ( literally my warband is a collection of fighters that seems fit for a old age care center or a obese rehabilitation center... they all suffer from something but that is part of the fun )... and then, out of the blue come this figure.. Falk Earthside... the most unimaginable figure to become a great warrior - after all he was a lowly miner with such prowess for battle as I do for knitting ( yes, I almost killed myself with 3 colours... ).\n\nThis Falk Earthside took business like no other. His love for the billhook saved the group many many times since the very first fight. Forget Captain Shepard and saving the universe. This asthmatic death wielding badassoftheweek will be recorded in the annals of whatever chronicles my Historian fighters feels fit to write.\n\nNow, after many many days in the River Pirates Falk is quickly becoming one of the favourites to be Captain. He always grins at the prospect of battle and seeing new recruits being mauled to mushy bloody sacks across the forest.","May 3, 2015","true","45.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

You should like this game if you like small unit medieval games like Mount and Blade or tactical games like X-Com of Jagged Edge.\n\nYou start the game with 3 randomly-generated characters who have statistics covering their hit points, chance to hit, defensive characteristics and other combat-related skills.  You get starting cash to improve their equipment and hire new characters, but you will also need to do quests to keep maintain, equip and expand your company.\n\nAll of your mercenaries have backgrounds that (mostly)  modify these statistics for the positive, or negative or both.  For example, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -- Err -- Illegitmate Son has bonuses to their melee attack skill, but minuses to their morale and melee defense.  In addition, each character may have 1 or more other traits like Dastard which means they cut and run on you easily if combat starts to go sideways.  And yes, you can have a Dastardly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game randomly generates a world populated with a city, several small towns, towers and a castle.  Each of these offer a shop, a place to recruit more warm bodies for your company, and quests.  As of the end of May, the quests are not all that varied.  You can earn money for escorting caravans, delivering stuff on your own to another town, or finding and destroying monster lairs.\n\nThe combat is excellent and where the game is the most fun.  Bandits, orcs and undead in various varieties inhabit the lairs or wander around the map.  They hunt you down if you are weak, and run from you if you are strong.  Combat is turn-based and your mercs and the monsters go in order of their initiative.  Combat is very similar to X-Com.  What makes it very tactically satisfying as that your attacks vary by weapon.  While all have 'normal' attacks, each have one or more special attacks.  Heavy weapons allow you to attack multiple adjacent enemies (and sometimes friends), axes can destroy shields, spears impale enemies moving to attack you.  My personal favorite are the pole weapons, which allow you attack monsters from two hexes away - meaning you can form a shield wall have have your pikemen attack from behind it.\n\nThe combat is also brutal.  Your characters will die -- especially early on when you are likely to have less armor.  You have two armor locations -- the head and the body.  These add extra hit points, and when they go away, damage goes straight to your characters (although some weapons can bypass armor).  Shields add to you chance to avoid being hit.  The problem is many weapons can kill unarmored characters in one or two shots, and in long combats they work through your armor.  Also, when armor is damaged, it needs to be repaired and that takes time and repair equipment.  So if you have several combats in quick succession, you may need to have vulnerable people hang back.\n\nAs you characters level up, get to increase your characteristics and also add traits you choose from 3 skill trees.  (Offensive, Defensive and a utility/leadership tree).\n\nThe game is in early access and lacks a cohesive plot and sufficient variety of enemies and quests.  But the bones of this game are still a lot of fun in its current form.  The good news is the developers just quit all of their day jobs to focus full time on the game.  They promise to add more to address all of these issues, and their track record at additions and fixes even before they quit to live the dream was a good one.  I plan to keep revisiting the game periodically to check on their progress, but would highly recommend this game.","May 30, 2015","true","175.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You must build your mercenary company from the ground up and your first mission is to retaliate the leader of the bandit that ambushed you and killed your brothers!\n\nBattle brothers is a tactical turn-based combat RPG game which you control a band of sellsword(up to 12 char). For me the game is all about freedom/open world because you can go where and whenever you want, which job to take or decline is totally up to you. Even when you decided to take a job and then find it too difficult or you don't feel like doing it, you can cancel it anytime you want.\n\nMercenary jobs in this game are varied and diversified such as killing bad guys, bandits, monsters that troubled the locals (yes, there are lots monsters e.g. goblin, direwolf, werewolf,  orc, ghost and plenty more!) also guarding/escort caravans, delivering package, patroling streets, collecting heads for gold and more. Besieds, there are also politics and stories which is in development since the game is still in early access.\n\nItems in the game are also varied. Usually in most games the armor that has 2 DR would be all the same look and name, in Battle Brothers they have different looks and  names eventhough they have the exact same stats. This attention to detail makes the game fashionable!\n\nThe RPG element is quite basic. You kill the enemies for exp to level up and you get to upgrade your character's stats, perks and stuff but when one or more of your character is gone, they're gone for goods! so be careful in battles, it's harsh and unforgiving\n\nThe last thing to mention is that almost everything in the game is random including events, world map, AI, your starting characters(names, looks, stats) places and stuff. So the game has a very high replay ability. Everytime you start a new game, it's never gonna be the same!\n\nIf you like tactical turn-based RPG, buy the game now.\n"Early access" means nothing for Battle Brothers!\n\n","May 4","true","72.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I never take the time to write reviews but i was compelled to do so for Battle Brothers. This game appealed to me because i loved Final Fantasy Tactics as a kid and have been disappointed time and time again by the genre since. I have Xcom Enemy Unknown (the first game), a game made by a major studio/publisher, yet I am drawn to this indie game more! It is kind of a toss up between this and darkest dungeon. This game has better mechanics but DD is just more polished with an amusing story.\n\nThe Good\n\n-Text Based story is not overbearing but is still engaging, especially when your brothers come to conversate/offer advice. As the contract/faction system fills out this can only improve imho.\n\n-The Characters, each brother you recruit will have different traits (think agents/generals in Rome Total War 2) it gives each of them pros/cons and a personality. For instance I have multiple characters with drinking perks that are either good or bad.\n\n-You can rename any character and bestow him a title, which is both amusing and immersive. The barber shop lets you change their apperance to suit their new names. I love seeing my big fat Hodor chopping peoples heads off with his axe, or an ageless Brett Farve throwing javelins into my foes.\n\n-The economic decisions are both gratifying and fun. All trade goods have a "worth" and a price to buy or sell at that location. For instance I find an orcish axe that is worth 400 but the small fishing village has no use for such a thing only offers me 100 for it. I will probably take this axe with elsewhere and sell it at a better price. You must also provide food, tools, ammo and medical supplies for the company.\n\n-The combat is challenging with dire consequences. If you can't deal with the loss of a favorite brother and are not the kind of gamer who can load and try the fight again, definitely not the game for you.\n\nThe Bad\n\n-The combat, it is really really hard. I picked up this game with my Final Fantasy Tactics swagger and tried to play on the 2nd difficulty "challenging" I was epically crushed by the first fight. The lowest difficulty is "Even" not easy and I think the suggestion of it being even is a cruel joke by the devs.\n\n-The combat animations are a little lack luster. I understand they are like game pieces and the legs won't move or anything but I think some opportunities were missed here. Some animations like a 2handed axe decapitation are spot on, others could just use a little more movement or even audio.\n\n-Everyone has a level, stats ect. However, you can't see the level of your enemies or the mission you are on. You basically go off the name from the scouting report if you get a scouting report that is. I know a bandit thug is weaker than a bandit raider but I dont know exactly how strong they are. It is all relative and has led to fights where I am at a disadvantage both level and gear-wise\n\n-The leveling is compounded by there is no real easy way to level someone. I have 9 brothers that are levels 3 to 4, one dies. A new recruit is level 1 unless you spend 1000s of crowns on him. All of my recruits get slain the first fight and i don't get all of their gear back. Once someone has fallen off the leveling curve it is very hard to get back up. I am going to try putting the new guys as archers but then they may not be doing what they are good at, just hiding to try and get xp which is dictated off damage done.\n\nAll in all I like it but buyer beware. One will either love it or be really frustrated.","March 13","true","27.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShanSanear/recommended/365360/","ShanSanear","Shan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShanSanear/","529 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSmall note regarding game requirments: it DOES work on Intel HD 3000 just fine, only thing lagging a bit is selling/buying stuff but I'm not sure if its caused by that.\n\nDescribing it briefly: it's Mount & Blade's type of wandering on map and general freedom of choice combined with Darkest Dungeon's high difficulty, turn based combat system and permadeath of every character.\n\nA bit more in-depth: this is game about leading pack of maximum 12 mercenaries/sellswords looking for glory and coin. It's done by taking contracts from local people to raid places that are source of their problems (old ruins with bandits, orc's forts and so on), escort caravans or deliver messages to specific place. You can of course do the first one by yourself, but then you are missing opportunity to earn some gold.\n\nLets describe some game concepts and diffrences from sea of other tactical turn based games:\n\n"Skillset" of every mercenary depends on what weapon and perks he has. With hammer you can crush your opponents armor very quickly, with axe - destroy his shield and deal more damage to armor, with two handed axe or sword - swing hitting everyone around character and so on. And of course with shield you can defend yourself, with bow - shoot etc.\n\nAnd when we are at skillsets: character leveling looks similar to typical cRPGs - after level up (max 10 lvl ups) you can choose to increase 3 out of 8 statistics of mercenary: ranged/melee defense/offense, resolve, health, fatigue or initiative and take 1 perk that helps you survive, deal more damage or gives some kind of utility.\n\nSome characters come with traits that can incrase specific statistics (optimist will have higher resolve, though guy will start with bonus health) or decrease (pesimist starts battles with lower resolve, greedy guy wants higher daily payment).\n\nBackgrounds  - every mercenary has his background. One could be farmer, another miller, hunter, bowyer, retired soldier, disowned noble... depending on who he was before, battle brother could have diffrent modifiers to statistics and there could be events regarding those backgrounds. Bowyer wants to create amazing bow, sellsword ask for higher payment because another group would give him more, gambler wants to gamble with you... And this is STILL early access.\n\nFatigue system - I didn't like it at first, but then I understood why it was put here in the first place.\nEvery skill cost points of fatigue (beside action points like in most turn based games) - from something like 5 points to even 20+ for single use.\nTo put it into perspective - every character starts with around 100 points of fatigue to start with. Doesn't sound that bad? Every piece of equipment character is carrying decrease maximum amount of fatigue you can have during fight.\n\nFor example normal sword takes around 8 points, helmet from 5 to even 20 torso armor from mere 6 for armor that wont survive one hit up to even 40 for plate. You can end up with guy having 40 points of fatigue left during fight. Sure, enemies will have hard time hitting him, but before he even reach them he will be to exhausted to swing his sword once.\n\nYet after training the same character can have 2x more of said fatigue with the same equipment but it takes some time to do so.\n\nEquipment - fair variety of armors... but I feel there is not enough weapons. Only 2 kinds of "standard" bows, 1 type of crossbow... At least developers said its going to change.\n\nWorld map - feels similar to Mount & Blade, but there isn't much happening - most of the time it's going from A to B, attack enemies, tactical battle, go back to A to get your reward - rinse and repeat. There is no incentive to explore map too much, because at least for now there is no reward beside gold, resources and sometimes better weapon to begin with.\n\nQuests - I saw only 5 types of them: go to another town/village to deliver message (♥♥♥♥♥♥ payment, most of the time its not even worth it) escort caravan (most of the time payment is low and forces you to stay close to caravan) destroy/find location (best/low payment) and sometimes killing specific group of enemies. New quest system is in development, probably much better than this.\n\nFor me this is one of the best (if not the best) tactical rpg-esque games I played (and one of few I bought for nearly full price). Feeling of nearly perfect battle when none of your 12 men died but you took 20+ enemies to their graves is priceless. If you are into quite difficult, brutal and unforgiving strategic game - this is something for ya.","December 31, 2015","true","64.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Gameplay is a refreshing mix of a gritty, morally ambiguous open-world experience with methodical tactical combat ala classics like FFT. In a world filled with undead, orcs and more, you can expect that your mere human Brothers will die quickly, and often. Combat can be unforgiving, but gives you a real sense of reward when you manage to pull it off. XCOM fans will not be disappointed here.\n\nTheme and art style are also well done. Brothers have this interesting chess piece-like feel to them (being represented by only disembodied torsos), but their randomly generated names, backgrounds and traits lend a surprising amount of character to each one. By the time your Brothers hack their way through a few battles, chances are that you'd have quite the soft spot for your mangy warband; with stories to tell your friends of the time "Reinhold the Torturer" made that sick Hail Mary arrow shot at max range or when "Otto the Fisherman" demolished 8 zombies all by himself.\n\nAs of current, there is a huge new update on the horizon. The planned feature list is tremendous, and the additions and overhauls seem set to add more gameplay value to the existing product. Definitely consider picking this one up.","January 13","true","44.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laiseurjika/recommended/365360/","laiseurjika","Laiseurjika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laiseurjika/","12 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI didn't lose my job, and still have a two-hour journey to get there, and another two-hour journey to get home, and don't take a laptop on my travels, but somehow I've still racked up c. 750 hrs in 5 months. Despite that, I've ONLY JUST discovered that you can also LEVEL-UP mercenaries each time they gain a new perk ...\n\nHere's a review/guide, with the caveat that the game's getting updated in a couple of weeks and so some of what follows may no longer be relevant.\n\nOne of the downsides of the game is that certain aspects (e.g. travel for lucrative contracts) can be quite monotonous. One of the many upsides, though, is that you can accumulate riches (or, more importantly, lots of heavy arms) by other means (i.e. loot). Another upside is that there are no rigid objectives that dictate too much of the gameplay; you can experiment and play in the ways that are most enjoyable to you.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the game (i.e. the perk system that allows individual mercenaries to unlock special skills as they gain more experience) results in something of a dilemma. It is addictive to to build up your band and its individuals by strategically selecting perks that allow them to acquire an almost super-human ability to overcome formiddible foes, but you gradually become more cautious and inhibited with them as this happens, since one lucky strike could result in the loss of a vital veteran into whose path you have invested such time and care. Now you no longer fight the battles that are the most fun to fight - I mean the bloodbaths where everyone's life, lungs and consciousness are hanging from threads and the outcome could easily sway either way thanks to some unlikely hits/misses or a sudden shift in morale.\n\nThe game is more engrossing if you try to develop lots of distinctive characters with their own appearance, arms, style etc., but with this approach you want to try out different types of recruit and find it almost impossible to not hire one with an interesting description. The downside of this is that more mercenaries in your band = fewer Experience Points gained by each individual member and a much slower rate of perks gained. If you aim for a rapid gain of perks before all else, your band may start to look like homogenous heavily mailed machines with crossbows hidden in their pockets ...\n\nSo there is some antagonism between (a) enjoying the game as much as possible and (b) fighting as pragmatically as possible, but winning battles and not getting killed is also important for enjoying the game, and so the following tips may come in handy ...\n\n- The Utility branch of the perk tree is the most important. Some of the Offensive and Defensive perks increase the chance of hitting an opponent or reduce the chance of getting hit, but many of the Utility ones can achieve both at once - e.g. Pathfinder makes it much easier to take high ground, which immediately increases your chance to hit (and reduces your chance of being hit) by 10% (it also makes it easier to retreat, withdraw or pursue fleeing foes). Bags and Belts allows you to reduce fatigue and carry a wide assortment of weapons that can be drawn to suit each situation (e.g. you can use a large axe to destroy a shield that provides +30/40% defence in a shieldwall, and then you can take out a spear that is less fatiguing to use and that has a +20% chance to hit). With Quick Hands you can arm yourself with a lethal 2-hands weapon in an advantageous position and still switch back to a big shield before the enemy has much/any chance to attack you (especially if your opponent has less initiative and you've waited your turn). Shield Bash is an underrated perk, since it makes the shield a weapon (one with a +25% chance to hit) and makes a useful skill (Knock Back) much more energy-efficient. Shield Bash allows you to take advantageous terrain, protect an imperilled accomplice and/or push an enemy into an imperilled position. Battle Flow is the best of all possible perks. Inspiring Presence is also splendid, but it causes you to become more cautious. Rally the Troops is a costly skill and requires that a veteren be kept away from too much combat ('tis better, easier and altogether sexier, methinks, to give everyone Battle Flow).\n\n- One Defensive perk every member of your band ought to have is the not-too-sexy-sounding Hold Out. This does not prevent recruits from dropping to lower morale states, but they retain their fighting abilities when they do so, which makes all the difference in one of those encounters where everyone's life, lungs and consciousness are hanging from threads. They also gain +10% attacking and defensive abilities when at confident morale (which they will all be to start with if one of your band is an Inspiring Presence). Colossus (i.e. hit points up by 25%) is also very desirable, since there are some weapons (e.g. crossbows and puncturing daggers/knives) that can do a lot of damage to hit points even through heavy armour.\n\n- Most of the Offensive perks are too specific to be so useful, but some of them are highly desirable for a specialist archer. Fast Adaptation is great paired with Quick Hands, since you can miss with a low-cost attack and then have a +15% chance to hit with an attack that is fatiguing and/or is usually less likely to hit (e.g. Puncture, Knock Out, Round Swing) ...\n\n- Fighting vs Wolf Packs is a brilliant way of gaining lots of Experience Points, since the werewolves have lots of hit points to compensate for their lack of armour. However, they also have lots of intrinsic attacking and defensive skills to compensate for their lack of weapons and shields, and have 12 Action Points per turn that allow them to attack you three times per turn in melee, where they can quickly cut through heavy armour with their claws. An effective strategy against this is to prioritize large shields over heavy armour, to form a communal shieldwall while energy allows, and to attack with light, accurate weapons (e.g. spears, swords, knives). If most of your band are grizzled veterans and you're not significantly outnumbered, heavy armour and two-handed swords can also be effective. If most of your band are skilled/perked and have lots of stamina, clubs/bludgeons/maces and Knock Out can be effective.\n\n- It's worth giving everyone a dagger as a back-up weapon. Carrying a dagger costs 0 fatigue and two stabs with it cost less fatigue than is recovered each turn. It can make all the difference at the end of an epic battle when everyone's injured and fatigued. It's also great if you have Quick Hands and Fast Adaptation and want to use the Puncture skill to kill a bandit or zombie without destroying that lovely suit of armour ...\n\n- Bludgeons don't do much damage but are very cheap and very durable (32 condition pts) and look cool (much cooler than clubs). They can also be used (albeit at high cost) to stun a dangerous enemy (i.e. cause them to miss a turn, so that a comrade can attack them or escape from combat). Well worth having as a back-up weapon with Bags and Belts (and especially with Quick Hands and Fast Adaptation as well) ...\n\n- Swords are not as accurate as spears (and more expensive), are more fatiguing than daggers, are less effective against armour, and (unlike axes) cannot destroy shields (exception: 2-handed greatswords). Don't waste money on them, but it's worth retaining a few looted ones if you plan to fight lots of werewolves or if you want to use the Sundering Strikes perk ...\n\n- Warbrands can be used x2 per turn (unlike other 2-handers) and do lots of damage (effective vs armour) and still have +10% accuracy. Splendid with Quick Hands and a big shield as back-up ...\n\n- If you give a recruit a bow or crossbow, ensure that said recruit also has some ammunition (and the right type of ammunition)!\n\n- Leaving injured, demoralized enemies alive in melee can = fresh, confident enemies unable to close and still vulnerable to arrows/bolts ...","October 11, 2015","true","215.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","17","24","7","1"

Goblins are a plague upon the earth, their existence is unacceptable and as such we must exterminate them all.\n\nShouted The Black Wolf to his men, a extract from the writings of Roderick the Wise.\n\nA tale of Devils, born in hell, but made to save mortal men.\n\nWell my fellow adventure seeking travelers, I have come to you with a little story to tell. Have you heard word of a mighty mercenary band called Hellborn Battalion, led my Marius the Black Wolf, his brother Christian the Scholar, and their good friend Sebastian the Berserker. Together with their mercenary companions they traveled the land cleansing the forests of goblin filth, removing treacherous bandits from the roads and destroying vile undead abominations. This they had done so successfully for a long time until chance had it a encounter in the southern swamps, a band of Orcs was reported to be raiding nearby communities so the Hellborn marched forth to meet the threat, little did they know the Orcs might was more then just the stuff of legend. As the brave brothers fought of waves of Orc young it became apparent they were only the light infantry of the orc force and soon their orc warriors strode in, the true masters of the battle field. They lumbered forth wielding their mighty weapons clad in the cobbled together ruins of many a brave fallen knight armor. Keeping their archers safe while they rained down punishment on the greenskin fighters the Hellborn Battalion toiled to see their foes vanquished, shields splintered, spears cracked to pieces, swords were shaken and much blood was split. But finally it was the orcs who were defeated, shaken, tired and wounded the Hellborn Battalion rallied to their leaders for support. Marius and Christian thanked their brothers in arms for the brave deed they had performed, and made forward to celebrate their victory and lick their wounds. Not more then a week had passed however and a nother orc warband fell before the Hellborn, the strength of their leadership so praise worthy, that even a untrained apprentice with little equipment, who was only recruited to boost the Battalions ranks temporarily, survived the battle against all odds.\n\nThe company then prepared itself for the brave goal of removing another orc clan as they had made their camp near a important city hailed by the Hellborn as their home. The battle was more fierce and terrifying then any yet recorded, man and beast fought each other tooth and nail, but ultimately the orc warlord and his warriors were destroyed, and only one of the Hellborn Battalion lost his life that day.\n\nTo this day I hear proud merry talk in the taverns, markets and even noble courts of people claiming justified or not, they had associated with the valiant Hellborn Battalion, and spreading tales of their famed exploits. Where they may be now, I cannot say. But I know this, if there is an orc, goblin or undead in their path it wont be standing there for much longer. However while I hail them as heroes, I would prefer we have no use for them, for they are indeed the devils of the battle ground and where ever they go, danger is surely present.","November 23, 2015","true","359.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The characters look fantastic, as does the equipment. It makes the world a joy to play in, and the art does a great job of roping you into the experience.\n\nThe combat is excellent. There's a wide variety of weapons, all with different advantages and disadvantages.; The hex grid turn-based combat is hardly revolutionary, but it's a well done rendition. It allows for tons of differnt strategies to be used. Wanna form a shieldwall of spearmen while you send your axe-wielding barbarians right into the fray? Wanna use one tank of a man to keep every enemy occupied while you use the rest of your men to pick them off one by one? Wanna use an elite core of archers to keep the enemy at a distance while your spearmen protect them? There's just so much possibility. There's a perfect amount of attributes, such as morale and fatigue, that add extra depth to the combat and force you to manage your use of your men even more. The combat is brutal and unforgiving, but fair. The AI will take advantage of any mistakes you make, and will pick apart your defenses and make your seemigly unbeatable battle plans look foolish. They are just challenging enough to be fun and not hard enough to be frustrating. There's also a huge variety of environments, such as swamps and snow, to add an extra factor to your battles.\n\nA big part of this game is your party of mercs itself. Every man you can get in the game is unique in their own way. They have their own appearances, as well as randomly generated backgrounds that explain what led them to come look for work as a mercenary. These backstories result in different buffs and debuffs to certain characters. For example, a hedge knight will be better in combat than, say, a former slave, but the former slave may have higher health due to having been hardended over his years as a slave. Permadeath is a huge part of this game. As your party grows bigger and stronger, you will become attached to your men. They will have gone through so many dangerous battles under your command. That's why it's so sad every time a bandit or werewolf carves their head clean off.\nThe worldmap is awesome. Every game presents a new, unique, randomly generated world for your motley crew to explore. This includes plenty of different towns and fortresses, as well as caves and bandit hideouts for you to attack. There's a wide variety of factins (also random) in every world, that have their own memebers. These factions have their own armies and towns, and getting on their good side is usually a good idea. There are also evil factions of orcs and goblins that will ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up if you wander to far into the forest unprepared. There's plenty to keep you occupied in the world around you. When you're not slaughtering baddies and escorting caravans, you can get wasted at a tavern or talk with the townspeople. You can even give your guys a full makeover at the barber.\n\nOverall, this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece. It's wonderfully constructed by passionate devs. Even though the game is practically done enough for a full release, the devs are constantly adding more content and have no plans to stop any time soon. My only gripe is that there's no way real way to tell the difficulty of a mission before you take it. But that's miniscule compared to the kickassery of this game. It's an IMMEDIATE buy.

I was hesitant at first since one can never be too careful when it comes to early access. But I can honestly say that this game, even at this stage worths every cent.\n\nIt feels and plays like the turn based and low fantasy version of Mount&Blade so if you like that game there is a huge chance that you will also enjoy Battle Brothers.\n\nIt is challenging but easy to learn because of simple mechanics and clean user interface. Music is decent, sounds effects are enjoyable. Graphics and art style is really nice as you can see from the screenshots. There are lots of ways to customise your companions, with different kinds of helmets, weapons and armors. You can level up your battle brothers and choose different perks. Each battle brother has their own unique backgrounds like some are hedge knights, some are sellswords while some of them are just simple farmers. They also have unique perks like some of your companions may have deathwish (doesn't care about morale and will keep fighting) or some of them may be bloodthirsty (all his kills will be fatalities) so such small details make each battle brother unique and adds to atmosphere.\n\nGame is very stable and bug free. New updates are looking great, especially the one with standart bearers and knights (with helmet decorations) , factions and royal houses to give a nice medieval atmosphere, devs keep polishing and making old content better. Updates are pretty frequent so I doubt this game will be one of those early acess games that will stay beta for several years and devs jumping on a new project.\n\nSo if you are interested with turn based games I am pretty sure you won't regret Battle Brothers.\n\n","November 26, 2015","true","29.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Battle Brothers has everything from resource managing, (food stock, mercenary wages, tools, etc.) to being able personaly name each and every merc you hire. Although, you might want to wait to see if your men will survive their first taste of combat before even bothering to learn their names. Combat in this game is well thought out and challenging be sure to pick your battles wisely if you can.. Fights are scary you'll be praying that the enemy dosent finish off one of your men with their next axe swing or that the enemy archer dosent find his mark. Expect to lose many men but dont be discoraged constant battle will birth ture warriors out of those lucky enough to see their next sunrise. Watch as that farm boy you hired harden into a true warrior as he survived time and time again as his fellow brothers fell around him day after gruesome day. He only started off with the rags on his back and that rusty thing he called a "weapon". Two months later he stands beside you shield locked to yours ready to fight more fearsome foes. I digress if you want a game that fills you with a sense of acomplishment just for managing to survive past a month buy this game. ps. I dare you to not save.\n\nEdit: Since the major update that changed the entire world map the game has at least 4x as much content. Not only that but the game has been balanced considerably and is much more enjoyable now. I love seeing developers care about their game and these developers have provided  and are continuing to provide major updates. This is the only early access game that ive bought that hasent let me down.","July 4, 2015","true","115.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Here is my evaluation of the game, along with some suggestions for future content:\n\nPros:\n+ Well-balanced perk system and lots of build choices.\n+ Diverse range of gear to use.\n+ combat morale system makes sense most of the time.\n+ Diverse range of opponents and very good AI.\n+ Great storylines and random events.\n+ Scenarios.\n+ naming your crew and company of course.\n\nNeutral:\n= RNG in this game: Great when you get a critical ranged hit against an enemy before they fight because they didn't wear a helmet. Terrible when you swing for a melee hit with a 75% chance and still miss.\n= I guess I understand this, but AI units on the map move like 15% faster than you so you either can never quite catch up unless they change course a bit or head into a swamp or mountain, or the enemy pretty much always catches you. I guess if this wasn't in the game, it would be too easy to move around especially if you got good reflexes.\n\nCons:\n- Fleeing brothers deliberately flee towards the enemy and get chopped to bits, even when they have a clear avenue to escape.\n- Dog AI sometimes a bit derpy when they run into an enemy zone of control and then try to move to another tile within enemy ZoC with risk of dying from free hit.\n- Arguably, a rather limited range of strategies when dealing with orc warriors and warlords. I personally think the orc warriors have too much fatigue points.\n- difficulty levels in missions sometimes misleading, usually underestimating the difficulty of a mission by 1 skull.\n\n\nSuggestions for future content:\n> Higher max level + a new perk category tailored to the former professions of your brothers (e.g. hunters, bowyers, butchers, fishermen, raiders, etc.). Each profession would have its own perk system and each brother can only have access to the category allocated by their profession. Not sure whether there should be a beggar category.\n> More perks in each existing category and maybe shifting some of the tier 2 utility categories into the other perk categories, like weaponmaster going to attack and brawny going to defence. I think utility should be more neutral in having skills that benefit both attack and defence, not just one or the other.\n> More storyline missions for later in game, where maybe a war breaks out and one of the Houses requests you to join them in some massive battle aginst either some other House or against the orcs or goblins.\n> The Houses expand their Empire by capturing neutral settlements and subjecting them under their control. Along with that, there could be rebellions you could receive a mission to either help with the expansion or rebellion.\n> An Elvish race, a neutral, sometimes hostile, but highly territorial race specializing in high quality units but fewer numbers. They usually situate themselves in forests.\n> A Dwarf race, also neutral, sometimes hostile, but highly territorial race specializing in a weird mix between what orcs and goblins specialize in. They usually situate themselves on mountains.\n> other roaming mercenary bands, which may either be neutral or hostile. You generally need to keep tabs on them because they'll compete with you for contracts and/or any available contracts would offer less. They may be situations where you'll have to go into some reverse auction with another mercenary band just to get the job (e.g mercenary group who demands the least amount of pay gets the job).\n> maybe some rough terrain for battles in mountains.\n> private merchant missions, some of which may offer you a huge list of supply and demand for certain resources so you don't have to do so much guess work to figure out where you can make a profit using highly priced resources.\n> being able to change emblems on your shield to fit with your actual company emblem.\n> some way to see enemy buffs and what they do.\n\nOverall, there is so much potential with the game. I look forward to seeing more updates and for those interested in Battle Brothers, it's well worth the money to try this game.\n","April 10","true","134.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The graphics style for pawns and items is functional yet simple and fits the game. It does take a bit to get used to the pawns being literally pawns (chess game piece; your men and enemies are represented torso up on a base, no legs), but after a while I didn't notice anymore. I found no example where graphics clashed, everything seems to mesh together.\n\nThere is already a variety of contracts your Battle Brothers can do (Escorting a caravan, delivering messages, finding landmarks, taking out enemy hideouts). There are several different enemies (Orc, Bandit, Undead at least) which have several different units as well.\nThey look different enough usually (since equipment shows up on the pawns) so it doesn't look like a generic enemy lineup.\n\nYou can save anytime, except in battle (which I presume is to prevent save scumming). Battles don't last that long, as you are limited to 12 guys and the AI is pretty quick in moving (esp. when moving pawns outside your view).\n\nThere doesn't seem to be to much end content as of right now (April 30th, 2015), but that isn't that bad an issue. Roaming the lands till you have your pawns leveled up and kitted in the best possible stuff is going to take a while (and along the way you'll probably lose some pawns you hold dear and have to replace).\n\nThe devs are very responsive and open to suggestions. This does seem to be an EA which is EA because the devs actually want feedback and want customers to be able to influence the final product.\n\n___\nThis game is already pretty fun if you like the combat and managing your own little warband.

That's just a rule I have to prevent lazy developers from dropping their project all together and leaving me with an unfinished piece of trash. But with Battle Brothers it was different from the get-go. Something screamed "genious" at me. Basically, it was all the fact that the game reminded me of several successful and interesting games of similar genres: Warband, FF:Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Shadow of the Horned Rat and many dungeon crawlers.\n\nThe game has an open world with non lineal quests that you complete only to improve your starting party and get more items to fit the style of fighting you want. This already allows for many types of party building, trying out new weapons, armor and whatever tools you can get your grabby hands on. The weapons have different abilities to reflect this variety in playstyle. Their use is very satisfying. Decapitating, impaling, stunning... All of these have their uses and add diversity to the combat. You can equip each character with whatever you think suits your warband best.\nOf course, your characters can also learn new abilities to improve their combat capabilities, like any good RPG. However, these skills do REALLY have a significant but not game-breaking impact. It reminds me of the table top verson of Mordheim, to be honest. Most importantly tho, the xp system rewards your guys for fighting, so of course you want to do that as much as possible. However that puts your mercenaries in a risk of dying, so you have to choose your engagements carefully. Luckly, the level ups feel rewarding after managing to survive with your fresh recruits for a while, so that's a huge plus. Increasing stats like melee skill or fatigue can really change the course of a battle later in the game.\n\n\nThe world map and quests are fairly simple and akin to those of Warband. You kill baddies, protect a caravan, deliver something and get gold in return. Pretty straightforward. You do get a bit of "lore" and backstory on certain events or characters, which adds to the fluff of the game. The most fun in the world map are the random events: certain characters may ask for more money, tell you something about their past, etc. You also have to make decisions, mostly revolved around morality, similar to how games like FTL do it. Something that is also really fun is the recruitment system. Every mercenary gets his piece of backstory and sometimes an alias to go with it. But most importantly, they have a defining trait, which is their profession. For example, a Raider may be more brave and skillful, but a farmer may be stronger and more durable. Hiring the right people is crucial if you want to survive late game... unless you enjoy cannon fodder being seint to the slaughter.\n\nThe combat tho, is where this game does it really well. However, it's also where the biggest flaws reside. Essentially, your band starts lined up if possible, facing the incoming force. You know the number of enemies you're facing when you enter combat but you may not have line of sight on them. Then the enemy either rushes or sits back depending on their race or party composition. The combat is responsive. Every hit feels right, breaking armor or making an enemy bleed. Also, you have to position yourself in a diferent way depending on who you're facing: too many throwing weapons? Advance your sword and board guys. Too many spears? Lob ♥♥♥♥ at them and shoot them. Depending on the map you may also have to reposition the soldiers that are left stranded so that they don't get overwhelmed early on. It rewards you for micromanaging your fatigue and armor too, so spamming attacks isn't necessarily a good idea all the time.\n\nHowever, here's where the most glaring issues come into play, IMO. My biggest gripe is that a lot of the fights just end with your party clumped up fighting off the incoming horde of AI. There's not much tactical positioning when fighting in plains, as opossed to fighting in swamps or the forest. So, sometimes the difficulty comes from simply bad luck instead of strategic thinking. As stupid as this may sound, this could easily be fixed with something other games have, which is AOE attacks. If most battles reward you for sticking close together, then force even the most trivial of fights to become a hassle for the player. I think more diversity in terms of AI playmaking would be nice as well.\n\nWith all that said, the game also has other pluses to add, mainly great and detailed art and a fenomenal soundtrack. My gratitude goes towards the composers, for creating such pleasant background music to listen to.\n\nSo, all in all, I'd say this game is totally worth the current 20$ or € it costs. Do yourself a favour and buy it so it may grow further. Hoping to see more products from these guys in the future.\n\nTL;DR Version:\n\nPluses:\n\n+Fun combat\n+Good weapon variation\n+Good character variaton\n+Rewarding skill system\n+Pretty art\n+Great score\n\nCons:\n\n-Overly simple quests\n-Simplistic combat in certain scenarios\n-Orcs (♥♥♥♥ these guys :( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 17","true","58.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is awesome.\n\nTherefore my first review.\nAltough still in Early Access it allready has a detail, depth and replayability worthy of most full titles.\nDevelopers name X-Com titles, Mount & Blade and Warhammer games as References.\nUpdates happen every couple of days and improve the allready pretty good game each time significantly. I honestly yearn for every new update with exitement and look forward to the new implemented changes and additions.\n\n\nTo pick up on the missing story critique\nThis game creates its story out of itself. Its a sandbox game where story happens and develops out of random events and individual decisions. I can still remember how i hired my first Hedge Knigt nicknamed "The Giant". Could have upped armor for half of the company instead but i wanted to have him. Couple of days and fights later he's dead and the cash gone. This game is immersive as hell if you like this kind of games and don't miss a scripted story driven development. Still i see the point.\n\nI have tried the normal and hard (one above) difficulty. With some experience in similar tabletop and pcgames normal difficulty is quite playable (from a certain point on possibly quite easy) but for novices to the genre probably demanding. Surely in parts because of a missing tutorial or handbook. On the next difficulty level things turned really demanding quickly and led to a more careful approch to missions and enemies. Fights had to be picked more carefully and Information about the enemy and adapting equipment became key. After the first hours played learning curve turned pretty steep supported by community guides. New combos and enlightening toughts shine on the horizon regularily.\nStill developers tip: "Prepare to loose soldiers" ain't there for no reason.\n\nAs i have to come to an end, 2-3 Suggestions:\n\n1) I just have to ask: Is there any chance to implement multiplayer in this game???\n2) Permadeath is pretty hard an can lead to a save/load reactions, hampering the progress, for me its hard to cope loosing men so often. What about a death/injury handling as in Warhammers Tabletops Mordheim & Necromunda? It would add to character individualisation and binding. It would be an alternative to take the hardness out of permadeath (which still would be optional) Shadow of the horned rat is allready a reference :) It would also eventually allow for nonplayer bands to roam longer and built up a history of its own.\n3)  Getting out of close combat is pretty hard. Either get hit and stay or get away are two optional outcomes if you try to move out. Something like light hit and leave in between? Retreat out of a battle in total is rarely an option.\n\n\nMinor personal remarks:\n1) Terrain is sometimes hard to differentiate. Trees can be overseen if a character stands behind it. Different height levels sometimes hard to tell apart.\n2) Possibility to customize setup at the start of battle is missing and hinders tactical preparation. But developers allready announced this feature.\n3) Contract types are few so far but more will be implemented over time.\n\nSo far in over 70h played the game only stuck once when a special event on the world map overlapped with starting tactical combat and neither could be activated properly.","March 29","true","143.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game is an excellent combination of RPG, Turn based combat, and strategy. If you enjoy Medieval games that will challenge you then look no further. Even in it's current early access phase the game will easily draw you in for 100+ hours. With Random generated maps and Characters the replay value is very high.

You can assemble a group of up to 12 mercenaries and you take on various contracts. The contract can range from caravan escorting to assaulting an Orc camp. As mentioned previously the battles are turn based. Your men start off some distance in a line opposite of the enemy. The outcome of the battle depends on your gear, level, and stat and skill distributions.\n\nI have had the game for close to a year now and it has had some significant changes, especially with the latest update at the end of February. The contracts are more interesting now and the map is more "alive".\n\nBottom-line: if you have been on the fence about buying this game, or if it seems interesting to you go ahead and buy it.

For example losing a key soldier in this game is a lot more tragic and will have a much stronger effect on your combat capabilities than in X-COM.\n\nWhen I lost a key soldier in X-COM, I bought another "blank page" soldier for next to nothing got a few kills with it and sorted. When I lose a key soldier in Battle Brothers I howl in horror, shout at the screen, tear some of my hair out, weep a little, then suck it up and carry on. There is of course the option to run-around quick-saving and just re-load when you fail, but that kinda kills the atmosphere of the game, for me at least.\n\nThis game, for me, is the definition of gameplay over graphics. I recently invested in a brand-spanking new GPU and here I am playing Battle Brothers, ha.\n\nPlease note that Goblins are going to make you rage, avoid them until you're stronger or just be aware that they are a real headache to fight. Been a lot of Q_Q about these opponents but I personally enjoy the challenge. I hope they don't nerf the difficulty too much, most games these days take <1 hour to master. I will admit, I do quick-save, but only before battles against goblins, cuz they will net you down and have their way with you, like... 20 inches of it with no lube. Don't say I haven't warned you. But they are beatable, fight them at night so their ranged weapons are less accurate, use shields to block some projectiles and never ever just try to rush them unless your men are SUPER tough.\n\nIf you want a challenging game that requires a lot of thinking aswell as being enjoyable and involves a lot of risk/gambles, I would definetly recommend this game.\n\nIf you can't handle a challenge and are going to cry about the difficulty go sit in the corner with the other 99% and play Call'o'Duty. Thanks.\n\n9/10. Would restart 15 times over again to see what name my character get's, only to realise I can change all the character names and titles myself.

A mashup of my two favorite games: X-Com and Mount&Blade.\nMy dream game!\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Game is punishingly difficult, a positive in my opinion.\n-Procedural world generation which provides a lot of replay value, even in its early development state.\n-Traits and backgrounds system add a lot of character to the brothers.\n-Really like the art style and the variation of appearance of the brothers.\n-Combat sounds are VERY well done. The weapon impacts sounds are great.\n-Quests are generated depending on the state of the game world. Really cool.\n-Good combat AI. The AI will intelligently take(and fight for) positions on the battlefield, form battle lines, and exploit weaknesses in your lines. I'm happy the devs didn't skip out on this part. Makes the battles more intense and dangerous.\n\nTHE OK:\n-Combat relies heavily on RNG. This doesn't bother me much, but will definately annoy some people. There is enough variables in combat though to allow for tactical play.\n-Limited amount of quest types, although I'm pretty sure more will be added in the future.\n\nTHE BAD: (Game is still in development, so these things will most likely get fixed)\n-BUGS.

It is already very playable at EA stage. Only thing missing IMO is content (campaign, more different mission types, mainly). I love managing my merc company and arming them with loot and purchases.

This is even hightened by other perks that chars can have in the beginning (like fast/fragile/brute etc) that give them benefits or maluses.

You ll have to put your skills to the test here. Unforgiving combat and perma death means that you need  serious planning. Money and inventory management, as well as the mood of your comrades(you can buy them beer and they get their morale boost...SWEET!). Now, expect losses, many losses... You will lose many men, thats for sure, but you ll enjoy the adventure. It is survival of the fittest(and sometimes the luckiest...) Random events contribute to the immersion, and give an old school text rpg flavour. The music is really good, creates this eerie medieval, rather than epic fantasy, music. Overall, a good game, though it certainly needs one big final update. I know that the people behind it put a great effort, and i read about the update coming up in February(with new maps, detailed cities, more factions, etc etc-CANT WAIT), so i wish them all the best and keep up the good work!

You basically lead a mercenary band in a free roam environment(think a bit like mount and blade mapwise) where you pick up contracts and earn money in order to develop your mercenary band. Naturally, the game is rather punishing even though you're playing on the lowest difficulty(even) like me. I generally lose a soldier almost every mission and I'm always just as sad when it happens. As you progress your soldiers will become more defensive if you so choose meaning casualties will decrease. But there are several ways to play the game and you can naturally focus on more offensive tactics as well which is more risky but might be fun.\n\nI can easily see this game becoming a classic alike mount and blade since the gameplay is so fun and addictive.\n\nPoor Dietrich was the just died when writing this review. :(","March 13","true","77.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I thought the premise was cool but I have never been a fan of turn based RTS games. One rainy day I had money burning a hole in my Steam wallet and I bought it, to say that I was pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. Games like Interstellar Marines killed my faith in early access but this game has restored it. I love the low fantasy Medieval theme, and the art style is simple yet beautiful. On the surface the game seems fairly straight forward and easy to grasp. I thought it was going to be a cake walk, but I was taken aback by the hidden intricacies and depth of the game. I have been eagerly awaiting the new update scheduled for tomorrow: 02/29/2016 which is notable because this is a leap year. I just can't stop thinking about how much more enjoyable the game will be with the new changes and I already have a blast playing it. I really appreciate how active and dedicated the development team is, and I have a strong feeling that they will deliver an amazing product once the game is fully released. 10/10 Donkeypunches, 7/7 Stars, 34289/34289 Orc Warriors.

You roam around a procedurally generated map adopting quests, random events and contracts as a means to feed, sate, equip, heal, repair and maintain your company of hired men. Much like xcom they can be outfitted to any equipment you want, upgraded (if they survive) in a small manner of RPG mechanics, and given their own name and appearances of your choosing. Yes, you can make your party of friends and equip them to survive, only to be torn down by ghouls in six minutes.\n\nRoaming the map feels a lot like Darklands. You go from village to village and encounter some kind of contract, alement or quest. Admittedly it's a thin herd of options right now but as early access trudges on, so does the feature list. Today they just added an entirely reworked world map, economy, and politics system -- and there's more to come.\n\nCombat is turn based and tactical. It's simplistic and easy to be punished for and needs some balance tweaks, (RNG is very real for some weapons) but it gets better every update. Permadeath is a feature -- you can and will lose your company, either entirely or partially, almost every fight. One whirring arrow can catch your eye and that's that for your favorite level 4 merc.\n\nEnemies include ferocious, unique Orcs. Terrifiyng undead/ghouls, and enemy mercs/bandits/robbers/militia that stand in your way. Fighting each 'faction' feels unique and punishing. Orcs will slaughter, take double turns, cut off your heads. Ghouls will rise back up RIGHT next to you and kill you. Humans use evasion, tactics and flanks.\n\nCould talk about it all day. You've played this game before, but worse.

Ulrich the Fearless fell into his own category, and became a legendary warrior the skalds will sing about for generations to come.\n\nHis story, you ask? Like all great tales, no one really knows how it started. A wildman that emerged from the forests, baring numerous scars from battles with werewolves and other beasts, he mysteriously wandered into the swamp town of Thurgau and joined the White Wolves Mercenary Company while they were recruiting locals.\n\nNo one understood anything he said, but it didn't seem to matter; his natural athleticism and bloodlust were unmatched on the field of battle. Spear, club, sword; he was deadly with any weapon you put into his hands. The billhook eventually became his weapon of choice, as he was rather fond of dragging screaming enemies back into reach and then hacking them to pieces.\n\nYou couldn't call him a gentle soul; on more than one occasion he bludgeoned a rabbit to eat it raw or stuffed a butterfly into his mouth after catching it mid-air. Despite his glaring lack of social graces in modern society, he earned the respect of the White Wolves company a dozen times over. He single handedly held the line against a never ending wave of Wiedergangers on a few occasions, artfully swung his billhook to hew down scores of young and warrior orcs alike while his comrades manned the shield wall, and even sprinted across the battlefield to save the archers that had been surrounded by goblin wolf riders.\n\nHis heroic end is fitting of all warriors that reside in Valhalla among the Gods. After a grueling battle in the swamps near Thurgau where he first met the White Wolves, a very large orc camp was sending out routine raiding parties to ransack the nearby villages. The crowns were too good to pass up despite the danger, and there was a certain sense of duty to raze the place to the ground. The local soldiers at Heimwart Tower could barely keep the roads clear of bandits and goblins, let alone launch an attack on an orc camp.\n\nA handful of berserkers and young orcs were the first in the orc battle line, but they were the riff raff, the first wave to wear down the White Wolves to make room for their warriors and chieftain. 10 warriors quickly surrounded the company after the first wave fell or burst through the shield wall in the center, using their overpowering strength and mass to simply knock the defenders out of the way.\n\nUlrich already had three kills to his credit, and once the shield wall broke, he was the first one in to hold the line and keep it from completely shattering. The carnage he rained down on the orc warriors felt as if the company were standing at the gates of hell watching a demon flay mortals alive. Again and again, his billhook split armor, dismembered limbs, or severed an orc's head free of it's body until only a handful remained.\n\nSuch was his fury, that even after his weapon shattered in his hands he did not stop, did not relinquish his position on the line. The last image the company saw of Ulrich the Fearless alive he was locked in a violent melee with the orc chieftain using his fists to keep the orc on the defensive while his company circled the massive brute.\n\nA gutteral roar and flash of steel echoed for all eternit; the chieftain finally found his mark and impaled the berserker on his sword. As Ulrich the Fearless spat bitterly into the chieftain's face in one last fit of defiance, he thrust himself forward to knock the chieftain off balance long enough that the company could surround the chieftain and hack him to pieces in revenge for their fallen comrade.\n\nWith no family and no way of communicating with Ulrich, he was buried in the swamp in a clearing underneath a large tree. No words were spoken, for what could you say about someone who was more than a man? Ser Silvan the Noble, a man who had once disparaged the wildman and even fought him over the last piece of meat roasting over the campfire two weeks ago, tarried the longest at the grave. Apparently even nobility can learn to recognize their betters.\n\nMany years may pass before someone finds the unmarked grave in the swamp and Ulrich's name may fade from the pages of history, but his legend will live on.\n\nPeople will wonder why a broken billhook lays on top of a gigantic pile of orc bones and rusted armor, and Ulrich will be remembered.","October 4, 2015","true","115.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","3"

Battle Brothers has already advanced beyond the turd stage. With several months still left in the planned early access period, the game already works quite well. In about 17 hours of game-play so far, I’ve had zero crashes or game-breaking bugs.\nFor instance, the contracts the player receives are limited to deliveries, go kill things, and protect a caravan. What’s there is fun and entertaining, but ideally there will be a bit more when the game gets to release.\nI think other reviews, youtube videos, and screenshots describe the game quite well, so I won’t rehash the basics. What I will say is for those interested in fantasy turn-based tactics games, this game oozes potential and is already quite fun. If this (0.5.0.2) was the release version, I’d probably give it an 8/10, mostly for content that is fairly light and some unbalanced gameplay issues.\nIt’s pretty remarkable though that the game is in such a polished state this far from release. Kudos to the developers for creating the ideal early access project: a game that is not only theoretically interesting, but functional, needing only the time and community feedback to reach its potential. With a bit more seasoning and content, this game is going to be a beast.\n","August 23, 2015","true","41.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I am going to nitpick and say what could be (This is Early Access) I will be doing this because I absolutely love this game. Personally it's if X-Com & Mount & Blade had a beautiful baby. Now, you're asking me; "Is this game worth buying in this state?" I will say, for $20 no. BUT it can be worth that very very soon and possibly hopefully beyond that.\n\nRight now the game feels stable-ish but a lot of the content feels missing. There's not much to do other than do a few contracts and die to werewolves. It just feels empty to me. Again, I am not bashing the game I just want it to improve and I hope the devs see my concerns and at least consider them. I do not want to assume how hard implementing more stuff will be, I am not an expert.\n\nDevs, if you are reading this, I am sure you seen/considered all these suggestions before but please consider potentially adding the following\n\nMore contract variation; attacking a merchant cart for rival merchant, assassination, escorting public figures, etc.\n\nAdd more things to the map, more towns, more castles, more unique-ish locations you can visit (perhaps quests you can stumble upon exploring the map to earn a new "legendary" battle brother or legendary/unique artifacts I heard was possibly getting added?)\n\nPossibly consider allowing us to create our own weapons? We could use tools and supplies and other things as materials to create our unique weapons. (AND LET US NAME AND PUT OUR OWN DESCRIPTION)\n\nAllowing us to potentially hire non-human battle brothers? Maybe for example an orc, werewolf, undead.\n\nAdding more fantasy or original races. I mean I don't want it to be a fantasy cliche but more races to fill out the map won't be such a bad thing right? (perhaps friendly races)\n\nThis would probably be low on the list to add but perhaps more backgrounds & traits for your Battle Brothers? JUST A PERSONAL OPINION: As well as making the current backgrounds more 'noticable' as in making the positives higher as well as the drawbacks so you get more specialized Brothers.\n\nAllowing us to have our own mercenary guildhome? Where we can let our injured brothers rest faster, have our own smith to create custom weapons, train our Brothers, stash our weapons/loot/money/supplies, and other things I'm sure you guys can find more uses for.\n\nA reputation/karma system: influences the contracts we can take as well as how high the payout would be. For example if your company is well known enough you'd get contracts to personally escort the King or some cool stuff like that. Karma being if you took evil contracts and did evil things you'd get even more evil contracts from seedier people that would allow you to assassinate officials, poison a town's well (I'm not judging) and other things.\n\nDon't skimp on the unique/legendary weapons/armor/accessories, for lootlovers such as myself a game with tons of unique loot is a game that has multiple playability just for the loot itself.\n\nI already seen that you guys plan to flesh out the UI, I hope there was some discussion on a follow caravan/unit option and a straight to/follow road pathfinding option that allows us to decide if we want our company to just cross a mountain that's in our way and prolong a simple fetch quest 50000000000 years or just take the roads there.\n\nEnemy mercenary companies you can take out for a monopoly on contracts (higher payout?) or to poach their best members to your company. I mean surely we aren't the only merc company out there are we? D:\n\nI mean theres plenty of other things I'm sure I could think of but I don't want you guys to feel like we don't appreciate the game or telling you how to make it. These are just things I hope you guys could consider to make this game truly amazing. Devs: if you're a bit shorthanded I could help with some of the writing ;) lol\n\nFellow players, if you disagree or wish to add on to what I said please feel free to tell me.","April 30, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Set in a somewhat grim, low-fantasy world with a bit of German flair, Battle Brothers puts you in command of your very one mercenary company. Travel a procedurally generated map full of mystery and danger, defending the locals from bandits, orcs, werewolves, and the undead, and explore completely randomized locations where no two battle maps are ever the same. The art style of the game is fantastic and the core gameplay is engaging and at times very challenging. The game as it stands is already a much more complete game than just about any other Early Access title, and as long as the developers continue to patch the game and add new, interesting features at their current rate, this game will be a must have.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lWxLgvBdAo&index=1&list=PLpqkCjhP2qY1ZQtgtwVsBmice3Ettw-Mx","May 2, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Know that first, the amount of patches, bug fixes, and quality control that went into the first three days of the game after the patch astounds me for a game with such a small dev team. We had a bug where there were no missions showing up in towns, fixed the next day. Game crashing on taking a new mission, fixed the next day. So many issues popped up and they had them all fixed within three days. There are major publishing companies who can't do that so I have crazy respect for these guys at this point.\n\nThe progression! They really nailed this one, the missions start off easy and progressively become harder based on the amount of success you have. If you fail a mission the bar drops back down a few notches and starts giving you easier missions again so you can try to recover from a loss. There are less super dangerous enemies in the early game and there are not many super deadly lairs located right next to towns anymore. The only issue they introduced was that you no longer have a difficulty rating over enemy camps telling you how bad the fight will be, which in my opinion is a hugely bad idea since the retreat is so punishing to use and there is a big difference between fighting 30 ghouls and trying to fighting 20 skeletons with 6 vampires mixed in.\n\nThe gameplay itself: Fighting is now a decent way to make money from day one, and with the new mission type of getting cash for kills while patrolling a road it's even better than it used to be. They've adjusted some of the prices for goods, food is a little cheaper now, and it seems to be easier to get decent armor at the start of the game so you don't have totally defenseless guys early on.\n\nYou can now recruit men at higher starting levels for more gold, and the game tells you what the recruit you are picking is likely to have as far as boosted stats go. It also seems less likely that more expensive mercs will come with bad traits (Ive hired four guys over 4k gold each and they had no negative traits) although cheaper mercs can still come with some terrible traits that make it somewhat risky to try and hire cheap guys.\n\nThe perk tree's have been redone somewhat with some new perks added in, 9 lives in particular makes the game a little more forgiving for new players. The only issue with the perk trees is that some of those perks (like bags and belts and quick hands) are almost mandatory to take they are so helpful, while others in the trees are so specific I don't see them ever really coming into play. Not saying they are useless but with only 10 perks to pick per soldier and so many really useful skills that are good all the time I don't see a few of the perks listed really being used at all. Why take a skill that gives you +20% chance to hit the enemy in the face when it only works on a stunned enemy when you could take a perk that increases damage by 20% if the target is at 50% or less, or a perk that gives a flat +20% damage to armor all the time?\n\nOne of the negative things I've seen in game is the change in the leveling system so that instead of getting flat bonuses every level up you get between +1 and +4 randomly per stat. This is a horrible system, as the RNG can now screw you out of being able to use certian mercs if RNjesus decides you get +1 melee attack and defense for five levels that soldier is just not going to be worthy of the front line anymore after all the gold and exp you sunk into them. It has caused me to have to fire two of my guys in favor of new ones since the RNG screwed them so hard. Early on it isnt a huge deal but when you start fighting the end game enemies you really need decent troops to do it.\n\nI'm still not crazy about the strange head hitting crit system that is in game, but I've grown to just accept that it's there and it's really not so bad but it is irritating when you hit a guy in the face and it's the only reason he lives. Doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's super irritating.\n\nThe fatigue system I've grown to like, it balances out your soldiers but it really does feel kind of BS that the enemy doesn't seem to have to worry about fatigue and you do, at least it doesn't appear that they have fatigue because I've never seen one not use all it's actions in one turn. If you intend on taking on large armies you pretty much have to have the rally the troops ability on at least one soldier otherwise you won't get very far because the enemy merely attacking you adds to your fatigue.\n\nRegardless of all that I really beleive this will be a great game when it's finished and while it might be a little iffy to charge $20 for a game that isn't finished yet I would actually recommend picking this up. I say that because the devs are some of the most responsive devs I've ever seen, fixing bugs, addressing community complaints, and generally that gives me enough encouragement to think that with some support this game could be something really special.","February 25","true","42.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There are a lot out there from the guys from Overhype Studios on Youtube (well done and even funny at times), as well as many more since the release of Battle Brothers to early access.\n\nBack then I thought: well, looks promising. Going to follow its development.\n\nNOW I can play it. To make it short: Even in its early state it is quite challenging, thrilling, rewarding and just so much fun! Right now there are around 10-15 hours of really enjoyable gameplay in it.\n\nBut be warned: it is a hard world. Brothers a going to die. You cant stop it :-)\n\nLike Jagged Alliance (some of you might recognize my picture - I’m a huge fan of JA2 1.13)\nthere are to kind of layers: the strategic worldmap and the actual fighting hex based combat maps.

The world feels rich and alive, with trade caravans, peasants, raiders and all manner of strange folk going about their business, even more so since the last big update which added a host of new features. The tactical turn based combat offers tons of depth with a wide range of skills, abilities and weapon types which you need to make most of to compete in a cut throat world.

I can't nail where to begin - the art and atmosphere is gorgeous, the tactics are meaty, there's tons of equpiment and skills, the enemy AI is great, and above all: the game is random, brutal and unforgiving. If you ever liked X-COM, Jagged Alliance or Japanese SRPGs, this game is for you. It's a real "storymaker", bonding you to your medieval mercenaries and letting you shudder in every tense combat. When was the last time you were really afraid of being chased by werewolves in the forest at night? This game doesn't hand you a minigun and heal-behind-cover abilities... this game teaches you fear. And that's what makes it fun :)\n\nDeveloper support has been extremly good so far. The devs are really responsive on the forums, and since the game went into Early Access basically every day has seen fixes and updates. There's still a lot of stuff missing from the current version, but the plans the devs have sound a) awesome and interesting and b) actually realistic to accomplish. Even right now, in a somewhat barebones form, the game is more fun than other full-price AA releases I have played recently. It surely isn't for everyone, but if you like emergent gameplay, roguelikes and the feeling of terror that a hidden orc archer picking of your recruits in a forest at night creates, do not hesitate to support Battle Brothers!","May 9, 2015","true","26.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The fun for me in a game is exploring the mechanics of the game.  Once I've seen everything a game has to offer, I tend to lose interest.  That is sort of where I'm at with this game right now.  But that is to be expected, because the game is basically just a framework right now: You level your guys up, and get better gear, so you can tackle bigger fish inside this sandbox.\n\nThere are still issues to work out, and right now the maps get kind of stale once you've moved around in them and discovered most of what there is to discover.  But all this is basically a placeholder so you can play it now, before it's done.  They have much bigger goals for a real, changeable world in future releases, where there are forces doing things behind the scenes, and your choices and battles affect the larger world.  Their goals kind of remind me of a Dwarf-Fortress-like world where you are impacting the world, but part of the fun is that the world will be different each time.

Even disregarding the promised updates for early 2016 (settlement upgrades, persistent great houses, reputation, contracts and backstabbing).\n\nName your band of merry mercenaries! Tour the randomly generated countryside! Lure farmers and fishermen to your banner with the promise of gold! Take on contracts to escort a caravan from a to b! Watch with horror as all your men get slaughtered by goblins!\n\nThe game has 2 parts, the results of which feed back into each other. Much like much-belowed UFO: Enemy unknown (X-COM in the states). The overmap where you wander around, take on contracts, upgrade and equip your band, and the hexagon map where you fight turn-based battles. The overmap is servicable, but barebones. (At least until the devs deliver the upgrades they promised for early 2016). But it nonetheless provides continuity between the battles.\n\nBattles are where the meat of the game lies, and they are a joy to play. There's a decidedly board-gamey feel to the battles in the best possible way. Information is displayed concisely and you seldom feel overwhelmed or uncertain about what's going on. Positioning is the name of the game, making sure your people are placed so their gear works well against the enemies they're facing and that you can deal the maximum damage while receiving the minimum in return. The AI is quick to exploit holes in your formation, leaving to many a vader-esque "NOOOOOO!" as permadeath claims your favourite battle brother.\n\nThe main complaint I can raise is that there is currently no endgame. Canny players will eventually reach a point where they have a full band of high-level mercenaries with all the best equipment and nowhere to go from there. The developers are aware of this, hence the current work on the overmap to give the player an "endgame" objective to strive for.","December 7, 2015","true","34.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's actually an incredibly cool concept that is well executed and manages to hit every note for me while feeling like you're actually managing a real mercenary outfit without too much excessive micromanaging. You will recruit farmers and fishermen alongside ex-soldiers and former bandits and can outfit them to your choice, you can give them spears and shields or axes and flails if you like, and you can take the contracts you want and discard the ones you don’t like. It's all very hands on and good at making the player feel like they're actively involved in the strategy instead of just 'go here and kill these guys and try not to get killed yourself'.\n\n\nMy only complaint is that Combat and the games finer points aren't really explained that well and the player is pretty much forced to figure it out for themselves and the current lack of content. However this game is still in early access with more content on the way.\n\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games I would recommend Battle Brothers 100%\n","March 21","true","15.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Hover over will show you where did this much stat come from?\n-maybe the stats of the enemy during combat?\n-this may seem unimportant; as i mentioned above that a death of a man affects the player which is great about this game,why not make your other men do a kind of burial ceremony, or have their say about the dead...?\n\n*****I hope you will add much much more stuff than you mentioned under the title 'coming features.'

Honestly though, the game gets repetitive and slogs down as you get further along (not hardware wise, gameplay wise).  I would love to build a Champion who leads my troops and I would love to see the gear aspect more robust (are there even accessories to be found yet?). I know you said we wouldn't be able to own a town or castle, but a base of operations would be nice.  A place to store goods, gear or reserve soldiers (12 is not enough) that we could switch in and out for different missions.  I'm also kind of skeptical about the level 10 threshhold for hired characters.  Even at level 10 a few well placed berserker strikes can kill them.  you would think at the highest level in the game, characters would be a little more durable.  I highly recommend the game, and I do realize it is in the development phase.  I will give it a serious playthrough when it is completed.

It has a polished feel from the get-go.\n\nStandard turn-based tatical combat is enhanced by a unique art-style.  Characters are represented as head and torsos on a base, like a board game piece.  This allows for more facial characteriscs to be easily visible, and each character has a unique look.  This allow for immediate recognition of the individual characters, and along with the rpg aspects and varied character background blubs, allows you to quickly get attached to individual characters in this squad based game. Weapons, armor, HP, armor, morale, and stances are all visible right on the character, and as wounds and morale change, the character's sprite appears more wounded, scared, pale etc.  nice touch.\n\nThe combat itself is smooth with nice animations that are pleasing.  all the standard turn-based combat tropes are present (height advantage, line of sight, ranks, tanks, archers etc).  there is no magic that I know of in the game.  Characters have various traits like wildmen who fight better with a 1-hander with a free hand, beggars who have low resolve, flaggelets who have enhance fatigue (endurance), fisherman who come with an entanging net, etc. You need to level up characters, but you can always have some cheap chaff units up front (though you quickly get attached even to these).  you need variety, some characters need maces to damage high armor, battle axes to break shields, tanks to build shield and spear walls, polearms for second rank attacks etc.  retreating from battle feels too easy, but I think I've had severely wounded characters not make it out (not sure how to tell when that will happen).  Retreat is quick however, you don't have to move your guys to far away tiles, you just hit the retreat button at any point in the battle and it autoresolves.\n\nThe world  map is pretty and easy to manuver, though land travel is a bit slow, and so far the game is mostly comprised of completing quests, exploring, and gearing up/leveling up.  there is no base building, though that would be a cool addition.\n\nThe turn-based combat is good enough to carry the game and the attachment to characters keeps you going.  there is even a simple trading mechanic where an item has an eastily visible given value, but what it will sell or buy for varies from town to town in a rational manner based on that town's local resources and improvement.  I think you can attack caravans and peasants as well but I haven't tried that.\n\ndefinatly worth the $10.99 I paid already.  definately recommend for a mercenary style non-magical turned based combat game.   The game is 0.6 at this point so I'm sure they plan on fleshing the game out even more, but great start.","April 25","true","22.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When you bring on a new guy you have to pay them up from, and pay them per day.  That adds a level of difficulty because you need to see if you can afford it, more guys means you have to take on higher paying tougher jobs.  You need to have food, tools and medicine to keep your team in fighting shape, plus you'll get a few of them killed on missions and have to replace them.\n\nThe battle mechanics are fairly simple, hexagon tiles and turn order fighting.  The way armor works is very cool and original.  As the battle goes on your guys will get tired from actions and lose moral based on injury and death.  Your opponent can retreat as well instead of insanely fighting to the last man in some games.\n\nOverall this game is very well done, it's better than a good chunk of finished products out there and there is still more to come.","May 21","true","62.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It also deals with aspects such as repairing equipment, feeding your mercenaries etc. in a way completing devoid of annoying micro management as well which is a refreshing change.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this game in its current state is a lack of "end goal" and so you just end up making your own end goals. The developers have said this will be introduced in time but I feel like it wouldn't be difficult to just introduce some placeholder "big bad" for you to gear up and work towards killing in the mean time. Could randomize the "big bad" for each play through as well. I feel like this would massively add to the already strong replay-ability of this game.\n\nDon't let that put you off buying this however as it is one hell of a game, and as I said the developers have stated that they're working towards an end goal or "quest line".

I must admit, upon seeing it in the Steam store I wasn't too optimistic. A bunch of armless and legless bobble-head looking characters? Early access? Well why not, it's only $20 and I love tactics style games - maybe it'll entertain me a couple hours...\n\nAbout a week later and I'm thoroughly addicted to this absolute GEM of a title. Yes, the little armless and legless midgets are a little cartoony at first but in no time at all you don't even notice it anymore. The gameplay is awesome, it's everything I love about a tactics game. The core premise kinda reminds me of the game "Gladius" where you run a mercenary company (instead of a gladiator school) and recruit and equip your team to fulfill contracts. There isn't a storyline as of this review, but the events are pretty well-written and give it an RPG element. It's a low fantasy setting, so don't expect any wizards or fireballs flying around. I actually really love the setting and the atmosphere; the names of all the characters are Middle High German which gives it a historical medieval feel, and the weapons and armor are very true to that setting. My only gripe about this game (and it's purely a vanity feature) is the lack of a memorial for all your fallen troops, although I understand this will be included in the final release. It is definitely a REQUIREMENT, because you actually really get attached to your little torso troopers. The game can be very unforgiving, and a couple well-placed crossbow bolts can kill your favorite guy in the blink of an eye (you will be missed, dear Theodebald).\n\nWhile it is early access I honestly feel they've pretty much got the majority of the game mechanics finished, and just need to add a few polishes and features. This is the best $20 I've spent on a game in years.

They are honest about their dev map and keep gamers updated on a regular basis. Their attention to detail and the progress they are showing are quite promising, as I have been following this game for quite some time now.\n\nIf you are concerned about it currently being in Early Access, the devs work hard to update the game and maintain weekly posts. The game is very playable in it's current state with minimal bugs, though you may find yourself repeating many of the same tasks at the moment. But it doesn't take much for what seems like a comfortable save slot with a strong party to run into an enemy party and get destroyed, forcing you to start all over.\n\nIf you like open-world, squad management game with an in depth turn based combat system, support the devs, buy this game, you won't be disappointed.","November 13, 2015","true","85.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I must say, as a fan of turn-based tactics, I find the already implemented battle system in Battle Brothers very solid and fun. It's rather simple, but have it's "depth". Across the world of BB you will find a lot of nasty enemies: mentioned above werewolves, goblins, orks, also undead and other humans. They all got different tactics and gear and it's bringing more fun to the game.\n6) Art style & graphics. Well, it's 2D and when you play a 2D game and it's not a "pixel throwback to 80s" it's all about art style. And to my taste, the style here is absolutely stunning. The work the artist did on the tiles, characters ... basically everything is not only well done, but done really VERY GOOD. (but ofc there is a room for improvement here)\n\nOverall, these guys managed to create one of the best indies ever (also, one of the best EA titles), and it will become even more enjoyable in Februart 2016 with the big update coming, bringing new wordl map mechanics, fast travel, factions with their own politics and much more. So in the era of failed Kickstarter-funded titles and failed Early Access titles, this game is a jewel. I strongly recommend this game, hats off to the developers.

As in "Darklands" there is a medieval German theme with supernatural elements. As in "Disciples" & "Heroes" you switch to a battle map when the action starts. The 2D graphics & music are attractive & work well. The battles are challenging but satisfying. And you gain loot and xp to level up your party. As in "The Witcher" levelling up provides many options & routes for specialization. Keeping your party & its equipment in good order adds a layer of management skill. I'd like to see more variety in faces for party members, as I had 2 or 3 guys who looked identical. And some variation in quests & quest-dialogue text would also be nice. And more variety in clothing. There is music audio, and this is very good, but there's no voice acting. As far as I can tell, there's no interaction between your mercs (as in "Jagged Alliance") but some text-based random events occur to "buff" or "debuff" your party.

However I am only writing this review because I don't know any other way to give feedback.\n\nIf I have any complaint about this awesome and promising looking game, it is goblins....\n\nGoblins are way, way overpowered right now. Basically, whoever created these goblins envisions goblins as the ultimate guerilla super ninja... not really how goblins should be. Goblins have: extreme ranged attacks, extreme accuracy on all ranged and melee attacks, apparently insanely high critical chance on all attack, great melee and ranged defense, absolutely insane crowd control with constant mass root - almost every goblin troop type is capable of root and insanely accurate, insane crit chance ranged attacks, and an AI that only wants to kite the player. That level 5 mercenary in heavy chain that has beat down orc warriors will just be quickly cut to shreds by a couple goblin ambushers in 1 turn.\n\nReally not fun, when I hit goblin missions, I just skip them altogether rather than spent 10 turns watching half my team die before I can even get into melee range.. and this with a group that can handle a couple dozen orc or human enemies. To deal with goblins the player must adopt an extreme and specialized suicide blitz strategy that is not effective and actually counter-productive against all other enemy types in the game. If these are the goblins, I don't understand why the game does not begin with goblins having completely enslaved the entire world.\n\nOther than that, I am loving this game.","January 13","true","178.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I would recommend this game for fans of open world open ended experiences with turn based combat as its very polished for a early access title and new updates are still coming in every couple of weeks\n\n\n10/10","May 29","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bought this a while ago.  Been waiting to play seriously till EA is done.  It's come a tremendously long way since first purchased.  The developers are involved and responsive to the community.  It's very stable and playable now even though EA isn't finished.\n\nDistinctive art style, interesting mechanics, customizable mercenaries.\n\nWould call it more of a low fantasy game.  Orcs, undead, and direwolves, but  no elves or hobbits.\n\nOne glaring oversight seems to be the lack of any female mercenaries ( least not that I've run across ).  Seems an odd design choice as there are lots of female warriors in books and film, and lots of female gamers.    Of course, there's nothing to keep you from going to the in-game barber and picking the most non-bearded face and renaming your mercenary  Brienne of Tarth.\n\nOn the quest side, a few of the quests  (e.g. the threat to the village quests)  can be a bit vague and you're left to wonder if you are in the right area or fighting the right creatures, but most quests are well marked and the instructions clear.\n\nOverall, it's a fun experience and I'm looking foward to the finished product.","May 29","true","47.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though it is in alpha I have enjoyed around 100 hours of gameplay.\n\nI only have two major concerns (that could influence potential buyers):\n\n1) The devs have made it quite clear that there is no "overall objective", "end-game", or "base-building" for the player. So the player is literally just running around the map with only the goal of making the perfect group of mercenaries.\n\n2) Weapons and weapon abilities are extremely limited. This will hopefully change, especially concerning ranged weaponary.\n\nDevs already addressed they will re-work the talents, they definitely need to be revamped, because they are entirely situational.\n\ntip: always fight goblin skirmishers at night","May 19","true","96.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Combat is lethal and enjoyable, don't get attached to your crew!\n\nCombat is turn based hex combat with characters that look like board game pieces: upper body showing the weapons, armour, and getting injured as the character does. Being decapitated is nicely animated and quite depressing as it should be!\n\nSo the devs have laid out a roadmap to add a ton of things, and really I can't wait to see this stuff implemented. Factions, story quests, its just what this needs.\n\nWhen they have filled it out properly, there is immense potential here to expand the game with DLC for alternate races, which would also be brilliant; as they are not rendering 3d models of every different character, you would hope that it isnt a gigantic ask to implement this - and to expand the world map.\n\nAnyway, for now solid mechanics on display, in the current version there isnt a massive amount to do other than just grow the warband, and take on tougher enemies, but I'm having lots of fun with just that because the gameplay is good.\n\nA few performance bugs even running on high power machine, but they are patching almost daily at the moment so expect it to settle down quickly.","May 1, 2015","true","23.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Death and injury is all but certain when playing this game.

But but at the moment the developer is confusing wildly varying RNG with "Grim and Gritty".\n\nmaybe things will change in time.\n\nOh train fatigue and nothing else at frist really. Also the "Utility" perk tree is the only viable tree for your charcters to start. Most of what you have to do to have any chance of is to train yourself to wear the heavest armor possible. The idea of fast moving skirmishers, or advanced tactics aren't currently useful: You have to pad yourself with enough hitpoints so you can hope your guys will finally connect with an attack.\n\n\nBut fair is fair, this game has some good points:\n\nGreat art style: feels hand painted, it is intricate and lovely.\nCombat concepts: In theory this game should allow you to operate cool formations and shield walls. The weapons and ranges are all set up for that. But the RNG makes it pointless at the moment.\nGeat characters: your recruits and their perks and such are pretty cool.\nGood variety of Foes: But orcs are rather over tuned at the moment, especially when stacked up with the wild RNG.\nSolid Writing: Though limited in number at the moment the little blocks of text that come with missions are richly written and often amusing.\n\nMore thoughts on the RNG:\nWhen RNG works right it should add an x factor to what you do that can force your plans to come apart suddenly, making the player react.\n\nWhat it does in this game is cause high level characters suddenly become worthless as they miss "average" attacks over and over while they're suddenly whittled down by often time weaker foes. That's not good RNG. That's RNG that completely invaldiates player choice and tactics.","April 22","false","19.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","1"

Yet sometimes to sate my strategy gaming desire, I need to just go for the throat. Battle brothers does that. It grabs the throat with iron teeth and rips it out with a satisfying schthack! Yet, under the simple satisfaction of crushing your enemies and seeing them driven before you, there is a depth that comes from building your team: gradually outfitting them with better equips; picking jobs that keep them paid and fed; eventualy firing that drunken craven begger infavor of the hedge knight who comes with his own greataxe and chain armor.

I don't know where this game came from, or how the development team knew that there were people like me out there looking for an unforgiving, turn-based combat rpg in a medieval fantasy setting. Don't get too attached to that level 6 character with the pimped out gear, either. You will die. A lot.\n\nPros:\n* Great turn based-combat system\n* Good RPG/skills system\n* Unique graphical style - the "egg soldiers". It's really grown on me.\n* Yes, it's early access, but this feels polished already.\n* Your hardwork will eventually pay-off - you will equip and skill your guys to a level where they can actually survive consecutive battles.\n* Already been three bug updates just a handful of days after initial release.\n\nCons:\n* Start of game is tough - took me about 8-9 attempts where my squad wiped in the first or second battle.\n* Not a great deal of content as yet outside of the combat - be prepared to escort caravans and run errands from one side of the map to the other for a pittance.\n* The best gear - armour/weapons/etc - don't respawn very quickly. By day 50 in my current game, most the stores are generally quite bare. This may be by design.\n* Once you get a solid core of 6-8 guys who are armoured up and at or around level 8, it's currently fairly easy to make money and win battles with minimal loses - again, this is probably due to an overall lack incontent outside of the start game period.\n* Some minor bugs - dead battle brothers turning into zombies who I can't target, the unpassable water tiles bleeding over into the grass/non-water tiles a little too far and making you stuck, etc.\n\nOverall:\nIf you like turn-based combat RPGs with a Mount & Blade-esque world map, this is the game for you. I've already sunk a number of hours in it, and I'm looking forward to more content.","May 4, 2015","true","64.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even in early access it gives the player plenty to do and while some of the meatier parts are not yet implemented, the experience is already overwhelmingly enjoyable.\nTo give you an example - the band of mercenaries you command consists of up to 12 pretty much disposable characters, but each of them has specific traits, portraits and backgrounds that are - and this is truly a testament to the ingenuity of the creators - *just enough* to make you care if one of them dies. In that respect, it's unlike any other tRPG I've seen before, where as a rule of thumb you either immerse yourself in the roleplaying elements fully or don't really give a s**t about any of the characters.\nThe main reason, however, to get this game even during the EA stage is the gameplay. The battles are already extremely fun, with a much more solid AI than usually in such productions. Your opponents pretty much behave the way you'd imagine (Undead try to swarm you, the Orks just break through anything you might put up against them), but still manage to trap you often enough that the battles don't become stale. On that note, they can be pretty challenging even on the "Even" (or previously known as "Easier") difficulty setting.\nThe music and graphics, while both quite simple, are pleasant enough, with graphics fixes coming in once in a while.\nThe game *is* a bit buggy though (a disappearing weapon here and there), but nothing gamebreaking.","September 4, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Similar to Mount and Blade: Warband, you trek from settlement to settlement with your band of sellswords, buying gear and recruiting new grunts who're down on luck and likely to be slain in battle. However, unlike Warband, each one of your men has a unique story behind him. Be he a lumberjack, deserter, daytaler or thief, each of your men has been driven to the mercenary life one way or another. Maybe he committed a crime and is on run from the law? Perhaps his village was burned down, and he has no way to support what's left of his family other than the work your outfit provides? Or he could've gotten a bad case of wanderlust and just wanted to see the world beyond his little farm. Regardless, he's a Battle Brother now, and one day he will die in rank with his brothers-in-arms.\n\nI won't go into detail of how the combat in this game works, as that can be easily be discerned by watching a video or two. Sometimes RNGesus will bless your men in their hour of need, and at other times he will damn them and your entire force. RNGesus sometimes finds certain men he favours -- soon-to-be veteran soldiers who will form the backbone of your little unit, able to cut down swathes of foes and opening holes in the enemy line for the rest of your men to rush through. While sometimes combat can feel like a game of chance, when your men are truly trained and skilled, that feeling goes away. The only thing required on your end is adjusting tactics as the situation demands; certain foes may require particular strategies to defeat them.\n\nOr gear.\n\nYou'll wish you bought a helmet for poor Adalbert, as he lays crumpled on the ground with his skull caved-in from that greenskin's axeblow.\n\nBattle Brothers is still in development, and development is sometimes slow, but this game is certainly in a playable state as of the day of this writing. With upcoming plans for quests that have twists and turns tossed into them, on top of the moral dilemmas of attacking innocents or sending men off to die so others may escape, will make this a title well worth keeping your eye on. Even now, I'd still highly recommend this title to anyone interested in a turn-based strategy game.\n\nLast, but not least, the decapitation animations are pretty frickin' sweet to watch. And since all the place names and your soldiers are German, everything sounds more manly and badass.\n\n9 dead greenskins out of 10, a great title worth checking out -- even in early access.","December 26, 2015","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players must juggle the logistics of supplying, paying, and equipping their mercenaries with a white-knuckle battle system that will leave you in a state of catharsis nine times out of ten.\n\nI will be frank here; Battle Brothers is unashamedly a brilliant game, one that is consistently evolving to become even more than the basic concept. Already, we have four graphically, tactically, and musically different enemy factions to fight against, with a fifth on the way. The world map is simple and perfectly functional at this time, with the upcoming release bringing with it a beautiful new map; one with regions, towns, cities, and noble houses ready to exploit.\n\nIt does have flaws, however. The learning curve is more so a learning peak, and it can be very newb unfriendly at times (especially in regards to Goblins... yeesh, don't trust your gaming instincts with those greenskins). As of the time of writing (7th of November, 2015) one can expect a solid 8-15 hours of gameplay at least, with the expectation going in that this game will not hold your hand.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent game, and one that shows the best side of Early-Access.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ptsz/recommended/365360/","ptsz","ptsz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ptsz/","151 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSet in a kind of low fantasy/medieval open world (the map's not big but it gets the job done), this game is a real treat for any tactical RPG fans out there. Even in early access it gives the player plenty to do and while some of the meatier parts are not yet implemented, the experience is already overwhelmingly enjoyable.\nTo give you an example - the band of mercenaries you command consists of up to 12 pretty much disposable characters, but each of them has specific traits, portraits and backgrounds that are - and this is truly a testament to the ingenuity of the creators - *just enough* to make you care if one of them dies. In that respect, it's unlike any other tRPG I've seen before, where as a rule of thumb you either immerse yourself in the roleplaying elements fully or don't really give a s**t about any of the characters.\nThe main reason, however, to get this game even during the EA stage is the gameplay. The battles are already extremely fun, with a much more solid AI than usually in such productions. Your opponents pretty much behave the way you'd imagine (Undead try to swarm you, the Orks just break through anything you might put up against them), but still manage to trap you often enough that the battles don't become stale. On that note, they can be pretty challenging even on the "Even" (or previously known as "Easier") difficulty setting.\nThe music and graphics, while both quite simple, are pleasant enough, with graphics fixes coming in once in a while.\nThe game *is* a bit buggy though (a disappearing weapon here and there), but nothing gamebreaking.","September 4, 2015","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As said in game website, inspired by Jagged allience, Mount & Blade and original xcom.\n\nIf you enjoy this gaming niche, you should try this one. Already solid gameplay in alpha, and there is a lot potential.\n\nSo basically gameplay is set in two parts: Strategic world map actions and Tactical combat\n\n1)Game is on early alpha currently, but tactical combat is already well implemented.\n\n2) Strategic Worldmap is only partly implemented, there will be more factions and more interactions with factions planned( considering it is early access, it is already pretty solid)\n\nHere is how devs are stating worldmap in website:\n\n"On the procedurally generated worldmap different factions exist with their own agenda and resources, struggling for survival and dominance. A strategic AI leads each faction towards its goal by making use of its resources while staying true to the lore of that faction. Factions own locations on the worldmap – villages, camps, crypts or similar – and send out parties from there with objectives such as patrolling the area, hunting for food or raiding an unsuspecting village.\n\nThe player jumps into this living world and affects its balance by his actions – but the simulation works even without the player intervening. This way, the game does not have to rely on pre-scripted or linear events but provides new opportunities of adventure every time based on the dynamic interplay of its inhabitants. Furthermore, the player’s actions make a real difference. Preventing that orc raid on a village has that village able to offer you more in trade, and even just killing a single orc leaves the orc tribe with one less warrior for future encounters."","June 25, 2015","true","206.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that it is leaves me wondering how much more the game will encompass on release. The shortfalls are rather bland RPG elements; this game has all structure of the D&D combat system and none of the roleplay. Or magic, you're limited to martial weapons and battlefield strategy, magic being solely wielded by enemy necromancers/vampires.\n\nYou can't do these things. . . yet. I've heard rumors that the devs are not taking the game in the direction of elves and dwarves and magic, of dungeon dives with your band of gold-hungry adventurers, but I do dearly hope these rumors are false.

He broke near the end of the fight and left his brothers to die while he fled for the edge of the map. 1 Turn before he would have crossed over, his morale recovers and he stands and fights against the 2 remaining bandits. He's only got a few HP left, no head armor, and about 1/3 of his armor left, so he's 1-2 hits away from dying, but he manages to make it through and kills the 2 bandits to redeem his honor.\n\nThe gist: Tactical combat is simple, but fun. Very RNG dependent though. Strategic mode works, but is very basic: You can equip and level your characters and you have to manage resources. Nothing beyond that.

It is set in a low-fantasy medieval world, looking like Northern Europe/Germany/Scandinavia. You as the leader of a group of mercenaries hire men with various backgrounds (peddler, butcher, soldier, etc.) and different abilities. You equip your men, search for quests and level them up.\n\nDon't let yourself be fooled by the paperdoll appearance of the characters. This is forgotten after a few minutes and the game itself is very immersive. I wish there would be an RPG set in the same world.\n\nAnother huge plus for me are the developers' quick responses to suggestions/wishes.

Open world - a nice map, somehow invoking a certain Darklands feel. I personally enjoy the fact that not every single nok and cranny has some content - I find the emptiness in some areas create a nice frame for those areas with cities, enemies stronghold etc., a juxtaposition of civilization and wilderness.\n\n2, Squad management - already satisfyingly rich and detailed, with plenty of options and depth to get into. Character backgrounds and traits are nicely described without running too long. They allow one to create a nice impression of one's troops and make your squad more like actual people.\n\n3. Quest/contract system - I find it refreshing that they are not all "save the world from". There is some variation: escorting, scouting, fighting. They don't sseem that much scripted, but rather taking advantage from the open world, e.g. when I took a very handsomely paying escort mission, I htought I will be beset by "unexpected" ambushers the whole way, as per the genre standards. In a surprising twist, the road was calm - but maybe even more stressful because of that.\n\n4. Graphcis - I find them charming, clear to see what is what and pretty enough.\n\n5. Tactical battles - playing on normal difficulty, they were good enough - I don't have experience enough to see if different groups of enemies have widely different tactics (e.g. orks more prone to charging headfirst, while rogues preferring to attack from the flanks) but the AI decently uses its troops and terrain.\n\nUI - the devs say they will improve it significantly, but already I did not have any significant issues with it.\n\nBAD/MY WISHES:\n\n1. A world map would be a huge help, especially when deciding on a contract.\n\n2. I wouldn't mind being able to personalize the leader of the company more - not to put them on the field, more like giving them separate experiewnce based on contracts fulfilled which in turn provided boons like cheaper recrutiment, additional contracts available etc.\n\n3. Factions and standing with them, diplomacy in general - if I say raid caravans originating from one town, it would be nice if they would consider me an outlaw and send their troops after me. Also with the enemies, allowing for a some kind of cease fire or even cooperation with them.\n\n4. I wouldn't mind female characters for players and enemies - just for some variation,\n\n5. Headquarters - a single, fortified camp to call one's own, to return to between contracts and to further customise with trophies after victories and upgrades for the benefit of the company.\n\nOTHER:\n\nCurrently, there is only a video tutorial on youtube but I found it easy enough to pick it up from simply playing and reading the tooltips. Be aware that I've learnt this approach on Europa Universalis series with their lack of tutorials, so yeah.\n\nLack of main quest line - it will be added. I don't actually miss it, it will be something nice to have, but I have fun already as it is.\n\nSome minor bugs - I've had only one gamebreaking bug when in combat AI would not take it turn, other than that there are just a few, such as items going to the bottom of the stash when one unequips them - nothing major.","May 9, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azbolg/recommended/365360/","azbolg","Azbolg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azbolg/","110 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_oFF2XzBo0I\n\nLok’tar humans!\nThis is a review of fun XCOM style, turned based strategy game, Battle Brothers, developed by the indie German developers at Overhype Studios.\n\nCurrently as of April the game is in early release, which can be unsettling because you are buying essentially an unfinished product, but that shouldn’t dissuade you if you want to cough up $20 and like a more sandbox open-end adventure for roughly 6-10 hours of content to enjoy.\n\nThe main premise of the game is that you control a band of mercenaries in a randomly generated, medieval fantasy, war-torn country.  Each character in your party has a detailed back story such as a scholar, solider, vampire hunter, or a simple beggar.   You purchase these characters to increase your band of mercenaries to the max party size of 12, as surely some will die along the way in this dangerous field of work.  There is an initial fee to hire them, which can be much higher based on the characters skills, as well as a weekly fee to retain them.  Some might easily desert you, while other will remain loyal to the end even if you run out of coin; they’re mercenaries after all.\n\nThere are plenty of weapons of all shapes and sizes.  You can build a fighter and bash other NPCs using the hex grid battle system.  Or you can try to riposte and counter when someone attacks you.  As your characters level up with each successful battle encounter, it is pretty detailed, you can increase many stats like their willingness to stand in the face of other comrades dying, health points, defense, and attack power.  Also there are talent tress or perks that can be offensive, defensive or utility, again adding a little touch to each character as you level.\n\nThere are many monsters: werewolves, skeletons, orcs, zombies, and bandits, which makes the battles even more dynamic.  Orcs might charge across the battlefield and stun your front line warriors, while zombies will appear out of the earth as the fight persists.\n\nThis game is someone reminiscent of Darkest Dungeon party system with a hint of difficulty, and a somewhat vast world.  Currently there is no overarching story, and consists basically just quests to explore other cities, escort trade caravans, and destroy enemy outposts.  I’ve only had the game crash once, and it AutoSaves before each battle just in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor $20 you basically get 6-10 hours of fun medieval strategy combat.  For this game to really improve it will need more detailed quests, an overarching story, and maybe an MMO/multiplayer feature, or server feature would make this game insanely popular in my opinion as it has a no holds bar difficulty, and fighting other players would be fun.  Also currently the battles are like a chess game, where a character, or piece simply hops into a designated hex.  However, it would be nice to see a full model, like we do in XCOM with full animations.  Maybe also adding a captain to lead your weary battle brothers would be a nice touch as well.\n\nOverall I recommend the game, and give it 8.5 orc axes out of 10, with a lot of potential to occur in the future if Overhype Studios continues to add features, because the game has good value where it is.\n\nLike, subscribe, comment, and I’ll see you on the battlefield human!\n\n","April 29, 2015","true","46.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really can't say enough about the writing.   I have ENJOYED reading every single character bio I have come across in this game.  I'm usually not that guy but a lot of effort has been put into *gasp* plausible and thoroughly enjoyable backstories.  I'm too busy killing stuff to bother to stop and read about some hair shirt wearing juggler who tired of his trade and turned to a life of bloodshed.  Not this time, the writing in this game is really that good.\n\nSo far I have had a max party of 8 mercs using a mix of weapons.  Every character had different abilities to perform based on the weapon equipped and had a nice variety of options.  Men using a shield could perform a shieldwall and received a nice bonus for being adjacent to another character also performing that action.  Same goes for spears and spearwall but with different outcomes.\n\nThe characters I recruited had differing background traits, making each guy an individual, not just a carbon copy of your previous 12 recruits.  The large amount of various perks allows for a lot of flexibility when advancing your crew.\n\nI could go on and on about this game and as I said before, I have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.  With it's  low price point you are certainly going to get a good deal that will offer MANY hours of gameplay with a ton of replayability in each playthrough.","March 13","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Traveling around a worldmap, get hired, kill bad guys, find loot, and so on. The tactical battle - the core of the game - is sophisticated full of possibilities.

Cause the different typs of enemys, eg Raiders, Gobos, Orc, Undead are attacing in different behavior. On the lower difficulty, which is quite easy, it doesn't matter but on higher difficulty, you should really experiment with the equipment. The fatigue system is challanging too.\nThere are Cons to.

The economics of your mercenary band and the wider world around you is far more intricate than the linear trade caravans & roads system suggests.\n\nThe developer team has literally patched this game seven times in seven days since EA release.

Managing your group of mercenaries going about in this open medieval fantasy world. You are to take up contracts from merchant for earning of your coins and it is up to if you want to fulfill or break the contract, seeing how the situation goes. The towns and cities are randomly generated with every start of a new game, as well as your starting mercenaries.\n\nThe combat is a turn base strategy which means combat is RNG and you have to do some management in terms of your AP, fatigue, HP, resolve, initiative and gears. Your mercenaries do level up through combat and you could choose which skills and stats (increasing of stats are interesting as you only could choose 3 stats and it randomly gives you an increase number from 1-5) to increase. Do take note that if one of your men got killed, he remains dead throughout the game, which leads you having to take up new contract with new men and to re-train them from low level up.\n\nCurrently, you can have only 12 men at any given time (until further down the dates where the developers will be adding in helpers and might be able to increase the number of roster of your men). Still, having just 12 men doesn't make the game any boring at the current stage, due to the permanent death mechanics.\n\nTo add on, I love the graphic details for this game, the weapons, armors, the mercenaries, the monsters, the environment, the showing of wounds and the decapitation. Furthermore, the developers are very active in updating the game and response well to the community.","May 14, 2015","true","49.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Absolutely.\n\n\nThis game is procedurally generated tactical combat in a procedurally generated Kingdom infested with bandits, undead and orcs.\n\nThe tactical combat especially shines. It is utilitarian and not cluttered. It is varied and chaotic. Although it is turn-based, it generates suspense as you cross your fingers waiting to see if you favorite brother will be struck down by the enemy's blow.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the Dev team will be fleshing out the campaign world which is OK at present time, but leaves a lot of room for improvement. You will need  to take contracts to pay your current brothers and hire new ones as you suffer causalities. Escort caravans, explore the wild and clear out enemy strongholds. The enemies in the wild are all acting towards their own goals, which often mean ruin for the settlements of humans on whom you depend for coin and supplies.\n\nThe Dev team is active and active on thier website's forums.

You should be saving often anyway.\n- Maps only occasionally mirror the land they're being fought on (likely fixed by release)\n--- That feeling when your bowman shoots your own guy in the back of the head\n\nBy release, I can tell that this game will have depth to the point where it makes even Mount and Blade: Warband look shallow!

While its currently limited, yet still enjoyable the devs have a lot of improvement coming. Everything I have read point they are going in the right direction. Many of the things I thought the game needed they have posted will be coming. Combat can be deadly so you need to work your tactics, better armor and weapons are a must even early on as there is no startup area. Starting on Easy basically only means money. It does not change the start much. Be careful with your early battles keep your troops together to help protect. A couple tactics I have tried to work well hopefully it helps. Basic tactic is Shields front with heavy armor, Pole weapons and bows/crossbows second row. A second tactic I have tried and worked is Heavy armor with HEavy weapons spaced 1 hex apart, with bows/crossbows to the rear. This lets missiles have a good firing lane and heavy weapons use area attacks. At the last, each soldier has traits that can affect them some minor some major some affect battle some events. Always check what traits your soldiers have after aquiring them.

It has a gritty tough feel to it that permadeath of your mercenaries boosts. This game shows tons of potential so far and seems to be progressing rather quickly towards being a fully developed game. So far I have only encountered one easily fixed bug dealing with the character spawning and terrain placement. For an early access game to have so few bugs and no CTDs as far I can see is great work on behalf of the developers to get patches and bugfixes out before moving on to other game features. My only gripe so far is the fact that Orcs in the average strength stages are so overpowered they easily outmatch well geared opponents with reinforcements.\n\nSo far you can travel to several towns, castles, watch towers, and enemy encampments. Do not be offput by the fact that there are only a few towns and castles as this is a very Early early access and for the price is somewhat fun. Now for some of the Pros and the few cons as the game stands right now.\n\nPROS-\n\n-The combat mechanics are amazing and fun. While a little tough at first anyone can quickly grasp it and become quiet adept at it. Just beware any rash moves you make can and will be severely punished by the AI.\n-The AI is not a pushover even on easy settings. It won't make any blatantly dumb moves or forgive every mistake you make. All in all the AI seems balanced and well put together working the battle mechanics to its best potential.\n-The quests are somewhat limited thus far but are well written, rewarding, and fit well within the world as it is the sort of stuff that you would expect people living in such a world needing help with. Quests also provide you a nice loose guidance you can follow to get stronger.\n-The writing is phenomenal to say the least. I have not found a single spelling mistake thus far. It is witty, funny, and charming adding great depth to the characters you encounter in your travels. Quests are also given great attention as well giving you a better look at how the game world works and how the status quo maintains control over the people.\n-Characters come with all sorts of different backgrounds that set them apart from one another. Some are heartbreaking and tales of sorrows while others are gritty and morally ambiguous at best. But in the end you will care when they pass away as they are all bound to go through deaths gates.\n-Leveling up is done very well. As you fight and survive through several battles your characters will gain levels allowing them to become a lot stronger through traditional increase in skills with the addition of perks to help them in battle.\n-The are tons of Perks, I have yet to go through all of them but all seem to greatly help your characters survive more battles.\n-Lots of weapons and weapon abilities. Every weapon type has its own special abilities, axes can cut through shields, Billhooks can strike from afar and pull enemies closer, shields can form shieldwalls, and many other weapons besides.\n-Great selection of armor and gear though I look forward to it being expanded even more.\n\nCons-\n-The spawn system does not take into account the terrain. This creates problems as characters are sometimes stuck unable to move. They might spawn on top of a tall hill unable to get down (giving them a great advantage at the cost of being unable to move). Because maps are procedually generated the characters may spawn stuck behind trees or rocks closed off from everyone else. An easy fix to this may be to make sure the maps only create areas that can be accessible from a single tile on the map A.K.A. it is all interconnected.\n-Bows for archers and crossbows for crossbowmen are limited as of right now to only shortbows, hunting bows, and only one crossbow. I have yet to see javelins in play. (Hopefully all of this will be expanded later on.)\n-The map while large and diverse in terrain so far has very few towns and castles. (Again this is early alpha so it will no doubt will be expanded and worked on later on.)\n-No real human faction struggles that I could see. Very few human factions.\n-You will probably miss every single shot you take at your enemies in dire situations. Not sure what's up with missing 6 shots in a row at an or with a 62% chance of hitting. At other times you will score hits you had no chance at making. this really needs some rebalancing and looking into.\n-BALANCING, biggest issue I have with this so far. Orcs even at average strength with your well geared party and back up from knights will get demolished. Some enemies are definitely over powered at this point. Balancing issues just make the game not fun.\n-Allied AI apparently is next to non-existent. It does not behave as intelligent as the enemy AI. It makes extremely dumb moves, and is prone to leave single units behind as outnumbered main forces are annihilated.\n-Game is far too unforgiving... while this may be a good feature in a title like say Dank Souls and Dank Souls II that thrive in being very difficult, it does not work well at all for this title.\n\nI will probably expand on this review later on with tips and more things as I explore the world. so far the game is great but I cannot recommend it in its current state.","April 28, 2015","false","16.3"," 70 of 142 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","70","142","3","16"

Why is there no multiplayer in such a simple going game? It surely cannot be that difficult to make a multiplayer platform    with a turnbased fight. AI is already decent, on champion its deadly, so just a multiplayer module and its done.\n\n2. Camping is ok, great concept as such; yet I miss some of the camping duties and options (like some from say Realms of Arkania 2, a really old game), where you could collect herbs for healing or poisoning, hunt for food in the wild, heal quicker etc.\n\n3.

It's brutally hard and frustrating even on the middle difficulty, and there's very little handholding.  The overworld map is randomly created and traversed in open-world style while the battle gameplay is strongly reminiscent of Fire Emblem- weapons and armors degrade, and a lot of your battle success does come down to succeeding or dodging 50% to-hit rolls that can instantly permadeath a character!  But it can be a rewarding experience when you do make progress!","March 16","true","57.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Dunno. Just a bunch of argumentative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But whatever. Onto the game:\n\nIt's a fun mercenary band economical simulator with turn based combat which still hasn't really decided what it wants to be. There are a lot of signs that the designers aren't sure what they want to do with the game, which leads to some problematic situations.\n\nFor example, on one hand --- turn based combat. Great. Fun. But when you get to mid/late game, there are so many participants in combat that it takes a ridiculously long time for everyone to move.\n\nThen there's the economical game: you have to make sure your company is supplied with food, wages for the mercenaries, tools to fix broken equipment, bandages for health and ammunition.\nBut... All those things just cost money anyway, so why force you to "manage" a "resource" which is basically just a pure money equivalent anyway? It's completely redundant! True, ammunition costs a little more or less depending on where you are, but you're going to be visiting many towns very often anyway, the way the game is designed. If you've got money, you'll always have everything else.\n\nAnother weird thing about the economic aspect: many times, fighting a battle is counterproductive. For example, if you fight a large battle for which you don't get paid much, you might actually be losing money on it, due to equipment degradation. If you lose one or two mercs in the process, then you almost always lose much more than you gain, making it somewhat counter-intuitive.\n\nAnd all in all, the problem is in the overall design goal. As said, it's uncertain if the devs. figured out what they want this game to be, so for now it's an open ended affair. Which is fine if there is content, but there isn't.\nFor example, mount&blade had you grow from a small merc band, fighting bandits, to eventually becoming a lord, managing castles and a large army, and possibly even king.\nIn this game you just... keep being a small company of mercs fighting bandits forever. there's nothing to work up to. And even if the intention is not an 'open ended sandbox', there's no plot, no goal, no endgame.\n\nIt's an ok game, with a potential to be a lot more than it is. Though the design IQ is not on par with M&B, so it's unsure what to expect.\n\nI'd get it anyway. It's a nice game.","April 1","true","139.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Your 1,000 gold mercenary is no better then your 200 gold one. And both can still be randomly one shot by a bandit with a bow from 6 steps away, or killed with a single stroke by berserkers or anyone with any two handed weapon. Don't bother trying to level or train your characters, write a story for them, or really just invest in them at all aside from gear, and that's only because you can pass it to the next smuck you hire to throw into the meat grinder.\n\nThe game's nothing more then a set of deminishing returns. I got 6 characters at the start, ended up losing the first two to lucky shots from the bandit archer in the first raid. Naturally I did not manage to recoup enough gold to hire back two replaces right then and there. I could only get one. I ran around the map for a bit, looking for someone to give me a quest. Protect the caravan. Fight some werewolves. Oh look, my 1,000 gold character just got his face ripped off in two swipes from a werewolf, despite him, and the guys on either side of him forming a shield wall. Well. Okay. Win the fight which nets me a whole 200 coins back. Get 800 from the caravan when it gets to the city. Buy up a soldier for 800. Give him the gear of the dead 1,000. Next quest. Go kill the orc camp. It says 'weaker' approach it, still says weaker' proceed to get half my team stun locked till the 800 soldier, and two of my starting soldiers are dead. My crossbowman is weakened. And my starting dude kills the last. Get back. I can buy 2 220 characters. Start going up the road to find another quest in another town... MORE BERSERKERS AND... I'm dead.\n\nwhile I don't know, I find the game alright, I would like it to be possible for me to predict the outcome of matches other then just wait to see who gets crit killed. And actually have a chance to level some guys, and those guys survive more then a single arrow to the face from a bandit in rags with a short bow.\n\nAll in all, the game's alright.

Even wages of individual soldiers (vetrans especially) seems improved. The overall game mow has greater content and variety. The world map is vibrant where before it seemed drab and empty and the game as a whole seems nearly fleshed out. Long term gameplay and goals are still vague/non-existant, but the game is as of yet unfinished. I would like to see more bandtry options for players. Cureently, stability is down a bit, but should be addressed in a upcomming update.\n\nUpdate: I've played some more of BB, with different tactics. I have encountered some more issues--caravan guards runaway in battle if odds are against them. Sometimes they stand still. Other times they charge headlong at the enemey, leading to their quick destruction. It is disappointing when they stand still as their caravan/donkey is hacked to pieces. It would be nice if scouting/placement of units was done in a tactical and not random manner.\n\nPlease don't pay attention to my 'in-game hours'. I have upwards of 30 in this game. Moreover, I first tried BB when it first released to ealry access. I am, for the most part, pleased that the devs have consistantly added new features--game content seems to be coming along at a good pace. And, on occasion, BB is fun to play. The models (especially undead) are very well done. Characters look awesome, especially as things progress.\n\nYes: this is in early access. Yet, the same issues that plagued early gamplay are still  prevelant, maybe worse. Billhooks and crossbows (if you find someone with any accuracy) are insanely overpowered. Same goes for any other melee weapos with 2+ range. More frustrating is the seemingly random criticals and insta death that occur on both sides during combat. This happens to both armored and unarmoned combatants, vetrans and fresh recruits. I find myself cocking my head in utter confusion when a new recruit suddenly beheads an undamaged assailant, covered in mail armor, or the opposite occurs to my merc captain with 55+ vitality remaining. Why does this happen so often?\n\nWhy is my teams ranged combat so inaccurate despite similair skill levels to melee? Shouldn't I hit something if I fire into a crowd of enemies for long enough? On the other hand, enemy marskmen will clean the floor with most of your team if you don't keep obstacles between you. Please consider shortening the movement potential of certain enemy units.\nAlso, why do goblin riders get to move and attack 3 times (one wolf, two melee)? They're already dangerous with their ability to skirt your front line. Why can't mercanaries have similair skills to mobs (orks charge)? And why is this game still so dipleasing to play? I like rougelikes and perma death but there is little payoff to enduring a battle in which your team gets sudddenly halved. There is a lot of potnetial here. Please spend time fixing basic gameplay before adding more features.","December 26, 2015","true","25.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Funny bits of story. Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, death, save scum, save scum.\n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics came out almost twenty years ago, before that Shining Force and after it Disgaea. They are similair and different but offer a plethora of ideas to use in the foundation of a turn based strategy RPG. The price tag wasn't bad and I'm optimistic but Battle Brothers has a long way to go.\n\nThey really need to revisit hit percentages. It is especially obvious on un-blocked ranged characters on even terrain. On the harder skill modes if you miss a bunch in the beginning of many battles you might as well reload your save because even with strategy it's downhill from there.\n\nI will note that I have only played on Challenge difficulty. It's probably the only acceptable mode that keeps the player from noticing the game is in Early Access because it slows progression considerably. There's nothing other than thumbs up or down ... so I will just have to re-visit the review as development progresses.","March 14","false","37.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","5","13","3","0"

So here's the long and short of it:\n\nGood game, needs work, ♥♥♥♥ you RGNesus!\n\nThe whole chess piece aesthetic to the characters SERIOUSLY put me off to this title for a long time.  And it got some pretty harsh reviews a few months ago so I stayed away.  And then it got some polish, and some people posted more/updated reviews, and so I took another look.  And I still stayed away.\n\nNow I'm not saying the game is much better than it was when people were complaining about this game.  It's still bad in the aspects it's bad in.  Namely the RNG.  It's SO RNG focused that I actually get irritated by it.  I always look at RNG reliance as a bad concept.  But it's still EA, so I'll wait til the final release for a real verdict on that part.\n\nThe core concept is good, though I feel like 12 guys is NOT a mercenary company, it's an adventuring band.  And that's fine, the gameplay isn't ruined by that.  In fact the gameplay is pretty outstanding, EXCEPT for, you guessed it, the RNG.  Which I'll come back to.  But you get up to 12 guys, and I understand more than that slows things down and gets too big, so from a balance/gameplay/time factor I'm not complaining.  But that's... not a mercenary company and that's a bit of a let down.\n\nThe combat is good and balanced and well thoughtout.  Melee and ranged weapons, no magic, and while it COULD fit, would mess with the balance and other things, so it not being a part of combat (it's only in the game in a very slight way, undead) doesn't really make you feel like you're missing anything.  Although I will say that not being able to heal units in combat in a perma-death game is  HUGE problem IMO.  Weapons and armor have different types, strengths, weaknesses, and you can make any guy fill any role with MANY different loadouts.  Obviously min/max'ing is possible, and there are lots of discussions on the most powerful builds, but there's not a whole lot you can't do, and it's completely plausible to make a LOT of things work together.\n\nBut here's the reason I can't recommend this game.  That's right, I said I CANNOT recommend this game.  Weird, right?  I haven't talked about anything that's a deal-breaker.  In fact, I've actually complimented the game on basically every aspect of it, right?  Except the RNG is ATROCIOUS.  It determines EVERYTHING.  That contract in town? RNG.  That attack you're trying to make? RNG.  Seriously, it's just too reliant on that, and even putting that aside, it's HORRIBLY SKEWED.  When I miss 5-7 40-70% rolls in a row... in the 7th fight... of my 3rd playthru because I've been either killed or just so wrecked that I started over... yeah, that's bad RNG.  I'm not talking about X-Com missing that 99% that got half your squad killed.  I mean whiff fests like you would not BELIEVE against enemies who seem to be able to land every blow, and just ripping through your band of hardened mercenaries like wet tissue paper.\n\nAnd the way the game gives you quests is all RNG based too.  That 1 skull contract you take to deliver goods to a town because your guys are too bandged up to take part in another fight, but you need cash or everyone will leave?  Guess what, RNG puts it way on the OTHER side of the map.  So by making the trip, YOU LOSE MONEY!  And you lose rep for cancelling contracts (which I get), so better save in one of those slots before you accept one.\n\nAnd some units need some SERIOUS rebalancing.  Orcs are WAY too strong.  Especially warriors.  The RNG aspects of combat coupled with unbalanced enemies seriously makes tactics totally obsolete.  There's no point.  The game just throws a wrench into your well-concocted battle plan every time.  And if this was done with good AI countering your strategy, I'd be THRILLED, but it's just RNG going "Nope, you're gonna miss those 4 attacks against this one dude who's pretty much dead, but he's gonna toss aside you're walking tower of steel to punch your archer in the face because you're doing too well in this fight right now."  Over and over and ♥♥♥♥ING OVER again.  I welcome a challenge, but the abuse this RNG throws at you is just ridiculous.\n\nSo here's the disclaimer to all this:  This game is good, from the core concepts to the details of every system, which I won't detail myself here.  But they're smart, they're intuitive, and they're easy to understand with very MINIMAL tutorial or explanation (the game doesn't really tell you much at all, and yet you're never really left scratching your head at how anything works, so MAJOR kudos there).  I've clearly spent a LOT of time playing it, so at it's very core, this game is not only good, it's fun.  And while the start is seriously brutal beyond belief, to the point where even X-Com is gritting it's teeth and telling it to lighten up a little, it's never insurmountable (except when RNG ♥♥♥♥s you over for the 10th time against those god damn orcs again!).  But once the ball is rolling, you've got some good gear, some major badasses, and what amounts to decent tactics as much as an RNG base allows, it gets fun.\n\nAlso, RNGesus hates me.  Seriously, like with a fiery passion, the likes of which put Hell to shame.  So it really could just be that my luck is THAT bad, and I would NOT refute that arguement in the slightest.  But I stand by the statement that this game relies too much on RNG.  At least without things to balance that out in some way, in case you're like me and have ♥♥♥♥ luck.","April 16","false","20.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

Graphics are nice, good open world concept. Quite like Warband in the sense there is a world map that you travel through to different towns to buy goods and hire men. For me however there is just one giant downside which leads me to not reccommend this game. It is too difficult. I don't belive I'm exaggerating when I say this. There are 3 difficulties the lowest being even. Although, it does seem as though every game is even (Though I have fought battles where I had 7 guys and they had 5 and i got wrecked) it gets incredibly frustrating when you spend the VERY limited amount of money you have hiring 2 more guys and having to buy them weapons and FEASIBLE armour. Then entering into a battle where you have the advantage in people and then you just get demolished. If you buy this game you will exeperience basically this -> group of 5 guys -> some level up to lvl 2/3 (out of 11) -> finish a contract getting you 400 more gold (giving you 1,100 altogether) -> you buy better armour and weapons for SOME of your group -> You get cocky and do another contract -> You think you have the advantage but you SERIOUSLY DON'T -> Your highest lvl players (being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lvl 2/3) get murdered (You get vexed) -> you MIGHT win the battle in which case -> you end up getting 400 more gold BUT it doesn't matter because you have to spend it on new guys (costing on average 130 gold)-> You once again buy ♥♥♥♥ weapons and feasible armour for your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lvl 1 newb soldiers -> The cycle repeats until you either get sick of not progressing (as skirmishes are very ♥♥♥♥ing limited) or your whole company leaves because you don't have enough money to pay them (which costs quite a bit) or they have nothing to eat (This is more likely to happen).

Love the aesthetic, setting, and so on, but it lacks replayability and any sense of discovery. I am dumbfounded by the fellow reviewers who say they've played 50+ hours. How? There's little excitement to discover, as levelling up simply adds percentages and modifiers to your existing abilities, and maybe a few AOE attacks. There's basically no mage or support classes to speak of. The world does not feel alive in the slightest, and the cookie cutter (slightly edited each time) quest text does nothing to alleviate the absence of a main plot arc. This game is definitely in Alpha, but from what I've read, I don't think they're going to be bringing it to a point where it's worth purchasing over more polished, fantastically modded, higher production value open world games such as Mount & Blade: Warband.","March 18","false","2.5"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","4"

There is very little to do in this game. There is not a whole lot to interact with on the world map; just the towns and contract objectives. The contracts are about all there is to do and the risk far exceeds the reward. The battles are extremely punishing and you end up losing more than what you recieve for completing the mission, and that's if you even can complete the mission; often times it seems you run into bands that you simply cannot defeat.\n\nSave your money. If they increase the content and features by about 90% then this might be worth the price.\n\nAll that being said, this game does have potential, which is why I decided not to get a refund.

I noticed that the further my people progress the worst they do. For example, my archers can't hit anything at all now. They are at level 5 and they can't hit enemies standing 2-4 tiles away. 6 turns, 3 archers, no hits. Yet the enemy are damn snipers from about 10 tiles away. That's not an RNG. It's cheating.\n\nScrew it. Yet another promising game ruined by lazy bs mechanics. Avoid this pile of ♥♥♥♥ unless they work out real mechanics to create difficulty. Like making skills and tactics actually matter.\n\n\nFirst of all: Gaben you got to add a "Wait until release" option for rating Early access games.\n\nSecond: I am the kind of player that hates tutorials. If the game takes hours of research to understand how it works I am not interested. If the game has hard time explaining it's mechanics during the actual gameplay then it's not  well designed a game. I play to relax not to waste my time reading countless wikis and guides. This game delivers well on that. It was fairly easy to figure out what to do without treating me like an idiot with crap ton of tutorials.\n\nI was going to recommend the game, but after progressing a bit further I found the annoyance that keeps me from buying games that claim to be difficult. It has the now standard BS (Rng) difficulty. To it's credit it does have the starting points of a game where it is important what skills to pick and which character is best suited for what job. However it quickly devolves into an RNG hell with massive balance issues. Enemy, after certain point, become very accurate, their archers have the ability to shoot from far greater distances than yours and they seem to have unlimited Fatigue and much larger AP pool. They also do not seem to be affected by morale anywhere near as much as your people. Strategy means nothing, it seems.\n\nIt is a fun game despite this and a few other annoyances. Such as no horse for faster travel, not being able to see the full stats of a merc you are about to hire. I am guessing I am going to play the game right after I post this. But the cheesy difficulty makes it into just a casual thing for me. I lost all interest in any of the characters or caring about having higher standing with the lords and peasants alike. I stopped wasting money on buying lots of supplies, armor and weapons. Because it does not seem to matter at all. What's the point of hand picking skills, better armor and weapons for 10-12 men when a pack of 5 young ogres can decimate your entire squad while taking only a couple of casualties.\n\nI'd say wait. Wait until it's released and see if the developer will opt out of this lazy type of difficulty and instead flesh out the one that is there but seems to be completely ignored.\n\nPlease developers stop with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG based crap. You do have the beginnings of a true difficulty in this game but you seem to be ignoring it.","April 26","false","29.1"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","4","17","0","4"

In 2 hours of gameplay, I have barely been able to complete the first fight without losing 2-3 members of my team.\n\nI can appreciate that this game is early access, and I am optimistic about the direction of where the game can go, but presently it just isn't fun. The RNG is too stacked against you, to the point where even Darkest Dungeon feels like a walk in the park comparatively. If I can't find, much less finish, 2-3 fights before I have lost my whole team to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG, I can't enjoy your game.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem I have is the difficulty gauge. "Even" still feels like you're boatloads behind in terms of the ability to hit, do damage, etc. Yet "Deadly" wasn't too difficult at all. Somehow "Weaker" ends up mopping the floor with you though. This makes the risk vs. reward feel completely uncompelling, as you're entering fights with faulty information.\n\nA few other things:\n- I think there needs to be a +10% chance to hit, minimum, across the board. It feels lousy not being able to hit anything ever, period. At the very least, equipment that adds +hit% would be amazing\n- Need more ways to make gold; walking in small squares is not exciting\n- Really need to balance goblins\n- Needs more factions to HELP you; having no caravans after day 25 is pretty awful\n- Enemy bases that you discover need to not outscale you constantly. There's literally nothing worse in the game than seeing no enemy encampments you can fight, no enemy patrols you can fight, and no allies to help you fight so that you can level up characters\n- Quests need to reward XP as a way to help get crap-tier characters levels without auto-dying\n\nLastly, and this is important, it's very possible to hit a stalemate as a combination of the above features. Multiple playthroughs now, I have gotten around 40 days into the game and been unable to level, unable to make real money (100-200 crown delivery quests are the worst and don't count), and unable to fight enemies. I restarted, figuring I did something wrong. Nope. This is a continuous thing. If you don't min-max with your party set-up and pigeonhole your play style, you'll hit this same brick wall over and over again. Please re-evaluate the pacing and flow of the game so that this doesn't happen. I should *never* hit a point where I am incapable of progressing any further.\n\nEdit 3/1/2016:\nBase chance to hit enemies is still so brutal and unappealing that I still can't enjoy the game. Even X-Com 2, a notoriously unforgiving game, has Rookies starting off with a 45-70% chance to hit.

I want to get it out there that I love it and I think it's one of the best games to hit Early Access.\n\nCombat is unforgiving, favoring those who think out tactically flexible forces that can adapt to a myriad of foes on the fly, or, if needed, combat things in a more prepared manner if given the time. From making a force that relies on shield walls, or a gaggle of greatsword-wielding maniacs running into hordes and dicing things up, the combat can be yours to make. The lack of a varied flavor of combat aside from infantry on the ground, footslogging across open ground can be a bit of downer for now, but from what I've seen the devs have been extremely active and may be implementing cavalry. Warhounds have also been introduced. What the player lacks in variety, however, the AI has in spades. From orks with ridiculously overpowered charge-stun attacks to undead ghoulies turning your dead against you, the game has quite a bit of interesting concepts behind the enemy. Sadly, the player isn't able to use alot of these interesting abilities, being unable to receive a zombie, ghost, wolf-man, ork, or goblin in the party.\n\nQuests are alright, though they do get a bit repetitive with "kill this thing here," or "take me across the map for a pitance of gold." The quests are adequate in getting the player to explore the randomly (I think) generated map, where they can see all the random encounters along the way or battle out enclaves of enemies. Rewards can be anywhere from the thousands of gold for simply walking a caravan somewhere to getting a dozen gold for slaying an entire camp of bandits nearby (not even accounting you may have lost a vast part of your party doing so.)\n\nThe creators seem to be under the impression that complete randomization improves challenging Rogue-likes. Though this may appeal to some, the creators failed to give any option outside that. They could take some elements from NEO Scavenger, allowing players to have a pool of points to create their starting party. Or the game could take elements from Rogue-Legacy where previous attempts add up into further plays.\n\nThe only reason I don't want to recommend this game right now if for balancing purposes. Save Scumming can be quite common place since massive armies spawn/emerge from forests are will and friendly forces only come from one castle and maybe a couple of towers, and even then, those patrols and armies can be absolutely wiped out when they fight things. Reseting the game for a decent crew can also happen, sometimes spawning with a decked-out former noble and some regular guys, to having rag-wearing beggars and vagabonds. This leaves the player scrounging around in the early to try and even kit the lower-tier party members, leaving little room to buy supplies, equipment or more men for the band.\n\nA lack of central plot or driving action/urgency really lets the game down since roaming the lands can only work so much on Battle Brothers in a 2-D world. It may work in Skyrim because of the *huge* rolling world, but here, kilometers are simply passed in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Eventually one gets bored or absolutely reamed with unrecoverable losses.\n\nI'll hold my recommendation for now until I hear back from the Devs or significant changes are made.\n\nTL;DR: Awesome game and time-sink let down by massive balancing issues and save-scumming that puts a halt to alot of the fun gameplay and flow.\n\n***EDIT, 8.22.15***\n\nOkay, so now the game's become even worse. Let me explain why. I reinstalled it JUST so I can review this new, huge, patch.\n\nThe introduction of Goblins, who will easily wipe the party in the first week, are hugely powerful and broken. They will ALWAYS attack the player if they have even the slightest chance of winning, and will always ruin your men before they even hit level 3.\n\nThe new economy is absolutely garbage. Everything's in the thousands and quests only pay a pittance now. Literally chump change. So if you survive the first week off wimpy escorting missions (how did you survive those Goblin raiders?) then you're going to have to grind forever to try and get new, better gear. The basic metal armors cost upwards of 500 and so far I've seen things up in 6k. In the old system, things seldom get beyond 600, let alone 6,000.\n\nThe asthetics have been improved, making the game that much more beautiful, with splendid armors, dulled down to mottled greys and browns to make the game even more dreary. Though it was done so very well and fit with the theme of medieval life. A very nice plus.\n\nGameplay wise, nothing new has changed. Aside from Goblins and the economy ruining the game, the only real introduction is damage changes to armor (which are useful, I guess but the game STILL doesn't distinguish between padded surcoats and steel plates, one having more health than the other,) and the introduction of... Dogs.\n\nThat's right. Dogs. They don't do much aside from you spending your money and watching them die IMMEDIATELY. They're not helpful aside from giving you one or two ablative wounds to hold off the enemy. Retreating is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since all your men except half die. The Billhook/shield wall combo is almost impossible to even perform so just watching your men get diced by the Orc leaders is still going to happen, even moreso now.\n\nThere is no middle ground for most weapon types. So either you get a hatchet, a cheap farming tool, or you spend an whole week's worth of wages for ONE war axe. There's no middle ground there. Maybe with swords, with short sword leading to arming sword leading into the better version of that. But that is the only weapon I can think of. So early to mid game, a player is carrying around useless weapons that can barely dent the bigger enemies. We still don't have access to new abilities like learning how to do the orc charge or anything.\n\nSTILL not recommending this game. In fact, now I am actively telling people to NOT get this game until they fix the ridiculous curve players have to climb.","August 17, 2015","false","47.6"," 11 of 40 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","11","40","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/recommended/365360/","SwaiN","Fuji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGreat concept and well executed, delivers what it says it does.\n\nThis game is pretty difficult and hectic even on the easier modes, and there's a few features intentionally left out that make the game frustrating.  You can't have a base of operations and say, store recruits/veterans in a barracks.  One bad battle and your game is over, at least 75% of time.  The equipment management is sorta clunky, and the general way logistics are introduced in this game rubs me the wrong way.\n\nUnfortunately, the game really enoucrages save scumming in it's current state and does not offer much of a strategic challenge (since the majority of the time you cannot choose who you're going to be "hunting" or who'll be available for recruiting).  Many of the mechanics of the game (such as following caravans, why is there no auto follow option?) are tedious and underwhelming.  Since I have been playing the Early Access, there's not a lot of content and the game gets boring fast.\n\nThe last problem is that not only have I iterated that many of the mechanics (strategics, skills, supplies, logistics, etc.) are tedious, but also not very well explained.  In fact, there are some mechanics introduced that are just plain wrong.  For instance, "certain mercenaries prefer certain weapons."  I have done some testing personally and looked at stats, but other than a range/melee focus characters do not have weapon preferences.  This game misinforms you, does not explain its mechanics well (perhaps in an attempt not to hold your hand, though to be fair I didn't have much trouble discovering things on my own), and gives you a sparse amount of resources that are generally insufficient.\n\nDespite the fact that the game pretty much delivers what was advertised, I would not recommend it.  The fun it offers is mitigated by the tedium, though I will continue to test it out as updates come out.  The last thing I should mention is that the game is stable and in addtion I have yet to encounter any bugs, glitches, or crashes.  The Not Recommended comes purely from a lack of entertainment provided, though your mileage may vary.","August 2, 2015","false","48.3"," 1 of 28 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","1","28","0","2"

If you love tactical battles, managing/growing teams, and games that feel largely different each time you play, this is a game for you, or soon will be looking at their roadmap.\n\nAs it stands, though, the game is unflinchingly unfair.  To build a company of hardened warriors, you need fights, but the vast majority of fights are beyond the capabilities *and* most fights are few and far between. It's a huge map with little in it.  You will spend most of the time doing messenger quests or guarding caravans.  But there's something great about trying to turn a bunch of deserters, escaped servants, rat-catchers, and fresh-faced peasants into a hardened fighting force.","June 14, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty hard, especially on the beginning. You walk through the map and fight against bandits, orcs, werewolf and undead. Sometimes you loose all your company (often), sometimes you win but not without losing some men and you can spend your hard-earned gold into new stuff or new recruits. There are not much content for now but it's definitely a good game !","July 28, 2015","true","34.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shields come in all shapes with different protection from ranged and mele attacks. And they have a ton of different symbols and colors on the shield that add individual flavor to each shield.\n-Large variety of weapons. Everything from pitchforks to flails, maces, swords, axes, hatchets, crossbows, bows etc.\n-Lots of armor. All sorts of helmets and armors, scale armor, hide armor, chainmail, you name it!\n-Interesting mercenaries with nice backstories.\n-Nice leveling system where you get to manage skills and perks/special abilities.\n-Pathfinding is great except for when crossing rivers, you wont have to click a bunch of times to get where you want.\n-Combat is fun and has plenty of tactic to it.\n\nThe bad\n-Early game, at least to me, was very brutal. In the span of about 1 and a half hour I had already died like 7 times, thrice on hard and four times on medium. I had to turn down the difficulty to easy and even then my party failed. I've had other friends share similar stories.\n-Lack of variety in enemies. There's orcs, There's skeletons, There's bandits, wolves and wraiths. And that's pretty much it as far as I can see. I only have 10 hours on the game but I've roamed for a long while across the entire map and these are all the enemies I have encountered. There could be a lot more enemies coming but I've already grown extremely bored of the current enemies.\n-Small map. Although the map seems large, there are very few locations. I've already been to every city and every castle/outpost multiple times and there's never anything new or interesting. Some more locations and maybe some more things to do inside the city would be fun.\n-Fleeing archers. When you've cleared out their mele soldier and prepare to engage the archers, you will find that you will be spending 5-10 minutes moving all your troops trying to catch up with the continually fleeing archers that waste your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. Fix this.\n\nIt's been fun for about 10 hours but now things are beginning to become boring, there's nothing to do. Battling the same skeletons or bandits at this rate is just getting boring, there's no new enemies or unique quests that keep the game interesting. It becomes a grind is what I'm trying to say, it doesn't feel as if you are achieving anything. My gear is almost maxed and my guys are high leveled, I got 8000 gold but nothing to spend it on. I cant build a castle, I cant pick a fight with outposts, I cant raid villages or caravans. There quickly becomes a shortage of things to do, and that's my problem with this game. As it stands right now, I cant really recommend this game. It's not really bad, it was good for a 10 hours, but I expected much more from a game like this.\n\nEDIT: Games good after the last update, added a lot of stuff and addressed most main concerns in my original review, reccommended.","May 21, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically Mount&Blade, except that all battles are turn-based.\n\nWhat makes it special is the unique atmosphere of the procedurally generated game world. The dialogue texts let you catch a glimpse of a grim, heartless world (like in Game of Thrones) inhabited by a bunch of cynics, but the cartoon-like art style and the occasional dose of humour prevent it from becoming just another game with an overly dark setting.\nGameplaywise, the sandbox doesn't feel complete yet as the game is still in its early access phase. The player spends most of the time travelling from settlement to settlement to gain money by fulfilling contracts, most of which require going somewhere and defeating some enemies in a turn-based tactical battle with your mercenary company. This is just as unspectacular as it sounds, but I still recommend BattleBrothers because I see great potential in this game: With some more features to make the game world more alive (Rivaling factions! Dynamic economy!), this might become a marvellously immersive sandbox game - and yes, the devs release update at a decent speed.\n\nInitially I pointed out the similarity to Mount&Blade, and I think this analogy fits rather well because both games have something else in common: You might find flaws in it, the gameplay may be grindy and occasionally frustratig, but nonetheless I have to force myself to stop playing because it's so motivating.\nWhich is a good sign.\n","June 6","true","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
