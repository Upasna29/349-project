As you can see, the camera follows our intrepid infiltrator. But it does so with a smooth movement, which added to our hitbox and own acceleration concludes undoubtly in havoc.\nAlso, as far as I've played, some obstacle courses have serious design issues. They don't seem to have been beta-tested.\nThen you have the lazy interface, stock sfx and generic music to complete the pack.\nUnity has me on the edge of my seat.

The protagonist is infiltrating into a notorious jail. It is a commons sense that the protagonist should be swift and thin in order to break into this prison equipped with high security.\nMoreover, the controls are exactly identical to those of Absconding Zatwor, which means that it is extremely hard to control the character with sophistication. Break into Zatwor is a game where the player has to move the character to a certain point without alerting the security. Controls are important! I do not understand why the developers did not change these awful controls that are making the game almost impossible to complete.\nIf there is a good thing about this game, that would be the trading cards. Just play the game for some time until the random trading cards are dropped, then sell them on the market to make some money.\n","February 18","false","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The graphics are simple but decent.\nBut if you are going ot have a game where the earliest levels are extremely prrecise (or die intantly) you need to have controls that are equally precise.  Unfortunately the control schemes (both mouse and KB) are anything but.  If I didn't know better (and technically I don't) I would think there was a random numbe generator attached to the move forward or backwards controls, adjusting the angle slightly eery time you start moving.  I don't think this intentional.  It just seems like the guy moves unpordictably.  And when you have a pixel or two of leeway on level 2...  Not so good.  And this completely tanks the game.  For me anyway.\nBetter luck next time guys.","September 7, 2015","false","0.1"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Robadob/recommended/395980/","_Robadob","Robadob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Robadob/","596 products in account","The game is primarily a top-down timing and movement precision based game, whereby you must avoid cameras/sound sensors/lasters and presumably later on guards. It also appears to be a sequel to the game 'Absconding Zatwor' by the same devs, following near identical gameplay, so be sure to checkout reviews to that game if you don't trust mine. Being a Unity creation, it comes with that low barrier to entry level of quality/polish. I had several issues while playing few the first few levels.\n\nPros:\n1. Game comes with cards, so if you grab it on sale and sell the cards, the game will be very cheap.\n\nCons:\n\n1. When I played the game in fullscreen (on default settings, not native resolution), the main menu buttons were misaligned to where I had to put my mouse to click them. Luckily most the buttons highlight on hover, I didn't continue into the game so unsure if it persists.\n\n2. I continued playing in windowed mode, looking in the gameplay settings you can choose to either use mouse or keyboard to play, however you cannot switch between both mid level (you can't enable both at the same time for some bizarre reason) you have to exit to the main menu, then reload up the level.\n\n3. Using mouse for movement seems inherently flawed, its not point and click movement, whereby you click where you want to walk and the character walks, you must hold the mouse button and put the cursor in the direction you want the character to walk, given the precision and timing required to move the character into small spaces in some levels this becomes very hard, as the place your cursor is pointing moves as the screen follows the character. There's a level whereby you must walk in sync with some fast spinning cameras however, whereby holding the mouse to move in a general direction would be favoured, allowing click/hold mouse movement could significantly improve gameplay.\n\n4. Secondly, the mouse cursor is a pair of black footsteps, this can be hard to see in certain levels against the background and similar, it would do better in a high contrast colour so it is always clearly visible. Simiarly, this cursor is visible when playing with keyboard controls despite the mouse having no functionality.\n\n5. I next tried playing with the keyboard, the keyboard controls consist of left-right arrows to rotate your character, and up-down to move you character forwards and backwards respectively. These controls just seemed unusual to me and do not make the movement precision any easier. Despite being able to walk in a straight line, I still struggled to get very far in Level 9 which consists of a thin straight corridors of lasers you must avoid whilst walking between.\n\n\nTldr:\nThe developers should ask some of their friends to play through the game and find out what bugs them, and have a go at fixing it. The game idea seems sound albeit simple, however the movement precision required to pass some of the puzzles is hard to achieve with the controls the game currently provides.","August 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

While it was kind of a cool concept at first, the controls are just plain bad, you can barely move, not to say, barely avoid obstacles. The keyboard controls are unacceptable, you basically can't play with them, while the mouse controls make it hard to make precise moves. The game is badly optimized, it barely runs on my computer for some reason. I've got games, like Portal 2 running on this PC without a problem, while this game runs at about 20fps.\nI think, that I'm pretty happy with what I got, considering I got this game for free, but you could put more effort into it.\nIf not for cards, I don't think this game is really worth any money.\n3/10 (I liked the concept)","December 31, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
