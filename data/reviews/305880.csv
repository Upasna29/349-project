Before you stands a mysterious owl, he explains that stuff is %$&@ed up and that playing a mini-puzzle game on the arcade machine him behind will probably fix stuff. He would have solved the puzzle himself but he doesn't have hands, plus he's too stupid. He moves aside and lets you have a go at the puzzle game. You solve it in like 3 seconds, because you do have hands ... and you're smarter than an owl.\n\nThus begins your epic quest to solve all the problems of this land by solving these progressively harder and harder puzzles on all the arcade machines you come across. They are also surrounded by various dumb animals with no hands. As you solve the puzzles, rocks turn to trees, buildings are restored, sinkholes are filled, fox tents are replaced, crops are un-killed ... uhm ... oh yeah .... treasure chests are revealed and new paths appear. Don't ask how this works, but it does. It's based on a true story.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, and definitely become more and more challenging as you progress through the game. You will get stuck. You will be perplexed. You may even wish you didn't have hands so you could make someone else solve them for you.\n\nThis is a fun, addictive puzzle game. I'm not sure it's $10 worth of fun puzzle game so I'd suggest waiting for a good sale.\n\n7.5/10\n\n","February 20, 2015","true","33.1"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","89","24","27","15","2"

There's so much charm and quality in this modest little game that it's a crying shame it hasn't recieved more attention.\n\nJudging from the screenshots, I thought this was going to be a match 3 Puzzle Quest style game. Turns out it's not like that at all. You have to make all the gems on the left panel match the ones on the right using a progressive upgrade system based on where you click (The gem you click upgrades two colors while the ones on the sides upgrade only one color). It has a kind of Minesweeper feel. It's not brutally difficult and it doesn't rush you in your decisions.\n\nThe music, sound effects, and graphics really sell the game for me. This feels like a puzzle game ported straight from the SNES. The aesthetics are relaxing and invoke pure delight whenever you finish a puzzle and see more of the map reveal itself. The music took me by surprise immediately upon entering the game. It's really nice.\n\nOn one hand, I'm ecstatic that I got this game dirt cheap in a bundle. On the other, I am saddened that it has recieved so little attention that it was relegated to bundle fodder in the first place. Good work should not go unrewarded, and I will be sure to spread the word about this charming little puzzle game as much as possible.\n\nBecause I don't yet know how much content is here, I can't confidently say that the game is worth the asking price of $9.99. But as I said earlier, it was dirt cheap in a bundle. I'd also recommend it whenever it goes on sale for sure. I will try to update my review as soon as I know more about the length.","March 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

There's a timer, but that's just there for the non-existant high score counter. The fact there's an undo button is great as well, because it creates very low-stakes gameplay that I can just relax with. The graphics are also crazy appealing, with lots of vibrant colors that really stand out and make the game feel really pleasent. It's a great game, and being able to pick it up for the price of less than a sandwich is great. One of the best impulse buys I've made in the past year.","December 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And then i tough that i would probably play this game more than 5 mins and forget that it exist. Damn that i was wrong. I LOVE this game. The gameplay is great, the music is great, i can just play and relax, no stress, just enjoyement. 10/10.","October 24, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I give me flash backs to columns on the Sega Genesis just a tad, it is Point and click as a default control scheme though.
