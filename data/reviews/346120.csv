Every weapon is unique in its own way and some of their effects are actually fun to use. They can even be used right away during battle after unlocking.\n\nThere are different variety of game modes you can try out (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Zombies, and more) and a bunch of maps that provide a real effect on the battle (Ice on the ground, traps, water). If you create a server you can even mess around with the options for a better experience.\n\nYou can talk to players via typing.\n\nGameplay runs smoothly most of the time on my laptop with settings set to low and windowed.\n\nDownloading and installing is quick and easy.\n\n----------------\n\nRight now the server list is sparce. You have to either wait awile for a server to be open or create your own and wait for more players to join. So you can't just jump right in with other players sometimes.\n\nThere was some lag that shows in a way that aiming and movement gets difficult.\n\nYou can be spawned-killed easily if you don't move away after invincibility wears off. Even when switching loadouts or weapons.\n\n----------------\n\nMovement is easy, yet difficult to master.\n\nThe game can be customized to suit what you want on your screen, like the crosshairs, the color of your character, and  even the sound of landing a hit on your opponent. Think there are others I haven't tried out yet.\n\nThere is a map editor. Haven't touched it so I don't know much about it.\n\n----------------\n\nRecommend it if you like the multiplayer experience and/or want to kill some boredom.","February 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","62","67","9","0"

"BORING Man"....how boring can this be?  I saw the trailer and was interested in putting that name to the test.  And my result?....\n\n\nThis...is one BORING game...you hear me?   This is a BORING game for BORING people.\n\n\n\n..........This game redefines "Boring".  It's a stickman combat game that anybody can pick up and play with a minimalistic hands-on tutorial.  There is a small "Boring" lore to keep you interested...all focusing on our hero Boring Man in his legacy to end The Man.\n\nAs for how this game plays?   Imagine playing TF2, except only having one class......now imagine that one class being customizeable with grenades and ALL weapons in the entire game in a way that you essentially make your own class.  The customization here gives you a massive freedom of choice and a chance to experiment after death as you can change your load-out after ever death if you so choose.\n\n\nPros:\nNew boring weapons after every level up (When you get them all, you are eligible for golden weapons.  Great for customization)\nNice boring main menu theme\nMultiple boring modes including survival, zombie survival, CTF, CP, parkour, and deathmatch.\nBoring taunts like barfing, smoking, drinking, etc.\nOptional boring bosses.\nRumor has it, this can run on almost any ancient, dinosaur-model boring PC.\nBoring Customization that lets you make whatever boring playstyle you prefer.\nBoringly Free.\n\n\nCons:\nA port-forward achievement is kind of.....off-putting (We're on Steam.  Simply joining through Steam would be a better option)\nCould use more servers.\n\n\n\nThis game is minimalistic, yet has so much.   This game is a case of having more with less.  Truly this game is one of the better free games on Steam.   One Manga Day could learn a thing or two from Spasman's Boring Man.  Truth be told, Boring Man is up there with Jigoku Kisetsukan (Another free Steam title).\n\n\nNow, it's not EPIC, but is great for any boring day.  Pick up Boring Man today, you boring players!!!\n\n8.75/10...such a boring score!","August 8, 2015","true","66.6"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","87","48","55","36","9"

You can unlock LOADS of weapons and create your own Taser-Katana loadout, m'ladies will love this!\nBut then you see this fabulous laser gun you haven't unlocked yet - just encourage the fella holding it to drop it for you!\nThere is lots fun to be had for free!

Now THAT intrigued me. So, what do I think about it?\n\nWhat I like:Easy to learn, I remember getting to the top of the Tab list even though I'm lower than level 10\nSimplicity, it's a 2D online stickman platforming shooter, that pretty much summarises everything\nNO BUY TO WIN, thats right, for a F2P game, it's all about skill, money won't get you any gears, they only give you cool visual effects\nLevel ups and unlockables, you'll level up really fast and each level will grant you a new weapon randomly, I got my favorite weapon from the first few rolls so, it won't take long to find a weapon you will get attached to\nLoadouts, customise your own playstyle. Like going in slashing everything? Suicide bombing (sensitive topic :P)? Camp and snipe? Or a cool combo of grapling hooking to the back of your enemies and backstab/shoot them at the back of their head? This games got you covered.\nWhat I dislike:Not much strategizing, it's mostly just run and gun\nLaggy, as expected of an online game :\\nNo friend system, I wanna make friends >:(\nFinal Thoughts:It's a really fun F2P game with solid gameplay and a great time waster\nI give this game a high\n9/10I don't really see anything wrong with it, it's really good considering IT DOESN'T COST YOU A CENT, really worth playing in my opinion","February 28","true","9.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This game is probably best to pass the time. I lke the game, the only things I think the developer should change is instead of press "E" on a ladder, just press "W" instead, and also when you press "W" to jump, it seems as if it lags a bit, like the time in between pressing "W" and actually jumping, so I hope the developer changes it so that you jump when you press "W" instantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperLuke/recommended/346120/","HyperLuke","HyperLuke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HyperLuke/","38 products in account","Boring Man is a game which takes the mechanics of an FPS, removes a dimension (and regenerating health), puts in loads of crazy weapons, and everyone is a stick-man. This game is anything but tactical. It plays a lot like quake with fast paced movement, and rocket jumping. Most of the weapons were fun to use, encouraged new play styles, and had fun little quirks about them. Such as how when you crouch with the  machine gun, it turns it from a suppressor, into a great guarding weapon. All the modes were unique and interesting. You've got Death-match, Team death-match, CTF, survival, zombies, Take over, and weapons deal, which is like COD gun game. The modes again, felt very fun to play and CTF had its own interesting mechanic where there is a generator in each of the bases, this powers the defensive turret, ammo dispenser, and tele-porters, which make games very interesting. However there are some downsides, the game is very glitchy, having internet problems here and there, shots not registring, and more. The game could also be great with a single-player campaign, survival mode alone didn't feel like enough.\n\nOverall, Boring Man is an incredibly fun online 2D shooter, if your a fan of FPS games but want a change, Boring Man has a lot to offer. 8.5/10","May 18","true","85.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s the first time you approach Los Santos from afar, the skyline ablaze with neon, San Andreas’ decadence forgotten as you bask in its warm glow. It’s at these moments that it all sinks in: the grandeur, the scope, and the scale. You come to realise Boring Man OTSC encompasses, for better or worse, everything that’s come to define this console generation. The violence, the scale, the raw ambition and the missed opportunities – it’s all there in the shining city. This contemplative state doesn’t last long. Once Stevie Wonder’s Skeletons starts blazing out of the speakers, we are gone. Off to commit as many hit-and-runs as we can in five minutes.\nBORING MAN is still, after all, a series which delights in tooling you up and pointing you in the direction of the closest heavily populated area for fleeting moments of murderous carnage. If you’re familiar with the act of standing on a rooftop, gleefully taking down police choppers with well placed sniper rounds, or derailing a legion of virtual citizens’ mornings as you career a bulldozer into rush hour traffic then you’re going to fall in love with BORING MAN all over again.\nLet’s get this out of the way now: this is one of the best open world games ever created and there won’t likely be one to rival it until the developer decides to adopt next-gen development kits. Across this generation, we’ve seen other games take and pare down the formula established by BORING MAN into entertaining bite-sized chunks: Crackdown recreated the expansive city; Saints Row took the irrelevant mayhem; Test Drive Unlimited embraced the countless distractions, but none have come close to attaining the astonishing level of detail that BORING MAN harnesses on a minute-by-minute basis.\nThe developer is slowly evolving the formula that has served it so well for over a decade; it no longer exists solely for the joy of channeling destruction. Sure, the freedom to havoc your way across Downtown Los Santos in nothing but a dress, equipped with a nightstick – as you inevitably shall do – is still there, but you’re no longer inherently compelled to torture the souls of this fair city. If anything, its greatest achievement is how effortlessly the player is eased into a living, breathing world, and not just a sandbox adorned with death and disaster.\n","March 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","10","15","9","0"

Stickman game. Ever.\n\nPros:\nUpdated frequently, guns are added pretty often\n\nLots of gear, 80 different weapons/tools and more are still being added. I know it says 70 different gear but trust me, it's 80.\n\nNot pay to win, money will only give you hats, double jump effects, bullet color, chat color, golden names, and some more chat commands.\n\nChat /smoke, (gives you a cigar) /yeehaw, (your character yells yeehaw) /drink, (your character drinks liquor)\n\nA decent variety of game modes, Zombrains, Climb, Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch (my favorite)\n\nPrivate games, you can host a private game for your friends, or you can host a private game with bots, and as long as you don't put on game settings that disable your experience points game, you can level up from bots. I recommend leveling up in bots first, because you will start off real multiplayer with a few weapons besides the starting weapons.\n\nGolden weapons, once you unlock all of the guns, every time you level up there will be a chance for you to get a random golden weapon, it is just like unlocking a new weapon all over again!\n\nThere is a way to effectively use all the weapons, except for the pineapple.\n\nCons:\n\nTo host a game yourself, you have to portforward. Portforwarding is not the easiest thing to do.\n\nAll the official dedicated servers are always full, you have to constantly refresh the servers for an opening.\n\nThat's all the cons I have, highly recommend this game, don't listen to the negative reviews, this game is a masterpiece. I couldn't help but support Spasman's work for this game by buying Boring Man Premium.\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 29","true","21.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbuhdai/recommended/346120/","elbuhdai","Ɛɭ Ɓʊɧɖąį","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbuhdai/","75 products in account","WARNING: SUPER LONG REVIEW INCOMING!!! Verdict is at the bottom.\n\nI've been told my reviews are too long, because the Steam community can't handle intelligent reviews anymore and just wants "20/10 guns in teh gaem!11!!", so here's some friendly little bullet points that EVERYONE can read!! :D\n\nPros:\n\n- The weapon balancing\n- Really fun and addictive\n- The developer, Spasman, who is independent, is cool and I've spoken with him before while on his Capture the Flag server.\n- Premium takes cosmetic customization to a fun new (and sometimes witty) level.\n- The only "DLC" is not even the slightest bit P2W, as it only offers really cool cosmetic options and 4 extra loadouts\n- Probably has the coolest weapon acquirement system of all shooters that don't take themselves too seriously. When you level up you get 1 of the 70 weapons at random, and when all of those are unlocked, you get a 25% chance to unlock a shiny sparkling gold version of one whether you supported Spasman with Premium or not.\n- It's free and downloads super quickly, so you have nothing to lose for trying it.\n- Really great CTF mode, probably the best I've seen. Each team has a defense turret near their flag, although it is terribly placed in the desert city map, allowing players to get the flag without even having to get in the line of fire of that turret. Also, there is an ammo and health resupply point for the team that doesn't run out. The turret and resupply can both be destroyed completely by gunfire or disabled by destroying that team's generator. The generator is broken until repaired by a member of that team. The turret and resupply remain broken until a red meter goes down or it is repaired by someone wielding a wrench.\n\nCons: Literally, one con leads to the next...\n\n- The weapon balancing...\n- There's like 5 or 10 thousand people named "Boring Man". This is not an exaggeration either, because many of them have numbers automatically assigned after their name depending on which Boring Man they were to sign up. I think the highest I've seen is "Boring Man(5 thousand and something)" Many people don't know how to change their name. I guess they COMPLETELY missed the options menu. Which will bring me to my next point...\n- The game is VASTLY divided in terms of skill levels. You see, it's like America... There's a few SUPER skilled players beyond all comprehension (players like me, MSN, Zyph, Matt the Killer, Swag Ninja :3, Nightmare God, and Doflamingo who I'd say is the best player of all...), and there is an overwhelming amount of bad players with not much of a "middle-class" skill level. A good majority of these bad players have the name Boring Man or Boring Man(some numbers). WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT...\n- The community is really small, which is good AND bad. None of the famous youtubers have played it yet and brought a whole bunch of noobs to fill the servers without hosting any themselves. The small community is the main reason I was able to name-drop those other good players, because I see some of them and a few others I didn't name playing almost every time I am. Although it's a small community, it's really good. Server admins don't abuse, or ban too many weapons because they think they're "OP", and whenever Spasman's servers go down, the community comes through in a matter of minutes, filling the lobby with their laggy servers with few slots to try and help the traffic.\n- There are some annoying glitches and things that should be a little more smooth to do in-game, but Spasman updates as regularly as an independent developer with a paper clip's budget who is STILL working a job can manage, so those things will be ironed out eventually. This leads me to my final con...\n- Some aspects of multiplayer can be a mess at times. A good connection with servers is hard to establish unless your internet is REALLY good. Mine is great, but not REALLY good, so sometimes there are issues. Some servers can't be connected to, even if the host forwarded their ports, and hit detection on multiplayer is the worst thing since canned sardines at times. People lose games because their bullets decided not to collide at the wrong time or the image of the player is ahead or behind where the player him or herself is on their own screen.\n\nMy name in the game is El Buhdai and I own the clan HTK with Swag Ninja :3, formerly Mad Ninja :3. I am a REALLY good player, and I mean really good. I often win whole CTF games without anyone else on my team scoring, and little to no scores from the other team. This is not to brag, because I've practiced a lot to be this good. I play this game plenty, mainly on Spasman's CTF server, or my own which I host from time to time (It's called El Buhdai's Unique Server, or E-BUS), so if you see me, fell free to holla at yo man and just say you saw my review or whatever lol. This is not about me though, this is about Spasman and his great game, so what's the verdict?\n\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n"While it has some glitches and issues that hurt the game at times, Boring Man is an epic 2D Action Shooter-Platformer-Parkour(er) that has a fresh, new approach to a lot of old concepts in shooters, along with plenty of ways to keep you entertained for hours on end. You can see my playtime as evidence. Boring Man gets a 7/10, only because of the issues. If these issues are eventually to be fixed, which I have faith that they will be since Spasman has demonstrated reliability, I will give the game a solid 9/10."","May 23, 2015","true","254.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

(and usually missing) The variety of weapons obviously helped the content of the game, but mainly the gravity of multiple projectiles also helped give different situations in which certain weapons could be used, thus helping the variety of approaches which gives more content and fullness to the game.\n\nThe large amount of gamemodes definately increased the amount of content and variety; the variety adds more options for players and thus increases the time retention of anyone playing.\n\nA progression factor is found in the leveling system, in which over time as players do more things to earn XP, they will unlock more weapons to complete there arsenal of 70 weapons, in which if they do they can level up to get golden versions of all the weapons in their arsenal; I think I should also add that every weapon in this game is good for different purposes, there aren't much "one is better than the other" situations.\n\nOverall the only problems with the game are the amount of bugs at this stage of it, and the, well, 'okay' graphics, besides that there are no major problems.\n\nIt's revolutionary in a way and quite fun, 8/10\n\n"It's very poorly made, mabye it's good as a joke game, 14/10" - IGN\n\n"This game is exetremely entertaining and revolutionary, I love it! 3/10" - Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nThe above quotes are jokes and are fake.","March 27, 2015","true","60.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

The only real problem I have with this game is the servers. It may of course be due to the lack of a community, and seems to be more popular in the US region. As for if you live in the EU, unless you like playing against bots which are even more challenging than those on Team Fortress 2.. *cough cough* sarcasm; then you should enjoy yourself well enough.\n\nOne of the features I really like about the game is the levelling up system which really differs from the games of old. Like I remember I used to play a lot of Raze 2 which was a sort of arena-like game in which you could pick up weapons like a railgun or a variety of I think 9 weapons, and whoever reached the top score won. In a way I wish this game was something like that, but honestly I like it the way it is.\n\nHow this levelling system works is you'll level up and hear some kind of sound, and this mini-window in the game will pop up and you'll unlock a random weapon like a lever-action rifle.\n\nI do recommend this game, but I hope Spas (the developer) improves his server system at some point, or does something pretty big to expand his community.","March 14, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My weapons that I've spent a good 55.4 hours working for (that were randomly selected by the game it self meaning i didn't get to choose them) were randomly deleted and my level stat of 63 was reverted back to level 1. with seemingly the same amount of exp that i had left off with at level 63 before the random demotion. All in all this game is the OPPOSITE of the title. It is very fun and pretty much made it easy to get lost in it. I didn't do anything but join dm servers and level up. which of course took me 55 solid hours of hard work and play for it all to vanish into literal thin air. SO if there is a fix for this please let me know in my pms or comments section, thanks.\n\n\nPS. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH FUN IT IS, ALL 55 HOURS OF ENDLESS ENJOYMENT WERE WAY WORTH THE PRICE I PAYED FOR PREMIUM.","December 12, 2015","true","374.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

As simple looking boring man is... it is fun as heeeeck. Its a 2d online shooter platformer with different and fun game modes that everyone can enjoy. The level system is also a great way of getting rewarded. See.... when you level up, you dont go up a rank, you simply get, a random weapon. AND DONT WORRY! All the weapons in my opinion are fun, and easy to use. And also, there is no mic system involved! So you don't have to listen to people yell or scream! But anyway.... this is one of the best, freee to play game i have played. So pls.... DOWNLOAD THE GAME!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!

It has a decent amount of options such as hitsounds, showing damage, removing the toutorial, and coloring your stickman. Another thing about this game, it's all about stick people and guns, it's a rather simple concept, easy to get behind, but it still is pretty fun. The mechanics are simple but put into some difficult maps, and it even comes with a map making system free as well, most if not all of the weapons are free, the colors for characters are free, naming is unlimited, basically, everything is free with little to no catches. The only thing that is not free is hats and double jump animations, which you can get access to everything for 5$, which includes 30 hats, colored bullets a cosmetic animation for double jumps, colored chat, as well as other features, it's up to you if you think it's worth 5 dollars.\n\nThe game although it can incorporate teamwork fairly easily, takes more of a common shooter approach where everyone is doing their own thing. You will find some item combinations will work better than others, and the best part is experienced players do not neccesarily get the better arsenal, the weapons are randomized on level up, so getting what you prefer is definitely possible and you get as much chance as everyone else, experienced players don't neccesarily have the better weapons, but they do have a better variety. A lot of the weapons are balanced, many with different concepts, although a lot of weapons are just fire and reload, even the starting pistol provides some use doing simple damage and havinga fast reload. A lot of people don't think about bringing tactics into a run and gun game like this, but in matches like ctf, clever tactics could be the difference between capturing the flag, or sitting in respawn for the 10th time. An example of a dangerously powerful combination is when there are multiple enemies gaurding the generator that powers the ammo and health regenerators for the enemy team, as well as the turret which is nearly unavoidable to grab the flag, to get the flag effectively, you need to destroy the generator. Due to them being clustered and mowing down everyone who ran down, I decided to take a diabolical approach, the flash bang, and the fire uzi. Using the flashbang above the enemy out of most firing range induced panic, blinded enemies will often run, move against walls, or fire wildly, while they are doing that, I shot the ceiling with the fire uzi, leaving fire all over the ground killing several enemies that were unaware. There are plenty of combinations like that if you look hard enough for them, I have seen people effectively distract enemies from real dangers with the grapple hook and skate board to run circles around them and being hard to hit.\n\nSo the game has solid gameplay and is all around enjoyable, the lore is rather strange but I do believe it's suppose to be simple minded, easy to understand, and a little goofy, I still wonder why they added so many side characters and factions but never included them into the game though, if you read the lore and check the colors of some players in some modes, you just might run into people who have also read it. Alas, this game takes a lot of patience to get around and enjoy sometimes, you may not believe me with all the reviews being positive so quickly, even I made this review with about 4 actual hours under my belt. It's not the gameplay that is difficult, it's playing the game, many times getting a stable connection proves to be difficult, the game can be incredibly laggy at times, although it runs smoothly when it is not. Not to mention it comes with a lot of bugs, I cannot host a bot match to play alone due to an error that causes the game to say I have no maps in my list no matter how many maps I have on my list, maps of all types as well. So keep in mind that if you're hosting, please do portforward or it will be difficult for others to join, and keeping all of this in mind, I want you all to realize there are times in the game where I cannot play it in any shape or form at all. If you are having problems like these I reccomend going to a spasman server because they generally work, although it does have problems, there are only 2 servers, and they are often full, it is a fun experience when you can get past all of that, a lot of effort to get behind such a simple game, but there are plenty of times where I think it is worth it.\n\nOverall, I think the game is a 6/10. Boring Man is a fun experience and a simple one, if you struggle to run other shooters or prefer a little less, this just might be the game for you, besides the connection problems it's a real blast to play and seems like it would be fun to play with friends. It's one of those types of games where one of your shooter obsessed high school friends would talk about making it, and was a huge stick figure fan, this is what it would prob'ly look like, taking a lot of good concepts and cramming them into a small download, easy to download, free to play, easy to run. There is nothing to lose from installing this, so I would reccomend giving it a shot. Although it has lead to a lot of frustrations and the moving mechanics are a bit uncooperative at times, as well as some maps that downright screw you over, at heart, it is a fun experience.","March 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

None of the muliplayer servers have a ping of less than 120, and I live in the southern U.S., heck, I cant even connect to 95% of the servers, actually.\n3: It is nearly impossible to tell friend from foe at first glance, because everyone is colored differently. Shot my allies exclusively on my first match.\n4: Ladders just dont work half the time, this mostly being caused by horrible lag and unresponsive controls.","February 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 110 of 225 people (49%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","49","110","225","15","10"

It's kinda boring. You might want to check it out of curiosity or because of stickman's nostalgia. Maybe if we were younger, prettier and without all kind of amazing free to play games then maybe it would draw us for longer. Sadly, it doesn't. At least I don't feel like sticking with stickmans once again.

The game itself is awesome but I seem to have problems with Boring Man. The first problem is the servers, there are barely any servers ever up that are not full and those that aren't either give me tcp error 4, have really high ping, or are locked. Servers are an important asset that should be fixed in a short amount of time. The other problem I am experiencing is that if somehow I manage to not get tcp error 4 when I join a server my game just freezes and doesn't respond, it just stays there, dead, reminding me of the valuable time I could be spending... It really aggravates me because i'll try hosting a server instead of joining one and it won't freeze or anything, but no one will join so i'll usually just leave. Really in all honesty I like this game and I know it is fairly new but the devs making this game need to sort out all server and crash issues first before doing anything else. For now I won't be recommending it until the servers get fixed or they implement patches.","March 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

On most game modes I've had a decent experience, however there is one game mode which is both my favorite ally and yet my greatest enemy.  Zombie mode.  You may be surprised to hear that the real challenge is the human zombies/ players.  While the actual challenge is the unfairness of the bot zombies as they can easily spawn on you, exploding and killing you within 5 seconds of the match.   This may seem like a non-issue, however the prolonged effect of the bot zombies continuously and completely unfairly killing ruthlessly, it gets annoying.  I played for 2 hours and not once died to a player and only died to bot kamzombies that spawned ontop of me.  Until this unfair part of the game is fixed, I personally find that the game has lost its unique game style and fun that attracted myself ot the game in the first place.  To conclude, this game is fun yet broken in some areas and until they are improved I cannot recommend to get an unfinished game. 0 outta 5 "Dunkey"","March 25","false","40.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

Once i got the game i thought it was cool. When i actually played the game for about 5 minutes i started to get sick of it and these are the reasons why:\n\n-Whenever you spawn someone people blast you with a bazooka or just spawn camps you.\n-When your trying to kill someone another guy kills you and another guy kills him.\n-When someone uses a flashbang the whole screen goes white for 10 whole seconds (just an estimate) .\n-screen shakes (i don't know what does it since i only stuck around for 10 minutes)\n-when you get a new gun/melee weapon and try to change to it someone kills you.\n\nI'm probably the only one who dislikes this game but its just not my cup of tea.","May 19, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
