Spread it out and use some HUD and symbols to allevate it.\n\nOtherwise a very strong work in progress\n","August 4, 2015","false","3.5"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

This made my experience frustrating & boring. I pretty much gave up at this point due to poor & messy game design.\n\nThe game has been left to die out for months after the devs announced their promoting update.\n\nI can't recommend this game to anyone in this poor state. I wanted to like this unique game but I can't. I will update this review when its get revised again.\n\nTill then, #RIP Zone 22 :'(\n\nEdit: Dev says he still working on it as he clains "Not dead, reworking every aspect of the game." So that's good news, just waitng for him to deliver his update","March 4","false","3.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
