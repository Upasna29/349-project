I have been playing it since its first release in 2001 and have yet to become tired of it. It's an RPG with great characters, plot deveopment and both outrageous and sophisticated humor. It leads you on from one story development to another, and just when you think you have a handle on what's going to happen it throws a curve and you're off on another tangent. I guess you could call it a role playing, film noir satire and space opera. This 12 year old  game looks great.The attention to visual detail is admirable. The music as well is inspired and puts a spin on each level. Don't forget side quests and areas to explore. It's quite possible you'll find things (or characters) on a subsequent playthrough you missed the first time which will add to the experience.","November 6, 2013","true","568.9"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","92","98","0","2"

And yes, it's totally worth it. Anachronox was intended as the first chapter of a trilogy (the game has a proper ending, but it's a "chapter" ending, not a "series" ending) and is affected by mild glitches, like falling out of the bounds of the map in some particular places, but nothing game-breaking. Also, you may have problems running it with the more recent systems.\nBUT, if you can overlook these minor faults, all that is left is a really good game. It plays like a third-person adventure game with   RPG elements and turn-based combat, with skill-related (like lockpicking) and story-related (and skippable, if it's a hassle for you) minigames. The combat is pretty much the less interesting part of this game, but the story, oh, the story.\nStory, setting, writing, character development, dialogues and voiceovers, they're excellent. Lots of humorous moments, the game delivers without being too cheesy. The background music makes a bit of atmosphere, but that's it, nothing really outstanding.\nThe difficulty levels just define how spongy the enemies are, you can make it through the entire game without grinding levels, controls are ok, plenty of secret bits. You can watch again every cutscene from the main menu, very low replay value. Be sure to install the widescreen fix.\nIt's also pretty cheap, even cheaper during sales. Definitively recommended.","September 3, 2014","true","67.0"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xvocab/recommended/242940/","xvocab","okay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xvocab/","842 products in account","I love this game. It's a western made jrpg on the quake 2 engine. It's pretty much a spoof on the save the world plot most rpgs have. Ya, it's old as ♥♥♥♥, the camera gets jerky, the combat anit too hot, and there's some bugs like falling through the world in this specific spot that was never fixed in patches, but everything else about the game is fantastic. Great world, great characters, and great ost.\n\nThe written dialogue in this game is on another level though. Not many games have as much charm, attention to detail and self awareness in its dialogue like this game. Plus, it's dynamic. Talk to most npcs with each of your party members. Not only will you get a different response, but they are treated as a different character all together. Many lines had me laughing which is rare in an rpg. It's just the game really throws some curveballs at you with its delivery. You will run into some weird random dialogue, and it will come at the perfect time. It's just unpredictable, and it's refreshing because of it.\n\nHow does the game play outside the combat? It honestly plays like an adventure game where you explore the world with your party members. You pick up items, interact with npcs, and use your party members to interact with certain world objects. Each party member has a world skill and can be only used when you have the member in your party. Most of the interactions are mainly minigames. Some of them are simple like picking a lock which becomes a game of hot and cold or opening a hidden lock by throwing a coin at it, and the mini game is lining up the coin with the switch x amount of times (not my personal favorite). There's some other ones that are goofy, but I won't spoil them or the other party members you get because that's one of the best parts!\n\nHere comes the biggest flaw this game has: Some times you'll come across a world interaction such as a computer screen or a terminal lock, and you'll not be able to interact with it unless you have that party member. While most aren't mandatory, you will always run into them one way or another. So what do you do? You have to go all the way back to your base of operations and pick up that party member and backtrack all the way back to the interaction. It's a common problem that the metroidvania genre faces, but it adds a lot of depth and replayability incase you miss them. The backtracking becomes tiresome. However, luckly one of the programmers for the game added a speed hack button to speed up running everywhere in one of the patches. It makes things less tedious.\n\nOh, and you will miss stuff in this game. Completionist be damned, because there's no way you'll find all of it without a guide (especially the PAL items). Even certain cutscenes, and areas because one section of the game has three distinct branching paths. It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to side quests at all. Once you find out that there are two npcs that work together it becomes a little easier, but early on you will have no clue who the hell some of these named characters are. The names in this game are completely out there, and some of them you wouldn't dare try and pronounce. Thankfully the side quest directions that are given are pretty clear so it's not some cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you will bang your head on a desk over and over for. Also, there's items you can only get after certain parts of the game. So the game encourages you to retread ground and retalk to every npc hoping you get some new item or some new side quest. None of the optional stuff is required of you, but you will be get much more powerful battle skills, and other equipment if you do so.\n\nLast but not least there's one mechanic of the game I didn't quite get. The Elementor system. It's supposed to be a way to customize your MysTech to be more powerful, but it's very complicated. You need different color beetles, flower petals, cobalt crawlers, and function hosts. You insert beetles on grids while given it a flower petal to level your beetle up, and using different color beetles to offset opposing elementals. Or something like that... I don't know, I just don't know! I don't even know what cobalt crawlers or function hosts do, but you need them! I did some small reading on it, and it involved math, and some other explanations on other things like grid layouts that made me go "right....." I didn't quite comprehend any of it. I ultimately gave up on the mechanic simply because the game gave such a small explanation, and that's it. You can beat the game without ever using it. However, it's power for your party that you'll never be able to access.\n\nThis game came out in 2001. Obviously overshadowed because that was the year where so many great games came out. This one was buried among them all. Which is ashame because it's somewhat forgotten, and only really discussed among rpg enthusiasts (which is how I learned about it). There isn't anything quite like this game to this date. I know some of the things I mention might sound pretty cumbersome, but they are minor issues at best, and never really hold the game back. It's both bizarre, strange, compelling, and a lot of fun. It's the second best Ion storm game, and if a sequel (which was planned at some point) was kickstarted, it would be quite the task to make a game quite as crazy as this one.\n\nGive it a shot. It's pretty great.","August 5, 2015","true","29.8"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","30","30","3","2"

Borrows heavily from classic JRPGs, such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6 and 7, etc. It is very good, but hard to recommend. Here's why:\n\nPros:\nGreat story, lots of awesome cutscenes, weird, but loveable characters, decent voice acting, good writing and sense of humor.\n\nCons:\nBUGS! I don't believe you could even finish it after the initial release. Even after several patches, official and fan-made, it is still riddled with bugs. When playing for the first time I got permanently stuck in scenery soon after watching intro animation. Had to restart and watch it again (it is unskippable).\nHyperactive, nauseating camera can be very annoying.\nBattles are nearly broken - very awkward interface, long repetitive animations, camera so busy flying around, you can't see what you are going to do. Only hardest skill level is somewhat challenging.\nLots of backtracking. Just to switch characters in your party you have to literally leave the planet, by running through empty locations, going through several elevator animations, many loading screens, and then go back.\nThe game was obviously rushed, some locations still have crude, unfinished look, some animations don't work. The graphics did not age really well and frequently looks dated even for 2001.\n\nMusic is average. Moody, atmosheric synth stuff. Some tunes are good, most are bland and repetitive.\n\nMy advice for those who still plan to play:\nLaunch the game through "Anachronox GCT setup" app(already present in installation folder), DO NOT launch through Steam, otherwise most animations will be broken. Basically, the game will be unplayable.\nUse fast-forward button, it is '\' by default, I think. Or you'll go mad. Rebind to more accessible key.\nEnable "save anywhere" option and use it. It is not game-breaking and can potentially save you some more time.\nMake notes. The game is not able to track side-quests, only the main ones. Remembering side quests, hints and secret locations is up to you.","October 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","8"

They don't make games like this anymore, and I mean that quite literally.\nThis game took some serious risks in terms of design and originality, and pretty much all of them paid off. It takes a darkly comedic approach to science fiction, and manages to create a rather believable universe in the process. The seamless blend of rpg, sci-fi, and clever writing make this a game worth playing.\n\nHowever, the combat is abysmally slow and unavoidable; and much of the early game's experience is marred by pointless fetch-questing and backtracking. This can be aleviated by using the "\" key to fastforward the game, a fact which I was not aware of on my playthrough. I am glad I muscled through it however, as the game is quite remarkable in its presentation, and still holds up after all these years.

Think of Blade Runner mixed with KOTOR but without Lightsaber and religious nonsense.\nThe game isn't very serious and most of the time leaning more towards comedic approach. And it works.\n\nGameplay is separated into two categories, exploration and spelunking.\n\n1. When in exploration parts of the game there is almost no battles involved.\nMainly running around the cities looking for clues.\nIt runs very similar with KOTOR but with more interactions.\n\n+Story is great. Interstellar detective in action? Count me in.\n\n+Bizzare and yet unique characters. (A PLANET!!)\n\n+Dialogue are witty but sadly most of them aren't voiced (except cutscenes).\n\n+There is some degree of customizations. Espescially around the middle of the game when you found a certain "magic."\n\n+Cutscenes are a bit lacking for an RPG, though all of them are very well made and satisfying. (some really made me laugh so hard)\n\n-Lots of missable stuff. Reading walkthrough is recommended.\n\n-Steam overlay not working.\n\n-Some areas are too dark. So you will be playing with full gamma setting most of the time. It's annoying.\n\n-The camera is bad.\nWhen interacting with stuffs most of the time there will be a short cutcsene with camera panning around giving a cinematic feels.\nUnfortunately, this coupled with how small the areas you explore (forcing you to move around the camera lots of time) can easily cause motion sickness to some people (like me). This can be remedied with playing in short session.\n\n\n2. The spelunking part is your typical dungeon run in RPGs. Here you will be battling most of the time.\n\n+Enemies are placed on spesific parts on the map and you can see them so you can prepare yourself before battles.\nAnd they'll only respawn when you leaves the dungeon. The dev's are pretty generous with exp and item drops too.\n\n+Battle is your standard turn based JRPG style with ATB like in Final Fantasy titles.\n\n-Sadly the flow of battles are very slow thanks to the camera panning around whenever anyone doing something. And you'll have to wait until the camera slowly back to the default position before the game continue with the next set of commands. Oh and skill animations are pretty long too.\nThankfully this version has the fast forward button implemented. It's like playing emulator with the throttle on.\n\n-The game is one hell of a BUGFEST. So save often in different save slots.\n\nOkay so overall this is a solid RPG. The only issues i have is the camera and the bugs.\nIt's a bit sad actually that not much people knows about this game existence back in the day.\nIt's even tops KOTOR in some aspect IMO.\n\n-------Score 8/10--------","December 10, 2015","true","15.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

Magazines hailed it as the PC's answer to Final Fantasy VII and, as a huge RPG fan, I really wanted it. It even had 'Chrono' in the title. Chrono Trigger is my favorite game. Ever. Sadly, my PC was only good at playing the odd Sierra game and it wasn't until around a year ago that I finally got to play through it. Color me surprised when I found out Anachronox has more in common with those point and click adventure titles than a traditional RPG. And you know what?\n\nI love it. Anachronox is one of the best game ever made for the PC and I was so happy to see it brought to Steam that I bought it twice in the spam of a year and a half. It's that good. Without giving away too much of the story, I can tell you that the game holds one of the most memorable casts in the genre, backed up with some great (for the time) voice work. Battles are the standard RPG fare, but you'll be spending most of your time exploring the large worlds and taking in every aspect of history and lore. And that world they give us. Boy, it's a beauty.\n\nIf you're hungry for a RPG and looking for something just a little bit different, you won't be disappointed in Anachronox. It's got more than enough to interest you through it's beefy playtime, though I could see how it lacks in replayability. But after that first time; after that first taste; you'll realize that you're playing an overlooked classic. Hopefully this game finds the audience it's always deserved.\n\n(9/10)\n\nRecommened If You Like:\n\nJRPGs with a point-and-click adventure twist\nWitty humor, fantastic writing, and memorable characters\n","January 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

ZOMGFBBQWMJRPG?\n\nWhatever you wanna call it, this game is absolutely fantastic, it was made by ION Storm (the Deus Ex team, not the Daikatana team), the story is both depressing and incredibly funny and optimistic at the same time, you meet tons of whacky and unforgettable characters along your journey, for example, your mouse pointer is a small ship housing the AI of your sarcastic dead secretary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nKeep in mind though, mechanically speaking, it has quite a few problems that are more outdated stuff than anything.\n\nThe graphics is the first thing that comes to mind, personally I don't mind a classic looking 3D game from the late 90's / early 2000's, especially if antialiasing is added through the drivers, but these might be a massive turn off for some, also there's no easy way to run this in widescreen aspect, so unless you look how to unlock widescreen resolutions *cough*[pcgamingwiki.com], you're mostly stuck with 4:3 aspect resolutions.\n\nThis being a JRPG style game, means that the battles are naturally turn based with your party of characters and that's great really, especially because there can be a surprising amount of strategy to kill certain enemies and bosses. The only thing that it could've improved over it's japanese counterparts, is the overly long animation sequences, those can get under your skin if you see the same long animations over and over for a long game like this.\n\nOutside the battes though, it's just a wonderful fully realized massive 3D sci-fi world(s) to explore, it kinda reminds me a lot of Mass Effect for the many friendly (and non-friendly) alien races you get to meet, it also reminds me of a traditional point n' click adventure games, there's a lot of stuff to see, tons of people to talk to, tons of places to explore, it's just good stuff.\n\nSo yeah, in conclusion, this is quite a fun west made JRPG with a few problems, but overall, I highly recommend it.","March 25","true","1.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Courtesy of them a few of my jokes made it into this game.\n\nAnachronox was a labor of love for its team, the kind you rarely see today, and it shows in hundreds of small touches.  Unfairly dinged on release for using the aging Quake 2 engine (which didn't keep it from having excellent artwork and level design) and the team's proximity to the high-profile flop Daikatana, it's a vast and beautiful thing, with a tone that manages to encompass both warm, strange humor (Tom Hall is a loveable goofball) and universe-spanning epic seriousness.  We'll probably never know how its cancelled sequel, Anachronox Prime, would have wrapped up the story.\n\nAlso one of your party members is a planet.

If you like tons of humor, including referential humor, and you also like going on a quest to save the galaxy with the most ragtag band of misfits imaginable, then this is the game for you.\n\nThe game's story is simultaneously engaging and outrageous. The gameplay is a little clunky but it controls just fine. Mostly my issue with it is it is counterintuitive; to interact with your environment, you have to move the mouse around until a little icon pops up, and you move the camera by mousing to the screen edge. I'd rather play with a gamepad, but it isn't supported. The graphics are really, really, REALLY old school but they get the point across. If graphics are an important thing to you, don't expect much from this game. The sound is surprisingly good for its time; I particularly like that most of the game is fully voiced. I don't find the game to have much replayability, however, although it can be worth it to find what you missed. Irritiating as it is, I recommend playing this game with a guide for all the side quests. Many of the side things you can do in Anachronox do not appear in your quest log, and it is vry easy to miss content. In my case, I probably will play Anachronoc again every two years or so. The story is that worthwhile.\n\nOh, and don't wprry about leveling up, the game auto levels you to the 'minimum level' when you reach certain areas, which makes a good tactician very unlikely to lose the game. Especially if you keep items on hand for healing and so forth. If you want grinding, exhausting challenge and the need to level up as much as possible, play it on hard.\n\n(Overall 9/10, Story 10/10, Gameplay 9/10, Graphics 4/10, Sound 9/10, Replayability 7/10)","July 31, 2014","true","21.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Superb story and gameplay is above average even compared to games today, sadly the graphics are dated, meaning players will not have too much eye-candy, but I would personally say the whole immersiveness of the story will be more of a distraction. What we have to remember is this is a very early game, so give it some credit and try it before you knock it.\n\nWhat I like:\n*Gameplay, the storyline and missions are entertaining as well as a challenge.\n*Unique characters, and their abilities have to be used strategicaly, to unlock hidden areas, and somtimes even progress in the game.\n*Side quests, and character development will keep the player occupied for many hours, revisiting old locations etc.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nWith the exception of the (hive) there are few areas where hostile NPCs will spawn and this can affect how fast the player can level up and gain expereince.\nCharacter abilites are not deveopled with exp points, but rather encounters later in the game. (have to speak to the correct person etc etc before you get master level in the ability).\n\nOverall:\nDespite its dated graphics, and the few bad points, its a game that should be played at least once, and you will probally come back to it again and again as I have, the immersion in the game is still there even today.","August 2, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I just got done playing Deus Ex which I consider to be one of the best FPS RPG of its time and considering this game was made by the same company I was excited to start playing it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by this game..The story has a unique sci-fi story as well as hilarious character interaction. "Sly Boots" is the down and out bumbling detective looking for work and stumbles upon a series of events that threaten the universe.\n\nPlaying this title now in 2014 definitely shows its age because of its graphics, but not really a dealbreaker because it's artistically done well with a top notch music score.\n\nI would still recommend this game overall because the developers definitely took the time to craft a unique creative experience, but this game is mostly for people who have the nostalgia for old school story driven games.

Luckily, someone smarter than I made a config file that will let you run the game in 1080p or whatever you would like.  http://www.wsgf.org/dr/anachronox/en\n\nThe controls are also a bit challenging.  The game uses a mixture of awkward mouselook controls without strafing mixed with point-and-click adventure mode when your character has stopped.

A sci-fi noir that feels like Deus Ex written by Douglas Adams. and indeed Anachronox was developed at Ion Storm Austin.  As you can see from the pictures it's not just Sly's hair that's late 90's and it is built on a modded Quake 2 engine which was pretty old even in 2001.\n\n\nTechnical Issues - Bizzarely 5 minutes into the game getting trained to fight I experienced a glitch which causes me to drop through the world while going through a repeat of the second cutscene from a minute earlier.  I had to find the noclip cheat and fiddle my way back in (it wasn't even that easy with noclip) and drop down to the training arena thing.  It was odd, I was using a machine with a XP OS, but it was the only single technical issue I had (apart from some of faces which were downright ugly).\n\nSetting - Despite the aforementioned ugly, the setting was pretty varied and pretty fun.  Another late 90's-early 00's thing was the reward for (and desire to) talking to everyone and snuffling around every alley and corner.  It was a golden age for persistent people-poking and cupboard raiding.  This includes weapons, cash and TACO's (Totally Arbitrary Collectible Objects).  I laughed, I totally got the tongue-in-cheek meta irony....I went on hunting them regardless.\n\nCombat is semi-turn based, where the cooldown between actions makes it turn based but if you hang about eating a sandwich the enemy will keep taking turns.  This style of combat suffered from getting a bit tedious early on before having a party, then slid (over many hours) to too easy before a sudden notch up of difficulty requiring collected objects at the end.  The little cutscenes for dramatic weapon actions were nice, but I could have done with being able to press space and skip them after 200 times or something.\n\nThe story world is immersive and as you can only have three party members at a time, there are things that happen and dialogue that only happens (and even a special short level for one character which depends one a character taken along somewhere earlier) depending on your choices.  None of them are epic or world breaking, but if you like a character and keep them around you get to see/hear more of them.  Different characters also had powers accessed through minigames, which broke up fights/wandering and it (of course) opened up new areas in places you had been before.  But the story did make me laugh in quite a few places and was engaging.\n\n\nOverall if you like your RPG singleplayer, not taking themselves too seriously but still with a world to get stuck into, I recommend this game.  Despite my comments on combat for every minute spent being slightly mildly irked there was an hour of exploring and laughing.  So go for it.  Especially given it's only a fiver.","May 22, 2014","true","31.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.  An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given.  Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 8\nAnachronox\nPurchase Date: 7/23/2014\n\nAnachronox came out back in 2001, but I wasn't interested in it at the time.  But over the years I have heard good things about it, so I didn't hestitate to get it when I saw it as part of a Humble Bundle.  Now that I'm 8 games in with my series of reviews, I'm starting to realize just how many games I've picked up this way.\n\nI admit when I first hopped into the game, it was a little jarring going back to graphics based on the Quake 2 engine.  Everything has a low poly count, because of course this game came from an era where 3d graphics was still in it's infancy.  And yet, I found I got used to it really quickly.  The characters in particular I felt like they did a great job with given the limitations of what could be done at the time.\n\nThe main character in this game is Boots, a down-on-his-luck private investigator who happens to owe a lot of money to a crime lord.  I find this out immediately as the game opens with Boots getting the crap beat out of him.  I definitely got a sense of the game's charm right off the bat.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, primarily Anachronox plays like a role playing game, but it also has some adventure game elements to it.  It has a pointer which will animate when you mouseover an item of interest.  So while I am moving around like I would in a typical first person game, I'm also pointing and clicking things to see what they do.  It took me a bit to get used to it at first, because the mouse doubles as both moving the pointer and the camera.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it cumbersome to use, but it took a little getting used to for me.\n\nLike any role playing game, I found myself interacting with various characters.  I felt the writing was pretty good here, but the conversations are also fairly basic.  Don't expect huge branching dialogs here.\n\nThe game works in a combat tutorial by having Boots go to a trainer.  The combat is pretty straightforward.  Combat is turn based, and plays much like most JRPGs, with options for a basic attack, using items, and launching a special attack.  Some fights will add movement options as well, but this varies from fight to fight, so it's not like a tactical RPG where the entire battle takes place on a grid.\n\nI didn't make it very far into the game in the first hour, especially since I spent most of my time running from point A to point B.  I didn't see any kind of in-game map, although at one point I ran into a little robot who offered to lead me to a place of my choosing.\n\nI ended my playthrough inside of Frank's Flophouse, trying to find someone who was staying there.  I figured out what room they were in, but when I clicked on the door, the game would just say "Seems Interesting".  It seems like this is the game's generic message for when you click on something that is clickable, but it doesn't do anything right now.  Not sure why I couldn't just knock on the door.  I get the feeling this is one of those games where I'm going to have to find a walkthough to help me get past the occasional spot where I get stuck in.\n\nAll in all though, I had a lot of fun in the time I spent in Anachronox.  I think if you are willing to look past the aged graphics and occasional clunkiness of the game, there is a lot of fun to be had here.","June 19, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have no history of ever playing it prior to a week ago when I tried it for the first time, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me. This game retains a lot of quality story telling and game mechanics that trumps many of today's story-heavy AAA games.\n\nThe turn-based battles will remind you of earlier Final Fantasy at first, but you quickly will find them to be a bit unique and perhaps even more entertaining. I'd like to point out at this juncture that the backslash key (\) will help you speed up the game clock and can make slow battles or travels pass a bit quicker.\n\nThe visual quality has aged quite a bit, however I found a guide in the community hub to patch the game with a custom and modern resolution and even add some opengl enhancements like bloom and SSAO. Just be careful with the bloom adjustments as they can make the LockPicking widget UI very difficult to see.\n\nI've ran into several little bugs and glitches already, but nothing that has been truly upsetting yet. Mostly I've been breaking out of map boundaries and getting stuck, almost each time while i was trying to speed back and forth between distant locations on a map while holding the \ button down to travel around faster.\n\nDifficulty wise, this game is quite comfortable - I found I like the casual playstyle of Easy mode for this title, but the normal and hard modes seem to add a bit of noticeable challenge during battles, if you are in for more than the story. I've also found multiple text walkthroughs and guides available on the Internet still to help me when I get stuck with an actual quest/mission.\n\nI would recommend this game if you enjoy sci-fi stories that take place in space. I can't think of any particular other franchises that this reminds me of most (meaning it comes across to me as a pretty original piece of work), however the protagonist character immediately reminded me of Nathan Fillion playing Captain Reynolds in the Firefly tv-series. The player character's attire and game ambiance led me to that conclusion very quickly and stuck in my mind as I found the cutscene humor to also remind me of the character, in a way.","February 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I never played it in the heyday, so now that I'm busy it's kind of a chore to finish.\n\nThe story is really good, the gameplay is fun, but the fighting system is depressingly slow.

I saw that it was cyberpunk/film noir inspired and got really excited for it. But pretty much everything about it is absolutely abysmal. For starters, you're never really given an explanation of HOW to play the game. I spent a solid half hour trying to figure out the controls.\nThe graphics were understandably made in 2001, but they're so bad it makes the game practically unplayable.\nBattles are slow and the story isn't that great in my opinion. I barely even understood the story because there was no background. The opening cutscene is a bunch of spaceships flying around and all of a sudden you're some guy named Boots getting punched in the face and falling off a building. And apparently you're just supposed to know what to do from there. That's literally all the information you're given at the beginning of the game.\nUnfortunately, I'd say this was a total waste of my money.\n\nThis game needs a reboot with less glitches, proper explanations, and graphics that are at least decent enough to make the game PLAYABLE.","January 1, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Man!!! My past was brought back! The slapstick comedy has aged, but it classically keeps the story going. It's a reminder of an age when games couldn't have powerful and realisic graphics, but had to have a fleshed out and solid story to tell.\n\nAnachronox is a slow start for an RPG, but always puts a smile on gamers who give it a chance. It's graphics haven't aged well, but it's story still works from start to finish.

The writing is great, the characters are loveable, and the story is pretty good so far, though I'm not sure I really know what it is yet.\n\nBasically for the combat expect a slightly dumbed down version of a Final Fantasy game. The boss fights are awesome! There is a system that allows you to move spaces during fights, which adds a nice strategy element to some of the tougher fights.\n\nIt doesn't look great by today's standards, but something about the presentation is very addivtive.

While being a big fan of late 90s/early 00s games and the Dues Ex franchise I had to check this out. It's briliant. I can't say I'd played a turn based RPG on the PC before, so that was interesting to see. As a guy who loves games filled with narrative this was right up my street. Talking to every NPC around gives you loads of bits to explore, stories to hear and more items to acquire. The humour is a key factor in this, and it really brings the game to life. Although the story takes a while to take off, once it's going it really sucked me in. The only let down really was the combat, even with the ability to speed up camera changes, it didn't feel like it had a massive impact on the story. I know that sounds ridiculous, but the majority of the battles didn't feel as impacting as the puzzle solving you had to do. Well worth getting though, there's alot of gameplay here!","March 11, 2014","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It brings to the table an RPG-style system similar to FF7 and combines it with an epic plot, lovable characters, and wonderfully-written (often hilarious) dialogue. Also, in true RPG fashion, there are many side-quests, mini-games, and easter eggs to be discovered.\nIf there are any criticisms I have, it's that the game progresses in a very linear fashion from one "hub" to the next; you have lots of freedom on each world you visit, but little choice in where you go next. Plus, because the game is quite old, the graphics will seem pretty dated (think Quake 2 era graphics). If you can set this aside, though, it's some of the most fun you'll have playing an RPG/adventure game.","October 24, 2013","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Developed by Iron Storm and underperforming on the market, this game is a hidden gem of the past. It takes the inspirations from JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and gives it witty story telling with some hilarious references and mockery.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. Poor level design - Levels are designed in a very long linear fashion and often you are required to backtrack several times to complete objectives.\n\n2. Animations are SO slow, especially during combat as it is turn based. Just having the 3 of your party do their attacks can take over 30 seconds.\n\n3.  Unskippable cutscenes\n\n4. The game does a terrible job at describing Mystech effects, skills and several important items such as the Elementor (Main damage dealer requiring specific combinations to deal different types of effects/damage).\n\n*1-3 can be semi-remedied by pressing (\) to fast forward animations.\n\nAll in all the game was enjoyable to a degree. It has that old-school feel of classic story telling of likeable characters and a well written plot. I would not replay this game at all due to the problems above though, as it made the game feel like a chore in a majority of playtime. It's great for a single playthrough if you're looking to kill time.","December 22, 2014","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Less than two bucks for 20+ hours of entertainment? You'll be hard-pressed to find that anywhere else.\n\nI mean yeah the controls are kinda awkward, but it's a 2001 game. You'll have to give the graphics a pass, too. What's timeless and the strong suits of the game is the turn-based play-style, the intricate environments and the collectables/quests inside of them, but above all else some of the best humour dialogue ever written in a game. It will have you laughing out loud and talking to NPCs. There's a LOT to miss in this game, so playing with a guide is essential to keep you ahead of the curve. It's a very tough game, so first timers should really play it on easy to get a feel for everything. The soundtrack is also stellar.\n\nSome of its issues would be a lack of a working Steam overlay and resolution issues.
