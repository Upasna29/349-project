Unfortunately, now in Epsilon Indi, she's under the investigation of the J.A.C., the corrupt space police. Between the rebel scientist, the priestess of a strange cult and the young man that want to be a Jackal, Gail and Sabina have to survive the encounter. And what surprise is in stock for them?\n\nThis game is the sequel of Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri. So, you bet that you're familiar with the ship. The story is still well-written, with the same humor as before: Gail still in dangerous situation, not really trusting herself, Sabina still logical and in her world and now, on top of that, a young man overconfident with himself, a scientist that is too absorbed in his work and a priestess that makes sense but not really. You still have Galactic Hospital as the sitcom on TV and the cat Zubar, though he's not useful in this opus.\n\nThe game is an adventure game made in RPG Maker - so don't expect any leveling or xp or any skill to upgrade. However, the gameplay is still take items, use them, combine them, examine them and discuss with people around (so that you can get more information about everyone). Again, you'll play two characters: Gail in the first two acts and someone else in the last one.\n\nThe graphics are correct, though we lost Gail's goggles. Anyway, if you liked the first episode, you'll like this one and like the fact that you will have some other landscapes to walk in. The soundtrack is as usual good and the trick with intercom is still working: activate the music and you'll hear something else than the ambient sounds.\n\nEpsilon Indi is a little longer than the first game, given the fact that you have more to do around.\n\nAnyway, again, the price isn't a factor to prevent yourself to buy it. Go for it!","February 6","true","4.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I think the story is starting to get even more interesting now. Since you should have played the first game before trying this one out, you should have some idea of what this game will be all about from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. In this one, the intrigue continues as you have taken on more passengers and of course, something is not as it seems. Which becomes apparent when a J.A.C. ship boards to search your ship for fugitives. Anyway, I liked this episode better than the first. I will be interested to see where episode 3, not sitting in my library, will take us.\n\nMuch like the last, considering the fact that this is an RPG Maker title, I would actually rate this 8 out of 10.","February 14","true","6.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Possibly more if some puzzles do puzzle you.\nThere is slightly more mix of re-entering old rooms in this episode however, and I found myself wandering back and forth quite a few times looking for certain items, or when characters gave me instructions that were not clear enough about what computer to use etc.\nFor that small amount of repetitive walking I did, I am thankful for the mouse support.\nAbout 99% of the pathing by clicking is really well done,  especially in the suit on the space walk, which was really cool	, and my character only messed up their pathing twice clicking across long cells, which is really awesome work to program the character to do that.\n\nThe characters are still boringly cliche, such as  another priest/nun religious character, generic group of soldiers with one female added in, hardcore sergeant, immoral G-men/women running 'round with gloves of blue and not mysterious briefcases this time and a Kryten... ah, android,	, but what is not cliche these days?\n\nThe animation tiles in this game series look atmospheric to a tee.\nI especially love seeing the ship in space, and the  space walk looked great showing the ships hull, as did the ground sections on the planet, especially the cliffs/fence when you walk into the courtyard near the bin.\n\nAs another journey on the passenger and cargo starship Quicksilver comes to an end and the familiar music comes on whilst the credits start to roll I am left with an excited smile to see what happens on the next episode of Space Pilgrim!\n\nThanks again, and I anticipate when this series ends I will certainly be feeling the all too familiar, "Firefly got cancelled," and, "If only they had made a few more episodes," set of feels. This is, after all, the only set of RPG Maker games/episodes I have purchased and probably will ever purchase.\n\nEnjoy the game you smegheads.\n\n- Nerf","January 9","true","7.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","11","15","5","0"

The story is pretty basic and straightforward, the narrative is quite plain so don't expect too many twists: I must say the game once again isn't afraid to show violence and keeps you on edge on what might happen to the characters involved.\n\nPuzzles are quite simple as long as you remember to search for items everywhere and then combine them when needed, again it's nothing extraordinary but it works well enough.\n\nOverall the game made less of a lasting impression on me storywise when compared to Alpha Centauri but it's still a decent purchase for 1$ and I'm curious to see how things'll go next.\n","March 11","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is a great follow-up to the debut, and continues the top-notch writing and dialog. My main complaint with this game is i think the RPG Maker mechanics. If you try to play it as a point-and-click (i.e. with the mouse), it is very easy to choose the wrong conversation option, find yourself unable to perform inventory puzzles or (most egregiously) quit the game by accident, and since there is no autosave that sucks a lot. I played through the same scenes two or three times till i realized you can navigate with the arrow keys and enter. Feels like the bad old days of PC gaming. Perhaps WASD and true mouse/touchscreen control will become available in the future. The story is great, though, and makes the awkward controls worth the pain.","March 13","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As you can probably tell without a guide you are probably going to spend a good hour trying to solve such a mundane task as there isn't many hints or anything within the game itself.\n- Some items are hard to spot / find\n\n\nOverall I'd say this game is mainly for people who are looking for a decent story and who like RPG maker games, there really isn't much gameplay so if you are not into the story itself than you may not enjoy the game.

The graphics are nothing special, there's hardly any music or sound effects, but the story is nice and funny, just enough for this game to be worth it, considering its price.\n\nThe only aspect of the game that really got me annoyed was the user interface. It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option. Too many times I ended up clicking somewhere outside the dialog box (for whatever reason), just to accidently choose something to do or say.\n\nTL;DR - A nice low-budget point & click adventure.

This one lacks the simplicity of the first episode, and continues the original's unfortunate simplification of the morality. The protagonist feels less like a protagonist and more like an excuse to get to the tedious 3rd Act which seems to introduce a character whom the writers want to the REAL focus of the game (so rather than being Captain Mal from "Firefly" Pilgrim is more like Itchy & Scratchy from the Poochie debut). The setting becomes less rich and more cliched, and the narrative (such as it is) just grinds to an excruciating halt with the beginning of Act 3.

Here I'm starting to think that the maker of these games has an uncanny ability of making characters believable and somewhat "rich" with just a few lines and sprites. That's something I miss from the era of older games. The storyline still works... although the middle part of the game was somewhat boring in my opinion.","March 9","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it's on sale, don't be afraid to pick it up. It's well worth full price and more. Very well written dialogue and amazing storyline, can't wait for more episodes :)\n\nAlso check out The Deed.","February 13","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
