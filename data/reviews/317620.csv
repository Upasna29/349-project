Everything looks remarkably better now. Especially glorious are some of the improved animations. My favorite being the new Genestealer finisher moves; fittingly brutal and memorable ends to our heroes of the Imperium.\n\nGameplayTactical options are similarly improved -- and vastly expanded. Think XCom/Jagged Alliance 2 style trade-offs between accuracy and AP, and fine-tuned % chance to hit instead of D6 rolls. Every mission completion will make you feel like a master of calculated risk, instead of a broken peasant berated by the shrieking laughter of the dice gods.\n\nWeapons are way more interesting now. Bolters overheat during extended firefights ala Incubation. Melee is now way less of a near-certain death sentence, as it is possible to improve a Terminator's melee skill via leveling and perks. The heavy flamer now has template options which are *excellent* -- you can choose to shoot a long narrow stream of fire, a short wide one, or in-between. Squad customization and leveling is well implemented and a huge plus. With customization and leveling comes a much deeper feeling of ownership and attachment to your every success and disaster. On hard difficulty, I assure you, you will sacrifice your rookies in desperate moves to support and protect your veterans.\n\nCampaign and RPG ElementsDid I mention the campaign? No more linear mission list. It's now a branching campaign with random flash missions on the side. Did I say campaign? I meant 3 campaigns. And now your squads can stick together through all 3 campaigns as a persistent force, leveling up and unlocking perks together the whole way through.\n\nOne last thing I need to mention is probably my favorite improvement --how much faster and fluid the enemy turn is. Now all of your Terminators fire as all of the Genestealers rush you simultaneously. It looks epic and delivers a much more intense payoff when you brace for an assault and hit the end turn button. It's about as far removed as possible from the tedious (and frankly boring to watch) combat resolution of the previous title. It actually feels like combat now.\n\nSuggestionsI do have some suggestions for the developer. I want a hotkey for reloading. I want icons over unit cards so I can see who is out of ammo, or has an overheated or jammed weapon. I think the deployment process during mission start should be improved. I want music in the loadout screen. I posted these suggestions in the forum last night. Soon after, in my thread and many others, I saw the developers quickly respond and let us know that suggestions are very welcome, and will be used for internal discussions. That kind of customer interaction should be commended, and it's the main reason why I decided to spend a chunk of tonight writing this review, rather than just playing all night and keeping my excitement to myself.\n\nConclusionOverall there are a ton of changes both big and small that elevate this game far above its predecessor. If you like combat-focused turn-based strategy games, and the idea of spraying alien guts all over the walls of a space derelict sounds like your kind of party, then all I can say is -- the xenos must be PURGED, brothers.","November 13, 2014","true","41.0"," 441 of 455 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","441","455","14","6"

Whichever side of the fence you found yourself on however, it was still a bit soulless. It put the board game on the screen, but beyond that, it didn't exactly push back the boundaries. It also suffered from unfair comparison to X-Com, and received generally middling scores in reviews. A success in my eyes, but a view that pushes me into the minority.\n\nAscension seems to be almost a slap in the face style challenge to those who made those comparisons and criticisms. More RPG elements? Fine. More of an arcade style play? Fine. You want percentages instead of digital dice? You got it. You want to name your marine Susan? Oh hell, if you must! Considering how much I liked the board-faithful game, I was fully prepared to dislike Ascension with all the fan-offence of a true alienated geek.\n\nThe result is, however ... surprisingly fun.\n\nIt's a different game - let's get that out of the way immediately. It looks vaguely similar, but plays very differently. So much so, the discount offered to owners of the first game surprises me slightly. It won't quench the angst of the self-entitled few who feel downtrodden by such evil injustice as FC not giving them a whole new game, but it's a welcome gesture.\n\nSo what's it like?\n\nWhereas it does contain the board-game set missions, it cloaks them in much more theatricality, and offers many side-missions to flesh out the story behind each campaign. The missions seem much more connected now. The three campaigns are flavoured for the three Chapters included, the Space Wolves, Ultramarines, and the staple of Space Hulk, the Blood Angels, but you're free to play them with whichever Chapter you prefer.\n\nInstead of an unlucky dice roll jamming your stormbolter, weapons now have a rising heat mechanic which prevents unlimited sustained fire, but which also means the first bolt out of your weapon won't result in a jam. It's a nice little touch which evens out the bumps in play and makes your imminent misfortune a touch more predictable, and subsequently allows you to plan for it.\n\nThere are now deployable items, sensors and the like that emit a revealing pulse, while using a very familiar sound. It adds another welcome level of tactics and evokes a smile at the aural homage.\n\nMelee combat no longer seems like assured death. When it does come however, the marine no longer falls over as though someone unplugged his Terminator armour. There are more death animations now, thankfully. The animations all round seem more polished, as indeed does the rest of the game.\n\nYou'll be surprised to find upon teleporting in that you can't see a great deal. With some exceptions, the Hulk is very, very dark until explored by your marines. Some will complain about this, as it does add an additional level of difficulty to the game. However, it also does what it was most likely intended to do. The game feels much more claustrophobic and oppressive. You don't feel like rushing ahead, because frankly, you don't know what might be out there. Sure, you can see the 'ping' markers for movement, but until you can see exactly how the corridors are laid out, your decision of how to proceed must be a considered one. Now I know what Hicks and Drake felt like, creeping along one step at a time despite having enough firepower to level a small village.\n\nThe ability to rename and customise your marines adds that little bit of empathy, and makes their death all the more of an event to be avoided. No longer are they replaced by the faceless masses. When Percival the III, space marine sergeant extraordinaire goes down under a hail of genestealer claws, he leaves behind some considerable boots to fill. Hicks Jnr will just have to man-up.\n\nThere are skills now, allowing you to customise your marines further as they gain experience, assuming you don't get them slaughtered that is, which can still happen. Extra movement is always welcome, as is increased to-hit percentage, or do you want to make a melee powerhouse called Francine?\n\nThere are loads of nice touches, like the heavy flamer having different patterns, the thermal view through the shoulder-cam, which is generally an improvement over the first game in all ways, and even in-mission goodies to find and collect.\n\nSo that's some of the good stuff, but is it all worthy of the Emperor? Well ... no, not quite.\n\nThere are customisation options, certainly, but considering you can have ten marines in the game at once, the options are quickly exhausted. There are not many heads to choose from, so my marines all go with helmets, except the valiant sergeant of course. It stops them all looking like interbred cousins from space. There's a law somewhere that says if you're going to offer customisation options, make them many and varied. If not, there should be.\n\nThere are some performance issues, especially with framerate when all ten marines are deployed, although FC seem to be already tackling that. Likewise, there are some bugs that have been reported and seem to be receiving due attention.\n\nNo custom chapter: Other developers have set the bar on this, so high that we almost expect as standard now some type of interface to allow you to design your own chapter from the ground up in honour of the game origins, which was essentially about you tediously painting very expensive figurines and inventing your own chapter if you chose to do so. It's lacking here, which is a shame.\n\nBolter sounds: It's a minor quibble, sure, but in the first game, bolters sounded ferociously chunky as they unleashed a thunderous volley. They now spit and plink. This is likely a case of FC not being able to please everyone. They came under criticism the first time around for the bolters sounding so loud. Damned if you do ...\n\nVoice actors: If there's more than one, I'll apologise. "Vengeance of the Blood Angels" from 1993 already showed how to do Space Hulk voice acting well. FC could do worse than buy an old Sega Saturn and copy of Vengeance off E-bay, fire it up and check it out. Instead of a load of very distinct voices giving a true sense of a squad in combat, we have the same monotone for all marine responses, and even the briefings. It's not a game-breaker by any means, but it is a missed chance for immersion. It's things like that which elevate a game from good to great.\n\n\nOn the whole, it's a fine game, or will be once some of the technical problems are fixed. Is it perfect? No, but my complaints are not deal-breakers, and some are not really complaints, but a list of wishes. It was perhaps released a touch early, but that can be dealt with. If you can live through a few teething problems, and if you're a fan of Space Hulk, or indeed 40k in general, then there is much to enjoy here, which is what I should be doing instead of writing ridiculously long reviews.\n\nBack to the Hulk I go, in the Emperor's name, of course.","November 16, 2014","true","25.6"," 218 of 232 people (94%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","94","218","232","10","3"

When Space Hulk released on August 15, 2013, there was much confusion as to what the game was suppose to be. A lot of people just didn’t understand it. The original game was a board game adaptation that was brought to PC and iPad, complete with multiplayer. However, a buggy launch with no multiplayer lobby, and backlash for being too much of a straight board game adaption and not enough of a “video game” plagued Space Hulk.\n\nInstead of taking all that consumer feedback negatively, Full Control took a different approach.

There is a great deal of confusion surrounding the two Space Hulk games Full Control have released here on Steam. Hopefully, what I have to say here will dispel some of the inaccuracies and misinformation. I also intend to justify why I recommend this game during the course of the review.\n\nSpace Hulk: Ascension Edition is a squad-size Turn-based Tactical Strategy game based upon Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 tabletop miniatures game and the spin-off boardgame, Space Hulk. In this specific case, that means the central focus of game play will be to command a unit of five to ten individual characters, Space Marine Terminators to be exact, as they progress through a confined map and encounter enemy characters while attempting to meet certain Mission goals. The enemies encountered will be the classic Genestealers and Broodlords that fans of the Warhammer 40,000 game line might be familiar with. As with many TTS games, controlling the environment in Space Hulk: Ascension is just as much a key to victory as killing the enemies that get in your way.\n\nGame play is executed by the use of an "Action Point" system. Terminators are alloted a certain number of points in a pool(typically 4 to start), and the pool grows larger as characters progress in experience levels based on the influence of special Sergeant characters, skills and each character's Agility Attribute. At the start of each Player Turn, all Action Point pools refill, but in each turn it is key to use this finite resource wisely as Action Points are the means to doing everything, including moving through map squares, using a piece of equipment, reloading a weapon or setting Overwatch to defend a killzone from Genestealer advances.\n\nCombat in the game is very straightforward, but has provisions for a number of tactical considerations. During a Player's turn, they can choose from a variety of Ranged attacks which can be as simple as taking a potshot at an enemy, or as complicated as causing a movement debuff or removing Action Points from the targetted enemy's Action Point pool. There are also Melee weapons, but melee combat is much more straightforward and simplified; you either attack, or you defend against an attack. Resolution of combat is based on a Percentile check against a random number generator. Your Terminators will start with a base percentage chance to hit the target, and the base chance will be modified by factors such as skills, type of weapon used, the range (in squares) away from the target and even which Chapter of Space Marine you chose to play the game with. Typically, if you plan appropriately and select your attacks wisely, your characters will be quite successful in destroying their enemies, but as this is a squad-based game, planning appropriately usually means maneuvering multiple units into positions to support one another.So as far as combat is concerned, you decide how complex it becomes for yourself.You can make it as simple as spamming Overwatch and Aimed Shots, or as complicated as using a series of Killzones with Suppression fire and melee Terminators. The key to success is in using the right Terminator for the job, and learning where each of these tactics will be most useful.\n\nIncluded in this game is an individual Character Advancement system which uses a basic experience point reward system. Meeting Mission goals, killing Genestealers, and ultimately just surviving the very deadly environment of the Space Hulk nets each terminator xp rewards, that can increase the level of the character and allow them to upgrade their Attributes and gain access to new Skills that buff combat performance and Weapon Loadouts. This allows for some rudimentary character customization, and is sufficiently streamlined that there are no wasted points while upgrading. The system is simplified, but still provides tactical advantages for the player.\n\nChanging gears now, the Graphics of Space Hulk: Ascension are clean and solid. Low-end machines can still play the game and enjoy all of the game play features, but will miss out on the detailed textures of the maps and models, as well as the massive assortment of dynamic lighting effects. Higher-end machines and true Gaming Beast-Rigs will find the game has some very good lighting and special effects which add to the claustrophobic feel of hunting Xenos in the dark, confining, Gothic-based corridors of a Space Hulk. Terminators models themselves can be quite detailed, and even customized prior to entering a Mission with various extra chains, skulls and other bits attached to their armor for aesthetic purposes. This gives a unique feeling of investment to many players, which even further adds to the tension of fighting in the Hulk.\n\nSound quality is good as well, with ambient effects being highly stressed. The roars of distant Genestealers, furtive rustling and the creaking of the Hulk are just some of the small details which enhance the quality of the experience. Add to this the combat sounds of crashing metal against chitin, Bolter-fire roaring across a corridor and the clattering of Terminator armor and you have a very dynamic feel. The only thing missing is a quality music soundtrack to go with it, but as this is written on Release day, it is highly possible that the developer may be adding one in with a patch at some point.\n\nOverall, I recommend Space Hulk: Ascension Edition for gamers of any skill level who enjoy a variety of strategy games. The gameplay experience can be tailored to a Casual environment where you play 30 minutes a day, or to a Hardcore Completionist's need to get their Achievement Hardcore-Mode fix. Although some aspects of play can become repetetive, the ability to customize your units and the branching Campaign paths allow for some unique changes of pace that keep the game from going stale. With good graphics and sound, a decent amount of polish at Release (no game is ever bug-free on Launch day), Space Hulk: Ascension is well-worth the investment of $30US.","November 12, 2014","true","424.4"," 129 of 152 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","129","152","2","6"

Its nothing too deep but it is OK, you can play with builds, try to go full melee, range specs, mixed with psychic or medic support, etc (here is when the "racial" traits of each chapter come in handy).\nThe game offers a small but very interesting amount of weapons to customize your men, each with its own pros and cons, altough their descriptions might seem misleading at first.\nThe difficulty levels can be customized but you wont get achievements if you select a custom difficulty.\n\nRegarding the DLC packs: they are not mandatory to enjoy the game but they enhance it a lot by adding 3 long new campaigns and 3 more or less interesting chapters (with some new specializations and weapons) to an already good game.\nIf overall you are enjoying the base game and like the Warhammer universe they are a recomendable purchase.\n\nI guess im missing some important stuff but hope this little edit helps to enlighten a bit.\n\nEnd of Edit.\n\nBtw, the game looks amazing and has enough customization options for the terminators.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/corpusdei/recommended/317620/","corpusdei","Corpus-Dei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/corpusdei/","116 products in account","The original was a direct port of the board game to PC - with all the problems that entails. You can have perfectly good tactics in the board game ruined by a run of shonky dice rolls that results in a "GG - you win" (or throwing a strop and chucking the board/pieces in the air and finding Genestealer limbs scattered around the living room for the next six months) - and in the board game, that's fine. However, that doesn't translate well to a computer game, especially in the campaign where outright failure isn't really an option and it just results in frustrating reloads.\n\nThis is a much more computer-friendly version of Space Hulk - yes the graphics and sounds are better than the previous version but far more importantly it's taken away almost all of the annoyances I had with the previous version; random command points are gone, random Storm Bolter jams on rolling a double are gone (they still jam but in a much more predicatable manner which gets rid of those irritating turns where everybody seems to jam, all the time), they've put a "Load Game" option into the quick-menu accessible during the game (previously you'd have to quit to the main menu to reload which was an unecessary pain in the a***)... hell, even Lightning Claws aren't necessarily a complete death sentence now.\n\nAlso added are some RPG-lite elements - hits work on a percentile based system rather than dice rolls so as your marines gain experience you can train up their Ballistic skill (for example, there are six skills in all) so they have a better chance of hitting.\n\nIn basically every way, this is a better game than the previous version (I don't even mind the removal of the tactical map).\n\nIs it perfect? No.\n\nWhile there are 3 parts to the campaign (3 hulks, one for each Chapter available basically) the campaigns are not significantly different. The missions are pretty samey and it doesn't take full advantage of the fact that it's not constrained by being a board game - for example, they removed the tactical map so you don't know the exact layout of the level... OK, fine. However one set of missions revolves around retreiving a C.A.T. unit, which is a little droid that potters around mapping the hulk - they could have used that to activate a tactical map once you'd retrieved it. There are a few missed opportunities like that.\n\nOther than that the voices are repetitive and some of the graphics (especially the character cards) lack polish, but this isn't a Triple-A title so I can forgive that.\n\nLike the previous version, this isn't going to be a game for everyone. It's still Space Hulk; a fairly slow paced, tactical take on one aspect of the Warhammer 40K universe. However, if you like Space Hulk this is a really good computer translation of the game and well worth the ~ £20 shelled out for.","November 26, 2014","true","125.8"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","75","80","0","0"

It is extremely satisfying to level up your favourite, personally named and customized Terminator and give him the equipment you deem appropriate for smashing slimy Genestealers in the name of the almighty Emperor. Many reviewers have recommended the game, I do as well.\n\nHowever, there are various shortcomings which make it seem as if the game were either finished in a hurry or still in beta stage.\n\n- level design seems not too well thought through. Some later levels are ridiculously easy, others are very hard.\n\n- there is no voiceover in the mission briefing, and numerous typos; the whole storyline seems rather rudimentary ("go there, kill all genestealers"). There are also logical errors, for instance, you meet Broodlords way before the "New Genestealer type (=Broodlord) encountered, find genetic sample"! mission. This lack of a compelling storyline is a pity because the Warhammer world offers some fascinating narrative, doesn't it!\n\n- there is only one voice for all your Terminators.\n\n- the in-game manual doesn't really explain much. Combat mechanics? Weapons? Functions of Terminator stats? You get some very basic info, the rest is left to your imagination. For instance, the Stormbolter and the Combi-Bolter have different accuracy stats, apparently, but I have no idea why and how they differ. And how does Genestealer poison work? The developers leave this shrouded in mystery.\n\n- the set-up zone markers don't disappear after the initial set-up. Instead, all through the mission, they glow obnoxiously green and pulsate. This can get incredibly annoying on those maps where there are lots of possible set-up positions. Combined with other lighting effects and numerous eye candy, this means that\n\n- the entire screen is constantly glowing, pulsating, displaying special lighting effects and command auras etc. to a degree where you can't see what's actually going on and where your Terminators are facing (aside from these effects, the game is incredibly dark). This is especially nasty because\n\n- your unit markers and their stats description are tiny. It is quite hard to discern which unit is on overwatch, etc. Moreover,\n\n- the special effects fireworks totally ruins the framerate; big maps with lots of set-up-zones (see above...) and two squads of Terminators are a stop-and-go nightmare. If the Emperor knew, he'd send his Inquisition!\n\n- your main weapon, the Bolter, sounds like an automatic BB gun\n\n- the "End Turn" button is positioned exactly at the spot where Steam displays a message when one of your Steam buddies enters a game. If like me you have lots of buddies, you'll occasionally have a hard time ending a turn, because buddy xy is once more starting "Euro Truck Simulator" and you can't click the "End Turn" button!\n\n- "Next Mission" Bonus items actually apply to the current mission (the one they were found in)\n\n- I'm quite sure that Genestealers with 6 AP can move 7 tiles.\n\nThere are other design decisions which will be appreciated by many gamers. I find the following, however, to be less than optimal:\n\n- there is no "undo move" option. I find this a real downside as the controls are fiddly and you occasionally end up moving a Terminator where you didn't want him to move.\n\n- you can't see the whole map and its tiles; you have, so to say, fog of war. Given that the entire game is incredibly dark (apart from the abundant lighting effects mentioned above), you often simply have no idea what is five or eight tiles away from your Terminators. Genestealer entry points? Air ducts? Good luck finding where they are.\n\n- the flamethrower has a minimum range of two tiles. Certainly, many have lauded the new firing options for the flame thrower, and they were right in doing so; you can e.g. shoot a long line of flame (nice for long hallways) or a T-shaped pattern (nice to get around corners). However, Space Hulk is a game which forces you to fight in extremely confined spaces, and having in these circumstances a minimum range for your flamethrowers greatly reduces their versatility. Holy Emperor, the flamethrower is a short-range weapon, isn't it? How dare you give it a minimum range? It is therefore always a good idea to give your heavy weapons guys some melee skill.\n\n- the flamethrower's fire only lasts for the enemy's turn. This reduces its strategic value to block the way for the Genestealers, it is more easy for you to proceed however.\n\nAll in all: fantastic Beta - when do we get the final version?","November 15, 2014","true","60.4"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","72","76","0","10"

It was a decent enough game, but very obviously a board game. Some missions were quite challenging but once you learned the mechanics, it was difficult to fail. The random nature of bolters locking was a problem, but as long as you ended rounds with extra points in the bank, you’d almost always negate this (and this was one of the huge issues in the original games, on the Amiga etc, way back when). It simply became a case of creeping through a well lit ship and covering your ♥♥♥ from every angle. There wasn’t a hell of a lot of atmosphere there, nor reason to really get into the DLC missions.\n\nAscension is a completely different story. While I appreciate that the first game was an attempt to digitise the board game, the things that made a board game fun didn’t really translate into a fun PC game. Ascension changes that in a big way.\nThere’s a lot of new stuff in the game, all of which adds immeasurably to the experience. The loadout and squad management sides of things is surprisingly deep, giving tons of incentive to play through the game – but all of these things are just icing. The real guts of the new experience is in the gameplay itself.\n\nFirst and foremost – the way the Space Hulk is now shrouded in darkness – awesome. Simply awesome. This changes *everything*. On the mission screen you get an idea of where in the Hulk you need to travel, but not what’s in between you and it. The way corridors are suddenly revealed when a Terminator rounds a corner is simply superb. The lighting fx (which graphic intensive) absolutely nail this. You never know what the hell is around a corner – including where the nests and entry point of the genestealers are. It’s not unlike the first game in that you have to creep forward, covering all approaches and making good use of overwatch – but this time round, you actually feel like you have Terminators under your command – not just guys in thick armour, but veteran Space Marines – aka bad asses.\n\nThis is where the RPG side of things ties so much better into the game. For example, my Sargent is equipped with a power sword and I’ve started to specialise his melee skills. His firing is good, but when a genestealer is in his face, he should be able to administer righteous justice in the emperors name without raising a sweat. And he does. In the original game, the randomness was just TOO random. My sarge isn’t invulnerable, but he’s functioning much more like a sargent should.\nAnd my regular Terminators also behave far more competently. In the first game, there were still stand out moments where certain Terminators would fluke a bunch of rolls and mow down an amazing number of Genestealers, leading to fistpump moments (particularly in melee encounters, which was always butt-clenchingly tense) – but the randomness usually won at the end of the day.\n\nThe randomness has now been moved into a much more workable percentage based form, where I have a much clearer of idea when to use things such as aimed shot to dispatch a foe, but sacrifice potential movement. The thing is though, with the new cooling weapon and reloading mechanic, the Terminators can now almost indefinitely hold a firing line. This might sound overpowered, or it might sound like its removing the challenge, but the fact is, if you look at 40k and what these guys are – if they are in a clear corridor, they should be very difficult, almost impossible, to approach. They maintain their bolters, they live, breathe, eat sleep with them (possibly even make the lurve) – but they would have a very good idea of when it’s heating up or possibly leading to jam. Now you as the commander can control this, and while in the heavier conflicts they still jam – they’re jamming from excessive firing for once, not just because a dice roll went badly. It’s hard to explain how important this is to the way the Terminators feel.\n\nAnd getting back to the darkness – you have no idea which corridors end in dead ends, which have nests down them, which are dangerous. I’ve found myself actively exploring down tunnels trying to determine whether it’s something I can leave unguarded – but moreso, drop a skull probe there (skull probes!!) – just in case.\n\nAnd with the new auspex sensor ranges-  I have had a handful of times now where Genestealers have snuck into my lines as their blips came from outside my sensors. This is so bloody awesome! Why? Because that’s what Genestealers do – they’re sneaky, vicious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s – emphasis on the sneaky. They get in and absolutely destroy you if you leave them unchecked, returning emphasis to your own visual awareness, and ensuring you monitor the sensors.\n\nIt’s also great to see Genestealer variations finally enter the fray. I hope going forward we can see even more of these.\nFor now, I think Full Control have done a superb job with Ascension. I think they’ve gone into it with a much clearer idea of what they needed to achieve. The first game was by no means bad, but it was definitely lacking. Ascension is by no means perfect, but it’s a bloody good Space Hulk game.\n\nTo conclude, I’ll drop a few wish list type things:\n\n1. More visual customisation options. New helmets, new armour fluff etc. Would be awesome if these were aligned with their numbers, so no.1 is the most basic, while number 5-6-7 becomes increasingly more detailed – making it easier to dole out the better looking stuff to veterans as we progress etc. Would like to see even more crazy high end designs – hell, even a Captain  :)\n\n2. When it’s the genestealers turn, the camera needs to move to the area where there’s the movement. Too often my Terminators are firing and I’m not 100% sure who fired (yes I can see his name in the shoulder cam but it’s not always obvious). The end result is having to click each Terminator to check their weapon status and reload accordingly.\n\n3. Hotkey for reload/weapon cool.\n\n4. A more obvious indicator when a Terminator is in overwatch – the tiny eye above their head is very difficult to see. Needs to be made more obvious on the Terminator model, not just above their portrait. Also love the fact they stay in overwatch between rounds, and stay in it when you weapon cool/reload – thanks for that! Also shoutout to the new visual when they go into overwatch – that little light that projects – very cool!\n\n5. I actually miss the cinematic camera. The enhanced shoulder cam is fantastic but a few rare cinematic kills would be great. They were a little too frequent and identical in the first game – but the odd one would be excellent, particularly on the more epic kills – like when a terminator has taken out several genestealers in a single turn – imagine they were all shown realtime in cinematic – mmmm!\n\n6. Really miss the intro video – the first one’s wasn’t amazing, but I eat fluff like that with an insatiable 40k hunger.\n\n7. Some way to veto movement if you’ve clicked on the wrong Terminator. This can be cheaty though – but it’s frustrating when you mis-click. Perhaps just make it more obvious whose selected.\n\nCheers and here’s to a healthy batch of DLC. Feel welcome to bring some new race enemies to the party ;)\n","November 13, 2014","true","9.9"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","60","67","0","2"

It had gone far from the tabletop game and has a lot of new elements, that fit perfectly.\nI'd say it's a well done sequel, and its gameplay entertains me much more, than the original(tabletop is fine, but it was quite boring in PC version, never could make myself play more than 1 mission in a row).\nSo what we have here:\n1) Fully customizable squad in terms of weapons and appearance. Different heads, bodies, holy symbols and all that. You can give every terminator a name of your choosing.\n2) Weapons with different stats and mechanics. Combi-flamer, combi-melta, combi-plasma, melee weapons from chainfist to thunder hammer and lightning claws, they all have different bonuses and have their own uses.\n3) XP and level system. Your terminators gain XP for completing mission and killing enemies, and when you gain a new level, you unlock new weapons, new perks(skills), new equipment like mines and power field generators and raise one of their 6 stats. This allows for building your team in your own unique way. I enjoy this RPG elements very much.\nAlso, terminators are divided into several classes: melee, ranged, heavy, librarian, sergeant. They all have access to weapons, exclusive to their class, and they all gain perks in different way.\n4) 45 missions in 3 campaigns, not counting the random(flash) missions. The game doesn't look as repetitive as the previous installation of the tabletop. Various tyranid enemies make the gameplay more interesting in a long run, it's not just standard GS and Broodlord in the original. Here you have debuffing genestealers, exploding genestealers, MK Scorpion-like("Come over here") genestealers. It's fun!\nWell, I guess that pretty does it. All that is left to say is one thing the devs screwed up with: MELEE COMBAT.\nForget the melee. Never build your strategy relying on melee advance. It's a fawkin' roulette. I say it as a player who chose Space Wolves for my first playthrough(they are "decent" melee fighters, but poor shooters and don't have Ranged class terminators at all, which is a HUGE disadvantage). It was painful and I walked through hell of save\load game since I hate to lose my characters.\nP.S. Always take a librarian in a squad.

So the game allegedly works again. To the developer I have something I would like to say.....\n\nSilverleech,\n\nTo start off I will say that is good to see you have been working to resolve your games issues and congratulations for getting this patch released. I hope this means there will be less customers overall that feel like they were conned by purchasing a game that was broken at full price. I am taking the time to write the following so that you may understand the position and feeling of someone among your customer base that usually remains silent. The portion that is walking out the door and unlikely to return. My intent is not to rant or troll but to inform you, or other developers or business people etc. that may be reading what a lack of communication in resolving these issues has caused.\n\nThere is a good chance that your failure to communicate has hurt if not ruined any opportunity to succeed moving forward as a company and may possibly have damanaged your reputation as a professional in this indusry as well. At the very least it has limited your potential to grow. I should not have to say this but communicating only twice through vague promises for over 3 1/2 months until you released this patch is unacceptable.\n\nLeaving a post once a week (really every week you need to leave a post or send a message) to state you were working to fix it should be the bare minimum. Assuming you have a viable internet connection that would have required less than 2 minutes of your time each week. I understand your company essentially went belly up and you needed help to get this done but if you are still charging full price for a product you need to be better than this.\n\nI enjoyed what I managed to play out of this game before but I have such a bitter taste in my mouth thinking about it now I have no interest in continuing it furhter. Silverleech, when I see your name or your company name's attached to another project I will not be supporting or purchasing it. Personally I am satisfied just to take my money and walk out the door a little wiser than before. There are some that will actively campaign against any furture products or bootleg whatever you produce going forward. I hope someone can use your failure and this experience to improve and move forward.\n\nBest of Luck,\n\n-Jilted Fanbase\n\n11/20/2015 - TWO MONTHS later and still no word from the developers on whether than are going to fix this game or not. While it may betrue you can play to completion of the game by avoiding certain paths this game's asking price is much higher than the qualify of work and support (NONE) that went into this game deserves. I was unlucky enough to mess this up and consequently ruined my 2nd attempting playthrough of the same campaign.\n\nIn regard to the poor behaviour of this games "lone developer" or sole remaining emloyee of the company that is suppose to be supporting this title. This developer has not stated or responed to hundreds of questions inquiries as to when how if this game will be fixed past a mention that he would see about getting to work on it this weekend nearly three months ago. Even if he is working on it this approach to customer service is unaccepatble. If there is no intention to fix the game because of lack of resources I would consider his silence cowardly.\n\n\nWARNING as of 9/22 many of the campaign missions are unfinishable due to bug that causes you to fail missions when completing them. You can use the forums to navigate around those missions and still complete at least one of the campaigns by circuvmeventing the problem.\n\nThe studio that created this game has since been shaved down to a one man operation and unfortunately after patching in some new content/dlc/bugfixes etc. earlier this month the current build ran into some problems with the new version of unity. While I feel this unfortunate as I really like this title based on mechanics and this unfortunate coincidence has really hurt my experience with this game.\n\nOverall I would give it 6/10 from what I've played so far but I got to knock off two points because of the current state.\n\n4/10.....Will finish review if/when a patch fixes the mission fail bug.","September 22, 2015","false","22.2"," 78 of 96 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","78","96","3","0"

All I can say is I am glad I did. It appears the developers have learnt from the first game that a straight board game conversion needs some tweaks to make it more fun on for the average PC gamer. Gone are the random bolter malfunctions and now if you fail it is more down to bad tactics and not just being very unlucky at the wrong time. Don't get me wrong there will still be instances you have to re-load within a level to avoid a bad timing incident. You now get persistent upgrades for your Terminators, which makes it feel more like a squad based RPG. I have lost some men on the way and on normal mode they are replaced with equivalent levels, so you don't feel you have to re-load everytime you let a man die (Hooray for casulties of war, shame there are no records of them like XCom and Cannon Fodder). The Genestealers themselves now have different mutations making them a more interesting threat, e.g. some burst into acid, whilst others are just tougher to kill.

So I will :D.\n\nFirst off, the 2013 Space Hulk was a digital version of the tabletop game. Die rolls, bad luck ruining everything, the whole nine yards. This was known, this was intended. The game was a bit boring, unfair, and it didnt receive much acclaim. So the Devs, much to their credit, took it to the fans and asked: "well if you didnt like it, what would you like?" Gamers being gamers, they answered and the devs actually listened.\nSpace Hulk: Ascension is what we wanted and its what they finally gave us. The game is much more in line with other tactical strategy games. The entire rule system has been reworked for a more immersive RPG tactical experience. Less games ruined due to bad "rolls", character progression, more enemy types, more weapons, more chapters, more storylines, more missions, character customiztion, etc. THIS IS NOT A MOD LIKE, SLIGHT TWEAKING OF THE GAME. Even the lighting has been improved. Yes some of the missions and story have been carried from the 2013 release but you are now playing them with a squad that you built, customized and care about; fighting new enemy types with your new weapons. This is Space Hulk as it "should" have been (my humble opinion of course).\nIn conclusion, if you like Warhammer 40k and/or Space Hulk but werent impressed by the 2013 release, then you really owe it to yourself to let this game redeem the franchise.","November 12, 2014","true","11.5"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","54","63","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/recommended/317620/","jingobingonfinky","Minitrue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/","152 products in account","I've selected a non recommendation for this game, but it's more complex than that - this is a game that falls in between the recommend and do not recommend.\n\nLargely based on what has come before, Space Hulk Ascension is a tweak of the core Space Hulk system ( the board game ) which sees a bunch of heavily armoured and armed marines clomping around the claustrophic innards of a Space Hulk whilst fighting off assaults of suicidal bugs. If you don't know what Space Hulk is, then I'd recommend you check that out. Here I am just going to concentrate on the differences between Ascension and vanilla Space Hulk.\n\n1 "Atmosphere". Someone designing this game obviously thought that making Space Hulk darker would fit with its grimdark background. Let's make Space Hulk again, but turn off more lights you can imagine the art director said. And so it is. Ascension level design is dark. With something of a fog of war that means you can't figure out what the map is like. From a narrative point this is interesting and somewhat realistic. From a turn based strategy game design point of view that has its roots in precise tactical placement and weighing up pros and cons of a given course of action it's a bit of a disaster. All too often a level won't be obvious until you've played through it once, or, you've played it, walked up a blind alley, realised that doesn't go anywhere and had to clomp painstakingly back again. Space Hulk here has been turned into part furious claustrophic futuristic combat game, and part Discovering and Exploring the Broom Cupboard Simulator game. All too often your elite, serious, deep gravelly voiced marines will find themselves in the supplies closet. With a mop. And some cleaner. Brother Sergeant, I believe this bottle of Vim and cleaning mop apparatus indicates we have gone the wrong way...\n\nSo the atmosphere depends on what you take from a Space Hulk game. For those that really like the board game I suspect that the dark don't know where you are going aspect will just be downright frustrating. Apparently the mission planner can tell you where to go and what buttons to press, but is clueless about the passageway in between. OK !\n\n2 RNG - The Random Number Generator. Space Hulk has always had a very active RNG. But that's not to say it's hopelessly random. Space Hulk is about calculating your odds, managing risk, and getting a good cross fire to cover the risks. Ascension has this. But it's also been tweaked. The RNG has been increased - some weird stealer variant can pop out of an air vent, be immune to attacks and just kill one of your guys straight off the bat. There's no real way you could have planned for it. There's no way you could have known it. And whether it happens or not is just whether the RNG spawns one of the things there or not. So. You lose control of your destiny. In game design terms, injecting random elements into the players path like this is a Bad Thing. Players feel like they have less and less say in what's going on, and ultimately people just can't be bothered to play because it's a hot mess of random. You can go check out the design implications of this on any number of serious board game design threads.\n\nSo Ascension decides to throw some random uncontrollability at us. It also makes that uncontrollability sting even more because your marines get to experience up, you invest time and effort in them, only to have the game randomly cull them for you later on. A succint model of life. But not a good game experience.\n\nMore often that not, at this point, you can reset the game, try again, and this time the RNG spawns something else and hey presto, no random instadeath for something you couldn't mitigate.\n\nIn many ways this is like trying to play a roleplaying game where a 10 year old is the GM. You will at times suddenly die in random hideous ways through no fault of your own, because the GM thought it would be funny.\n\n3 Tweaking the stats. So the stats have had a nudge. Now it matters more if your guy prefers melee or not. Or maybe you've levelled them up as a sharp shooter. By and large the stat changes haven't been altered enough to make that much of a difference. The core balance of the original Space Hulk is still here and is by and large intact. So the tweaks just add a layer of chrome to the existing ruleset - and do not fundamentally adjust ( or break ) them.\n\nOther than that all thingss said Ascension is basically Space Hulk. With perhaps more twisty corridors than you remember.\n\nWhether you like the game or not depends on whether you are ok with random uncontrollability, like the idea of a narrative fog of war, let's walk pointlessly down a dark corridor, and whether you like looking at a screen that is 90% black all the time.\n\nIf you are a big fan of the board games I suspect this game is going to annoy you. The changes have been made without proper playtesting or understanding of how it changes the fundamental aspects of the game. Space Hulk, via luck or judgement, is a game that has outstanding balance and replayability and has been playtested to death over the course of the better part of 3 decades. It is therefore not surprising when some Johnny come lately Video game designer comes along and applies some "Awesome Cool Tweaks" and ends up breaking some of the subtle and sublime balance.\n\nIf you haven't a clue about the board games, but perhaps like 40k, then this game is going to be much more palatable - because it has no prior expectations to live up to, and the sight of big clompy marines wandering around is enough to get your juices flowing.\n\n\nFor me personally, the game is a great model for what a bad designer can do to a good game. Or to put it another way. Video game designers know zip all about good game design ( but they do a mean line in Kapow, Splat, Kaboom, In game Purchases, and pointless character level ups )\n\nCaveat Emptor !","August 31, 2015","false","19.4"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","68","88","5","0"

There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.\n\nSpace Hulk: Ascension is a truly wonderful game based in Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 setting.  The setting, along with its sister Warhammer fantasy world, reached its height of popularity in the late 80s and early 90s.  Both worlds had as their primary manifestations tactical tabletop wargames using handpainted miniatures.  There were also pencil-and-dice RPGs and numerous other tabletop games, including Mordheim and Warhammer Quest.  For me it all culminated in 1989, with the near-simultaneous release of Space Hulk and the now legendary Bolt Thrower album 'Realm of Chaos.'  The game was exciting and unpredictable, even scary, and the music was glorious.  I fell in love with the Warhammer 40k setting.\n\nSo you can imagine my delight when Space Hulk was first released for PC.  Unfortunately the initial release was ultimately a too-perfect translation of the tabletop game and did not hold up well as a satisfying video game.  The revamped Space Hulk: Ascension, on the other hand, is in my opinion the most faithful representation of the experience of the WH40k universe ever developed for computer gaming.\n\nMighty battlefleets cross the demon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomicon, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will.\n\nIn SH:A the player controls squads of Adeptus Astartes- genetically engineered superhuman Space Marines- who are tasked with reclaiming city-size battleships that have been...corrupted...by their passage through the warp.  Nothing human has survived and the huge, dark ships are infested with the shifting, protean monsters known as genestealers.  The ship interiors are characterized by dark, dingy, metallic corridors lit by occasional blood-colored emergency lights and the glare of he Astartes' headlamps.  The sound design is superb in this regard: the whining of the ancient Terminator armor suits, the clanging of metal grates and tiles, the oppressive echo of bolter fire against the too-close bulkheads, the static of the Marines' voices over the vox channel...and the lunatic chitter and clatter of genestealers just outside of sight.  It's brilliant.  The view is 3/4 overhead but the claustrophobic nature of the situation is still palpable.  There is never enough room to do the thing that would work best.  It's a constant game of making the best out of a horrifying situation.\n\nChange for the Change God. Hear the Symphony of the Warp. All Is Dust.\n\nThe most significant change from the first Space Hulk PC game is the integration of RPG elements into SH:A.  It's still a squad-based, objective-centric tactics game. But now your Astartes earn xp from kills and objectives, and, though growth is slow, the careful distribution of skill points is essential to success later on.  Change to live, adapt to your environment- or die.  The default settings include permadeath, and you will be losing many Astartes forever, sometimes ones you've spent many hours developing.  This is an accurate depiction of the brutal nature of the WH40k universe generally and of the honor among Astartes specifically.  When a Marine falls, he asks only that he be avenged.  The key is to fight back against the forces of Chaos that threaten always to swallow the Empire. You can switch off permadeath, and then your fallen warriors will be available for future missions, but will not earn any xp for the mission in which they fell (and nobody else will get the xp for their kills, it's just lost).  Either way tension is high and sweat will bead on your brow every time you press 'End Turn.'\n\nI could probably talk about this game and its setting for hours on end...but I will show mercy and cut to the chase.\n\nI'm not sure I'm capable of the level of detachment necessary to give this game a number rating, because the base game and the world beyond are so close to my heart.  That being said, the game is well-balanced and difficult, and gameplay is enthralling and nail-biting, and victory is glorious.  So, highly recommended to any lover of tactical or turn-based gameplay, as well as lovers of dark space opera or space horror genres.  Despite its difficulty it's a good place to start your WH40k journey if you're new to the setting.\n\nThe DLC add quite a bit to the game. Each one adds a new playable Astartes Legion (every legion has different skills and units) and an entire new campaign.  You can play any Legion you own through any of the campaigns, which makes for enormous replayability.  But there's really no point in purchasing them until you've played through the base campaigns with the base Legions.\n\nAvenge me, my brothers!\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","May 25, 2015","true","10.3"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","55","69","4","14"

If you have the original one and were not a fan of the RNG'nes of the dice rolls, Then Ascension will be a pleaseant surprise for you.\n\nShooting, Overwatch and Close Combat is no longer done with dice rolls and instead with a percentage chance to hit.\nWhich in my opinion is a good fit as the percentage will get higher over time whe you use skills and find weapon upgrades inside crates during levels. This, along with customisation of your terminators, makes your squad feel bad ♥♥♥ compared to the rookie squad that you will end up neglecting ( unless you play the harder difficulties anywas).\nThe nice thing about all this is that even if you have an excellent team and don't save scum, 1 wrong move and you're bound to lose one of your guys.\n\nThe graphics have gotten a noticable overhaul compared to the original. The lighting is alot better, Excellent shadows (better then some AAA games i've seen) and the visual effects are without a doubt much better.\n\nTime for the bad part I guess, If you've read anything about the game, people are saying it runs at a really low frame rate or that the menu is basically a slide show cause it's poorly optimized, I say to them that they need to stop blinking so fast. My frame rate is over 60 fps and drops to about 30-40 with fire everywhere, dead bodies and everybody on overwatch with the sight cones active. So as you can tell, that's not the bad part cause fps doesn't make the game unplayable.. Even at 10-20fps. What does is the part where if you equip your heavy terminator with a cyclone missile launcher you can't click on him, to move him, shoot, overwatch, nothing. Tiem to restart the level it is. Started again, same thing, reset the game, same thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002567771/recommended/317620/","76561198002567771","Xenus Icelon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002567771/","346 products in account","Space Hulk Ascension is a re-do of the old Space Hulk boardgame (Available as a directly ported video game on steam as well) which seeks to create a more video game-like experience by increasing the amount of action and changing game mechanics to fit better as a videogame rather than as a boardgame.\n\nHowever, it has problems. While it seems that each of the changed mechanics work on their own, it does not quite come together as a single whole game. At times this can make it frustrating or annoying to play as nearly nothing is explained of these new mechanics. Coupled with an UI that has many flaws, I would call it slightly messy.\nBut it's still pretty decent, the devs are paying attention to it and the steam forum, and they are clearly trying to fix all the bugs and to improve the user's experience.\nSadly, it feels like that they rushed through or skipped playtesting entirely. I encountered several bugs and many oversights. Most of which are based on not giving the player vital information or in a complete lack of explanation as to whats going on. Examples include a hidden fail condition(3/10 marines dying on a specific mission autofails it), missing information on your inventory(Objective specific items not shown, gear stats not shown), and little explained on game mechanics. You will feel powerless and like your choices do nothing until you figure out how things work.\n\nFor those who do not know Space Hulk, it is a turn based tactical game in which space marine terminators (From Warhammer 40k) enter a space hulk(Large drifting mass of ships and debris fused together). They then encounter tyranid Gene-stealers(Aliens with sharp armour piercing claws) and go through the space hulk as the first force to enter and go to the most dangerous places. You're not alone. There's a main force behind you, but you're the first in, always in the dangerous parts, and the last one out.\nYou will control a squad(Up to two ingame) of these terminators during a mission and achieve objectives, and preferably not die.\n\nThe basics:\nThe marines are in big, slow, cumbersome terminator armour, but have guns that will be able to shoot a lot of xenos and occasionally jam. The genestealers are fast, deadly in melee and have superior numbers.\nThe marines have to move through a level to complete their objectives, and the genestealers have to stop them.\nIt's an interesting take on tactical turn based combat and worth taking a look if you're interested.\n\nDifferences from the original, since the store page doesn't list it in detail:\nBolter jamming - No longer chance based, it's now based on how often it fires and the chance it gets to cool down. 10 shots in a single turn will overheat it and force a jam. (Personally I feel this only really removes a lot of tension, but it does make them consistent)\n\nDistance bonus/penalty - A simple change, long range shots get a penalty applied to them. Short range gets you a bonus. Sadly missing is an option to tell your marines not to shoot at too high ranges, which can potentially jam their bolter with xenos right around the corner ready to jump them.\n\nDifferent fire modes - Burst fire, aimed shooting, and suppression. They all have their uses, though they cost two action points as opposed to one. I'm not sure if +10% to hit from the special aimed shot is as valuable as just shooting again. Burst fire is great at opening doors and killing broodlords though. (Note: For fans of the old Space Hulk, you can shoot doors while walking to them in this one as well. There is no button for it and its never mentioned ingame, but a marine gets a free shooting action every move action. You'll have to manually tell him to shoot after every tile though. Xenos are automatically shot after a move if possible)\n\nItems in some maps - Missions marked with a lightning icon have items in them. These can range from completely useless junk that gives you a +16% chance to hit on meelee for one mission, to a relic that will seriously boost your marines for the rest of the game. Currently appears bugged to have the 'next mission' bonus stuff apply to the mission you picked it up in.\n\nRPG elements - Your marines level up, and you can increase their stats. Pretty standard stuff. They are:\nWeapon skill: Your ability to hit the xeno threat with your meelee attack\nRanged skill: Ability to hit at range\nAgility: Actions per turn\nPerception: Range at which your terminators can detect xenos. Note: The game doesn't tell you this, but your perception is apparently used to determine how far away you get your ranged bonus/penalty\nToughness: While there is no health bar or lives and a single hit kills a marine, toughness reduces the chance for a xeno to score a hit on their attacks\nFocus: Psi power points and resistance to psi attacks\n\nProgression - A double edged sword. You might like to see your marines grow in power slowly over the game. Or they could die and you're left facing large amounts of deadly xenos with just a bunch of rookies. Most of the good gear is also level locked for some reason.\nIf you play on hard you'll have to re-level a marine from level 1 if they died. Which can leave you with a team of rookies against the best xenos\n\nMelee was changed from the original - You can no longer spend AP on guard to get a reroll on your melee should it fail. This was offset by making a tie be a terminator victory. Personally I've found that this means melee is faster but also completely unreliable in every way. Warning! The meelee percentage you get when you think about hitting a genestealer is not your chance of victory. It's your chance of hitting that genestealer with your one dice. If he hits both of his dice, he will still win and kill your marine. Ultimately this means that meelee is usually suicide. On the bright side, even the greenest rookie will score a hit on a broodlord if he can flank the thing as flanking is now always an instant-success.\n\nLights and darkness - The map is really dark. As your marines walk into a room the lights in that room turn on and will stay on. This is very well done and atmospheric when it works, however it often means you're watching darkness seemingly randomly erupt into red clouds during your overwatches. Your marines can see in the dark, and they're not telling you what they see in there.\nSometimes it's also a bit too dark to see where the wall stays a wall and where it becomes a ventilation shaft.\nIt's nice looking and all, but if I have to resort to asking my librarian where he can place a forcefield to see where I can actually walk in areas that I already went through there is something wrong.\n\nBlips - Now one blip you see is one genestealer. You don't know what kind it is, just that it's there.\n\nGenestealer variation - Now with more kinds of genestealer! Sadly, it seems all the new ones exist purely to punish meelee marines, with extra sharp claws for even more attack, acid clouds on death so they can suicide bomb you, and what seems to be an unavoidable weakening attack makes it so that anyone even considering melee is harshly punished. If you weren't considering melee, that's okay. They have a flesh hook to pull you into it. Broodlords(Big guys, you'll recognise them when you see them) are much more plentiful now than before, but also easier to take down. Instead of being hard to kill monsters as they were before, now they just take more hits to bring down.\nAll of these seem to appear only later in the game, so you don't need to worry too much early on.\n\nIn the end, it's alright. It's an interesting take on Space Hulk that appears very rough around the edges and has some poor flaws that really stand out. It has a lot of potential however.\nSo my advice: Wait a few weeks and then check it to see if it has been patched, if it hasn't, then wait a few more weeks. I am recommending it because it does in fact seem to be worked on, so hopefully we will see it updated and polished soon.","November 20, 2014","true","19.8"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","2"

But with Ascension, we have everything the original was crying out for--and more!\nThe character progression is very well done--rather than simply gaining hit points and killing power like in nearly every other game, upgrading your terminators makes them more versatile--faster, more accurate, and most importantly, more options for equipment.  One solid hit from a Genestealer still kills, making you have to use your newfound abilities to plan better, rather than simply muscling your way through.\nAnd by making the Genestealers more varied, it adds a new level of tension to the game.  I'll never forget the first time I got cocky and blew apart a nearby alien, only to find myself minus one teammate when the creature unexpectedly exploded into a pool of acid.\nYou know you've made a tactical strategy game right when "mage" type characters are used for more than firepower.  I love blowing apart swarms of monsters just as much as anyone, but nine times out of ten, I found myself having my Librarian put up a barrier rather than kill several enemies, as it was the sounder tactical move.  Doling this of my own volition in a game like this speaks volumes of its quality.\nAll in all, this is one of the finest games I have ever put my fingers to.  I can find no fault in its execution, no issue with its mechanics, and other than screaming at my own stupidity when one of my teammates is butchered before my eyes, I have never found myself becoming angry at the game or any aspect of it.  11 out of 10!!!","November 25, 2014","true","66.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

The customization and personalization of your squad is something that i really enjoy and adds more depth to the terminators; instead of them all just being storm bolter weilding automatons you can actually customize traits and abilities to make your squad truly YOURS. But with this comes minor but acumulating setbacks. For example if one of those customized terminators falls in a mission he is replaced, albeit with a terminator of the same level if your dificulty setting allows, but the replacement is a random computer generated terminator. What is the point in letting us customize our terminators if your just going to have to go back and rework all of them after each mission? Sure you can set them back to the way they were but its just tedious and annoying. Why undo all of the improvements you have made with the customization by making them so limited to one life? To me it just defeats the purpose. Along with this the lighting is not helpful, sometimes i cant tell if i have set my terminators to overwatch because the eye icon above their heads is not visible leading to a disapointing genestealers turn. The extra difficulty is great if you enjoy a challenge so i wouldnt take points away for having a game that engages you and makes you think but the subtle annoyances can really add up.

I find myself caring much more about my individual marines and carefully managing upgrades, skills, weapons, who I use in a mission, etc.  The game is brutally difficult even on normal.  With death only a simple positioning mistake away, it somewhat reminds me of a rogue like style game.\n\nAs an owner of the previous version I received an additional discount for a total price of $22 USD.  In the time I have spent playing this weekend so far I have already gotten my monesy worth, and I have only completed about 6 of 100 available missions.\n\nOne thing that the new marine character progression system has brought about which is kind of a negative, but may be postivie, is that if I find myself losing one single marine, I abandon the mission which allows you to restart the mission without the troop loss.  So you don't actually lose your dead troops if you abandon before the mission is over.  I have played certain missions 20 or more times now because I just can't stand to lose my 3 range, 3 agility, 3 perception marines.\n\nI would really like to see expanded terrain options.  I am not sure why we have to be always on a "space hulk" which is an abandoned spaceship.  This game's mechanics could be applied to a variety of enviroments with larger maps, ala Xcom, and more racial enemies.  I also want to see a lot more guns, gun and ammo upgrades/alternates, marine types, gear, etc.  All of this would add to the depth and complexity.  I believe a game that added all of this would sell extremely well and would appeal to a wider market than the current design restrictions.\n\nAnyway, much better than the first, and will not be for everyone, but this is a good game if you like very difficult rogue like "lite" style games, tactics, Warhammer 40k, and turn based strategy.","November 16, 2014","true","19.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I've always enjoyed the board game, and I thought the FC adaptation of it was decent, if a bit basic at times. I recommended it to many friends.\n\nWith that in mind, I don't enjoy this game. This game attempts to provide difficulty by obfuscation. You start out on a map where you can only see a few feet around you, and some objective off in the distance that you have to get too. You have no way of knowing how you're supposed to get to that objective other than just roaming around. Since the enemies coming at you can be coming down random paths that you can't see or shoot down without certain weapons, and you don't know that until you get there; functionally you end up starting a map, roaming around to scout the map out, then restarting. Imaging playing the XCOM reboot, where aliens are shoot at you from off-screen off-fog of war, and then magnify it 10 times; that's this game.\n\nSo, in practice, you have to play every map at least twice, the first time being a total waste of play time. It's like a tax on fun.\n\nThere's also no rapid view that shows the state of all your units, what actions are available to them, and what weapons they all have. You have to drill down through context menus to find out what you need. I imagine that it looks pretty? but it's not nearly as useful as the older "ugly" UI.\n\nRPG elements were added to the system, but for the most part they range from your units being generally terrible, to your units being unstoppable killing machines that completely invalidate the risk of the game. At any given time certain weapons are great, and other weapons are terrible, and there isn't a lot of balance too them.\n\nFull Control did a great job of working on the previous Space Hulk entry after development, so I guess I'm hoping they spend some time on this one to make it playable; but for now it's just a frustrating overlay on top of space hulk. Adding in pretty graphics doesn't make up for deteriorated gameplay.","November 19, 2014","false","0.8"," 76 of 130 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","76","130","3","0"

Initially had a list of gameplay bugs that made completing certain campaigns impossible. The company no longer exists but the dev and a few ex-employees were nice enough to issue a patch to fix these bugs. As far as I can see, 1.4.1. bugfix seems to address the main issues. This is good because I like this game. I enjoyed the original Space Hulk (not the remake by Full Control) but always longed for a turn-based version. SHA fits this bill. If you get the DLCs on sale, the overall game will probably keep you busy for a while.\n\nDon't be fooled though; even with the turn-based structure, some missions can be pretty brutal. You need to have a good understanding of your units, weapons, equipment and tactics in order not to lose any terminators (not to mention patience).\n\nWith the recent bugfix, the game is playable and more importantly, enjoyable.

It's just another take on the franchise, just like all previous computer adaptations.\n\nAnd all that is fine, because I'd rather see more people getting in contact with the SH franchise (and having a good experience), than having it fade back to obscurity again. The developer has been doing a nice job from that regard, keeping SH in evidence, listening to the user base, etc.\n\nWhat else can I say?\nSpace Hulk can be a very unforgiving game, but Ascension kind of softens the blow through things like the removal of randomness of weapon jams/overheats. That's a huge design decision, that makes the game instantly less frustrating for the uninitiated. However, it also removes a lot of the challenge as well. SH is a risk management game at its core.\n\nI also see many people praising cosmetics like name customization, skins, etc. Good for them, those Gen Y players (haha), but this old dog doesn't care for that. You guys feel free to name your marine "Sheldon", or whatever floats your boat.\n\nThe only thing that I wish was optional is the fog of war (darkness).\nAdvance planning is a huge part of the appeal of Space Hulk to me, and the fog affects that aspect of gameplay. I actually enjoy spending 10 mins visualizing the entire map, trying to figure out my strategy, risk minimization actions, etc, before moving any pieces. The darkness is just an annoyance, since after a few plays you end up memorizing the map anyway. What's the point in all that "exploration" required by the fog/darkness then?

The lack of a save option during missions on the impossible setting also limits them as it commits you to a session rather than being able to dip in and out as time permits on the other difficulties.\n\nOverall fun though, and I would recommend for people that like squad based games in confined environments and have a little patience.","November 30, 2014","true","46.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You could be forgiven if you had once shown interest, only to have this superb turn based strategy fall off your radar. The developer closed up shop leaving behind a host of bugs and crashes. With only a couple of volunteers to keep the lamp lit for this game and providing the much needed fixes. It has taken quite a while for Ascension to become note worthy. Even in its severely broken state this game had the potential to be a classic. But was always going to fall short due to the various unwinnable scenerios and other boken bits.\n\nBut NOW IT IS FIXED, 100% operational and stands out as a fantastic eulogy for developer, FULL CONTROL. With masses of content, fully customisable squads and some of the most brutal unforgiving gameplay that you're likely to come across. Mistakes can be costly and the constant use of the quick save feature is a sure fire certainty, if you want your team to make it out alive. If you don't like to think in your gaming, it is pretty much guaranteed that you are not going to have a good time. And you will find yourself fretting over every single individual action as the stress and tension slowly mounts with each turn.\n\nAs this is based off of a table top game, the level designs and layouts are quite basic. And unfortunately can appear a bit samey. Which is the first of two flaws (at least by my reckoning), that is present in SH:A. But much of this melts effortlessly away through the atmosphere that oozes from every action. The maps (although appearing small at first), will take some time to finish as progress can be quite slow. Especially if your Terminators find themselves cornered by hundreds of enemy units. This is definately not a game you can rush and does require a clear thought process, in order to move your squad and get them in to a safe defensive position before the end of the turn. With each squad member being allocated a certain number of Action Points depending on their skills (which can be upgraded). These points dictate how much a particular unit can move, shoot and perform other actions. Such as operating a switch or opening and closing a door. And the game can become almost puzzle like as you try and decide just how best to move and position the team in readyness for the enemy turn phase. Luckily when it comes your turn to defend. this operation is free. Providing you have spent the points in your turn to activate the Terminators defensive "Overwatch" function. Then your guys can just blast away merrily... At least until either the ammo runs out or the gun heats up so much that it becomes inoperable. Both situations are recoverable by either a reload or venting the heat from the weapon. Not an easy thing to calculate when being set upon by a horde of Gene Stealers.\n\nAnd a horde they are. Your enemy is numerous, vicious and at times can appear seemingly unstoppable. Though there are only like 4 maybe 5 different types of enemy. Which is a bit of a let down as I am sure there were quite a few variations in the original table top. But despite this, what they lack in variety, the bad guys sure do make up for this in numbers. And it's a good thing that you have a nice array of ridiculously large and extremely violent weapons on hand to help keep them all at bay. Though the better / fun ones do have to be unlocked through levelling up your Marines. Which is done through aquiring experience through kills and only benefit your unit should they survive the level. So keeping them alive is really in the best interest all round. As this can take a while and even longer if you keep on losing your units in the field.\n\nIn closing, Space Hulk : Ascension is just really smart and snappy little title with bags of grit and atmos. And just the perfect title if you're wanting a bash at something a little slower paced or looking for something to exercise the brain matter with for a few hours.\n\nDamn fine violent turn basey fun 10/10","May 22","true","131.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is how it plays out:\n1. Move your team 1-2 sqaures and set Overwatch and end turn\n2. Genestealers are very fast; they close the distance every turn\n3. Hopefully your soldier will kill enemies with Overwatch during the Genestealer turn\n4. If your soldier misses he might get a melee kill, otherwise he dies\n5. Repeat and Rinse\n\nThe game is very dark, you can see 3-4 squares in front of your soldiers but that is it. Many times I would go down a corridor only to find a dead end at the last square since it is very dark. After losing on a map you will know the map and what to do better. Overwtach tends to fail rather often and your soldiers die. If you manage to win you get XP and might level up your soldier, or at least train them some.\n\nGame is very slow paced, but interesting. It is sci-fi and Space Hulk after all.  The campaigns are varied and each is neat. This game takes a while to play and, as I stated, is very slow paced. On occasion you get to shoot during your turn, but this takes up precious movement points (AP action points).\n\nI may play more of this game in the future, right now I have played about 9 hours.

Sure it was obviously rushed, the terminators were slower than the multiplayer loading screen and it wasn't exactly atmospheric, but I don't think it deserved the barrage of abuse that it received, it was simply a direct port of the board game.\n\nSpace Hulk Ascension however, takes an OK game up to a good game. Its still not perfect, but the developers didn't just decide that they knew best, they actually listened to the feedback from the first, and improved on those aspects: adding a leveling system, better lighting, more variety with weaponry and skills and generally a smoother gaming experience without taking away the core aspects that make Space Hulk what it is.\n\nIf there are any devs out there reading this: one nice little feature would be a way of seeing lifetime statistics for your terminators - i.e. number of kills etc. Also some flash missions seem far too easy, and you can set up a winning overwatch on the first couple of turns - minor gripes to an all round good game!\n\nI would give Space Hulk Ascension 8 / 10","December 20, 2014","true","49.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Space Hulk Ascension is an enjoyable turn-based experience,which may not be for everyone.\n\nLong corridors with multiple routes, doors to slow enemy advancement and a squad of Space Marines equipped to fight the alien Tyranids in close quarter combat. The game holds simple objectives to see your squad from one side of the map to another in turn-based combat.\n\nYou'll lead a squad of Space Marines with different weapons and abilities, which become more diverse as they level up. The levelling system encourages you to keep your marines alive as they progress which provides more depth for your squad. The strategies that you apply to your squad are not quite as varied.\n\nThe xenomorph-like alien enemy, known as the Tyranid, fight your gun-wielding Space Marines in hand-to-hand combat, making your best bet to keep the aliens back. Having marines cover one another, waiting in sentry mode as the next marine moves up, it all becomes quite formulaic. The game forces you outside of your squad's comfort zone as it holds spawn points for aliens which push you to vary your strategy. The real panic sets in when you lose a marine or even when you are forced to sacrifice a member of your squad. With a man down, strategies change, but not enough. You still find yourself covering each marine in sentry mode as they move forward.\n\nThe maps can take some time to complete, as your squad slowly pushes forward covering one another. Though the real pleasure of this game is seeing your squad level up, to use their new weapons and abilities for the march through the tougher levels.\n\nThis game can be slow, but rewards players who continue forwards. A fandom for the Alien movie franchise, combined with a love of Games Workshop and an enthusiasm for turn-based strategy will see longevity from this game.","April 26","true","45.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Being a space hulk player from the early 90s on, I was very exited to have a digital version of the game, that stays true to it's board game roots. While the initial relase was lackluster in many areas, the people at full control did their best to fix bugs and smooth out the rough edges, until the game finally became what I had expected.\n\nNow with ascension, full control has proven that they really care about the game.\n\nFirst of all: This is NOT another version of the original space hulk, but a complete new game, that deviates enough from the common ruleset to justifiy the full price launch.\n\nWith this game full control did nothing short of enthuse me in the best way possible. Right from the start, this new entry in the space hulk universe oozes atmosphere. While production values are still not nearly as high one might wish, the small developer team did an amazing job of polishing the title as much as possible with limited ressources.\n\nGone are the clunky animations of the terminators. The overall feeling of your troops is still cumbersome (like it should be), but the blending of the different animations is much more successfull in ascension, not getting in the way of immersion anymore.\n\nThe interior assets of the hulks, while quite impressive in the first title, look even more claustrophobic and menacing in ascension. The light is now only coming from the headlamps of your squadmates, improving even more on the dark and menacing atmosphere. There was some critisism about the lack of a layout map of the missions, but I think, that it is just perfect the way it is. Finding your way room by room on a completely shrouded map feels perfectly in tune with the fluff of space hulk.\n\nAnother big plus are the new sounds. This might actually be the first time I ever felt that a storm bolter should EXACTLY sound like they do in the game. New animations including the much missed genestaeler kill moves plus the more dynamic death and gore effects are the icing on the cake.\n\nWhere ascension really shines is the whole loadout and configuration system. While your terminators gain experience in battle, there is an almost endless variaty of different configurations available. One might change the appearance, the names, the loadout and skills of any squadmate, providing them with the much needed edge against the genestealers during the ongoing campaign.\n\nThe game is still hard as nails. But even after the umpteen failed attempt to get all my terminators to safety, I am still motivated to go on.\n\nThis game is a delight for fans of the series and people who like 40K in general. I really appreciate the effort that went into the creation of this title. There are only two things I would wish for the future:\n\n- transfer the animations and sounds to the board game version of space hulk\n- make ascension available for tablets\n\nApart from that, this title is just what I wanted.","December 31, 2014","true","25.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Such as a game like dark souls, understanding the way all moves, attacks and enemies function will lead you to victory and the tense moments such as trying to escape with all your marines alive as the genestealers rush to your position en mass truly make the game exciting for me as a turn based tactical strategy guy.

Highly recommended.\n\nOh wow. Very tense and difficult game. As a noobie to this type of game I have to say I am really enjoying it. My first mission took me about 2 hours and it went something like this:\n\nI was very very careful because I did not want to lose any guys in my first mission (you also have to escape with three). Needless to say, two of my guys (including my sergeant) were offed by the genestealers. This forced me to not only to pick up the pace but to change my strategy entirely. I ended up just a few tiles away from the teleporter with each of my terminators covering the three entrances. It was horrifying. I was so close yet I was so scared to move any of my guys, I didn't want them to pour in from one side as I retreated. I had my heavy with the flamethrower continually fire at the most open entrance and then retreat into the teleporter. Just two more guys to go.\n\nI noticed a slight break in the wave of enemies from one side, so I pulled that guy back to start heading towards the teleporter but he was now out of action points. All of the sudden, tons of enemies started coming from the final entrance with my guy barely holding on for dear life. I pulled the last man back one tile at a time, putting him in overwatch at each turn as my second guy escapes. My last guy is so close to the teleporter but his gun is jammed and out of ammo so I know I have to be really careful. At the same time I notice enemies are coming from every entrance now. Should I reload, unjam, and go into overwatch again and hope my guy doesn't miss? That's when I realize I have just enough action point to make a run for the teleporter. I had completed the first mission.... phew.\n\nI highly recommend this game. I haven't played the first one but I do know this one is very tense and difficult. Playing carefully, the first mission took me two hours, so I can't imagine how long this game is going to take me to beat entirely. There are 3 chapters to choose from each with their own campaign. However, there are two DLCs that both add another chapter to play as and another campaign. My only gripe with this game is the framerate stuttering that you experience sometimes although this is easily fixed my turning off the Terminator's first person camera (except I love that thing). :)","March 4, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also recommended for people, who don't know anything about WH40k, but are interested in sci-fi's like Aliens (second move with Marines fighting off hordes of aliens), or anything of the sort.\n\nLeading squads of elite inter-galactic marines, with the finest weapons and armor armor in the galaxy, and hunting down hordes of the most deadly biological predators, is incredibly satisfying to watch. This  is a dark, tense, and unforgiving game, and I love it for that.\n\n+ Each chapter feels pretty unique in look and gameplay, and it's worth replaying a campaign with another Marine Chapter.\n+ Campaigns are lengthy and offer a variety of challenging scenarios to overcome.\n+ Lots of tactical depth with the squad customization of skills, gear, and weapon combos, which allows you to build up your squads how you want.\n+ Armor and Decorative customization is a nice addition.\n+ AI is solid and challenging to face.\n+ Sound and FX are perfect - the dark, horrific atmosphere is enhanced by stellar ambient sounds. Comparably awesome to the well done Dawn of War series in this respect.\n+ Extremely satisfying death animations and weapon effects.\n\nI love a good soundtrack, and this game doesn't offer much in that regard, as music is used sparringly (what  - which in this game's case, is not a bad thing - as the mood of the game is set not by instruments, but by the atmospheric sounds of the Space Hulks; the screams of vicious biological terrors; and the blasts of bolters shredding apart bodies and the clanging against metal - which is perfect for a horror setting.\n\nIt is worth supporting this developer, as they treat the Warhammer 40k IP with great respect, and there's a lot of potential for bigger better WH40k games in the future.","March 14, 2015","true","25.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also happens in Rogue mode, which is an amazing mode! So in other words, this game is worth every penny and is amazing when it was working. Truly amazing! However I wanted to leave a warning to those who might want to purchase it in it's current state. If I was puchasing it now I would be even more disapointed, however I would still keep the game and wait for a fix either by the devs or the community, because it is worth it.

Graphics are nice as well and with tweaking options for sure will run on your rig.\n\nTL;DR Want death and claustrophobia around every corner?

There's no way around it, quick saving and loading will be happening often.\n\nThat said, gameplay is shaped by a combination of meticulously planning every move, and trying your luck knowing that you can always revert to a previously saved state and take it from there. This means this game is SLOW PACED, and if you don't take your time, you're not winning any battles.\n\nLastly the power-ups and upgrades are also something to be carefully considered, with some options being practically a necessity, while others just seem to be a waste of terminator XPs. Quite unforgiving, but exactly for this reason, whenever you manage to outsmart the GS and keep all of your units alive, equally rewarding.\n\nIf you like the battle components of X-COM, this game is for you. It's possible to develop more sound strategies in X-COM for most of the time than here, considering the maps' layouts, but there are unmistakable similarities between the two. I'm a fan of turn based strategy first and foremost, and the feeling I get while playing this (besides the X-COM nostalgia) is that I'm playing some sort of very futuristic version of chess, on a constantly mutating board, against a largely unpredictable number of enemies.\n\nOh, and getting to know your terrain means everything, so going for a "trial run" on every map (losing it stupidly quick just to take a gander at it) seems to be advisable before going on a real attempt at completing a level in a clean way. The first time I played a mission in which I had 5 terminators and had to wipe out 60 aliens, was the moment I accepted losing and restarting to be a part of this game, and ended up refining my strategy (controlled retreat, standing behind "curves" etc) to finish the level with all my units alive.","March 14, 2015","true","48.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

At first I was unsure about this approach but I realized how much tension and challenge this adds and it makes playing some maps especially exciting.\n\nMy only critique would be to say the maps are sometime very dark and it can be hard to judge distance/tiles on those maps (remember to count out those 6 precious square to know if you might be lunch for some alien filth).\n\nOverall though lots of fun and just like the first one a good challenging turn based experience.

I dare to say that the developer team managed to improve a few aspects of the game (for example there is leveling), while avoided messing up others. Good job! My only problem is the same as with all of the Space Hulk games: it's nice that we have melee weapons, and I understand that there should be a way for the genestealers to have some chance, but since in melee you can easily die while you attack, I avoid melee as if the genestealers spread leprosy. Maybe I'll try Blood Angels once, a melee specific faction, but I will prepare myself for heavy losses.\n\nAnyway, SH:A is not a too short game either; right now the counter stays on 12 played hours, and I am at about two-thirds of my first campaign - although I don't rush, I never rush -, so I'd say it was well worth the price tag.","March 28, 2015","true","32.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It caught my attention as i had previously played space hulk, but this is above and beyond what i expected for a sequel. Although the gameplay is quite dark (literally) it adds to the experience well.\n\nSpeaking of experience, this game has a steep learning curve, but its the little things, for example: move a space marine forwards = 1 move, move him backwards = 2 moves.. simple huh? WRONG! Get a group of 4 high protein diet lumbering space marines into the confined spaces of a ship and these small things become a tactical nightmare. If you have one guy watching the walkway behind the team, he will move at half their speed (that's a problem), or take the other mechanic where one space marine cannot squeeze past another.. come to a crossroad then what do you do?\n\nThese small things make this a very strategic game, but mark my words, your men will die, which is a shame as good men are literally hard to find in this game because when a guy dies, HE ACTUALLY DIES and you can kiss him and his perks, training and on the job skills goodbye. The Result = you will be jumping at the chance to sacrifice rookies for vets.\n\nFrustrating, strategic, depressing, fun and nuturing all in one package, what more could you want? And bravo to the devs for the space marine vision camera on all marines, upgraded look and feel and more in-depth game play (like bolters overheating).\nFor the price i suggest you pick up a copy asap, a fine example of the end result exceeding the sum of its parts.

SH was more a direct port from Board Game to Computer, while pleasing for fans of the board game, it was not (imo) that great a transition to computer for non Board Game fans.  SHA addresses this by making the game more suited for the medium.  Some differences\n- Hit % now replace random dice rolls\n- 3 Chapters to choose from (4th available as DLC)\n- Terminators can be customised from looks to name\n- Terminators can gain XP and be lvled up and customised\n- Generally more "friendly" to new players\n\nAs for the game itself?  If you like Warhammer 40k and Turn Based games then this is a very good game.  It is slower based than games like X-Com (Modern version) mainly due to the fact you are fighting a very dangerous foe which means, while the levels themselves are not massive, you progress slowly & cautiously (or else face the consequences! :D)\n\nYou have a few different classes of Terminators (Units) and can upgrade them as they gain XP.  It is a welcome addition and causes some tough decesions as if things go wrong you will want to protect your vetrans but the Upgrade/Class system is not that in depth.  Also, while there are several weapon loadouts to choose from depending on class, the weapons, especially Melee, do not feel that different from each other.\n\nLevel wise, tbh they all look pretty much the same, but a variety of objectives and enemies do help keep things interesting but all follow a pretty similar format.\n\nThere is not much story to be had and briefings are very minimalistic which is a shame as there is no real narrative to tie things together.  That being said, due to customisation and the painful process of getting enough XP to upgrade I did care deeply for my terminators.\n\nSummary\nPros\n- Fun Turn Based Combat\n- Hard but still accessible\n- Customisation & lvl up options keep things interesting\n- Ability to burn foul Xeno's in holy fire!\n- TERMINATORS\n- Warhammer 40k\n\nCons\n- Lack of functional variety in some weapons, especially Melee\n- Levels all look alike\n- Lack of campaign narrative\n\nOverall I would recommend to fans of Warhammer 40k and Turn Based Strategy","December 31, 2014","true","22.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a lot like the original Space Hulk, and comes with some things of its own to make each mission a varied and fun battle against the genestealer hordes. You've got the squad of terminators from a certain chapter that you pick at first, and have a host of upgrades in the form of skills and weapons that you can choose from. Then there are the classes for each, with the standard terminator to the sergeants to the librarians. Each Chapter also gives a special ability or unit, such as the Dark Angel's Apothecary or the Space Wolves' Frost Weapons.\n\nThere is also permadeath, because it wouldn't be Space Hulk if it didn't have that. This gives you an incentive to keep your guys alive, because while if they die you get a person on that same level as a replacement, it also drops them to the base exp for that level. It's also great to see your Space Marines get better and better. You start to get attached to your men, and when they die you feel as if you got hit yourself.\n\nA good example of this was when I was doing a mission to hold back a certain number of genestealers. I can't remember the exact number, only that there were a LOT. My Space Wolves were split into two teams, each in a room desperately trying to hold off the swarm. These thing kill in one hit, and I had already lost three of the Emperor's Finest to them. One of the rooms were going to be fine, with my men covering one another. However, the other room was only just holding them back. This squad was going to die if someone didn't do something.\n\nThe sergeant stepped in front of the door that the genestealers were going through, and he was going to hold that line. There were only about twenty of the xenos left, but the chance of overunning was still very real. Remember that these things killed in one hit. Sergeant Alfgeir killed one of the aliens. And then another, and another, and one after that. He defeated eight of the xenos in a row, without taking a single hit! There were only six of them left! They could get out of this!\n\nI was still celebrating when Alfgeir was suddenly torn to shreds by one of the last genestealers.\n\nMy Space Wolves won that battle, with four casualties. Alfgeir was replaced by a new Sergeant, with the same frost blade that he used to use. I was both sad and excited. Sad because Alfgeir was a Wolf who could have lived had I made better choices, but also excited because this new Sergeant, Bothvar, was going to do some equally heroic. Maybe he would live, maybe he would die, but I know that whatever happened, he was going to drag the xenos down with him like Alfgeir did.","January 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Their first attempt - simply titled Space Hulk - was poorly received on the whole, being criticised for a somewhat buggy launch and for being a literal interpretation of the source material. So, how does their second outing fair in comparison?\n\nSame ruleset, different approach\n\nThe first thing to know is that Full Control have not reinvented the wheel with this second outing. The core concepts from the board game (and thus their first outing) are still very much on display. You still only receive a small squad of soldiers (Terminators) to face off against a horde of vicious aliens (Generstealers). Careful positioning of your Terminators is still the number one priority and poor placement can lead to things going messy very quickly. Overheating of weapons is still present and is as deadly as always, and the surroundings are still the claustrophobic halls of long derelict space craft. So what’s different?\n\nThe six sided dice are gone. Wisely Full Control have moved the entire combat system over to a percentile base, which seems far more forgiving that the D6 based system found in the first game. The chance to hit a target is clearly displayed each and every time as are the factors influencing that number – giving the player a far better idea of whether they are likely to score a hit or not than the randomness of the previous iteration. Weapons jams are still an issue, but rather than occurring on a dice result they are caused by continuous fire while in Overwatch (an action taken by terminators allowing them to fire during the Genestealers movement); this feels both far more realistic and fair, whilst adding another layer of decision making to the gameplay: do you spend the action points (of which each terminator only has a limited supply of per turn) on movement, taking an extra shot, or cooling you weapon and settling in for a defensive overwatch?\n\nIn addition to the mechanical changes of the game play, Full Control have added a layer of squad management to the game similar to that found in the X-Com games. Each terminator is able to level up and as they do so they become more deadly fighters, gaining access to better weapons, equipment, and skills. Experience points can be distributed between six different attributes allowing a measure of customisation within your squad, and these choices have a noticeable impact on gameplay and the results of combat during missions.\n\nThe campaign system has also received a little bit of attention, with branching mission lines and flash missions that crop up between the main strokes, giving you the opportunity to hunt down bonuses (such as extra XP per kill, increased melee skills, increased chance to hit at range, each applied to the following mission) or rare and powerful weapon upgrades. There is also greater scope present than in the first – instead of just one force (Chapter) of Terminator you now get to choose from three – each with their own themed campaign that feels distinctly different to the others.\n\nStill Pretty\n\nSo what’s stayed the same? The atmosphere. The first game did a great job of bringing the derelict space craft you were on to life, and the Ascension edition is no different. Light flicker to life as your terminators explore new rooms and corridors. Steam hisses out of ruptured vents and fan assemblies, and chapels and reliquaries can still be seen just out of reach. The game is, for a turn based strategy game, gorgeous. A great deal of love and attention has been lavished on each of the character models and it pays off – with terminators armour becoming more ornate as they level. The lighting and special effects are just as beautiful as they were the first time around.\n\nTough but fair\n\nOverall, Space Hulk Ascension can be a brutal affair, punishing poor decisions in very short order and wiping the floor with the unprepared or impatient. This game most definitely is not for those of a short attention span or that need fast paced entertainment to have fun. It rewards careful planning and caution. If you take the time to position your men correctly and establish covering fields of fire, then the game is quite easy (save for when faced by some of the tougher enemies that turn up late game). But just one mistake can see a great number of your troops killed in a single turn, leaving little chance of completing your objectives.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf you like turn-based strategy then most definitely. There’s a lot to like here and quite a bit of gameplay for the money, and a degree of replay ability thanks to the levelling and equipment systems, as well as the branching campaigns. However, if you do not have patience and get frustrated easily, then this may not be for you.

There's a great synergy between the dark claustrophobic maps with lots of narrow corridors and the ponderous nature of your terminator suits that creates tension and rewards planning.\n\nThe overall tactical experience is that you're launching a cautious, slow motion asphyxiation of the genestealers ability to attack you by covering corridors with overwatch, clogging xeno spawn points and just inching ever closer to your objectives. But you can't concentrate firepower for the most part as line of sight is blocked for anyone behind the lead suit, so you really need to work at having a sound deployment that maximizes fire coverage and covers your soft underbelly (unit facing is huge in this game). Another unique element is that you've got a serious fog of war issue, but unlike most tactical games, its actually very stubborn as you can't just send out a scout real quick and take in the lay of the land. So, assessing the environment and trying to intuit the turns and twists of the corridors in that big black blob outside of your view is another unique element to the gameplay here.\n\nWhen things go according to plan, you can take out 45 genestealers without losing a suit. When things go wrong, you can end up completely exposed with a squad going down like dominos as the suits are hyper vulnerable from the flanks or behind (well, and sometimes from the front too). While you generally are rewarded for caution, there's also times when a quick, risky rush might be appropriate and acting on these instances is quite dramatic.\n\nThe player turns are extremely slow in comparison to something like X-Com, but the slow pace actually works really well from an atmosphere and immersion standpoint in addition to the tactics. Conversely, much of the action actually happens during the Xeno's turn, which are in fact quite fast, so you have this "pray you didn't screw up and then press end turn" tension ritual that you keep repeating every few minutes. *takes a deep breath*\n\nThe use of lighting is fantastic and everything looks great on the map (I was thinking that the terminator textures were kinda 'meh' in the mission briefing, but they're perfect in conjunction with the lighting effects). More sound effects - and voice acting in particular - would be nice, but what's there sets the mood.\n\nSo, if you're patient, posses a mild streak of masochism and unique tactical gameplay with a tense, dark edge to it sounds interesting, you've come to the right place.","March 4, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If, like me, you've played the tabletop game and enjoyed it, then you'll probably enjoy this. It's a much less frustrating version than the previous Space Hulk game released here on Steam as Genestealers die more often and your Marines don't. Saying that though, your Marines do die and that can be frown-enducing but still you push on; the goal must be attained and your Brothers must be avenged.\n\nNice noises although a bit bang-slam at times but nice through a sound bar and/or with some bottom end on the audio. Visuals are nice, a bit dark though but obviously that is the intention. Overall a good, immersive atmosphere with a nice dose of testosterone ;)\n\nAs a casual gamer (ie. I have a life that means work comes before gaming) Space Hulk Ascension does become difficult as strategies fail but I do find myself pondering strategy whilst waiting at a bus stop or in a queue to order coffee.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RelixKhandor/recommended/317620/","RelixKhandor","Relix Khan'Dor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RelixKhandor/","365 products in account","Finally, a turn-based Space Hulk game like the tabletop! Now, this game does has some drawbacks, but it does a lot right.\n\nFirst thing, there is no story. Think of REASON X for the Imperium of Man to risk the most powerful warriors and fairly powerful equipment, both of which that could be used elsewhere. If you want a story, google Flashgitz and watch their two parodies of Space Hulk then rename your space marines after the poor sods featured in the flash animation.\n\nBut since this is a GAME, I'll judge it as such:\n\nPROS:\n+Sound effects are amazing. The Genestealers sound like Xenomorphs, but who cares it works. The space marines and everything having to do with them sounds amazing. When you bash xeno scum with a powerfist or gun them down with a botler, it sounds amazing.\n+Atmosphere! It is simply amazing. Seriously, it is really good. I hope Space Hulk Deathwing has the same, but more.\n+Permadeath options. Normal difficulty has your space marine die and the replacement be at the same level. Hard is "Nupe. He dead." Even though on normal you are given a replacement, you still grow attached to the Sergent named Leto and ♥♥♥♥♥ when he gets swarmed to death.\n+Everything looks Warhammer 40k. Parts of the space hulk, the marines, and the genestealers. I love the art design and wish there were more good Warhammer 40k games.\n+Turn based stuff done with lots of stats and numbers. This game WILL bash your brains in if you stat your marines wrong. Good. I like that, a lot. It means my choices have consequences. It really brings out some strategy rather than rush over and kill. You will need to plan ahead, otherwise, you risk death. When a genestealer kills the space marine guarding the rear, your entire plan will fall apart.\n+This is probably one of the closet things you'll get apart from actually playing Space Hulk on a table.\n\nMIXED:\n+/-the asking price is far too high. If you really want a good turn-based, I'd say burn the $30 or go get XCOM, but $17.99 (what I paid) is perfect for this.\n+/-The really cool picture-in-picture mode is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but it lags. Thankfully, you can switch it off or on whenever to save the framerate. HOWEVER, it shouldn't tank the framerate.\n+/-Some of the missions can get repetitive, but they are still enjoyable. If people can play the same COD maps over and over, you can do the same with this but feel like you've achieved something.\n+/-Animations are sometimes poor at times but this isn't a in-your-face shooter, so the animations are only noticable if you always zoom in, which you won't be.\n+/-AI lacks any ability other than SWARM THE PLAYER!!!!! The game still requires managing how the swarm charges and having the space marines ready. I'd like it better if the genestealers could set traps or build up then charge from all doors instead of swarming down that one hallway. Howwver, that hallway can kill you if one marine runs out of ammo.\n+/-There's almost no reason not to play the Ultramarines or Blood Angels over the Space Wolves. I really love having different chapters (two more are DLC) for different stats and playstyles, but there's no reason ever to play as the Space Wolves unless you want ultra-hard mode. All chapters per squad of five have one sergent or librarian, one heavy, and three wildcards. Ultramarines have three ranges, Blood Angels have two/one ranged and one/two melee, and the Space Wolves have three melee. Melee classes can use bolters or two-hand Lighting claws or the power hammer, but they do have worse aim at range. Why is this a problem? See below.\n\nCONS:\n-Melee is utterly pointless and dangerous. I'm not talking about the counter-attacks that are sometimes possible by a space marine before a genestealer rips them apart, heck no I'm talking about worse! If you have a 97% chance to hit melee and miss, you are dead. There's absolutely no reason to do a melee attack UNLESS it is 100% (like from the sides or behind). If the melee attacks had more HP at the start, it'd be worth the risk, but there isn't any difference until later ranks. Even then, it means if you have a 3% to fail an attack and die, you still won't risk it. If melee was done differently, I'd love to try it out more, but as it stands, it is just a death sentence.\n-Space Wolves, since they are melee focused, are completely pointless unless you want the game to be harder. Seriously, just play hard mode with the Smurfs or Space Vampires.\n-DLC is a tad too expensive for what it offers. If they were $2 or less, maybe.\n-NO MULTIPLAYER OF ANY KIND!\n\nClosing:\nI'd give this game a B because it does what I expected it to be: Be a good virtual version of Space Hulk.

Yea it was worth it for cheap, but there are some real design flaws. I feel like I got my money's worth, but I'm definitely getting bored / annoyed with it after this many hours. I'd recommend you watch some Steam Broadcasts / gameplay vids before you buy it.\n\nPros============================================\n+ Well done environments, graphics, animations, sounds\n+ The shoulder cam (think picture-in-picture) drops framerate significantly, but it is really cool\n+ Ranged combat strikes a good balance between fear of death <--> thrill of success\n+ Preset or customizable difficulties\n\nCons============================================\n***I never played any prior Space Hulk, and I'm not a Warhammer tabletop player.\n\nInfo available in-game is greivously limited at best and outright lies at worst\n- Things with multiple attacks only animate one attack\n- How melee combat gets resolved / rolled for\n- No enemy stat is visible besides Action Points and Hit Points. Number of attacks per AP, Resistance, Attack modifier - none of that is visible in-game or even documented conclusively *anywhere* as far as I know.\n- All "Chance to hit" numbers displayed when you mouse over a target are outright lies because they don't take into account all the different dice rolls that influence the outcome.\n\nWin-Or-Die.\nThis seems pretty bizarre to me, since even in Warhammer tabletop (hey I watched some YouTube) things have more than one Hit Point. Most RNG-based games have multiple HP so you have some chance to think "Hmm, ♥♥♥♥'s going south - better change plans." SH:A isn't like that at all; you can go from a perfect-so-far mission to annihilated at any time, 1 minute or 1 hour into a mission - with just one bad die roll. SH:A's philosophy is that you're supposed to "plan for the worst", but even if you managed to avoid being immediately meat-mulched by one bad roll, I feel like you need every squad member alive to make it through most missions. You can save at any time (except on Impossible difficulty) to re-do a bad round - but that really feels like cheating and is sort of unpleasant.\n\nSH:A is a battleground of competing design philosophies.\n1. You need every marine alive so they can get XP and grow to face the threats ahead.\n2. It is a given that your marines will all die at some point, regardless of difficulty, because of the Win-Or-Die mechanic.\nWhile Normal, Easy, or Custom difficulty allow you to 'revive' or replace marines KIA, the replacements lose ALL experience they would have gained from the mission. You could have a guy 1% away from level 5, but if he dies - the replacement will be 4 with 0% progress towards level 5; that is an almost insurmountable loss of effort and time. Harder difficulties give you level 1 replacements! You could lose a really high-level guy and receive a level 1 replacement - and then you will pretty much be unable to advance as far as I can tell.\n\nLeveling takes a long, long time.\nCompleting missions gives no meaningful XP reward. The only way you are going to get meaningful XP for your marines is by setting them up in a highly-defensible room on Overwatch, all looking towards the same door, and then watch them mindlessly blast xenos for hundreds of turns - performing the same mindless process each round: quicksave in case of bad RNG, [Cool Weapon and Reload] for every single marine, End Turn...for hours, and hours, and hours.\n\nTL;DR: this game has a ♥♥♥♥-POOR XP SYSTEM. You cannot level up enough to meet the challenges ahead by dutifully performing your mission objectives. The system requires that you ignore the actual reason you are in this damn space hulk and brainlessly XP farm for hours.\n\nOverwatch crawl.\nEspecially in the early-game when nobody has very many AP, each mission becomes a painfully slow crawl where you move a couple squares, enter Overwatch to shoot xenos when they move on their turn, reload, move a couple squares, enter Overwatch... Guys, there are some *BIG* maps in this game, and it can take a painstakingly long time to creep your squad across them a few squares per turn, blasting xenos all the while and praying that one bad RNG die roll doesn't ruin it all and necessitate reloading an earlier save or abandoning the mission altogether. It can be thrilling and fun at first, but eventually I got to the point where "I just wanna get to the damn objective already!"\n\nDevelopers, if you are reading this - I would have MUCH PREFERRED a design where Overwatch capability was a toggle-able per-marine, and its effectiveness was governed by a passive attribute like Weapon / Ballistic Skill.","March 6, 2015","true","50.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to admit I was put off from getting the original space hulk after reading the reviews and hearing about its bad press.  I was lucky enough to get acension in a sale and so far love it. Its a bit of a system hog so sadly I can't see it in its full glory but it still looks good and is very atmospheric. They have captured the dark claustrophobic corridors of a hulk brilliantly.\n\nThe game is still brutal with the odds stacked against your squad of terminators as they make their way through these ship or ruins. Squads can be customised right down to individual terminator looks and names. Each game is by no means over in minutes (unless you get wiped out). You have to think about every move all your terminators make as it could be their last should you make a tactical mistake. Things such as making sure you are facing towards where the genestealers will come from. Checking you have reloaded or cooled down your weapon.  Putting a terminator in overwatch at the right location. If your squad manage to survive their mission they will earn experience and be able to upgrade various skills making them more effective for the next missions. Although terminators do not fear death you should still do your best to keep them alive. The animations are nice, especially when the genestealers make their move and your terminators start firing back. A nice touch is the shoulder cam view that lets you see what the selected terminator sees in front of him. Attention to detail is demonstrated here when you can switch the shoulder cam into an infra red mode which shows the heat signature of nearby genestealers.\n\nIf you are new to space hulk then fear not as there is a good in game tutorial that will get you started. The devs are really pro-active and will be bringing more new content for this game giving it even more hours of playability.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=404161941","March 5, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been a fan ever since. I own the previous version of Space Hulk and was happy with it, even enjoying replaying some of the classic missions. I was truly ecstatic when I first played Ascension. The RPG elements, the different chapters of Astartes (Space Marines) each with their own distinct feel and flavor and not just a different skin, and the atmosphere is great. Absolutely Great.\n\nI bought it on sale but with all the content it is worth the full asking pricein my opinion. I even own the DLC which adds on alot more content and is fairly priced.\n\nIf you are a fan of 40k in general you will like this game. If you like turn based strategies you will find alot of fun and challenge with this.\n\n\n\nTo those new to Space Hulk or 40k in general the game can be difficult at times, the odds are always in the Genestealers favor (as is true to the classic board game). The difficulty can be tweaked i the options though.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that this is nothing like the previous incarnation of Space Hulk on steam. This plays alot better and more like a Video Game then a Board Game. Which is what was intendid by the Devs. There are also alot of tweaks available to enhance the experience.\n\nI definitly recommend this game if you enjoy GW games in general. If you like squad based strategy games and/or the 40k universe you will be pleased with this game. Personally i truly love what they did to create the atmosphere and immersion. It is top notch IMO.\n\nI would warn new players tho to go thru the tutorial, even experienced Space Hulkers since the experience and mechanics are totally different then previous versions of the game. In a good way, this plays more like a Video Game then like the Board Game version, and I am sure you will enjoy it.\n\nEDIT: After playing some more I find that the close combat mechanics are even more brutal then the classic game. Even when you have a Lightning Claw equipped Terminator who in the classic game rolled 2d6+2 vs the Genestealers 3d6 usually did alright, and was useful as a kind of portable 'wall'. In this game they get beat ALOT.\nEDIT2: After playing evenn some more I find I love the atmosphere, really a great job. The only complaint I have is that the structure and architecture of the hulks sometimes are too 'clean'. There should be more dirt and destruction. Also, I would LOVE to see them add all the things from the original tabletop version, like space marine captains (+2 CP, and their nifty auxilary grenade launcher) as well as genestealer hybrids (and the magus). It would add a whole new level of tactics if you had hybrids with lasguns/heavy stubbers/conversion beamers shooting at you. Also the option to use power armored marines who pretty much moved like stealers (6ap base, first 90degree turn is free).They aren t as well armored as terminators and are even weaker in H2H but they are faster and get flamers/bolters/bolt pistols/chainswords/plasma guns/missle launchers/heavy bolters/las cannons and they get grenades (frag/krak/blind). And finally bring in the chaos forces.Add all the older content that you could use/play in the original tabletop like a hulk that a chaos warband is using for its fortress infested with chaos marines/cultists/terminators/daemons and a campaign that has a genestealer cult ie alot of hybrids, a genestealer magus and regular stealers. Make it available as DLC and then you would have the BEST Space Hulk experience released to date. To be honest I think this is already the best thats been produced for PC. I know it can even be better. Just make it already so you can shut up and take my money!!!!!","March 6, 2015","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the turn based apsect to the game, and how they have improved certain elements such as adding the radial interface for selecting which action you want the terminator to make.\nAt first I didn't like the fact the map had been removed, but after a few missions I actually found it better, makes oyu play a little more tactical and gives that eerie feeling of not knowing where you are going or what is coming at you. To aid in this your terminators have a perception range that can detect / sense what is their but you can still only see parts of the map that is actually in their view.\nI also like how they have introduced reloading into the game play which makes you run a little more tactical, the bolter jams have improved as well, so instead of jamming on a certain dice roll they overheat after a lot of firing and eventually jams, this means you have to spend action points to unjam or cool down the weapon before fring.\nThe heavy flamers have also improved giving you 3 different firing modes.\n\nFor a full review visit us at\n\nhttp://www.bsbnetwork.com/home\nDirect review link :\n\nhttp://www.bsbnetwork.com/forum/m/1291049/viewthread/21597615-space-hulk-ascension-review-video/page/1\n\nYou can also watch the video review here\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBichSvYQHA&feature=youtu.be","May 3, 2015","true","93.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It provides really tense moments when you must advance, overwatch and pray that you can survive the close combat. You can't just rush and hope for the best, you need to advance carefully and plan ahead, sometimes take a calculated risk. Just for that the game gets thumbs up from me.\n\n- There's a good variety of weapon loadouts and skills. There's even cosmetic customization.\n\n- The graphics are nice, and the sounds of weapons are great, this game has the best sounding bolters of all 40k games I've played.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- The game is not very clear on its rules. I've played the tutorial, I've read the manual and I still didn't know how a lot of things work, I had to read fan guides. There are different variants of some weapons, but usually their descriptions are very vague (like a flamer which "creates a better use of the fuels, but does not burn as hard"). Some weapons just don't work against certain enemies. Sometimes the missions have you reach specific tiles and do specific things, but it's again very vague what to do and with who. Expect reloading when it turns out you're supposed to reach the tile with a different terminator or face a different direction when you got there and now you have 6 new enemies spawning next to you.\n\n- There's no minimap and the game is very dark, so you often can't easily tell where you can and can't pass. This may be a deliberate design choice, but in the end it just makes the game more tedious because there are ways you can look at the tiles in fog of war. Sometimes it can be hard to tell where you have LoS to  shoot (especially with flamers), but it's usually not too bad.\n\n- The balance is iffy. The game would have you believe there's a ranged and melee strategy, but in reality melee is much worse and works as support for ranged weapons at best. Some weapons are kinda useless when they could've been good with just small balance tweaks and bug fixes. Some stats are much more useful than others and one of them just doesn't do anything for most units.\n\n- There are bugs. Not too many, but better keep multiple saves, I once had the game freeze at the start of my turn in a way that I could select units but not move anywhere, autosave was corrupted too.","June 23, 2015","true","36.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Space Hulk Ascension was a game I was excited about for a long time.  The original Space Hulk game by 'Full Control' was fairly good, and many critics claimed this game did everything better.  I waited on the price for a while, then I picked up the basic copy for about 10 $.\n\nFirst Impressions.  The graphical fidelity has improved a bit and a few more weapons from the Space Marine armory have been added.  The big selling point though for many critics was that the game now contained 'RPG elements', such that a characters can change weapons, gain levels, change outfits, have minor items, and take these minor perk things.  These elements are certainly welcome, but I don't believe they do that much to improve the game.  They just give you options and unfortunately some of those options are very powerful. The combi-flamer is something I personally would have limited more or not included all together.  It's a disgustingly overpowered weapon that you can take on virtually every squadie.\n\nOk, so what else ? The campaigns aren't bad, but they are fairly easy.  They also all start with very easy missions and move to hard missions.  This gets a little redundant because the developers let you play the three campaigns in any order.  I don't know why they wanted the player to pick between three starting campaigns.  It seems stupid, but I guess they did it for creative reasons.  It's just sad watching my superhero team crush the easy missions at the start of another campaign.\n\nThe difficulty level is fairly easy too.  If you beat the original space hulk this game is easier.  I like that they removed random command points, as these could be quite easily abused.\n\nThey also removed multiplayer.  After talking to devs on facebook my feeling is they could never get it working properly and just gave up.  It's sad really.  Space hulk is supposed to be played in the multiplayer mode.\n\nOverall, it's good.  It's more of an upgrade for the original than a new game.  I prefer the original, but I'm a purist.  It also shamelessly plugs a lot of DLC, but I'm not going to be buying any of that.","July 15, 2015","true","20.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It elevades the basic principles of Space Hulk that we love to a whole new level and gives players the posibility to live through so many stories.\n\nBut what it really does is: It utterly destroys you. It gives you experience points, weapon upgrades, special items and abilities all connected to the individual experience of the squad member. And then you watch them die, one by one. Each time someone dies, he will be exchanged for a newbie with no exp and no abilities, no weapon upgrade etc. And then someone else dies due to the newbie. And so on and so on Until you are in some End levels with no veterans at all but you will like it. You will like it how the game plays smash ball with your feelings. And when you feel like it couldn't get any worse, remember in this game there are several different types of tyranids. But hey the bad guys always have all the advantages, what does one more matter? The good guys are screwed anyway.\n\nWell it matters, the Genestealers are ridicilously strong some don't even get down when you hit them. It  is crazy. And still remember you need to keep all members allive to get better gear, so you have a chance to make it through the next mission. Space Hulk has always been a tough thing for the Terminators but Ascension brought it to a new level.\nIt is unforgiving, mercyless and laughs at you, when you fail. And again you will like it. It is that awesome. You can say what you like. It is a great game.\n\nYou get three unique story lines and three more with the dlc (may be more, don't know the newest dlc). All chapters have unique abilities and equipment. The new rogue mode seems great too.\n\nI love it and I hope they can make more DLC for it.\nJust give us more missions, more diverse enemies and playable characters.

Don't get me wrong...the weapon/personal upgrading system in the first two Dead Space games, for example, was fantastic.  But did we really need the "unique customisation" of Dead Space 3's alleged "crafting" system?  Well I for one certainly didn't, as clearly evidenced by the fact that I simply settled on a couple of guns which seemed to work okay for me, before unceremoniously breaking down the other ones I'd made for spare parts.  Which brings us to the rather ambivalent business of comparing the first Space Hulk to the "new 'n' improved" Space Hulk: Ascension.  Is it really all it would crack itself up to be?\n\nWell, to put it simply:  That depends on who you are.  If you're a Skyrim kinda person, who feels that buying houses and finding wives to move into them adds "depth" to your hack-'n'-slay fantasy gaming experience, then Ascension is probably the turn-based game for you.  And even as a big fan of the first Space Hulk game from Full Control Studios, I'll happily concede that there's some definite improvements in evidence here.  Not having to put your space marines on "overwatch" round after round, if you're choosing to just keep them that way, is a welcome relief.  Being able to perform other actions such as reloading or cooling down your weapon AFTER putting yourself on said "overwatch" is a further relief.  But what happened to the "undo" button from the earlier game, for those innumerable occasions when you "accidentally" turn a marine around 180 degrees, wasting all your Action Points in so doing, and effectively turning your back on the enemy and thereby all but ensuring said marine's certain death?  And sure, the graphics are definitely "nicer" and "moodier"...but for all that newfound darkness, how the ♥♥♥♥ are we supposed to see the vent from which the genestealers are about to start spilling onto us, swiftly followed by the spilling of our pure space-crusader blood?\n\nIn short, for almost every improvement this game arguably makes over the original, it seems to balance that out by taking something away.  I won't bother going into each and every pro and con in this regard...that would be pointless and pedantic.  So what is, in my opinion, the MAIN thing which this new game giveth, versus the MAIN thing it taketh away?  Ironically, for a rabid "horror" fan like myself, my number one criticism is that what this game undeniably adds in ATMOSPHERE, it takes away from in STRATEGY.  And given that this is, first and foremost, supposed to be a "turn-based strategy game", that's a minor problem, don'tcha think?  Let me put it another way...Ascension is arguably the more "suspenseful" of the two games - you literally DON'T know what's coming around the corner, and it's arguably "scarier" for all that - but gone are the days when you can feel the satisfaction of a hard-won victory based on careful trial-and-error and/or strategic forethought alone.  The first Space Hulk, in my opinion, struck a (mostly) excellent balance between strategy and just-plain-dumb-luck, while Ascension seems to have tipped the balance slightly in favour of the latter.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me most about the earlier game was the fact that there were some missions where you basically had to pre-plan almost every move, from the meticulous deployment of your troops onwards, in order to succeed.  How did you accomplish this feat?  Well, with a MAP!  A map which showed you every single square of the area your mission takes place in, and every possible place that the dreaded genestealers could pop out from.  So you would plan your route THROUGH said map accordingly (and then, to some degree, still hope for the best)!  Ascension dispenses with this entirely, in preference of only being able to see a handful of feet in front of you.  More SUSPENSE, yes, but LESS STRATEGY.  And more "cheap deaths", to use the modern gaming vernacular.\n\nWhatever you do, don't take this as an indication that I don't LIKE this new Space Hulk game.  I do.  A LOT.  But I'm not sure I like it quite as much as the first one, and if I was to recommend one of them and one of them alone...well, like I say above, that probably depends on what "kind" of gamer you are.  I honestly would never have thought of myself as being a strategy-biased gamer - hell, I like a lot of "dumb" ♥♥♥♥ - but in this particular case, my money's on the earlier game, if only just.  But if you've got money to burn, or know of the existence of a thing called "Steam sales"...why not try BOTH?!  Then you can tell me what a ♥♥♥♥wit and a philistine I am for not seeing the obvious superiority of Ascension over its predecessor.  You can tell me how board games and video games AREN'T the same thing, and shouldn't be treated as such, and how endless choices for individual customisation of games are not only the way of the future, but indeed should be how we invariably play games RIGHT NOW.  Maybe I still won't BELIEVE you...but it'll hurt a hell of a lot less than bashing your head against a brick wall.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS One definite NON-improvement is how HARD the tutorial in this game is to get your head around.  It took me THREE attempts to get through the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  Sigh...maybe I just wanted an "improved" version of the original, and not so much of a "new" one...if it ain't that broke, don't fix it, etc etc...)","June 17, 2015","true","123.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

While it has been adapted to a more computergame-like version over the original Space Hulk, it still has many things in common with it's board game counterpart. It's slow paced, and fairly unforgiving of mistakes. RNG will screw you over occasionally.\n\nAll in all I would reccomend this game. It is a fairly unique take on the turn-based combat genre. I tend to do a single mission when I have an hour to spare, but long sessions tend to become rather tedious. The narrow corridors doesn't leave a lot of room for fancy manouvers, it is more a game of anticipating the enemy's actions and setting up a defense, move up a couple of steps, and set up a new defence. There is very little variation in the enemy types, and many maps feel very alike, but in the end, the tactical gameplay makes it worthwhile. Definatly one of the best games set in the 40k universe, and very faithful to that universe.\n\nThere are a couple of campaigns, but not much to speak of when it comes to story. Basically they all boil down to "Go in, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, glory to the emperor", but it's not a game you play for narrative either. There is some customisation and some RPG elements with stats and equipment, but that part is fairly shallow.\n\nIt's a challanging game. A single mistake can kill you, which adds to the game, however it also forces you to play very conservativly, and avoid chances whenever you can. The difficulty is a positive in my book, but it is also what can make prolonged gaming sessions boring, there are very few variations in tactics that are viable.","September 4, 2015","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Certainly an evolution on the original Space Hulk game from Full Control (which was a 1:1 conversion of the board game), but in other ways a step backwards. At least for me.\n\nAll the extra stats and skills, made it too complicated as far as I was concerned and although for some this meant extra tactical depth, for me this translated into fiddly micromanagement (one of my biggest gaming turn offs). The extra layers of Space Marine attributes, unlocking of new weapons, new Genestealer types and less dice rolls all seem to make sense for a changed and updated version of the game, and I know for a lot of people Ascension is the Space Hulk game that should have been made in the first place.\n\nBut it just never rang true for me, throughout my 9 hours of play, I read guides, I tried the different Space MArine chapters and campaigns (even buying additional DLC) but eventually I realised I just wasn't enjoying it. I was trying to make the game live up to what I wanted rather than what it was and in truth I think the original Space Hulk from Full Control is more for me. I prefer the strong risk to reward mechanics of the original version and I enjoy the bad dice rolls that can cause chaos in a well laid plan. That version is simple and straight forward and when it comes to this game, less is more.\n\nOn a side note, SH:A also has some serious performance issues, which despite upgrading my graphics card to a GTX 970, changing to an SSD, doubling the RAM to 16gb and upgrading to a top of the line processor (i7 4790k) throughout the life of owning this game, it made a blind bit of difference. Even playing on the lowest possible settings would cause the game to bog down to sub 30fps eventually... and perhaps another example of were less (in this case graphical bells and whistles) is more. That said, it could just be this build of the Unity engine, a few other Unity games have had similar bizarre performance issues on my computer, albeit nowhere near as bad as this.\n\nIf you can look past the crippling performance concerns this is certainly a good game for some, but for me, not the "Ascension" I was looking for.","February 5","false","9.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Lose 90% of your units to enemies who just crawled out of the walls when you're one turn away from victory.\n\nHave fun doing the whole mission over again because you forgot to save after every single turn.\n(Get stabbed in the back by autosave, scrub.)\n\nEnemies in the vents you say? Good luck figuring out what's a vent or a random black spot in the map, or even seeing where you're going for that matter.\n\nEnjoy the horrible ambient noise that never stops and can't be muted without turning off sound completely.\n\nNew percentage system totally works better than the dice roll system. I mean a 50% random chance to hit, totally nothing like rolling a random D6...\n\nOh and completely whiffing every single melee attack, 90% percent chance to hit? Nope, get rekt ten times in a row, woo for more strategy being left completely up to luck.\n\nIn all seriousness though, this really isn't much of an improvement over the last game. Still ridiculously time consuming, still tedious, still annoying when you try to think things out and have them ruined by luck time and time again, still buggy, and there's still a number of the more annoying mechanics in the game like spending AP just to turn. Progression is also extremely slow, and while it's nice to have progression and variety in equipment, it's still lacking. The same goes for low customization options. (And why no love for Deathwing terminators or Grey Knights terminators?)\n\nSo it's great that overheating is now better, and you can get more AP points, but I don't think that redeems this game. It's simply not a 'fun' experience. Most of my time with the game has been spent sighing and grumbling profanities after having to deal with technical issues, or annoying things like having three terminators all killed by the same genestealer after they whiff all their attacks. The amount of effort I put in versus the reward I get simply doesn't add up.","November 14, 2014","false","20.6"," 76 of 151 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","76","151","3","3"

Your units don't have health bars; one hit and they're standing at the Emperor's side. That means the missions often leave you on the edge of your seat. Many times have my units made a last minute mad-dash for the extraction, with dozens of Tyrinads snapping at their heels. I've had several battles in which only my squad's sergent was the last man standing, and the hardwork I'd spend on the remainder of the squad now laying in a bloody ruin amongst the corpses of uncountable xenos.\n\nAt its basics the game has you move a unit, decide to directly engage, and/or enter an 'overwatch' and automaticly engage any approaching enemies. You've got a heavy weapon unit which adds a very different dynamic depending on their loadout. Aditionally psykers add a continuned level of depth. However, at its greatest depth the game has a lot of luck, hoping, and frustration.\n\nFor me, this reminds me how much I crave a Dawn of War 3 more than anything else.\n\nWorth buying on sale with extra DLC. 10-20hrs of enjoyable gameplay.","July 13, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have 6 campaigns, with all the DLC, with an average of 18 story missions and 20 side missions. You have the Ultramarines, Blood Angels, Space Wolves, Imperial Fist, Salamanders, Dark Angels, Novamarines, Crimson Fists, Angels of Retribution, and Flesh Tearers to choose from for your Space Marine Chapter. Each chapter has different pros and cons to them, like the Ultramarines get a bonus to hit with ranged weapons while suffering a penalty to melee. Salamanders have the unique ability to field 2 heavy weapon terminators in a single squad. Unlike the prior version of Space Hulk by Full Control, you can customize your terminators loadout, skills, appearance, attributes, and powers/equipment plus you have two squads instead of one.\n\nI'm in the middle of the Sin of Damnation campaign and it's really excellent. The mission difficulty ramps after you manage to get further in the interior of the hulk. Each of the missions takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to complete, so you'll get a long play time with six campaigns. You start out with normal difficulty missions then the next step is hard. Speaking of difficulty, you have the choice to play the game on Easy, Normal, Hard, and Custom. Easy and Custom difficulties have achievements disabled. Normal grants bonuses to Action Points and to hit, plus replacement terminators are the same level as the ones that died during a mission. Hard difficulty doesn't grant the bonuses and dead terminators are replaced with level 1. Custom difficulty allows you to customize all the parameters, so you can define how you want to play exactly.\n\nThe terminators can gain experience and levels. The levels are broken down into three ranks with a maximum level of 10. You can spend points in their attributes to make them better shots, melee fighters, or increase their action points. You also unlock better weapons and skills as you level them. Your heavy weapon terminators start with flamers, but can eventually get plasma cannons, also if you play the Ultramarines you can give them cyclone missile launchers. Sergeants eventually get access to combi weapons like combi-bolter and plasma along with power swords. Sergeants also grant a bonus of +1 AP, plus a bonus to hit, for any of your units in their command range and get access to command vox that further increases the range. All terminators will unlock a maximum of three skills that will dramatically improve their effectiveness.\n\nEach squad has a commander with the basic being a Sergeant. Sergeants are really good at improving the effectiveness of all your terminators, regardless of squads, as long as they are within the Sergeant's command range. Librarians are excellent choices for leading squads with their psyker abilities able to turn the tide of battle in your favor with abilities like Psychic Storm Area. Librarians get a certain amount of focus points that can be upgraded with the Willpower attribute and using a librarian skill. If you run low or out of Focus Points you can set the Librarian to meditate to regain points. A new squad commander unit was released with the Dark Angels DLC and that's the Apothecary. In my opinion, he's the worst of the squad leaders and his points for special actions do not regenerate. He has a set amount and once they are used up then they are gone. He does grant bonuses to the squad's characteristics, but in the long run he's not worth it in comparison to a Sergeant or a Librarian.\n\nOne of the biggest changes SH:A makes from SH is that it's no longer using all of the GW rules. Full Control are using their own rules when it comes to to hit and defense against genestealers. Toughness combined with Weapon Skill actually matters now and can have your terminator survive a close combat with a genestealer. They also removed the finnicky die rolls and replaced them with a percentile based system. This change dramatically improves the terminators ability to survive by making things easier to kill. The final big change is that Full Control put in Brood Lords and they run in packs of 5-6. They require 3-4 hits to kill and are a big threat compared to genestealers.\n\nMy rating: 8/10","November 2, 2015","true","81.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The DLC packs were adding more chapters and campaigns, so it felt better and better... Right until the Dark Angels DLC release.\n\nIt added a ton of game-breaking bugs, half of weapons stopped functioning properly, some missions couldn't be completed , etc. There always were some bugs, yes, but devs kept fixing them rather qucikly. Last patch (August 2015) didn't fix all of them, at least I couldn't finish a certain level with it.\n\nThe dev team is currently in a pretty bad shape, so I don't expect any more patches, which means the game most likely will stay in a broken condition.

I played the board game when 'Enter Sandman' was number one on the charts and this clumsy 'interpretation' fails everything that made Space Hulk enjoyable.\nThe 'Fog of War' covering the map means I can't plot a course to the objective and have to spend valuable points exploring. It's not thematic because Nerdly McTermitator has always been back on the ship scanning the layout.\nGenestealers pop out of thin air because the Fog of Stupidity obscures deployment points, which makes it impossible to count squares. This means each squad moves forward two steps at a time while the point guy has to stay on Overwatch. It's like scouting out a nightclub just in case you catch Herpes just by walking through the door.\nTo make things worse, Storm Bolters have limited ammo and overheat on normal fire. New firing options are nice, except when there's only a 14% chance of hitting the dude close enough to lick your nose.\nDid I mention there are no command points to interrupt the Genestealer's turn ?\nNow I need to reel back and harpoon my hatred into the Autosave feature. In a turn based game I expect to Save immediately before making a stupid decision. But no, I can't create a unique Save slot and Autosave triggers at the worst possible time, like the second after you say your wife's ♥♥♥ is getting a little big. DAMMIT.\nOfferring to level up individual characters is the ultimate cocktease because I want everyone to survive. Evacuate 'at least three' Terminators to win the mission, except the mission doesn't end because heroic T4 covering the rear (in between reloads and overheats) can't get out. That Marine just killed more carnts than Malaria, has earned enough points to  become Christ's therapist and I have to sacrifice him just to end the mission ?\nThe interface is clumsy, the play is ratsheet, this game is a gigantic pile of crap.\nSound is great, art is mostly great except map portions are highlighted without any good reason. Oh, you want me to advance two squares at a time toward that glowing thing while Stealers pop out of nowhere and my gun jams whenever I take a breath ? Sure ! Stupid. So, so stupid.\nI want to love this game so much but it's complete sheet.

First of all, this game has a great deal of potential - in principle the core mechanics and design are good. However - The game is (at least on my rig) hideously bugged.\n\nFirstly and (most frustratingly) the percentile mechanics (Chance to Hit et. al.) are woefully inaccurate. When my CtH is 87% I expect (funnily enough)  nearly 9 out of ten times to hit my target. This is very much NOT THE CASE. Now I could write off getting less than that percentile as my being unlucky but  not to the frankly ridiculous levels this game has perpetually demonstrated. You will notice that I have clocked a goodly number of hours on this game - let me assure you that a large chunk of that time has been WASTED in reloading due to utterly preposterous CtH results (and once because I walked away from the game in disgust and forgot to turn my PC off)- not because I have been enjoying myself. NEVER has a game frustrated me as much as this one. Now, just to be clear, I am quite patient when it comes to games so long as I am not being 'cheesed' by them. Dark Souls is without doubt one of my favourite games. But Ascension is a total stinking bishop of a game.\n\nSecondly, there are numerous missions where heavy weapons (esp. The Assault Cannon) will not work for no reason whatsoever. Specifically several of the missions in the Blood Angels campaign (last stand & defend).\n\nThirdly, the animations for all the terminators bugs out when ever you get in close proximity to a genestealer that turns from a 'blip' into a visual target. When I say bugs out I mean the terminator dissapears completely for a second or two only to re-appear in a completely different area to where he was / where you told him to move.\n\nFourthly, skills such as Acid Proof and Fire Proof DO NOT WORK!!! The number of times I've had to reload missions from the start just because a key squad member has died from acid or fire exposure WHEN THEY HAVE HAD THE SKILLS EQUIPPED is beyond laughable.\n\nI could go on but it is simply too much effort for this game. All I can say is if you want to play a great turn based tactical combat game go and buy X-Com: Enemy Unknown. It is all together a better game; more challenging without resorting to cheese-ing you. Far less buggy and better performing on a medium spec rig. Full Control - sort it out. Please. You have a great license and are letting it down with silly bugs. Until then I'll stick to the boardgame.","January 13, 2015","false","68.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

It does so by mainly by adding more content, options and a progression system for your squad members (those that survive, that is).\n\nSome things have certainly improved, but the gameplay experience overall suffers compared to the 2013 Space Hulk as a result of some truly bizarre design decisions. For one, perhaps in an attempt to add ambience, the gameplay areas are far too dark. Not just gloomy dark in the ambient way of 2013 Space Hulk, but dark in that annoying way that makes it hard to see what's going on. Is that a wall? Or a door?\n\nThe movement system has also been changed for the worse. In 2013 Space Hulk, you simply clicked the square you wanted your Terminator to move to, then dragged a direction for facing and let go. In Ascension, left-clicking and dragging only sets his route. You need to click a second time to confirm the move. I assume the reason is to make it harder to misclick, but unfortunately it is now easier as it's the same mouse button that you use to confirm the movement. This means that if you accidently move the mouse a little as you click to confirm, you may accidently draw a new route and end up with a Terminator facing the wrong way. Perhaps if they had made right-clicking the confirmation method, it would have worked.\n\nThe biggest issue the game suffers from is that the player isn't shown the enemy's movements. Thinking back hard on all the turn-based games I've ever played, I have to say this is probably a first for me. And it very quickly becomes clear why, as you frantically pan around the map as you hear the sounds of battle, hoping to find out where you're being attacked before the action is over. And once your turn begins, you again end up searching around the map to see where any new enemies might have appeared within your Terminators' scan range. And with the new ammo system, cycling through each Terminator to see if they spent ammo off-screen while you were looking somewhere else, is also a good idea, lest they run out when you least expect it. These manual game state updates get frustrating very quickly, and the choice is doubly mysterious given how well the game showed you what was going on in 2013 Space Hulk.\n\nSome of the missions also suffer from similar design flaws as some of 2013 Space Hulk's missions. In Space Hulk, the gameplay only really works when the Terminators have to push forward against time. The endless spawning of Genestealers being the clock as the Terminators methodically make their way towards their objective. When missions turn into "stand here and kill X" amount of Genestealers, the gameplay falls apart as there's no interesting tactical decisions to make once all your Terminators are in place and on Overwatch.\n\nGone is the map, which used to give you a quick overview of the situation in 2013 Space Hulk. I think they wanted to add an element of exploration to the game, but they could have at least provided an automap that filled out as you explored the level. Instead, they took the lazy route and just removed the map altogether.\n\nOn the positive sides, the game does look better (when you can see it), and the animations of Terminators and Genestealers have improved considerably. The soundscape is also better, and it's nice to have more options and some continuity with your troops.\n\nBut overall, I think Ascension is a case of one step forward and two steps back. While I liked the 2013 Space Hulk and will recommend it to fans of turn-based tactical combat, I'm afraid I cannot say the same for the sequel. The biggest deal breaker being the game's refusal to show you what's going on.","March 15, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The one shot deaths of squad members you have patiently built up soon become tiresome and the lack of variety in...well EVERYTHING...becomes clearly apparent. There are only a few different kinds of enemy, the maps vary only in size consisting mainly of shuffling your guys through narrow corridors and hoping that you spotted the air vents. Character progression is boring and limited, there are no item drops as changing loadout simply consists of upgrading to better equipment when you have levelled up enough. Plot and story is nothing more than tack-on text at the start of missions. And the fairly expensive DLC's do very little to change anything. Despite buying the full package including DLCs at 50-75% discount I STILL felt the need to request a refund. Blindly hoping that I had positioned my squad in such a way that they could kill pop-out mobs with Overlook again and again was a very dull excercise indeed.","June 28, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You end up deactivating features to make it run properly, thus making it lacking or ugly.\nThen, it appears to be really slow, gameplay-wise. I'm the cautious type, so I try-harded. I ended up doing more reloading and cooling off weapons than real action. After 30 min, I had no fear anymore, and was just hoping to have a random spawn surprising me. Of course, I wasn't much far in the game so I guess it was deliberately easy on me.\nThe customisation part is quite poor too, alas, with less possible face then terminators available, and a weapon bugged. The stat/skill system made me feel no progression.\n\nI may have had a bad experience not faithful to the entire game, but considering the dev team is not operating anymore, I took advantage of the new refund system. I feel I should go back to X-COM: older and way better. Too bad for the W40K flavour. I'm sad.","June 28, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Be astounded as your terminators spend all of their action points trying to turn around and move one tile; what an eventful turn!

The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of performance issues with constantly low fps (regardless of the graphics settings) and will clog up your virtual memory after just a couple of rounds ( I mean i have 16 gig DD3 RAM and still it becomes unplayable after a few of turns). The game itself is frustratingly hard, but not in a nice an challenging way - the low visibility makes it nearly impossible to spot vents etc. so 50% of the time you die from  sneakattacks out of invisible vents. The genestealers have been nerved down so much that the game just has to throw literally hundreds of them in your face, which ends in a giant never ending mexican stand off  rather than a strategic RPG (you can only progress one or two tiles at a time in order to fend off the gÄyzillion genestealers that spawn every round). The bugs turn this allready horrible experience into a nightmare. This title has so many unnecessary bugs that just show, how poorly the game has been tested prior to release. Propably the  most annoying I encountered so far was in one of those "you have to extract at least 3 Terminators" levels. I finished mission goal 1 and started extracting and after my third marine has teleported out, the game gave me the "mission failed" screen - so i reloaded some earlier checkpoints, redid it and BAM!

The scoring is suberb, effortlessly capturing the essence of dark, warp filled halls teeming with vile xenos. It will also kick you in the teeth, even on lower difficulty settings. The 'stealers have a propensity to swarm and even the most formidable Astartes can be overrun.\nNow that I'm done with that bit...the game itself is actualy quite solid. You are forced to lock down strongpoints, cool your weapon systems, and monitor the health of your squad...just like in various other combative turn based games of yore. The in helmet camera is a nice touch as is the leveling system. All in all a very fun and enjoyable way to kill a few hours smiting the the foes of the Emperor.","July 8, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
