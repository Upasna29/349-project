Instead of just trashing the unclear directions, bad grammar, elevator music, and general pointless gameplay of the Forbidden Planet; let me give you a list of 18 "better" uses of your time in space, fellow Star Voyager!\n\n18. Anomaly Series :  Really old school strategy with great artwork\n\n17. Energy Balance:   Math puzzler in Space with great art\n\n16. Asteroid Bounty Hunter:    Space Shooter with Beautiful comic book art & good narrative\n\n15. Apollo 4X:   A very good 4X space game\n\n14. Luna’s Wandering Stars:   A planetary physics game\n\n13. Habitat:    Sandbox Space Ship Builder using space junk for crafting in actual outer space\n\n12. Universe Sandbox 2’ed:   A Strictly Simulation that lets you imagine “What if?” Great graphics & Art!\n\n11. Kerbal Space Program:    Simulates an actual Space Race for all ‘Kerbal-Kind’ to visit the planets\n\n10. Spore:   Strictly for building and designing aliens and alien ships (No action/ just art) Also has action gameplay for evolving creatures.\n\n9. Sid Meier’s Starships:    A 4X game that is at the top of it’s game… using a fleet to conquer the universe\n\n8. Rymdresa:    Space story in poetry with awesome graphics & art\n\n7. Rymdkapsel:   Minimalistic Strategy game that will make you forget why we ever wanted more graphics\n\n6. Planetbase:   Build & manage a planetary base, with mini colonists to order around & keep alive\n\n5. Empyrion – Galactic Survival:    Survival Sandbox builder with planet to planet travel & base defense\n\n4. Opus: The Day We Found Earth:   A Mystery Adventure with excellent narrative & star exploration\n\n3. Offworld Trading Company:   An Economic Base Builder Simulation with multiple paths to Corporate Success\n\n2. Stellaris:   Grand Strategy meets 4X in a beautiful new space exploration simulation\n\n1. XCOM: Enemy Unknown/ Enemy Within / XCOM 2:   The Strategy & 3rdPerson Shooter that lets you rid Earth of aliens with a highly personalizable squad\n\nHeed the warning & stay away from the ‘forbidden planet.’ You only have so many years on this planet to play video games. Of course, if you just want to spend your money on this to get the cutesy background art… there it is.","May 30","false","3.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","14","14","6","0"

The only strategy that works is to reinforce a single planet, and hope that teh other planets don't get hit. If you try and protect other planets, then the game becomes impossible as resources are spread too thinly.\n\nThe developer needs to make the resource acquisition rate higher, that way it's possible to defend more than one planet.\n\nIn summary you can win at this game, but it has little to do with strategy.","May 2","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
