However the developers are too greedy and as a result ruined the experience.\n\nWhen I say 'sparks', it means bought currency.\n\nTwo major gripe I have with this game:\n\nInventory Slots\nThe one biggest problem I have is inventory slots.  You start off with a tiny inventory which requires 'Sparks' to unlock FIVE slots.  Then each additional unlock, the amount of spark needed to unlock an additional five slots becomes higher.\n\nCurrently I have 40 slots in my inventory and to unlock the next 5 slots, it will cost me $4+.  Even parts you have equipped on robots count towards inventory so this gets filled up very quickly.\n\nRobot Slots\nSo you unlock a robot slot with sparks.  But wait, they limit your inventory so you can't build anything with your new robot slot!  Thus making you spend on inventory in addition to buying new robot slots.\n\nCrates\nYou would think the game had enough money sink?  No.  When you win matches you have a chance to get crates.  To stand a chance to open these crates you will have to use sparks otherwise the picklocking tool has 0.1% ~ 5% chance depending on crate level.  I have no problem with this in games but when you add in the other two money sinks then this makes the game have a bad f2p model.\n\nConclusion\nStay away from this game unless the developer gets their head out of the gutter.  Too many money sink.  With the inventory limit it literally forces you to use sparks to progress.  Yes you do get sparks in-game but no where near enough to make the game enjoyable on being free.  I have no problem spending cash on a f2p game but there are too many money sink that are not really optional.\n\n\n","September 28, 2014","false","36.9"," 451 of 492 people (92%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","92","451","492","20","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/293540/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","A concise review...of course, mileage may vary (different people have different experiences, values, and expectations which will result in different opinions):\n\nPROS:\nGreat art style\nGood combat mechanic\nGood bot custom creation system (except for upgrading parts, which is one of the worst in any game I've played, see below).\nDevs are active in the communityCONS:\nMost importantly right now: In-game purchases of boosts (credits for example) DO NOT WORK. The devs are aware of this complaint but insisted it is working fine. I have evidence to the contrary (several screenshots during and after the 24hr boost, there is no difference in credit gain whatsoever. It was a wasted purchase.\nTutorial is severely lacking (lobby chat has a never ending supply of new players asking what to do, how to build a robot, etc.)\nLimited to small skirmishes of 5 v 5 (some may not necessarily mind this, but for others, it just feels to small, too "quick."\nIt's very common for players to go AFK because they get rewarded either way (even if it is a loss). This creates a serious imbalance in the small 5 v 5 match.\nVERY limited inventory space (devs want you to buy more), which means there isn't much room for customizing or building bots. Creativity is discouraged.\nThe price increases (it isn't static) if you want to increase your inventory. Again, another discouragment of creativity.\nPlayer is nickel-and-dimed for almost everything imaginable in game (customization, extra space, being able to form a squad/group with more than 2 players), etc.\nChat Lobby has no filter, there is no way to mute/ignore/ban players (people spam porn sites and obscenities quite a bit, again, screenshots taken).\nUpgrading your parts is expensive, yet adds very little value. Almost all parts gain minimal durability and durability only. Each part already has numerous properties, but none (w/ exception of damage for just a few weapons) ever get upgraded. It's absurd IMO as a higher tier part ought to have a relevant increase in quality...in Guns and Robots however, it does not.\nYou get random bonus chests at time, but have to pay a lot of sparks (purchased with real cash) to unlock them.\nSummary\n\nThe game is worth playing as long as the player understands that this is a game in which the player is expected to spend quite a bit of money to enjoy the full experience. However, spending money in-game (vs DLC Starter Pack) just doesn't work (for me) and the devs don't seem to be concerned with it.\n\nIt's a game I'd play casually, for kicks, but would not recommend to friends and definitely would not recommend spending money on, a lesson learned the hard way after purchasing the Starter Pack and spending sparks in-game. It's a cash grab through and through.","August 6, 2014","false","16.9"," 334 of 393 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","334","393","8","21"

This game has tiers, like in Robocraft, so you aren't supposed to be put with people who will annihilate you in one shot. However, I was put in a match with one of the top 10 players on the enemy team. They one-shotted me, and later, two others, on my team. To put this into context, destroying an enemy robot in this game can take over 10 seconds of non-stop fire.\n\n2. As I mentioned before, this game has tiers. But you can only 'tier-up' when you upgrade your robot's parts. However, the only thing upgrading parts does is give them more health, except weapons, which get more damage as well as more health. This means, in higher tiers, your robot will have more health and do more damage. This also means every other robot will have more health and do more damage. What's the point? Am I missing something?\n\n3. There is no progression in this game. Yes, you can upgrade your robot, but as I said, the whole 'upgrading' system is linear and useless.\n\n4. There are very few people playing it. Getting into a match doesn't usually take any more than about 30 seconds, but being put into matches with, quite often, the same people, who are quite often, using the same robot each time, can get repetitive, especially when they use over-powered weapons.\n\n5. You will occasionally get a box as a reward after completing a match. You can open these boxes with credits, the in-game currency, with a success rate as low as 0.25%, upto 5%. Failed attempts will not destroy the box, only the tools. You can alternatively pay real money in exchange for 'sparks', which you can use to open the box first time. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that these crates can give unique robot parts. That's right, people who pay real money get an advantage over those who don't.\n\nPersonally, I have enjoyed this game so far, but I simply cannot recommend it to anyone.","December 16, 2014","false","40.7"," 152 of 179 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","152","179","3","1"

The matches are ENTIRELY too short. I'm talking 30 seconds to 3 mins max. It takes longer to queue and ready up for a match than it does to actually play it.\n\n2. No sufficient tutorial. I ended up wasting a lot of currency because the game did not explain what to do to a reasonable degree. I'm still not sure how to take components out of the items.\n\n3. There is NO respawn, which in turn is part of the reason the matches are so short. Everyone dies in 3 minutes or less, game over. You didn't get to play so now you're back to waiting to queue for another match which will be the same exact boring match where you either die quickly and don't play, or the match ends up ending a few minutes later.\n\n4. There's not as much customization as the game lets on. Some things clearly work better than others, and many of the options are redundant. You'll never have a need to mix and match so many things, you'll just want to go with what works better than other things, and it will become obvious quickly.","August 9, 2014","false","6.9"," 163 of 205 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","163","205","8","3"

The concept is great but its anything from playable.\nThe three mayor concerns with this game is.\n\nA. There is no matchmaking to speak off. The game tries to put up equal teams but it cant so every game is stacked and one team ALWAYS rampages the other.\nB. The game is mostly played (as most f2p) by east block players and Russians on their dial up modems with even ISP on dial up modems. Result a good base of players warps all over the map and abuses this by using high speed bots.\nC. There are hundreds and hundreds of bots to combine out of several different parts, alas there are only about 3 viable concepts that everyone uses. So youlle constantly face the same bots and the only way to beat them is using the same bots and getting the drop on them.\n\nIt is however free to play so I wouldnt say not to give it a try. The microtransaction system is extremely fair and well implemented (big thumbs up there). Compiling your bot out of different components however is rather puzzling as there are quite a few stats and they arent very easy to compare (also see remark C).\nAnother big thumbs up is map design.

Let me explain why:\n\nIt uses the World of Tanks method of resolving objectives. If you blow up, that's it, you're out. If everyone on one side dies, the game is over. The objective rarely is considered in most matches because of this. It also uses the idea of disarming an opponent based on where you shoot. Shoot the feet, you slow the opponent. Shot the arms, you disarm it. Shoot the head, you impair it's vision.\n\nIt's like Loadout in that, in order to succeed, you have to experiment with your build. There are a sea of different parts, whcih are used to make modules, the components of your robot. Each robot is made up of one chassis, one engine, one body type, one battery (or two), one head unit, and 2 to 4 weopons and weapon frames. This means you can tailer the bot to match your strategy as much as you wish. To make this more absurd, you can equipt up to two devices, which allow you to pull the game to your advantage.\n\nAlso like loadout, you ave to buy every part. Unlike Loadout, however, there is a limited inventory for each part, and each part can only be used on one robot at a time, so you are encouraged to just have one, with a few spare pieces to mmix it up a few times.\n\nIn short, it's intense, it's annoying, but once you deal with it, it can be a really good game. Or a really bad one.","August 8, 2014","true","7.2"," 88 of 133 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","88","133","4","1"

When you can actually play.  Several issues make this difficult, some part of the game and others the players.\n\nThere are three game types, though two are rather similar.  Capture the Batteries and Plant the Bomb are games designed on moving something from your base to theirs or the other way around.  Capture the Batteries has you go to their base to claim one of two batteries to return it to your base.  Only one battery spawns at a time and capturing has no regard for where your own are.  Plant the Bomb has you take a bomb to their base and put it on their totem.  You defend the bomb until it explodes or you go back to your own base to disarm a bomb if they have planted.\n\nI would have no issues with these two types of games if nearly every one I've played didn't end up being about the third game type.  For those types of games there should be respawns and it shouldn't end until those objectives are finished.  Instead it comes down to who can blow away the other team first.  Destroy the other Team is the third type of game and it's how all games seem to play out.\n\nWhy would we bother doing complicated battery and bomb objectives if destroying them works just as well?  Beyond that issue is the reward system for playing games.  You get the same random rewards for winning or losing.  I've often gotten better rewards from losing a match then winning.\n\nThere is a repair and ammo replacement system that costs in-game currency.  This would actually be a concern if each match didn't make enough coin to pay for both every time.  I don't see a point to these systems if even a lost game gives enough money to deal with it.  All this does is govern your profit from a game, which is rather random anyway.\n\nThe queue system is another problem.  I can no longer count how often I have been put in a group with or matched against someone far below my robot level.  A one or two level difference isn't really enough to notice but when I'm 5 and they are 1 it becomes the difference of me shooting once or ten times for a kill.  It seems to be a practice for level 4 and 5 robots to group with level 1 robots, forcing them into matches one or the other shouldn't be in.\n\nIn match group balancing seems to be firstly priortized by robot level (which is good) and secondly by personal level (which is bad).  This comes up often.  If four level 5 robots are queued then it makes a match of 2v2.  It will then use the levels of the people to balance the teams.  Personal levels determine, without spending the real money sparks on, what parts you can upgrade to which point.  So in that instance it makes sense.  But then we get a match with four level 5 robots and two level 3 robots.  It will make a full group of the level 5 robots and put the others together because the personal levels of the level 3 robots is higher then some of the level 5 robots.  With some variation of individual part levels, this puts a heavy toll on the lower level group.\n\nUpgrading parts changes your robot level.  A level 1 robot will generally have all level 1 parts.  You can have higher level parts and still be a lower level if you don't upgrade some parts or even take off some.  So I can go into a level 1 match with my mostly all level 6 parts simply by dropping most of my guns and special ability parts.  Even at one gun of two or of four, that level difference is enough to blow them away.  This seems to be a common problem with leveled games and I don't really have a fix for it.\n\nThe speed at which I upgraded didn't feel that slow or fast.  I played matches to get upgrade parts and money and then the parts would upgrade while I was sleeping.  Building new parts and the robot as a whole seemed easy enough.  You have a build platform that you simply start slapping parts on.  There is a blue transparent version of the part to help guide you.  You can even upgrade a part as you are using it, leaving less need to stop playing just to wait on one part.\n\nYou start with a basic robot and a slot for a second robot.  Additional slots can be purchased with Sparks (real money).  Now while you have room for two robots you do not start with enough inventory space for all those parts.  You can build one robot, the one you start with, and that's it.  Buying more inventory room starts at a simple 10 sparks, somthing that you start with.  This gives you enough space to either upgrade your robot or get a few off parts.  The next space buy is 85.  After that it's 160(unsure of the exact number only that it was way up there).  For a game that talks so much on customizability this is horrible.\n\nIn it's entirety I would not conclude that this game is pay to win.  However, some elements are in the game that certainly make it headed in that direction.  The better crates you can get either with Sparks or by chance after matches contain arm peices that allow two or three weapons to be attached to them.  It is horribly expensive to get these as it is only a chance to get them per crate, but it is still there.  They can certainly claim it is possible to open these crates with the coin bought crate openers but at a 0.01% chance to open there is little point.\n\nFrom what I could find the only thing that is ONLY purchasable by Sparks are the paint colors used to customize your robot.  You start with a few blah colors and can buy more at outragous prices PER color.\n\nI wouldn't say this game is unplayable by any means.  But there is a lot that needs to be done to make it a fun and stable environment.  Everything from the basic robot construction to Spark purchases needs to be reworked to allow for a smoother time in the game.  I'm all for them making their money but it is currently too spikey in prices.\n\nIn closing I will add this one tip:  To detach a single part from your robot be in build mode and click the part so it is highlighted then click the detach button below the robot.  To do this to the ability parts you will need to rotate the camera to see them and then do as the other parts.","September 22, 2014","false","38.8"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","44","61","3","1"

It's very similar to Loadout in a way, but with robots.\n+Third person perspective allows you to see where you're getting shot from (most of the time).\n+The matches are (normally) quick, unlike many games.\n+There's an option to automatically repair your parts and resupply your guns after battles using credits. This is INCREDIBLY useful if you're lazy like me, or if you simply like to be able to jump straight into your next match.\n+Almost all the parts that I've seen are able to be bought with credits, and from what I've seen, they're not very expensive.\nDislike:\n-In order to expand your inventory, you have to spend 'sparks' which I believe you have to pay for. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n-If you leave during a match after you've been defeated, you can't do anything with that robot until the battle has finished.\n-It's always five on five with no respawn. It's made worse by the point above this.\n\nSo, even though there are some bad qualities, I would definitely recommend this game, at least to try it out since it's free. Please, leave any feedback if any of these things change, or if I was wrong about anything.

The game divides up robots you create into weight classes and 'Tier' ranks, in an attempt to make sure that any robot you design will never face down a robot considered to be 'more powerful' or in a higher 'weightclass'. Unfortunately this system is extremely broken and is constantly getting exploited by experienced players so they can game the system and earn fast coin.\n\nThe basic issue is that right now.. since robots are so highly customizable, every individual part needs to be invidually 'scored' based upon its power curve and over all effectiveness. Two Dragonov (Spelling?) Sniper Rifles, while considered Heavy Weapons, can actually be bolted onto a light weight robot chassis and have only minimal impact on your over all speed. This allows for high speed, high maneuverability designs that still pack a heck of a damage _punch_. This problem compounds even further when you move up from a 2-Weapon Robot Frame to a 4-Weapon Robot Frame. 4 Sniper Rifles, or 4 Hailfire Rocket Launchers basically allow you to faceroll over most of the competition, yet still somehow keep your robot ranked in the "Tier 1" ("Lightweight") groupings.\n\nIf you want a 'build your own robot' game with a ranking system that WORKS, go try "RoboCraft". "Guns And Robots", at present, is an unbearable mess.","December 14, 2014","false","10.7"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","31","47","3","1"

Mostly solo, but a couple of my friends joined when they were around. I reeeally like this game so far.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/VsYbNd7G-mU\nhttp://youtu.be/40Wd0noQCJU\nMatchmaking is really fast, I never had to wait more than a few seconds to get into the action. There doesn't seem to be any issues with lag which as I am located in Australia and I was worried that there may not be servers in my region. Controlling your robot is very easy, weapons on your left are bound to your left click and vice versa. I think you can also fire weapons individually with number keys. So you basically are allowed a lot of versatility e.g. you can have your long range weapons on one side and your flamer thrower or shotgun on the other side for close quarters. I found that it was really fun to play. Only problem I found was that you weapons don't fire from you perspective, so often my projectiles would clip into objects even though I had a clear line of sight of targets. Also because my weapons sat low on my chassis I couldn't fire over certain cover. It's something you just need to get used to. You seem to get plenty of the base currency from playing matches. I was quickly able to buy components and set up my robot in the basic configuration that I wanted after just playing just a few matches. You have a limited amount of inventory space for robot components. You need to use premium currency to increase it's capacity. But I found that you can just sell components that you don't want to use anymore to make space for replacements. With all the base currency you earn it's easy to afford new components in case you want to switch back or try something else. There appears to a large variety of options when it comes to build and equipping your robot. The modules you assemble together to build your robot are made of multiple components. This basically allows you to customise them e.g. a base component may apply a damage modifier to your weapon at the cost durability etc. You have a player level which progresses as you complete matches and unlocks upgrades for modules i.e. for chassis, weapons and so on. Upgrades require special components which I had trouble earning as rewards for matches. You can buy them with the premium currency which I thought could sort of force you invest money to avoid a grind, because you don't seem to earn a lot of it through matches. However I did notice that you can actually convert the free base currency to the premium currency and as I said getting the base currency seems to be pretty easy. So getting enough of the premium currency might not that hard at least in order to acquire low to medium tier upgrades.\n\nFor a game that is described as cartoony I really like how it looks. Yes some of the designs are pretty silly, but some of the robots look really really cool. There is quite a large amount of variety and interesting examples in the designs created by players. The most memorable build which I saw was a big heavy one that slowly glided around. And personally I built a heavy weapons platform with four guns and tank tracks. It was really slow but it felt cool as hell to move into the fray with it =)\n\nThis game is absolutely worth playing so far. Not a single major issue. Even better with friends which by the way are easy to form a squad and play alongside with.","August 4, 2014","true","17.3"," 51 of 88 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","51","88","0","6"

I built the heaviest possible robot, with automatic machine guns on both hands, and I've been getting the majority (if not all) of the kills in every game, and haven't lost once.\n\nThat brings me to another point, regardless of the game mode that you're playing, the game devolves into a deathmatch battle, because killing the enemies makes you win anyway. There's no respawn, and you often get thrown into 2 v 2 games to make matchmaking quick, so games last all of a minute or two at most. Nobody even bothers with the objectives, let alone acting as a team.\n\nAnyway, all of these things can be looked over while playing the game. Short matches? You get to play with more games. Ideal build? Cool, more kills for you. With just this stuff, I would recommend the game, because it's a bit of quick fun. However, there is one problem that really makes this game a drag, and that's progression.\n\nThere's nothing in this game to really make you keep playing it. You can level up by getting experience from battles, but leveling up only allows you to upgrade your equipment to a higher level. Upgrading equipment requires money and parts, and the parts cost Sparks. You can only get Sparks by paying for them with real money, or (guess what), leveling up. You play battles so that you can play more battles to get the stuff so you can upgrade stuff to play more battles. This isn't fun or interesting, this is just grinding for the sake of grinding. Why would I bother upgrading my stuff so I can win more games, when I'm already winning games in order upgrade the stuff?\n\nAnyway, this is an interesting game to try for a little while, but don't expect to be playing it for more than a few hours. Maybe a little longer if you have some friends. If you want something similar that actually rewards progress, go play Robocraft or something.","September 12, 2014","false","2.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

And yes I know it's hypocritical to criticize instagib builds when I use one myself, but you have no choice unless you just plan on dying all the time.\n\nThe devs need to take a long, hard look on weapon balance and the overall [fun] factor of the game if they want to retain players. They actually have one of the best, if not the best F2P model I've seen and it's a crying shame the game eventually becomes such a frustrating experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/northstarblue/recommended/293540/","northstarblue","Changeling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/northstarblue/","94 products in account","The concept behind the game is simple enough and quite appealing: build a goofy robot out of random scrap and junk, strap some equally goofy weapons to it like dynamite launchers, bootleg laser guns and acid filled water balloons, and then send it out to go blow up stuff. It's rather cartoony, doesn't take itself all that seriously, and in theory would be a fun quick-fix sort of game.\n\nIn practice though, there are a lot of imbalances and glaring issues that ruin the fun. The main offender is the upgrading. You have to upgrade your robot's parts and weapons to stay competitive, but it's not just a matter of paying some coins and waiting for the upgrade to finish like other games of this type. You also have to have upgrade components which can only be found randomly as post-match rewards or bought outright with premium currency (aka the cash shop), and if you don't feel like buying them then you're going to be stuck waiting a very long time for enough components to do anything. This really kills the experimenting that should be a part of any game about robot building, as it makes you not want to invest in new parts or weapons. Having the timesink alone is more than enough to slow down upgrading, adding in the extra element of components just comes across as a very cynical cash grab attempt.\n\nWeapon balance is also another problem, as too often one player can steamroll an entire team by themselves just because they managed to build a heavy bot with four launcher arms. Supposedly battery power and weight limits have a limiting effect, but since launcher rounds travel in a straight line and not an arc, it seems all too easy to just build something that can tank all the opposition's fire and spray AoE misery right into their faces.\n\nAnd finally, there are a number of overall fit-and-finish oversights that left a sour impression. The tutorial gives only the very barest of detail on how to build a robot and doesn't give even a basic explanation of how weight limits, battery power or engine choices affect your movement and ability to use your weapons. A lot of features can only be found by just clicking around and stumbling onto them. Even some very basic functions aren't working right: there's an achievement for renaming your robot, but at the time of writing this you can't even do that. Shouldn't the things tied to achievements at least be checked to make sure they're not broken?\n\nThere's a fun idea here, but the game loses its appeal quickly and still feels like it needs a lot more work before it's ready to be played more than once out of curiosity.","August 4, 2014","false","2.3"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","2"

It is true however that some weapons are nearly useless compared to others but that has been due to the devs nerfing one thing, and as a result some other gun becomes op.  There were a few generations of weapons that I personally watched everyone use, then get nerfed, then everyone would use the next op weapon just to get it nerfed as well.\n\nThis game really is ftp, try it and don\'t listen to the negative nancies who claim you have to pay to play.","June 1","true","208.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It is such a shame how unpopular you are. Sure, you are not the greatest game out there, suffering a number of issues both big and small... But deep down there is a fun game here.\n\nAlas, what holds G&R back so hard is it's balancing and small, unsocial community. With any game that allows you to build your own weapon, there are bound to be dirty players who exploit this fact and abuse it to create frustrating builds that take the fun out of the game and either force you to build your own cheap build, or just attempt to tough it out and try your best to beat them (And if you have skills, chances are you will at the very least do a considerable amount of damage to their bot).\n\nAs for the community, there is hardly anyone left... On average, there is probably around 150-100 players daily, if you are lucky.. Often this means fighting the same people over and over (said people probably being the cheap builds that frustrate you so), meaning it gets dull seeing the same robot over and over, nothing new and creative coming your way, and even worse for noobs to the game who get put together with level 80 vets. Even moreso, the community is very quiet for the most part, not much chattering going on between players, which further makes the game feel empty.\n\nDoes this mean the game isn't worth playing? Hell naw, when I first started playing, I really enjoyed it. It is fun making your own personal robot that suits your playstyle, mixing and matching parts and painting them all up to make a fancy killing machine that people will easily remember and adore/fear, and when you join a guild, it is fun working together to gather enough money to help invest in the guild to purchase buffs that give you a slight edge against your rivals. That, and the fact that this is the most generous F2P game I played in a long time, where all the things you can buy with real money don't have serious impact in the game, keeping it fun for everyone.\n\nIf you do plan on playing this, though, I suggest you bring some friends... It is much more fun when you have a crew you can rely on instead of having to go solo and risk having to be paired up with bots... yeah...","November 2, 2014","true","25.4"," 72 of 137 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","72","137","6","0"

If you use 4 you will be slow, so most of the times you will be using 2 of them, but its okay since the balance is needed. It has 'capture the batteries (flag)',  "plant the bomb" and "team deathmatch" modes. The game is soo funn, and there is no time limit before you get bored because your robot is simply 100% customisable. Every part (chassis, body, head, weapons and , yes, HATS) has around 10 different models on shop with different status so you can make the perfect robot for your style. Its like Team fortress, loadout and robocraft combined.\nThe downside is that it is new so it still have some problems like having only a few maps and some balance problems (there was a specific very overpowered wepon but it got nerfed yesterday, but still some are clearly stronger than others). But at least every weapon cost basically the same and it is not pay-to-win since you can earn all the currency just playing. The only 'pay to win' thing here (too expensive to buy just playing it normally) are cosmetic things, like hats and painting. All in All, it gives loads of fun but need new maps.

Building robots and marching them into battle.  Sounds good right?\n\nIn two days I leveled past 20.  I estimate I was doing above average.\n\nHowever, in that time I started to notice wildly mismatched games happening.  I started to notice wildly OP weapons -- I'm talking weapons that could literally one or two shot me when in quad configuration -- and I was running a fully geared and very slow (as a result) heavy build with 5 levels of armor throughout, etc.  It seemed like that should have meant something.\n\nWell, it doesn't.\n\nThere are severe imbalances throughout Guns and Robots and it's a Pay2Win game along the same lines that World of Tanks is.  It might not be SEVERE pay2win, but it's still there, just like WoT.  It's a damn shame.\n\nThis model of game is also designed to create addiction.\n\nSo, I uninstalled it.\n\nYour experience will vary, but I cannot recommend this game.  I typically end up locking such games or uninstalling them, and in this case, since the balance is nowhere near as good as WoT, and because the game itself has a paltry inventory space that's basically begging you to pay money to field more than one robot, the variety isn't even close to WoT, where you can field a half-dozen tanks easily without feeling anyone pinching your wallet, etc.: Guns and Robots earned an uninstall.\n\nI'm just tired of this sort of game design.

Problem with players using "hacks"  No notable support for the community.  No way to report offending players. The matchmaking itself is pitiful at best, you can have teams set up in such a way where all the experienced (sometimes even veterans) players are on one team, and all the new people are on the other. So it seems it does not balance player levels, only robot tiers. Sadly it is very difficult to find any decent games with anything above a T2 robo (it goes up to 10). At T3 I am lucky to be able to to score a 2v2 match, which often ends up including T4 bots (on the opposing team), with just the T3 going vs the T4.\n\nYou cannot choose what game mode you want to play, and yet there are daily missions that ask for very specific things such as "win x amount of team deathmatch/bomb squad/capture the battery games" and countless other daily missions that require you to be the one to fulfill the objective of such matches, which is exceedingly difficult, because not only are you unable to choose your game mode, but far more often than not, players treat every match (regardless of game mode) more like it is team deathmatch.\n\nInventory is also constricting enough to strongly encourage using some $$ to expand it, though you can get most if not all things from simply playing the game ... the time it would take to achieve such things will really have you question if its worth it, especially with the quality of the game as it is now.\n\nThere is apparently also a problem with people using auto-target and wallhack cheats, I have been in games where not even 5 seconds in, I would be getting shot by an enemy using railguns (in the suburbia map) across 5 walls, not being in line of sight, and not even firing in my direction (evident by bullet trails into the sky in another direction).\n\nLastly, it seems there is no real support for the community, as there have been countless times when i have seen the chat being absolutely flooded with spam (with no apparent chat bans or otherwise), and throughout the weeks I have been playing it I have not seen any key updates to solve any of the major problems of the game. In fact, a report button seems non-existent! So with that I feel we can probably assume the game developers arent that interested in really keeping the game in a good shape it should be.","August 21, 2014","false","21.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

However, after some experience with the game, the game has come down, quite a lot. The game is good on the gameplay side but in the multiplayer ranking system, the game doesn't do that well. For example, If you are a new player who joined the game and you are just expecting to have fun, well, don't have your hopes high. Because the game is randomly ranking you, you might end up with a severely high-ranked team, which you will have no chance against. This isn't a one-time thing either, it can happen anywhere, anytime.\n\nThat said, I still enjoy this game, due to good players, and such. But if you want feedback, look below-\n\n. Pros .\n\n1. Good gameplay\n\n2. Entertaining for long periods\n\n3. Good controls and graphics\n\n. Cons .\n\n1. Can get quite frustrating. [Depends]\n\n2. Glitches here and there. [Sometimes]\n\n3. High usage of bad language by players, not the "normal bad language". Some which are personal. [Sometimes]\n\n. Suggestions .\n\n. Improve the ranking system [Foremost important]\n\n. Disallow usage of same weapon 4 times, this is another issue i've seen where people use high powered weapons to destroy you easily. [Secondary importance]\n\nThat's all for now, if you do these things, I assure this game will be one of the best.\n\n\n","September 1, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One gun may have 10 damage for 3 shots per second, another 30 damage for 1 shot per second. They'll use about the same amount of energy per second and so on. There are differences but they're mostly minor. Different chasis have different speeds and some other stats, but mostly you're deciding if you want 4 arms (for higher DPS and lower sustained DPS) or 2 arms. That's about it. Light mechs dont seem to have much advatnage over heavies (they go faster, but not really MUCH faster).\n\nAll in all there are simply better games out there that deliver a higher degree of customization and strategy, ranging from more complex games like Mechwarrior Online to more similar ones like Robocraft.","August 4, 2014","false","4.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Perhaps they could make a better tutorial, one that covers a walkthrough of the garage? Was a bit frustrating in the beginning - took me a lot of time to get myself acquainted with all the robot modifications and how to apply them.

It has a lot of ups; and a lot of downs, people tell me graphics are rubbish, nut in the middle of a firefight your not going to be staring at the walls are you? And yes i kinda agree when you tear yourself away from shooting another Robots head off, yes the graphics are a little plastered on. My main problem with Guns And Robots is what im going to call 'class diversity' for example i was in a 5v5 match where 9 people were using the same type of gun, this may not seem so bad for a game like Robocraft but when you look there are over 15 types of gun to chose from its quite depressing. What i like is that you have to keep a constant eye on you health, which is different for every single part of your body and this makes the combat more responsive. Another downside is the community; which is very small, in Robot Ranking 3 for example your more likely to do a 2v2 that a 5v5 as the amount of players at the moment is so small. In a way this is good because you get to know people and its much easier to make a clan, but you'll be versing the same people again and again.\nSo if you like community, querky and somewhat reponsive games; I'd recomment Guns And Robots.","September 23, 2015","true","22.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ploopploop/recommended/293540/","ploopploop","ploopploop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ploopploop/","405 products in account","So after a year I decided to play this game again, nothing much has changed since back then.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding as always and so is the gameplay. Assemble your robot and launch your attacks against the enemies. Play with strategies or just go for the kill. I have 2 videos, one is team deathmatch and the other capture the batteries. There is also a third game mode, plant the bomb, I will post a video about it on here some other day.\n\nIn both I was talking through skype with my mate so we played it organized.\n\nTDM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNn_Q6DzSSU\n\nCTB: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqps3gWWBWM\n\nUnless you squad the teams are pretty balanced! Which is hard to find in any other pvp based game out there. You don't get matched with or against players that are more than 1 rank higher or lower, unless you squad ofcourse.\n\nBeing in a squad brings a lot oppertunities and dissadvantages. You know your mate that he won't mess up and it's easy to talk to (no russian language or an other which you dont understand) and you can use certain tactics to win. HOWEVER you can also get matched up against players ranked higher than both of you. Especially if the gap between you and your mates robot rank is big. So keep this in mind.\n\nNow the question might arise, what is this rank that I keep blabbering about? It outputs the strength and agileness of your robot in a simple number ranging from 1-10. Keep in mind that the differences are HUGE. A rank 3 robot can kill a rank 1 robot in 1 hit. A rank 5 can do the same to a rank 3 etc. Ofcourse this isn't always the case, but that are the differences. So yes the games are very balanced.\n\nFor once this game isn't pay to win, you can pay for buffs or you can earn them ingame with the special buyable currency known as sparks. They are easy to collect or pay like 1 buck per 100 sparks. This brings buffs such as more xp for your character or double golds from games or 3 way squads. Or you can buy cosmetic stuff, shortly said, the gameplay does not get ruined by peoples with a lot money.\n\nIf you have watched the short videos you will have a rough idea by now about what the game is. I highly recommend you to at least give it a try. The tutorial pretty much covers the basic gameplay and play 1-2 rounds online. Most of the players (that speak english) are very kind and will help you rightaway if you're stuck with something. A good community for once in an online game!\n\nThe game is free to play, but those game are 9/10 times better than the game for which you pay 20+ bucks.\n\nThe sound effects are also superb. With a surround system you can hear where your enemy is walking and act according to their position. For example you don't move and flank them when they get close.\n\nVisual, graphical, gameplay and community wise I give this game a well deserved 9. There are some minor buggs but they won't ruin your gameplay unless you have invested 50+ hours. Then you might be able to spot the first bug ;)\n\nOh also they have easter eggs in the game! Found a dutch add in the garage.. after owing the game for a year or so...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=490625213\n\nHope to see you in game <3","July 30, 2015","true","69.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","1"

It does have a few very minor lags and the game needs to have more variety robot parts for players to choose from to build their robot.\n\nIf you are into playing a unique or a combination mixed game.

I played it back in the early stages of it, and let's just say the game was a trainwreck. No team balance, getting new parts was fairly hard due to the low income of credits and whatnot, but now this game is AMAZING! Definitely a 10/10 in my book, as well as being listed as a must-play title. It's not Pay-to-Win since people can still get the same parts for their robots with or without paying for the game, and the people who play tend to be very friendly. Also, this game is VERY fast-paced, the matches only last for like 2-5 minutes and they're over when one team completed their objective OR if one entire team of robots have been destroyed. Give the game a whirl, it's F2P, and it's less than a gigabyte, so even if you don't necessarily like the game, you won't waste too much of your time waiting for it to download.\n\nBiggest attractions of this game:\n-Customization is flawless (countless modules including guns and chasis and heads and etc.)\n-Team balance is pretty good\n-Community is pretty funny\n-Controls are fairly easy\n-A shooter with Robots\n-Lovely achievements\n-All currencies are easily obtained while playing the game\n-FREE TO PLAY!\n\nSomewhat of a bummer:\n-No gamepad support (YET)\n-Takes a while to get certain parts to upgrade your modules without paying for them with premium currency (Sparks)\n-Very small bagspace\n-Only 2 free Robot slots, and it's 85 Sparks to get the third slot (not sure about how much it is to buy anymore)","August 8, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mixing and matching parts is fun to be a tank, a skirmisher, or a sniper, or a combination of any of them.  Matches are fast-paced and generally over pretty quickly.  Plus there's a minigame during the lobby screen to keep you busy.  8/10 would free-to-play again.\n\nUpdated after several days of play: The game is pay-to-win.  Sometimes this is not bad; but in this case, do not give the devs any real money.  First of all, you make money fast enough without resorting to cash payment.  Second of all, the devs don't seem particularly active on the topics discussion, updates, hotfixes, patches, hacking, and cheating.  I'd like to know the devs are actually improving the game before I give them money.","September 26, 2014","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to pay for a ton of sparks to get a VIP account just to have 3 people in your squad ( otherwise you can only have one other person.) Then to unlock nicer paints you have to pay damn near $100, and you have to shell tons of sparks ( the monetary unit used in-game) to increase your inventory size.\n\nBUT..\n\nPros:\n-I, myself have created a guild and am fortunate enough to have met and collected some great and active players to fight along side with and chat between matches.\n- I don't understand what people mean by the game has " unfair combat and ranking system." I have never had my share of win and lose streaks and this game has a pretty fair match making system.\n-Making your robot is fun! there are definitely three styles of bots that you can succeed with. ( heavy, high hitpoint bots/ light, lightning-fast, fast damaging bots, etc)\n\nConclusion:\n-This game is definitely more fun in a guild or with friends! if you are a solo player, this game probably will lose your attention in a matter of hours. give it a chance, if you dont like it, you're not out any money.","March 25, 2015","true","65.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's similar to Robocraft: you build and cutomize your own robot, generally it's either going to be a hard-beating tanker or swift recon, but there are variations in between. The customization aspect of this game is quite nice.\n\nThe battles, too, are amusing enough actually. However, things could get quite frustrating when you are faced with a four-armed heavy tanker opponent (you normally only got two arms)... which is able to kill you under 10 secs. Though to be fair they're still manageable with a good teamwork (3-4 people need to flank him at once), the problem is when there are TWO of these kind in the opposing team. The team only consists of 5 people at most, so if the opponent have two insta-killers you are practically doomed.\n\nWithout those crazy OP guys though, the game is fine. The maps are well-designed so that give swift recon robots opportunity to surprise buttsecs anytime. And while there is an IRL-bought-currency here (especially useful for upgrading weapons and providing slots for robot customization), you can still win the currency in matches. Even the OP four-arm customization is buyable with in-game cash/through winning matches.\n\nHowever you're going to meet those OP four-arm robots often, so expect loses. I personally note and remember each OP guys' name and quit the lobby everytime those guys are present, but this isn't too practical, so I don't suggest playing this game too frequently.\n\nWith its small size, it's still worthy to stay in your HDD; it's a good time-killer, but you'll know when to stop when you face those OP robots.","September 8, 2014","false","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Theres no lag as far as i can tell. You have a choice of what kind of robot you want. A fast but not as durable skirmisher. A balanced fighter. Or and slow, but strong tank.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexy-medic/recommended/293540/","sexy-medic","Mercenary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sexy-medic/","16 products in account","This game is really fun but most people don't try to play it enough to make it out of the tier one rut.\n\nFirst off upgrade your robot. Yes there is fewer people playing the higher tier levels but all the people who played the game for a long time like to go back and play as tier one with over powered robots to mess with new players and get into games faster. If you level up your bot weapons and armor and get to at least tier 3 the games will still be quick to join and more equal robots.\n\nDo not buy or upgrade the special weapons like mines or sentries. A lot of people do this and complain about being beaten every game. They are usually weak and uneffective and brings your tier up by one or two. Putting you into games were your robot it self is a lot weaker then other robots.\n\nGet into an active guild that play with friends. Make plans to play better or just have people to talk while playing and getting to games. The buffs are way over price and doesn't really help much so I barely donate to my guild.\n\nI would not recommend 4 weapon bots. They deal a lot of damage but the armor is low. I use the LMGs at tier 8 and it only take a few seconds for me to mow down 4 weapon bots. Also watch the patch notes on what is getting nerfed and buff. It only takes one update to make your bot the best to the worst\n\nIt is not pay to win. Yes the cosmetics cost a lot of sparks that does not help the robot get better. I would not recommend buying keys to the specific crates. I buy a whole bunch of the generic keys and I have open 5 or more of the best crates.\n\nCaution: the spam filter is not the greatest. There is one person trying to make people buy sparks from him all day everyday. Try to just ignore it and if you are trying to ask to join a clan ask the people you are playing with in game.\n\nOver all I find this a fun small game I play when I am mad at other games. Just don't try to copy everyone else in tier 1 and you will do perfectly fine in this game.\n\n-Thank you for reading","May 30, 2015","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play the game in any style you like: rush, tank, stealth, tactical, etc. A large variety of weapon choice, although the meta guns are there and they usually work better than other guns. There is some teamwork involved, and cover base shooter elements in this game.\n\nYET, there is one huge problem. There is a really, literally, PAY 2 WIN factor, but it's not any kind of pay to win, you will probablly need to pay a gigantic amount of money to do this. There are crates/boxes (random drop or bought with real money) in this game and they can be opened with paid "keys" (paid with real money). 3 of these crates contain unique weapons that can't be bought with in game currency, but the most expensive crate contains 2 completely op equipment.\n\nThe 2 equipment allows the robot to have carry extra guns. Standard robots, bought/built with in game currency, can have up to 2 or 4 guns. But these 2 equipments allows the robots to have double or triple the amount of guns comparing to a standard robot, although damage is reduce, due to the increase amount of guns, the damage is still doubled. When used with projectile base guns, these op equipments allows much larger amount of space being under fired.\n\nThe pay 2 win problem right now is not common and you can rarely see it, but when you do see it, it's instant gg. unlike most so call pay 2 win games, those gives a slight advantage, but this gives an obvious "you will stand no chance against a paid robot" kind of advantage.\n\n*I will rate this as neutral if I can since the open season event*\n\nPros:\n+Free :D\n+Great art\n+Large variety of weapons, body parts\n+Some cover base shooter elements\n+Interesting maps\n+Pay 2 win situations are not common\n+Really fun and addictive\n+Queue mini game, wtf :D\n\nCons:\n-Pay 2 win situations although not common, the game turns absolutely discoruaging when such situation does happen\n-Unstable server\n-Buggy, not critical\n-Can do a better job on UI\n-Some achievements can not be achieved yet\n-Balance between guns are really off *but all available to the public*\n\nFor now, the game is great and I really recommend it, but when the day where pay 2 win is common, just uninstall this...","August 7, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epichammar94/recommended/293540/","epichammar94","epichammar94","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epichammar94/","4 products in account","Most shooters of recent times never seem to catch my eye too much. Many of them feel like the same thing over and over again, such as the Call of Duty series. There are, however, a select group of games that classify as shooters that I can thoroughly enjoy. One of those is Guns and Robots.\n\nWhere do I start with this game? The basic idea is that you assemble a robot and send it out into battle against other players' robots and try to complete an objective. Whether that's delivering and planting a bomb whilst stopping your enemy from doing so, or just good old fashion 'last one standing wins', Guns and Robots gameplay is very simple to get used to.\n\nOne of the key selling points to this game (despite it being free for the most part), is how the actual robot is built. You can purchase a variety of different parts that you must assemble in order to build your perfect war machine. There's also the case of needing to repair damages and resupply your ammo which is a nice little touch. Lastly are the weapons, which are split into light, medium and heavy categories, and each has a very familiar feel. There are quick firing weapons, explosive weapons, laser weapons, sniping weapons and even a flamethrower, all of which you can slap onto your bot and use to your heart's content.\n\nThe game's physics engine is another praise point I have for it. Your robot does not have a healthbar, but instead, the damage to each body part-the head, torso, both arms and the chassis-is shown instead. Losing your head causes your controls to act funny, losing your chassis makes you immobile, losing an arm means losing a weapon, and if your torso is destroyed, you are basically dead and eliminated from the round. I found this especially interesting, as a player now has the ability to strategize which parts they want to eliminate. You can aim for the chassis and turn your enemy into a helpless turret, blow their head off and watch them dizzily stumble around, remove their weapons to make them helpless, or you can aim for the torso and watch them go boom. Strategy is something we don't often see in your typical shooter. Not even Team Fortress 2 is so strategic.\n\nAs a final note, I do love this game for what it is, and what it does, and my only advice to the developers is to continue to bring us new and interesting content to play with. There are only so many customization features, and only so many game modes and maps. Keep pumping out the goods, and we will stay loyal, and bring more gamers to love this game.\n\nFinal Mark: 4.5/5","April 17","true","4.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The battles are short and fast paced not to mention, getting into a match is quick and easy. I do wish they would elaborate more during the tutorial rather than just showing you how to use and build a bot, but instead it would be nice to have the game explain how to use and implement devices, buffs, etc. The micro-transactions are not that bad, and its not in a pay to win style. You could easily get a lot off enjoyment out of the game without forking over a dime. I think for a free to play game this is very solid and still has a lot of potential.","June 1, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epichammar94/recommended/293540/","epichammar94","epichammar94","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epichammar94/","4 products in account","Most shooters of recent times never seem to catch my eye too much. Many of them feel like the same thing over and over again, such as the Call of Duty series. There are, however, a select group of games that classify as shooters that I can thoroughly enjoy. One of those is Guns and Robots.\n\nWhere do I start with this game? The basic idea is that you assemble a robot and send it out into battle against other players' robots and try to complete an objective. Whether that's delivering and planting a bomb whilst stopping your enemy from doing so, or just good old fashion 'last one standing wins', Guns and Robots gameplay is very simple to get used to.\n\nOne of the key selling points to this game (despite it being free for the most part), is how the actual robot is built. You can purchase a variety of different parts that you must assemble in order to build your perfect war machine. There's also the case of needing to repair damages and resupply your ammo which is a nice little touch. Lastly are the weapons, which are split into light, medium and heavy categories, and each has a very familiar feel. There are quick firing weapons, explosive weapons, laser weapons, sniping weapons and even a flamethrower, all of which you can slap onto your bot and use to your heart's content.\n\nThe game's physics engine is another praise point I have for it. Your robot does not have a healthbar, but instead, the damage to each body part-the head, torso, both arms and the chassis-is shown instead. Losing your head causes your controls to act funny, losing your chassis makes you immobile, losing an arm means losing a weapon, and if your torso is destroyed, you are basically dead and eliminated from the round. I found this especially interesting, as a player now has the ability to strategize which parts they want to eliminate. You can aim for the chassis and turn your enemy into a helpless turret, blow their head off and watch them dizzily stumble around, remove their weapons to make them helpless, or you can aim for the torso and watch them go boom. Strategy is something we don't often see in your typical shooter. Not even Team Fortress 2 is so strategic.\n\nAs a final note, I do love this game for what it is, and what it does, and my only advice to the developers is to continue to bring us new and interesting content to play with. There are only so many customization features, and only so many game modes and maps. Keep pumping out the goods, and we will stay loyal, and bring more gamers to love this game.\n\nFinal Mark: 4.5/5","April 17","true","4.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
