This is because the mechanics of both games are very similar.  Instead of atoms, each level has boxes to rearrange into the targetted combination.  This is done using conveyor belts and various machinery that sort, rearrange, duplicate and combine them, depending on what you need.  The theme is more 'real world' than SpaceChem and while  I quite liked it, the 2D nature of the conveyor belts restricts the complexity of possible solutions.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say, the presentation is somewhat lacking (the whole game is 33 mb).  However, I consider that puzzle games should be ranked on their puzzles alone.  In this case, the levels are straight foward but challenging so that it's a rewarding feeling when you finally solve them.  While I haven't yet attempted the hardest puzzles, based on the difficulty of the earlier ones I expect that each will take a long time to solve.\n\nWhile SpaceChem is the gold standard for this genre, there's no shame to be in such a great game's shadow.  If you want more, then Great Permutator is worth your time.","September 16, 2014","true","6.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

The premise is simple enough - you have to transport red, blue and yellow blocks from the upper side of the screen to the bottom, using unlimited number of conveyor belts and a limited supply of special blocks, while fitting them all on a 11x11 board. However, after only a few levels you will find yourself scratching your head and wondering how to sort them properly.\n\nAnd after that, the game grips your brain in its claws and never lets go. There are lots of levels that will make you think they're impossible, and make you feel oh-so-smart when you finally solve them.. that is, until you realise that getting it solved is just a beginning of the road.\n\nWhere the game shows its real greatness is the fact that every level has several different solutions. If you played many puzzle games, you know well enough that often a level has only correct solution, as devised by the author, and either you reach it or be stuck. Not in Great Permutator. Here you can solve the level by occupying 100+ tiles and be done with it. Or you can try to get an A+ solution. But while A+ solutions are good enough to get the achievement, they are not sufficient to snatch a good spot on the leaderboards.\n\nEvery level, apart from having a predefined (and known in advance) number of tiles you can occupy to get A+, has a world record, established by unknown player(s) and stored on the server. And reaching it is exponentially harder than reaching A+, to the point that as of now *nobody* found the best solutions to *all* levels at the same time. And even when someone does, there can still be some levels that can be solved in another, better, but yet unexplored way.\n\nThat said, I have little doubt that the game's author is a genius and I can't wait for more levels, as hinted by the now-empty "Add-ons" tab. Thank you for that GREAT game! ;-)\n\n-----------------------\nThe old "review":\nThe name of the game says it all: it's about permutation and it's really great. ;-)","November 13, 2014","true","152.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","2"

Much like the jump from imperative programming to functional, even practiced puzzle gamers and critical thinkers will find themselves grappling to construct the strange loops of logic (ala Godel, Escher, Bach) required to rewrite the incorrect solutions the implied layouts provide.\n\nNot only are many of the initial solutions challenging to reveal, players are encouraged to develop their score to compete with the best in every level, and shaving one tile off of a score can require a substantial shift.  I take pride in knowing that the majority of my solutions are tied for the best out there, and that by the time I reach completion (lord willin`), there will be haunting imperfections in my record, and intellectual arch-nemeses whose monikers I will scorn, but I will likely never meet.\n\nPart of me fears I don't quite have the edge to pull it off.  Some puzzles I haven't solved genuinely hurt my feelings because I can't wrap my brain around why all the permutations I can deduce don't work.  I explore failed alterations that weren't even close to plausible after all.  At first I skipped a puzzle here and there, because I'd come back to it after doing something I could wrap my head around.  Now I can't proceed without solving one that already haunts me.\n\nThat is mastery in design.

Several optimization puzzlers (SpaceChem, Infinifactory, Manufactoria) in this genre are very "big part", complex games where there are many possibilities for solutions.\n\nThis is a bit different. For most of the puzzles, the range of solutions is constrained - the constant grid size of 11x11 is used well without you noticing it at first. In addition, there is a limited amount of tools, also called 'action blocks', and the game exploits several of their traits including some subtle asymmetries. These combined not only means you won't have to think in such big quantities, nor will you forget how your solution works.\n\nThis is a style of programming puzzler I really enjoy and I've got a lot of time and fun out of it.\n\nUpdate on negatives about the game, as well: The debugging is pretty poor - it is a very trial-and-error part of the game, though thankfully the mechanics are simple enough that it is not as bad as SpaceChem.\n\n8/10.","October 24, 2015","true","62.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/residualdeviance/recommended/319270/","residualdeviance","Iconoclast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/residualdeviance/","267 products in account","Not a bad game at all. First, if you're on the fence about this from the screen shots, this isn't for you. This is a challenging puzzle game through and through.\n\nIf this sort of "use pieces to get things from points A to points Whatever" gameplay appeals to you, this is pretty fun, and is what you might expect. There is a demo, so you can decide if this game appeals to you.\n\nBear in mind, though, this game has a pretty steep difficulty cliff right out of the gate. I was having brief trouble with 1-star difficulty levels early, and a lot of the early levels will either require knowledge of pathfinding, or teach it the hard way to players. Even early manipulating blocks are presented with the "here's a new thing! Figure it out yourself" instruction. This is not a casual game.\n\nThis is, for those looking for a challenging puzzle game, a neat idea.\n\nGraphics have a solid, consistent style. Music is actually pretty good, never mind for an indie puzzle game. I don't much care about these for a puzzle game, but they're both capable here. Controls are a bit clunky. If you are those who wants controls to work for your specific style, instead of being ok with dealing with a not-quite-super-intuitive interface, you might have some issues with constructing your solution at times. I personally didn't much have a problem with it, but I know some people who will very much like this game's concept might have issues with the interface.\n\nEach puzzle after the brief tutorial is rough. And then, once you learn what the game is maybe expecting of you, challenging. And then, you'll come back to the game and solve something you struggled for almost a half hour with, a single puzzle, immediately, after time to sleep on or ruminate on the level. I've only gotten to the later parts of the first half of the main pack, but I can see this idea being the norm for this game. And "only" 65 or so levels becomes a complete, double-digit or so hour game when each level takes several minutes of thought, and possibly pencil and paper, to complete an individual level. And then, you can use what you've learned from that difficult level to beat more easily/accessably solved future levels. And the rare past level you chose to skip.\n\nAnd this is a barometer for which I will judge harder puzzle games. I'm fine with learning the ropes for them, and once you do, this game becomes a game where you have a eureka moment randomly on a level and then beat said level reasonably quickly, after staring at it and trying hard for a while on with no progress.\n\nThe dev is also very receptive to the game's users, including being, in the past, willing to allow previous purchasers of the game elsewhere to get a Steam key for free when this was first put on Steam (From what I can tell from the game's discussions forum). I got this game during a sale several months after this went on Steam, but for smaller-scale games like this I like seeing how the dev(s) act with roadbumps in the release process. This game has, in the past, had a strong dev interest in its playerbase. I definitely consider this in my opinions, and this game passes with flying colors here.\n\nAnd on that "graphics" front, the spray-painted "29" in the game's interface for the challenge mode is a subtle change that almost represents this puzzle game's strengths too perfectly from those who dedicate the time to complete this game. Originally, the challenge was to clear the game with 3,000 tiles covered, but because of the community, it was discovered that one could beat the game covering (as of now) exactly 2,900 tiles. It's worthy of optimisation; and that's pretty big for a game that's not super-big to achieve; an ultimate challenge that even the dev underestimated, to an extent.\n\nI'm digging this. I might update this review as I play on, as I've not gotten past the first screen. But yea, this game is difficultly engaging for a puzzle game fan like me, almost to the point where I'm learning a bit about data structures (and am inspired to learn a bit about types of coding) from it.","June 27, 2015","true","15.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is hard as hell, and wrapping your head around these puzzles is going to provide you with nightmares for weeks to come.  Level 1 sets you up for level 2 to take you down.  In The Great Permutator you have a soft limit to each stage for the number of conveyor belts and pieces that you use.  In order to get the objects from the top to the bottom, you're going to need to start thinking of how to manipulate the system.\n\nYour soft limit is typically 20 conveyors, but you can place as many conveyors as you want (you just get less score if you go above 20, I guess).  Not readily apparent at first, there is an order to which boxes have to leave the factory first, which is where the true challenge comes in.  You need to figure out ways to make sure the right boxes leave the factory first.  Unlike the "as many as you want" rule, this rule is hard and immutable.  You can't just take a penalty and drop the boxes off in any order.\n\nIt's fun if you like puzzlers, but if you don't, then you might as well save your $7 and use it to buy something more your style.","September 16, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This concept helps describe the overall objective of the game, to guide colored blocks down a transport puzzle to reach pre-determined destinations in specific order. A better name for the game, perhaps, could have been "Great Iterator", not because the grueling puzzles in this game often require trial&error problem-solving, but because they frequently must be constructed such that blocks loop through the puzzle several times, interacting with puzzle pieces multiple times until the puzzle’s conditions are met.\n\nThe puzzles can be solved with two different types of pieces. These are the conveyor, which move a block to the adjacent square in the direction in which it is drawn, and devices, modifier pieces that may change the block’s color, that have variable points of output, that collect blocks and releases them simultaneously when enough are inserted and so on. The puzzles require patience and lateral thinking. They are very difficult, particularly if you try to solve the puzzles in the fewest number of moves possible. With 50+15 boards and a built-in editor, Great Permutator has more than enough content to satisfy those who appreciate genuine challenge.","May 4, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In particular the Great Permutator's swap machine, randomiser, duplicator and what is effectively the equivalent of an if-statement make the whole game feel like a cross between some sort of esoteric programming language (an obscure language that exists purely for entertainment) and the kind of puzzle games that people used to make for handheld consoles, but with 16-bit console/retro PC graphics.","June 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
