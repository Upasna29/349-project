This game is made by Finnish studio called "Bugbear Entertaiment" known as of Flatout Series (expect Flatout 3 chaos & destruction which was awful game made by some studio from Czech) Rally Trophy, Ridge Racer Unbounded and future release "Next Car Game" what is upcoming game to new generation consoles and pc (people voted from greenlight for steam). Even Though game is from 2005 this game have "heavenly" physics motor and driving response system when it is considered its racing game era back to that time. Simple & very challenging single player career. 8 player AI-races, 16 different cars what you can customise, 48 different tracks including Demolition derbys, Bonus and stunt tracks and all tracks contains hundreds of destructible pieces. Multiplayer is closed but still working with downloadable patch from net.

Although they belong to the same main genre, racing, they are completely different games with completely different perception of racing.\n\nI played this game for the first time when it was released in 2005 but I was not able to get pass through the first stage of three as I was not that good in PC games back then. I grew up, saw this game on discount and I was determined to complete this after all those years and finally managed to complete the game in 15 hours.\n\nDuring 15 hours, I completely lost my s**t, I leaned right or left on my chair while I was simply pressing left and right buttons on my cheap keyboard, I looked for a brake pedal under the desk, I felt like I won a real race after each race. This is probably one of the most underrated games of all times as it's gaming mechanics, AI, graphics are better than current era of arcade racing games.\n\nFlatOut reminded me why I loved racing genre. 10/10.","April 15, 2014","true","17.1"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","60","64","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princess_gay/recommended/6220/","princess_gay","Princess Gay X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princess_gay/","287 products in account","FlatOut was released on November 5, 2004 for both Windows and Consoles. My first impressions of the game were also back then. The game was fun. But now, it can only be played for nostalgia. I suggest you pick it up on a sale.\n\nI said that the game was fun because there are better games out there that you can buy. This game made a good start for the derby racing game and started a future for FlatOut series. I still find it amazing how the driver just flies out of the window during big crash. The gave is hilarious especially if you play with friends. But I am not too sure if the game servers are even running. I know you can play with friends via some LAN programs or even HOTSEAT. It's a good game to have fun with.\n\nAs in any racing game there must be music in this one. It has a decent soundtrack for the time of release, but I have personally never heard those bands in my life before or after. I do not dislike the soundtrack but I think it could have been much better. The rest of the sound effects seem fine and nothing particular caught my eye( or more like ear).\n\n2004 was a big year for very good looking games. This game didn't do too bad compared to big fish around that time. Car detail is good. The detail of the maps is good as well. Human rag dolls are a bit on the low side, but they are not that important. Overall, I am still very happy with the graphics to the current time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=349808821\nControls and overall steering is a bit funny. I take it that's because the game was made for consoles too. There are not many buttons to press, but powerful steering can ruin your race.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=350923568\nThere are a few things, of course, that I quite hate about FlatOut. First thing is AI. It's so straight forward that it's actually not fun playing against computer. All it wants is to reach the finish line. I can also add that AI drives in the best possible way and will not crash. All other reasons add up to the first one. Because the AI drives really well, one mistake on the map could mean that you have lost your lead, quite probably for the rest of the match. And the last thing is that in my opinion the cars get damaged way too fast even without actually crashing into anything. But the end of the match you will end up having engine on fire, 2 car seats with human and skeleton of the car.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=350923322\nRe-playability is low in my opinion, because you can just play other better games with the same name.\n\nSo in overall, I think this game (without considering the rest of the series at least) is quite good. I would recommend it simply because it's really fun. Not everywhere you can send the driver flying out.","December 4, 2014","true","1.6"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

I was blown away by the damage modeling which at the time looked amazing, considering the best compairison was GTA3.\nSo I looked into this crazy title by a studio that no one had heard of, and found out that it was still in beta.  I probebly put 20 hours into the demo/beta before it was announced that it was going gold, but didnt have a publisher in the US.  So I ordered it directly from Germany.\n\nHonestly, a fantastic older game.  It feels right, with cars all handeling a little different, and convaying a great sense of speed and weight.  And the party games are far too much fun.\n\nI have bought it twice now, and I cant recommend this enough.","August 3, 2015","true","6.1"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

This game was great back then and time has not taken anything away. I used to play this game with my friends at dorm LAN parties and we loved it. It is simple but hits that racing sweet spot of really fun gameplay. FlatOut doesn't take itself seriously like other racing games but instead opts for solid racing levels and whacky exibition courses. Even today it looks great and gives you that raw destruction derby racing feel. Oh yeah, it also has ACTUAL destruction derby in the exhibition courses. The AI feels sometimes strange, ranging from stupid to godly. Therefore you will enjoy the game mostly in multiplayer where it is loads of fun! The downside is that there is only LAN play and so you either have to simulate LAN or actually have real physical friends in your location. Overall a fantastic old game that is worthwhile and I recommend it!","June 20, 2015","true","2.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

However, unlike more realistic titles on Steam, this game seems to play more around dirty racing, such as slamming into your opponents, ramming them or pushing them into telephone poles.\nFlatout doesn't take itself seriously, however, with the special events. I won't spoil them all, but they include such things as darts and a high jump. With your driver's body. Yeah, it was one of the first racing games to incoporate ragdoll physics and it plays this for laughs, especially when, if faced with a hard enough impact, your driver just FLIES out of the car.\nXbox controller support is okay, and it's a title that feels like it should be played with one. It's hardly taxing on modern hardware, and it runs pretty smooothly on laptops.\nHonestly, give it a try, it's pretty enjoyable for the price!","November 15, 2014","true","16.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

Whilst the music was not quite my taste, the rest of the game was quite enjoyable. It's an old game, so don't expect any flash graphics. What this does mean, though, is that it will run on pretty much every modern system flawlessly (though I did have the occassional minor audio glitch where the music would disapper for half a second). The game boasts environmental destruction as well as car destruction and ragdoll physics (for when your character flies out of your car!!). The career contains 36 different tracks as well as some bonus material (e.g. Destruction Derby), and the variety of cars and upgrades for those cars is a nice addition too. Overall, the game is worth getting if you're a fan of arcade racing games. You'll have a lot of fun!

Along with your standard racing, FlatOut goes a further step and gives you semi-fully destructible vehicles as well as often hilarious bonus activities, such as throwing your character at a dart board or bowling with the top of his skull. Aside from an engine that's on fire and is still somehow propelling you, the car physics are very believable and sometimes a pain in the ♥♥♥ (such as when your wheels are all ♥♥♥♥ed up and every time they rotate they make your car bounces).\n\nThe choice of music isn't something I care to listen to, but it suits the gameplay well enough.\n\nOh, your car is also fully customizable, to the frame to the tires to the engine that realistically improve your vehicle (as in, there's no "super tire" that never loses grip, and there's no "super engine" with a million horsepower). In fact, the wee bit of power the upgrades give you are sometimes the only thing that keeps you in 1st place.\n\nThis is a very nice game, and if you don't mind looking at low-poly characters, definately give this game a try.","June 20, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

In some ways it feels a bit dated, but at the same time it holds up quite well. Which is not that surprising for a game that came out in 2005.\n\nThe controls really make and break this game. They are very floaty and extremely clunky. It basically feel like you're controlling a jetski in rough waters. When on tarmac, it feels good. You can drift around corners and speed through light curves and it feels like a great arcade racer. When you drive on snow and off-road on the other hand, you're sliding all over the place and have little to no control. Almost slowing down completely before big corners in order to handle them. And the AI cars will drift through like zen masters.\nWhich is another problem with this game. The AI. There's not much rubberbanding in this game. If one of the AI cars end up ahead of the pack, then their perfect path finding will leave you in the dust. You can never catch up. I had the fastest car with all upgrades, and they still sped ahead of me. This game is about crashing your opponents to get ahead, and then keep the lead. And if you crash yourself, you're forced to a 4 second slow-mo crash sequence, and when it ends you're put back quite a while. Usually last place. There's also a reset button. It works when prompted, and some other times as well. When you've been pushed off track and facing the wrong way though, it will most likely not work. You don't decide when to reset, Flatout does.\n\nBut when it all comes together (usually the tarmac tracks) this game is incredibly fun. But the other aggravations kept me from finishing this game. I beat the bronze and silver tracks, but I had to give up at the gold tracks. After resetting a track 20 times because the AI kept using the PIT maneuver to turn me the wrong way, I gave up. That's where the fun ended for me. But for the price and for the hours I put in, I can't complain. I will recommend this game, but be aware that it definitely has its shortcomings. But then again, it's also a 9 year old game.","April 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love it. It's simple and really not very difficult. But that's good. The real fun comes in later when you know the tracks well enough that you can start to really shave those valuable hundredths off your time, and start to invent your own games, like letting all the other cars lap you, then seeing if you can unlap yourself again to win. What? I told you I'd played it a lot. :P\n\nIt's not 100% perfect of course. When your driver flies out of the car and hits trees, he kinda gets a little stuck and turns into Stretch Armstrong for a second. The replay function after each race could have used more options, like the option to edit multiple cameras together, and then save the replay to view later or share. The tracks are reused quite extensively - a few more would have been nice. And among other little things, being able to race any track in the opposite direction would have added just a little bit more replayability to it.\n\nOverall, it's hard to fault this game for what it is - a simple, yet highly fun and addictive racing game. :)","August 2, 2015","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't even use the letters on your keyboard to type your name for a save file! You must move the cursor over to each letter), is still an amazing game for as long as it's been out. I remember buying it on the PS2 thinking it was just going to be another lame racing game, and was VERY wrong! It mixes difficulty with strategy to make the game fun (if you like a challenge like me), it has soft-body physics (when you crash into something your car bends to meet the damage unlike Need For Speed or Gran Turismo), and you can play Olympic games with your car! There is a long jump, high jump, curling, bowling, skiball, and even darts! You play these games by driving your car and ejecting yourself out of your windshield causing yourself to do awesome stuff! The question I'm asking myself is, who WOULDN'T buy this for $7? I personally say it should be worth at least $10 or $15 for all the original stuff and work the creators put into this...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LittleAprilShower/recommended/6220/","LittleAprilShower","λ CryLikeAnimeFansOnPromNite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LittleAprilShower/","85 products in account","10 years after this game's release.. it's... adequate.\n\nFlatOut is a game I used to play on the original Xbox. It's... a racing game, at least that's what it claims to be.\n\nIf you played the game back in the day, what you probably remember most is the ragdoll effect the game has. You crash too much, and your driver flies through the car in a ragdoll. And if you remember that, you most likely remember the minigames involving your driver's ragdoll. The fun minigames include playing darts with your driver's body, seeing how far or how high you can make your driver fly, or flying into a clown, which I remember sucking at as a kid.\n\nOf course the game has it's flaws, which is understandable for a 10 year old game. And sadly, 70% of the game consists of it's worst feature; Racing.\n\nNow I'm not really much of a hardcore Nascar kind of guy, so I don't know how car parts work and how upgrades work and whatnot. But racing in this game is a frusturating mess. It was a mess back then, and it still is now. It's not as bad as the racing minigames on the older Grand Theft Auto games that were released around the time this game was new, but there's a large chance you'll be shouting swears and curse words from the racing.\n\nThe opponents will always stay on the road. Sometimes they'll make a wrong turn and try to get back on track but they'll barely crash and wipe out. You, on the other hand, will find yourself slipping through sharp turns, flying off the track and wiping out from EVERYTHING. You'll feel like a feather in a race with a bunch of bricks, much like GTA III.\n\nIf you've played the game for more than 30 minutes, you get this nagging feeling that the game was built for demolition. Like demolition derbies, which is available as a side "mission" to earn cash. Said cash can be used for upgrades.\n\n\nThese upgrades suck.\n\n\nI don't know if I picked the wrong car, or if I'm just bad at this game but I had my car's body upgraded to, what claims to be, maximum protection. "Survive the harshest crashes" the description of the upgrade said, or something. And the car's pretty heavy too. Despite all that, I found my driver flying several feet across the map because I hit a TREE STUMP without crashing into anything else prior.\n\nYou also get a little radio when you're in-game. The music.. is forgettable. This is coming from someone who enjoys more like Country and Pop, mind you. I enjoy some rock and to a lesser extent, heavy metal now and then but you'll be hearing songs about screaming teenagers or "babies with two heads". The baby song politely keeps the wonderful image in your head as the woman vocalist keeps screaming the phrase over and over again as an excuse for the chorus. The only song I really remember in a good way was "Beat the Boys" by Lab, which is used for the game's opening. I remember hearing the song play on the in-game radio, but it barely happens. I don't see a way to have custom music playing either, so that's another thing.\n\nOh, and about the minigames I mentioned before; Only two of them are available at the start of the game. You have to unlock the rest from, I'm assuming, the good ol' racing. Yayyyy.\n\nThe game is nice to pick up and play every now and then but I bet you 90% of the time, you'll only be playing the minigames. I'm sure there are other racing games with smoother.. well.. racing. Luckily, I remember on the Xbox, there being a certain phrase you type in as your profile name to unlock everything. I don't really remember it and frankly, I don't approve of cheating my way through video games. But if you don't have the patience to get through the racing, then you'll probably want to look it up.\n\n\nHonestly, I don't know whether or not to recommend this game, but it has a lot of nostalgic value to me and I can't really call it a "bad" game. I did have a lot of good fun times with the game back then. If you like a little goofy fun, then you should try the demo first. It's a lot better with friends to play with. The lack of the ability to save replays is a little disappointing though. (One time, my driver's foot got caught between the car and a wall, and stretched out mid-launch during the long jump minigame. I took a screenshot though.)","August 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It's enough to get at least bronze to progress. A race takes about 4 minutes.\nIt took me 40 hours to complete the game, but I used most times the worst car and got 1st place everywhere.\nYou can buy and upgrade different cars, BUT you can't collect them. Buying a new car will replace it's predecessor.\n\nMulti-player: Well, the game is from 2004 and has a couple successors, so don't expect official servers online.\nThere is a community that seems to play regularly. You might wanna take a look:\nhttp://fo-online.net/\n\nLocal Co-op You can play above mentioned silly games with up to 4 players, but nothing else, which probably isn't what you were hoping for.\n\nFull controller support I had no issues using my 360 controller, except that navigating the menu is a bit weird. I have to use L-/R-Trigger to move up and down, but this is resulted by having throttle/brake bound to them, so it depends on your settings as well.\nNote, that your controller must be plugged in before starting the game, otherwise it won't be recognized and your game will change your setting to keyboard control again!","January 30, 2015","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDylan25x/recommended/6220/","xDylan25x","xDylan25x (GamePreak)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDylan25x/","71 products in account","First off, I'd like to say that I love this game.  Been playing it since it was pretty much new and it was on a ps2 with low res textures and fuzzy resolution.  No matter if it's on PS2 or PC, they both play amazingly.  The physics for the cars crashing and crumpling were way ahead of any other games I'd played at the time.  They still are impressive today, the only GOOD car destruction in a series that I can think of being GTA.  Beam NG Drive and Next Car Game don't count, as one is a one off test, and Next Car Game is made by the same devs of Flatout.  Anyways, the game is great, the destruction, car upgrades, and race unlocks make the game feel worthwhile to keep playing, to get that next race or the next upgrade to finally win.\n\nOkay, let's talk about the music.  The music is great, fitting, and by some bands I've never heard and seem to be a bit hard to find, but if all the music is as good as their one or two tracks they got in this game, I'd love to listen to more...\n\nThe AI is very good, but sometimes pull ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t manuvers.  Ramming you out of the way, the whole they seem to have 3x the mass of you problem, etc.  Lots of races come down to the last second, and the game suffers from (some of) the problems Polaris Snowcross has (AI seem to race perfectly, but don't rubberband like they do in that game.  Though they do take corners super fast, magically.)  (Watch Ross's Game Dungeon for more on Polaris Snowcross)\n\nMovement is great.  Drifting is nice and allows you to pull off interesting stunts and ways to get past the AI.  Getting nitro is great.  You knock stuff down and smash through signs, cones, and other items to get boost, which sometimes means risking either your place in first or maybe trying to get some boost to get back into first place to win.  Races can suddenly be completely over if you crash sometimes, which is good or bad, depending on how hard races are.  Sometimes it's a legitimate "Okay, I ♥♥♥♥ed up.", but in gold the cup, I found myself getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at this one barrel that kept getting knocked over into the road, which ended up making me ramp off the road, hit the barrel on my way down, and FLY THE ♥♥♥♥ off the track.  ♥♥♥♥ like that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, but for the most part, other than a tire of two, nothing else really did that.\n\nThe stunt arena...used to be more fun.  Now, I had fun with it in the early stages of this game when I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to okay car, but when I got blade, the middle bump ended up flinging my car and making the mission impossible (haha see what I did there?  No...?  ...Okay, I'll stop.).  The game needs to have multiple cars owned at once as a feature.  Seriously, that'd be great.\n\nOn the topic of features that need to be added or should have been in the game, LET ME SKIP SONGS PLEASE.  Also, the nitro is a pain the the ♥♥♥ to get sometimes.  Like, when I push an AI to the side, and they try to push back, but I slam them into a wall and they fly out of their windshield, I should get SOME nitro from that.  I mean, burnout did that and it was a great system.  Obviously, this isn't burnout, and maybe that came out after this, but it just seems like something obvious.\n\nOther than that, this game is almost perfect.  Great game for its time, and even today.  I will be playing the multiplayer soon with a friend.  Cpmpleted in just 11.7 hours, it's a little short, though I haven't completed the stunt arena (though you prbably know why if you read my review).  9/10.","January 24","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes even the tinest of objects like cones, can cause huge wrecks too.\n\n(Continued) I was in a gold class race, second to last lap on Fairgrass Challenge, when i ran over a cone on a turn. This cone caused my car to roll, then cartwheel 16 times, so farr off the track tthat I smacked the semi-invisible wall marking the end of the map, flew out of my car, and had to restart the race. A Tiny cone, was enough to ruin a whole race for me, stuff like this is very frustrating, but, minor.\n\nSome of the Shortcuts on certain tracks are totally useless, and generally will result in  a wreck, or making you take longer to do a lap.\n\n\n\nOverall though, its a whole lot of fun, and pretty Solid, woth the cheap asking price in my opinion.","February 27","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Theres also a good amount of added gamemodes, like Destruction derby, highjump, bowling, and the added derply like tracks, like the oval and Figure 8 tracks.\n\nPros:\n\n\nNot demanding, runs well.\n\nGraphics still hold up even today, and look pretty good for their time.\n\nGreat soundtrack overall, aside from maybe 1 or 2 songs that are just "Eh.."\n\nDriving feels crisp and responsive, though some of the bronse class cars can feel a bit floaty\n\nGreat sense of speed.\n\nMultiple gamemodes, all of which are pretty fun and entertaining\n\nEntire tracks are all fully modeled and explorable with destructable bits included, a feature sadly removed from Flatout 2.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nA minor flaw-,Soundracks repeat during racing, and the playlist only changed to another song if you reastart the event or go to another one.\n\nSome objects are badly placed on tracks, like excavators,trucks,tractors ect all being placed in bad areas, wich can cause unneeded or undeserved wrecks, it also makes it harder to get a good driving line through certain corners. Sometimes even the tinest of objects like cones, can cause huge wrecks too.\n\n(Continued) I was in a gold class race, second to last lap on Fairgrass Challenge, when i ran over a cone on a turn. This cone caused my car to roll, then cartwheel 16 times, so farr off the track tthat I smacked the semi-invisible wall marking the end of the map, flew out of my car, and had to restart the race. A Tiny cone, was enough to ruin a whole race for me, stuff like this is very frustrating, but, minor.\n\nSome of the Shortcuts on certain tracks are totally useless, and generally will result in  a wreck, or making you take longer to do a lap.\n\n\n\nOverall though, its a whole lot of fun, and pretty Solid, woth the cheap asking price in my opinion.","February 27","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Customization options are reasonably translated from real-world gearhead practices, and different from many other games with a simply text-based customizing interface, different components were given polygonal representation; meaning you get to see the parts you put into your car. Good navigability and diverse minigame options make it tough to get tired of this game.","March 1, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ironically I bought it the second time, because steam didn't accept the CD Key.\nI bought it on steam, It's mine. They didn't cut out ingame content and sold it as DLC, there is no microtransactions ingame and there is no DRM most importanly. Simple, beautiful, perfect.\n\nShame really it doesn't have any trading cards or steam achievements, but this game is also running in 1080p and Isn't locked at 30fps. Are you taking notes, EA?\n\nBut you will argue: "wah wah you're talking about cosmetic dlc what about the ingame content that's expands the game storyline and adds new features and gives you new content wah wah wah.."\n\nYeah, I know what you're talking about. You're talking about expansions. DONG EXPANSIONS.\nI hate the term DLC because it got ruined with horrible business practices. Expansions are huge update to the game, its almost like releasing a sequel, DLC on the other hand is itsy bitsy minor stuff that is overcharged with price.\n\nI maybe won't play this game again, because I already beaten it when I got the CD.

There are minigames in the side menus which let you drive up a ramp and shoot your little driver man or woman through the windshield and try to see how high you can get them on a large scale. There are a few other mini games worth playing as well. The actual game itself is god awful due to the racing physics and car handling but the awfulness transcends very well into the mini games. I should also mention that this game introduced me to the band The Hiss through their song Back On The Radio and it is is super splendid. Look it up. So, so very good. I'd pay 7.50 to launch a man out the windshield to that song any day.","May 14, 2013","true",""," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its made by bugbear the devlopers of next car game, If you want a feel for the new game this is a slightly aged version. Next car game has the best crash engine up to date however flatout delivers a decent crash engine with graphics good for its time.

Also there is a system where you can buy and upgrade cars with the money prize from races.\nI would give it a 10/10 and call it perfect but sadly you can't paint your car nor own more than 1 at the same time, aside from that, it's an amazing must have game","October 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have alot of abruptness and big text to read and not a whole lot of content. You don't have to think at all when purchasing upgrades just buy the ones there you can afford and move on. Physics don't seem quite right as items that you would expect to fly right through either collide with you and can throw your car off track or just completely stop you with friction. The music is pretty bad and sounds like they tried to make a song that kinda sounded like a good popular song but failed with every attempt. Vocals are strangely quite and hard to hear over the gameplay if you can at all.\n\nThe actual racing is pretty boring. Its a basic arcade racing game. Nothing special. Once you get so far infront of the AI drivers they dont really catch up unless you slow down. They don't seem to take short cuts or really know how to drive very well either. Nothing really links one race to another either, I feel no reason to keep playing the game and no real impetus to beat another race.\n\nWhat is "special" about the game is that if you crash hard enough your driver can be tossed out the window and your care can take visual damage to specific areas. The cars are modeled decently well detailed so this can look pretty neat. But in reality getting tossed out of the car (which for some reason makes the game chug whenver it happens on my system) is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying and I just sit there nailing the reset button.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toomuchnitro/recommended/6220/","toomuchnitro","Toomuchnitro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toomuchnitro/","158 products in account","I really have mixed thoughts for this game...\n\nEssentially you race around in clunkers and beat up old muscle cars. The cars are supposed to handle like clunkers too, which they do. At least for the first couple of races. Once you're past like the fifth or sixth track, you'll realize that even though you're driving the same exact car with all the upgrades, all the AI cars start handling like exotics which doesn't seem right.\n\nSecond, this is one of those "make one mistake and you're done" racing games, if at any point you come to a complete stop you might as well just restart the track because everyone will get so far ahread if you weren't first..\n\nAnother strange flaw is the  turbo/nitro system. The game will give you turbo not for driving good, but the opposate. Instead of getting boost for drifting corners successfully or maybe jumping something, it will give it to you for smashing things around you which seems really counter prodcuctive. If I slam through a stack of tires to get boost, the speed I've lost will is almost always more than the speed I'll get from burning all my boost. Also, most of the things required to get huge amounts at a time will slow you down almost to the point of stopping.\n\nAnother huge flaw is the reset button. I find that I use it every single race. Want to drive through a fence or buliten board? sure smash it up. What about this wooden pole or small tree stump? Nope, that will wreck your car completely causing you to  need to reset. But, this wouldn't be as bad if the game didnt make you sit there and watch your driver ragdoll around for 3 seconds before you can get back on the track. On top of the 3 seconds you just lost watching your ragdoll, the game sets you back a pretty good distance away from where you wrecked. This alone will send you from a decent first to last in seconds.\n\nFor me I just can't be happy and play this game with these flaws. I can drive like a boss the first couple laps then screw up once and be done for the rest of the race. If I cant get at least third then I just reset it because theres no money awarded below that. Now, I'm not saying I want the game to be super easy because this isn't a pull ahead and win game by design, It's just the objacts that you'd think would be breakable and arent, or having to reset the race because I crash at the last second and lose my standings, and the terrible reset, I just can't enjoy the game without getting mad.\n\nNow if you want to just get the game to drive backwards on the track and smash stuff or play the demoliton derby minigames, then get it, But if you want a fair driving game that you can have fun and progress in this isn't the game you want.","December 4, 2013","false","17.5"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

As a game franchise I'd never heard of before I was surprised by how good it was.\n\nCompaing this orginal Flatout to the second one seems a bit unfair but to be honest this feels like an unfinished game. Some jerky physics and control issues with some menu problems make this game a bit disappointing.\n\nYou can be winning a race comfortably only to hit a traffic cone and be spun out...but not just spun out, spun out into a forest, hitting a tree and having your driver fly out of the car. That might sound fun, but sometimes if you just touch a tire wall you'll spin wildly out of control or get "hooked up" against it and have to reset your position. I feel this detracts from the gameplay.\n\nThere also appears to be "shortcuts" on some courses. The problem with this is that the shortcuts often end up so insanely difficult to get through that they cost you far more time than you save. When is a shortcut not a shortcut? In Flatout.\n\nThere is no way to sell cars you buy that I can see, or to even change to the cars you've spent money on previously.\n\nThere is also no graphics menu so make sure you choose the settings you want when you first start the game. The only way around this is to delete the setup file in the game folder which is pretty annoying.\n\nApart from those minor flaws the game is good fun, with a decent soundtrack but it's just too frustrating and random to be worth playing.","December 31, 2014","false","7.5"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kikaz1/recommended/6220/","kikaz1","Azkik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kikaz1/","906 products in account","This is a good example of a game that just doesn't know what it wants to be; the racing aspects of it actively contradict the demolition aspects, making it downright painful to play at times. All of the modes offered each somehow find a way to sap all of the fun out of flinging yourself from a moving vehicle.\n\nGraphics: The cars and terrain look decent enough for 2004; I'd even go as far as to say the damage effects look good. The skybox texture and the background look like they came out of the '90s, however. There is an issue with models and textures not covering the full extent of their physics, creating invisible walls or bits of physics objects. The UI is abominable and after extended play it can begin warping itself around the world; it's difficult to explain, but it appears that physics are applied to the UI and it can glitch out, causing display issues.\n\nSound: The sound effects, particularly the car sounds, seem very budget and hollow, as if they were recorded on a $20 tape recorder from the 80's. The soundtrack itself though, is actually pretty good; most of the tracks fit the game well enough.\n\nGameplay: Your driver seems only too eager to launch himself through the windshield at the slightest brush from a sapling. Sure, it's funny the first couple of times, but when it gets right down to it, this game's poor physics and driver launching feature get in the way of both racing and, to a slightly lesser extent, the "Bonus" modes (which include a counterintuitive demolition derby in which you keep your car from getting smashed, and things like darts and bowling which utilize your driver being launched from the vehicle). The vehicle customization is scant and performance options are as vague as those of the Need for Speed games of the era.\n\nConclusion: The main selling point of FlatOut proves to be little more than a tacked on gimmick to what is ultimately an average racer that seems to have assigned itself the task of trying to make losing funner and easier. If that sounds appealing to you then by all means go for it, otherwise, skip it.\n\nThis Reviewer Gives FlatOut: 4/10","May 18, 2014","false","3.5"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","4","20","0","0"

This game just flops, specially compared to its successor. Ignore this and get FlatOut 2 instead.\n\nFlaws:\n• The cars feel weightless. You barely nudge a curb going 15 and your car just tumbles. You slam into another car and it doesn't really feel like you've done anything to it.\n• Cars have no grip/traction, you seem to be constantly sliding along. This would be fine on snowy tracks, but not on every track. Braking basically has no effect, trying to slow down before a hairpin turn and NOPE! just keep on sliding off the course!\n• Courses are very bland. They are wide and empty feeling with no character to them. Theres also very little in the way of different paths/shortcuts.\n• You get flung from your car if you barely tap anything.. most of the time. The game is really inconsistent as to what makes you get flung out. Barely scrap a sign? AWAY YOU GO! Slam head on to another car? Nah, you're fine!\n• Its a Demolition game.. WHERE I ACTIVELY DO NOT WANT TO CRASH, EVER. With how easy it is to be tossed out of your car, theres no point in going after the other racers. You get boost for crashing into things, but it also increases your odds of being thrown from your car, and the fact most things you can break to get boost are also very heavy when hit and will slow you down. Boosting is also something you'll only use to correct coming out of a turn, because going to fast and barely scraping something (and one time nothing at all) will send you flying!\n• If you drive ever so slightly off the course, even though you can easily correct yourself and get back on, the game will nag you to reset, often respawning you behind everyone else! With how slippery your car handles, this is more common than it should be.\n• The sound design is poor.. very poor. With how amazing it was in the 2nd game, I truly was surprised how crummy it is here.  There are almost no sounds for hitting things. Your tires are next to silent, with how slippery the cars already feel, the lack of sound makes the cars feel like they are floating. The engines sound weak, like you are driving a go-kart or lawn mower.\n• Unsatisfying driving. Managing to get a perfect run on a track felt more like a test of patience than skill.\n• Upgrades do nothing, atleast they feel that way. My thinking was to upgrade my tires and suspension to have better grip. Well it did nothing at all, the car was just and slidey as ever. You often feel like your car is under powered compared to the computer. Eventually after buying a few upgrades you can beat'em easily, even though the upgrades feel like they've done nothing at all to improve your car. You just suddenly starting keeping pace with the computer. There was no noticable increase in speed, durability, grip or anything.\n\nThe few Pros it has:\n• The cars look nice again, being mostly muscle cars and having a nice demo derby look to them.... Now if they only sounded like muscle cars.\n• Music seems a bit better than the 2nd and there was a noticable amount of female vocals.\n• My controller worked on the menus! Not the way I would of liked it to, but it worked fine enough.\n\nWhile its not the worst racing game I've ever played, its certainly skirting the line. The game is at odds with itself, not knowing what it wants to be. Is it an arcadey smash everything demolition derby game? Its too easy to be pinged out of your car and everything you crash into slows you down. Or is it a technical driving sim? Well it has boosting, very simple upgrading and far to slippery controls. What does this game want to be?\n\nIgnore this and get FlatOut 2, they really improved EVERYTHING in the sequel.","February 19, 2014","false","7.3"," 12 of 39 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","12","39","0","0"

Even though this is an older game, I really feel that I got my money's worth.  I've actually been playing this one more than Next Car Game, as this one is complete and they're still working on NCG.  Once I've won everything I can win here in FlatOut I'll probably switch back.\n\nSummary of what this is:\nMostly races, all with 8 cars.\nThree different difficulty levels.\nYou can buy, sell, and upgrade your car (but can only have 1 car at a time).\nSome bonus levels - races, demolition derbies, and carnival type games where you launch your car's driver through the windscreen to hit various targets.\n\nPros:\nA lot of entertainment for the price.\nPretty decent physics.\nDifferent tracks - race course, forest, town, sand pit, ice.\nSpectaular crashes and car damage.\n\nCons:\nIt's a 9 year old game (as of when I write this)\nNo real "career" mode, you earn $ to use to upgrade your car or trade for a better one.\nDrivers fly out the windscreen regularly as there are no seatbelts (this may be a pro for you; I like realism).\nAI is not horrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nOverall, I give it a 7.5/10.  Any price under $10 for this would be very fair, in my opinion.\n\n[Edit:  I have only played this as single-player.

Where this game differentiates itself from other racers, be it GranTourismo or Forza, is the emphasis on damage, destruction, etc. where the game encourages you to drive reclessly arouund tracks, hitting other cars or stuff right by the track, & in some cases to the point where ultimately you end up launching your car's driver out the windshield. It's not exatly Gran Tourismo, but it's not exactly Burnout Paaradise either... perhaps somewhere in between? At any rate, this is a fun game & if you don't play this game, you're sorely missing out.","December 14, 2013","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You drive well modeled cars in Races, Derbys and other extraordinary "Games". Dart e.g. where your Dummy is used as arrow...\n\nWhat I find most convincing is:\n- the beautyful atmosphere: the Sunsets and the Winterlight which you also find in FlatOut 2.\n- what didn't made it in the second Part unfortunately, is that you can drive of the Track and dash e.g. through vaste construction sites. What is most fun if you play it in...\n- the Multiplayer (LAN only)\n- The realistic driving - much much better than in so call Racingames (NfS) and the visible, quite realistic effect of crashes. One funny thing is, if you crash too hard, your Driver will get kicked out of the vehicel :-)\nAlso nice is the Destruction of Stuff that is in your Way or along the Road. Teaching barrels to fly will give you Nitroboost.\n\nOne thing remains: Tuning.

Even though this is an older game, I really feel that I got my money's worth.  I've actually been playing this one more than Next Car Game, as this one is complete and they're still working on NCG.  Once I've won everything I can win here in FlatOut I'll probably switch back.\n\nSummary of what this is:\nMostly races, all with 8 cars.\nThree different difficulty levels.\nYou can buy, sell, and upgrade your car (but can only have 1 car at a time).\nSome bonus levels - races, demolition derbies, and carnival type games where you launch your car's driver through the windscreen to hit various targets.\n\nPros:\nA lot of entertainment for the price.\nPretty decent physics.\nDifferent tracks - race course, forest, town, sand pit, ice.\nSpectaular crashes and car damage.\n\nCons:\nIt's a 9 year old game (as of when I write this)\nNo real "career" mode, you earn $ to use to upgrade your car or trade for a better one.\nDrivers fly out the windscreen regularly as there are no seatbelts (this may be a pro for you; I like realism).\nAI is not horrible, but not the greatest either.\n\nOverall, I give it a 7.5/10.  Any price under $10 for this would be very fair, in my opinion.\n\n[Edit:  I have only played this as single-player.  I see there are other negative reviews saying that multi-player doesn't work, but multi-player is not something I even considered with this review.]","June 9, 2014","true","76.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also damage system is good. You can f*** up your car not only by crashing into other cars or trees, but also by poorly landed jumps. Also a damaged suspension will make your car very jumpy and unstable, so every turn becomes a challange. And this leads to the bad side.\nIf you want to survive the race you need to drive quite carefully and clean and that makes the game slow. Even if you have very fast car you need to drive very gentle. Two hard crashes sets your engine to flames, few more and you're done. Sometimes the slightest hit will blast you out trough the windshield or tiny cone will send your car to the sky, what becomes quite annoying.\nIt also could be a bit longer.\nOverall score - 7/10 - A good game for 2004","January 25, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game doesn't lack colors  and have aged very well. Sound is also great and soundtracks fits really good with the game, you will hear some alternative/heavy/punk/industrial rock songs, however no noticeable bands or musical projects to mention.\n\nGame features some variety of tracks and surrounding environment, not much but not as little to feel repetitive. Tracks are challenging with a lot of destructible obstacles, but you want to avoid them because hitting or going through them will really slow you down or make your car flip over and and slightest touch will make your driver fly out of window even when you hit something with left or right side of the car, so at harder races it will get really annoying, also not all shortcuts look like shortcuts, and sometimes when you leave track even for couple seconds, game will force you to reset your car from place you left the track, also some spots on tracks sometimes can be passed easily and sometimes those same spots will make your car spin and flip and ruin your race. Also there are some bonus events like derby or how far can you throw your driver through front window.\nGame have enough variety of cars, but when you are choosing one it doesn't show all info about car only its weight and horse power, also you can upgrade your car's performance.\n\nSo to sum it up. Game looks great for 2004, music fits in the game very well, has some variety of cars and tracks but the gameplay just doesn't become fun and is more between challenging and frustrating than anything else. So if you want to get into Flatout's games I advice you go with second installment or "Ultimate carnage"!\n\nI gave it 6.4, thanks for reading!","May 9, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, wear your seatbelts, kids. This game should be the reason why you do.\n\nGameplay: I'm not too learned when it comes to racing games, but I do enjoy a good one from time to time. FlatOut is what I would consider to be a good racing game. Not a great one, but a good one at least. As you may or may not know, FlatOut is a racing game more in the vein of rally-style courses than Formula One courses, where there is a great deal of emphasis on vehicle control in rough terrain as opposed to hold down gas, turn wheel every once in a while. Yes, you will definitely need to make use of your brake button in this game, as well as maybe letting go of the gas every once in a while, as all the vehicles in game are rear-wheel drive. RWD means that you can do donuts. It also measn that you may find yourself doing donuts unintentionally. Since most racing games use front wheel drive, the physics in this game may feel unrealistic to some, but if you kinda know how a RWD car works, it's pretty solid actually.\n\nThe game has an alright selection of cars, but honestly, you should just pick the car with the best power-to-weight ratio just as a matter of principle. This game also has a system of currency where you win races to get more dosh, and while it never turned into a grindfest for me, it might be if you're not as decent at racing games. Plus, the vehicles with the best PWR aren't really too much more expensive than the ones of the same class. Yes, there are multiple classes of cars in the game, which unlock one class at a time over the three series. While you can beat class two racers with a class one car, it becomes very difficult, and in some instances downright impossible. The way that you can kinda do this is through upgrades, which while a neat idea is also not that well executed, as you have to buy components through a series of parts (you can't just buy the best parts on their own; you've gotta buy the crap ones first). These parts don't transfer to other cars either, which just makes the system feel like a waste of time.\n\nThe AI isn't exactly great, and if you've got an underperforming car, races can turn into an exercise in frustration as you have to take the track perfectly. There's no rubberbanding, which is good if you're absolutely smoking your opponents, but also pretty frustrating if you are way behind. AI in this game doesn't really have any aggression either; they just take the track as they want to, irrespective of you being in the way or not. This game manages to save a lot of file size by having only six maps where the tracks are different routes through the map. While the courses do for the most part feel their own (although there are a few lazy excuses for courses just being a course from earlier in reverse), you'll find yourself seeing a lot of familiar sights. Also, as mentioned earlier, this game is more along the lines of a rally racing game, so there's a LOT of start and stop. If that's not your thing, you may wanna look elsewhere.\n\nOverall, while this game could've done with some more work on tracks and the AI, it's still a pretty fun game overall. I managed to 100% the game with all gold medals in the amount of time that I've been playing it (~8 hours as of writing this review), and I don't regret my time. I just wish there was a bit more done for the single player. 7/10.\n\nStory: No story.\n\nGraphics: The game looks pretty great for a game from 2004, and it manages to have a good bit of detail for only being a 1GB download. The maps are big and constructed pretty well, things break in a satisfying way, there's a good deal of detail to the cars, and it all just looks good. While a realistic style does have a tendency to age absolutely terribly, from the perspective of a game from 2004, it looks pretty damn solid. There's no optimization issues for modern hardware either, as I was able to run it at a perfect 60 FPS with everything on max at 1080p. One issue that cropped up every now and then was that a magical fairy would show up every now and then and make the HUD go away and vomit the alphabet at me. Fortunately, this can be fixed temporarily by just Alt-Tabbing, so it's not a huge deal. Overall, the game looks pretty great for a 2005 game and not half bad for today's standards. Give it 20 years time though, and it may not look so great. 4/5.\n\nSound: One big draw to this game for some is the amount of very obscure bands that this game has. Most of the bands are either of a punk or metal persuasion, but the metal only goes as far as something like a rip off band of Judas Priest. In fact, there's a few bands that sound like ripoff bands; there's a band that tries to be the Beastie Boys, one that tries to be every Industrial Band from the early 2000's, and one band that tries to be as terrible as possible (I still remember Killer Barbies' Baby With two Heads as being one of the worst songs I've ever heard from when I rented this game for PS2 back in '07). While it's not bad for the first few runthroughs and while there are still a few pretty good songs, it does get kinda tiresome after a few hours, so you're likely to just shut off the music and play your own. Sound design is delightfully chunky, and I still haven't gotten tired of the guy driver's derpy scream after being ejected from the car. Again, the problem with licensed music is that it's cool for a while, but it gets old really quick. 3/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/4/3; cumulative score of 7.0/10. Pretty fun racing game, and definitely a fun one to play with friends, but apart from that there's not much to it.","May 4, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it easy game? Can I play like brony in My Little Pony?\nMy answer is: NO! This game is badass. This game isn't easy. This game isn't like MLP. And I ain't brony. This game is rough as long as you're soft. This game is evil as long as you're good. This game is hard as long as you think, that it's easy. Bronze is like hugging little fluffy bunny while Silver is like being bitting by this little fluffy bunny which actually is a monster with long teeth and your blood on its face. Gold... gold is a dream.\nCars. Your first choice is like your last choice. Or first, if you don't waste money on upgrades which surely helps you hang dirty, rough tracks where NPC is much better than you. I bought Grinder. I'm driving him in Silver. I think about driving it in Gold, because I have good car. Every other car is good. Pepper, Bullet, Fasthammer, Speedevil. It can be better if you buy one or more upgrades. It really depends if you will drive it rough or soft. I recommend you this: Take shot of the strongest vodka you can handle, play FlatOut and drive rough. This game isn't for friendly and soft-driving grandfathers or selfish pros. YOU ARE NOOB in this game whenever you will be first at first time in your first track, next track can be your worst nightmare, frustrating and making you biggest rage you ever could image!\nMy recommend is - What are doing here?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nevajag/recommended/6220/","nevajag","ic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nevajag/","246 products in account","While a lot of people really enjoyed this game I definitely found it over rated.\n\nGraphics looks pretty good for the time. Game doesn't lack colors  and have aged very well. Sound is also great and soundtracks fits really good with the game, you will hear some alternative/heavy/punk/industrial rock songs, however no noticeable bands or musical projects to mention.\n\nGame features some variety of tracks and surrounding environment, not much but not as little to feel repetitive. Tracks are challenging with a lot of destructible obstacles, but you want to avoid them because hitting or going through them will really slow you down or make your car flip over and and slightest touch will make your driver fly out of window even when you hit something with left or right side of the car, so at harder races it will get really annoying, also not all shortcuts look like shortcuts, and sometimes when you leave track even for couple seconds, game will force you to reset your car from place you left the track, also some spots on tracks sometimes can be passed easily and sometimes those same spots will make your car spin and flip and ruin your race. Also there are some bonus events like derby or how far can you throw your driver through front window.\nGame have enough variety of cars, but when you are choosing one it doesn't show all info about car only its weight and horse power, also you can upgrade your car's performance.\n\nSo to sum it up. Game looks great for 2004, music fits in the game very well, has some variety of cars and tracks but the gameplay just doesn't become fun and is more between challenging and frustrating than anything else. So if you want to get into Flatout's games I advice you go with second installment or "Ultimate carnage"!\n\nI gave it 6.4, thanks for reading!","May 9, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than being a street racing game or track racing game like many other games of its time, the developers at Bugbear Entertainment decided to make a dirt rally racing game with some elements of destruction derbies.\n\nThere are 3 different divisions to race in; Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each cup increases the difficulty slightly, all of which I still found fairly easy to get first in. When I first launched the game I chose to have the difficulty on Normal instead of Professional, so to anyone that plays this game I recommend selecting Professional. There are about 4 types of race tracks being Snow/Ice levels, Wooded levels, Construction levels, Town levels, and possibly another one (I can’t remember sorry :D). Each level type handles about the same as the next but with different aesthetics. The tracks can seem fairly repetitive because of this.\n\nWhen you are driving down a track you can hit something hard and go flying out of your car. After a few seconds though you can reset your car back on the track and continue racing. This mechanic can sometimes be very frustrating because even if you are going super slow and hit the side of your car along a guard rail, you will sometimes be launched out of your car placing you behind the pack.\n\nThis game encourages you to knock stuff over and run into other racer’s cars, giving you the ability to use nitrous oxide which can boost yourself ahead of the other players. At the end of the race you will also be rewarded with extra cash for knocking things down like fences and street cones. There is an extra Bonus division where you can play mini-games like Darts by launching your driver at the dart board. While it does have silly mini-games like Darts, I prefer to play the destruction derbies.\n\nIf you have about $7 to spend and are into racing games, you should definitely check out Flatout.\n\nI rate this game a 7/10\n\nFor more reviews like this one, check out my game review blog here: www.gonemadgaming.com\n\n~rhillfake\n\n3DS Friend Code: 2595-3048-4554 || Steam\Origin\Other: rhillfake || Xbox Live: WasBottlehead99","December 2, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics are really great, even if the cars sometimes feel a little bit to light, the physics are understandable.

It's fun though :>  Better than many racing games out there and better as an aged game compared to some of the poorly made ones in recent years.  Try it out, especially on sale!","February 1","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just make sure to grab the widescreen fix (google it). Otherwise the game looks like garbage an WS monitors. It's a bit short, and there are newer ones, so I would only grab this during a sale, which reduces the price to less than 2 euros anyway.
