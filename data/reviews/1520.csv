The exact numbers are not certain but the city of Pyongyang was hit directly as five silos where reportedly located in the center of the North Korean capital. The decision of dropping nuclear warheads on North Korea has stirred massive debate between UN members on whether or not the US should be punished for its deeds.

While the game only supports 1 map, little gamemodes and very little unit choice, this opens a whole new realm of micromanagement/strategy where games can be won in a matter seconds.\n\nI could go for a whole page critically examining the intricate depths of Defcon strategy and how intense but fantastic it is, but honestly I find the mood of Defcon speaks for itself......\n\n"The Defcon counter slowly counts down to DEFCON 2, as you manoeuvre your subs to deliver a fatal first strike to Asia. The slow hum of a massive turbine and background radio remind you of a massive nuclear bunker, where deep underground you are determining how many people die from your orders. The slow strings of a cello pass the time, as you anxiously wait for DEFCON 1.......3.........2...........1........the massive letters of DEFCON 1 flash across the screen along with a high pitched siren.\n\nSuddenly you spring into action clicking on your subs, activating your dormant SLBM's methodically targetting the major cities across the Asian continent. A quiet piano beings to play but you don't realise it when your too busy concentrating. As you finish the last of your targets another warning signal blares and a small nuclear signal flashes on top of your sub. The SLBM's slowly fire up, then gracefully turn towards their targets. Satisfied you take a break and nervously watch the SLBM's fall down as a now louder piano plays sombre, dark notes......flash......Tokyo hit....4 million dead.....success your first SLBM hits the target dead on, soon after the entire coast of Asia is alight with bright flashes and messages.....Beijing hit.....Honk Kong hit......8 million dead.....6 million dead.\n\nAs the last of the SLBM eradicate the last survivors you glance at the scoreboard, excellent you are leading by 50 points. Content you move over to your Pacific fleet to co-ordinate your bombers to deliver another fatal attack on Asia and as you again click on further targets with deadly precission you hear the faint coughs of a woman along with the humming of the loud turbines. Horrified you realise how clean and elegant the deaths you have been presented with. A flash, a confirmation and a number killed. Reality brings you back as you further witness the extermination of the rest of Asia, the whole continent  glows brightly as ALBM's rain upon the cities illuminating the world map.\n\nDespairingly you imagine yourself deep underground, ordering the death of an entire population by a simple click and you don't even see their deaths. Only a small flash and a number killed.","November 26, 2013","true","41.7"," 150 of 156 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","150","156","0","4"

DEFCON: Everybody Dies, the latest title from UK-based Introversion Software, places you in the middle of your very own nuclear bunker, planning the demise of the world above. Surprisingly enough, the most attractive aspect of this game is its simplicity. A single glance at a screenshot will quickly illustrate that this isn't a graphics-intensive game which, like so many on a nearby retail shelf, incite purchases with incredibly realistic rendering.DEFCON is like a game of chess with a deadly spin: a series of units is placed on a pre-defined map and a set of strategic actions take place. However, when the king falls, more than half of the world's population has been killed. As the website suggests, it's not about winning, it's about losing the least. The game divides the world into six territories  which are pitted against each other in an epic struggle of who will press the big red button first.Since the rules of the game are so easy to understand, anybody can quickly join in on the mayhem. As the game timer advances, the DEFCON level increases, changing the combat options of the players.The key element to this game, which Introversion has expertly mastered, is maintaining the atmosphere. No dramatic music is queued when launching your nukes, no explosions challenge your subwoofer when a city is vaporized, and no screams are heard when a few million people die. DEFCON highlights just how easy it is to ignore the painful deaths of half the world's population when you're safely hidden in an underground bunker somewhere, plotting the demise of the enemy.DEFCON has a fairly nice presentation. Both the game's manual and website are built on a very fitting template made to look like a 50 year-old booklet which hasn't been touched since the end of the cold war. The manual reads fairly easily, in part due to the simplicity of the game.The auditory elements of DEFCON are limited at best. The game's atmosphere thrives on solemn low-volume music which just barely breaks an otherwise dreary silence. Whilst the tracks themselves are fairly good and appropriate, most gamers won't really notice unless they really crank up the volume.DEFCON is clearly intended to be played against human players. The variety of tactics and strategies that make this game challenging can only come from human minds. The AI is still respectably intelligent though, if you're not quite ready to challenge real players.Simply put, it's an amazing game. It could be argued that the appeal is limited, as after all, there is only one map to play on. But due to shifting alliances and perceived threats, the game never fails to feel anything but completely fresh.An interesting concept, classic battle graphics and tremendous replayability, this game has it all.","December 9, 2014","true","32.9"," 89 of 103 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","89","103","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucazdaking/recommended/1520/","lucazdaking","☭ LucazDaKing ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucazdaking/","21 products in account","DEFCON, in simple terms, is a simulator/game where you can destroy entire countries and continents by using nuclear weapons to decimate populations and cities whilst watching them burn. You can choose to be either North America (Canada, USA), South America (All South American countries), Africa (All African countries), Asia (Most Asian countries and far east countries), Europe (All European countries) or just Russia (Just russia, duh). There is a DEFCON timer, in which it starts from DEFCON 5 all the way to DEFCON 1, signalling nuclear war. The DEFCON system is a US defence and readiness condition system in which state the military should be readied at, depending on the current condition, five to one. Slowly or very quickly depending on what speed you want it on, the DEFCON level will drop until it reaches DEFCON 1 and nuclear war will begin. The game is based on a film called Wargames (1983) and is about a hacker who gains control of NORAD's nuclear missiles and threatens nuclear war. The GUI and game is very similar to Wargames' control systems and computer simulations. In order to start the game you need to select one of the continents, you can place down radars, missile silos and airbases. Each one of these has a certain strategic importance. Radars can detect incoming nuclear missiles from nuclear submarines or land based silos and show their trajectories. Airbases have the ability to launch fighter and bombers to city targets or fleets of ships in the oceans, the bombers can also drop one nuke onto a city or military target. Silos obviously have the ability to fire up to 10 missiles anywhere at a target. Silos can also become air defence systems in which they will shoot down incoming missiles, fighters and bombers within their range. There is also the ability to place fleets of ships (nuclear missile equipped submarines, battleships and aircraft carriers). Submarines can attack ships on the surface of the sea and sink them and can also fire nukes at cities within a shorter range than silos but they are more stealthy. Battleships are an all-round ship, they can attack all kinds of ships including aircraft. Aircraft carriers can launch nuke bombers to cities or military targets and attack them and launch fighter jets to attack ships. It is also worth mentioning, you can't win. It is impossible to win. As the games motto/slogan says "Everybody Dies". The whole object is to loose the 'least' by having less casualties.  For each 1 million citizens killed, your continent gains 2 points, for every 1 million citizens killed on your continent, you loose 1 point. The game is easy to grasp but can be a bit challenging at times and difficult to use. It does take time to learn, but hey, its really cheap on sales and what isn't good about nuking the ♥♥♥♥ out of Africa?\n\nTL;DR\n11/10 would nuke Africa multiple times again.","June 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","64","70","13","0"

It's an an-and-off relationship, and recently I got back into it a little, and the old fever caught on again!\n\nPro:\n- not much required in terms of specs (although it can blow the fan a lot in certain situations)\n- UI has a great visual design\n- soundtrack is fitting\n- game mechanics depend on other players to work out one way or another: good online games are common\n- interesting game modes, for example: diplomacy. Everyone sees everything at the beginning, being in one team. Who defects first? Lots of maneuvering and chit-chatting among parties and backstabbing! Oh the backstabbing! Boy did we have fun with that!\n- can't strain this enough: the players are awesome and you need to communicate with others in larger games\n- there are some mods out there\n- this is a fun game that at the same time illustrated the madness of nuclear weapons in real life: you juggle multiple millions of lifes around with the press of a button! It's not about winning... it's about losing the least!\n\nMeh:\n- Units need to be selected individually, no C&C-style multi-selection. This makes it extremely fiddly when starting an all-out attack, and you definitely give away that something is going on when slowing down the game speed as is necessary\n- the community is still active, albeit in small numbers: sometimes you need to wait a while to fill a server. once you find a suitable game, it's awesome.\n- usually longer games. my longest was 6 hours real time!\n\nCon:\n- smaller bugs live forever: sometimes units' targets can't be switched in time, and the UI seems unresponsive. Maybe it's a feature but it comes across as a bug because this made me blow up my own stuff by accident more than once.\n\nVerdict:\nGet it. Get it now! 10 bucks are fair for this game. Sometimes it's on sale. GET IT!

The slick, elegant graphics that pay homage, or rather, "totally worship" classic films such as Dr. Strangelove and WarGames, serve their purpose in a most appealing way. You may only see one screen in the vanilla game, but it is more than enough for the sheer beauty DEFCON is.\n\nBackground music also deserve the massive praise - it is simple, minimal, ambient, atmospheric, yet haunting. Haunting is the right word. It is a perfect setting for this game.\nHearing a distant, muffled cry of a woman somewhere in the background while the screen is coldly informing you that you have you just erased millions of lives is an experience no other game offers.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the most important thing, after all - do not be fooled by the looks of the game. It is a complex strategy title, a unique one in the bunch, which doesn't fall back behind any of its genre "collegues".\nThere are many ways to commit nuclear holocaust, many little details and tactical manuveurs to be had - I admit myself that I'm still quite an unskilled player, but seeing the ways I was eradicated of the map and reading several walkthroughs, I can confrim - this game is truly a strategy game.\n\nOnly real flaw of the game is its community, or to be precise, the lack of it.\nI had to wait for more than half an hour, sometimes, to fine an open spot in a game. Creating your own game can result in even more time spent.\nHowever, there are still players, you just need to be a tad bit lucky.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game - if you're interested in an unique experience, picking this up on a sale day is no wrong doing.","February 1, 2014","true","6.6"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

There's just something about strategy games such as these that make me feel in control. "The Life In the Machine" story from the reddit no sleep board described it perfectly:\n\n"People in their daily lives have no control over their environment. They are told what to do, where to go, and how to live. Their jobs consist of standing or sitting somewhere until it's 5 PM and they're allowed to head back home. It's no mystery they're unhappy.\n\nFor many people videogames are an escape to a world where they are in control, or live exciting fake lives filled with adventure. The aspect of control is found in strategy games."\n\nOr in this case, the strategy of nuclear holocausts. Military strategy games in general draw my attention, but the simplicity of this game makes it seem real to people who don't know any better.

(Each jet also has some small amount of radar to let you see enemy silos and Radar)\nYou can only place units until Defcon 3, when battle becomes more intense, and you are allowed to send jets into enemy territory to scan for military bases and whatnot.\nAfter getting to Defcon 1, Nuclear weapons are permitted, and can be launched by Bomber, Silo (Which will prevent the Silo from protecting against incoming jet, bomber, or ICBM.)\nAfter you or them launch, the entire game flashes with the warning that one of the players dared to go launch nuclear missiles, and silos (Or Subs) That are launching them will be revealed to the world, and nuclear missiles will launch, but will only be seen if it's under a general radar of a team..\nA nuclear missile will destroy Radar in one hit, and air bases in two, and silos in three, also destroying half of that building's current housed warfare. (Be it be bombers/fighters or ICBMs)\nA missile, hitting a city, will kill half it's living population, which is usually a a couple million each hit, depending on where you strike.\nDespite a majority of the community is gone, the game is still here, unlike TF2, which is aimed at multiplayer play, this can be played with well programmed AI, of which aren't generic, and actually are quite hard at times.\nThe achieves, however, can't actually be attained form fighting bots, so you have to play online to actually get them, but due to a dwindling community, it's quite hard to find those players, so try to get friends to play if you want to competition against an actual person.","September 6, 2013","true","112.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

Which might seem boring; And it actually is, when it comes to the comparison between killing millions to kill more millions. At this point, Defcon gives you the ability to slaughter the nature itself and unleash the true nature of men; Unleash the savage side of yours upon the entire World. - And, eventually, turn our little blue and green *heaven* into a dust.\n\nWith its minimalist and just-enough artstyle, Defcon is one of those games that will never get old.","October 25, 2014","true","1.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

In the New Update yosimite the game will not start. well it does start but goes to a screen saying checking authentication then quits. when i bought this game i was looking forward to playing on my mac book but sadly i can't now. Luckly on our families desktop mac we had not updated it yet to yosimite and it worked. So it is safe to say it works on Mavericks not Yosimites. Hopefully this problem will be fixed in future.\n\nExcept from this bug i found that this game was fantastic and i recomend it to anyone who likes tatical nuking of other coutries.\n\nI give this game 9/10 when it works\n\nHopefully this review has helped somone about to buy this game decide weather to buy it or not and remember if you have yosimite you Probaly should wait till it is fixed.","April 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

It is really hard to find a match, and when you do nobody ever speeds it up. The best part of this game is mulltiplayer (Just like Civ) because, at least in my mind, it is way more fun playing with a person you can actually talk to and strategize against - and maybe even ally with. The computers (or should I call them mindless drones?) will never befriend you, always act the same, and it always feels the same.\n\nI personally think that it would be way better if more people played. However, the game is still fun, even in sungleplayer.\nDue to the deep strategy you (may) be able to incorporate in singleplayer or multiplayer, it is still a good game. More of a timekiller for me, but if I find a match its on.\n\nI still have to recommend - maybe more people will start playing multiplayer sometome.\n\n7/10\n\nEDIT: Eh, more like\n\n7.8/10 - Earth probably has too much water anyway.","December 14, 2014","true","33.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When i picked it up I was not really sure what type of RTS it would be. I can say after some initial confusion it exceeded my expectation.\n\nI am a fan of C&C, WarCraft, StarCraft and AoE type RTS games. Ones with resource gathering and elaborate tech trees. So when I started playing Deacon I was NOT in familiar territory. In fact my first play session I was so confused on the most basic controls that I lost 95m people without landing a single nuke on my enemy. I thought the game was broken…\n… but then I cam back and tried again. I learned more each subsequent match until i FINALLY won!\n\nOnce you figure out the ins and outs of the game it is very rewarding. All sides start with the exact same resources and do not get anymore. It is all about unit placement (and starting territory) and then how you move and deploy them.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is not a more robust skirmish mode that allowed the user to make more unique scenarios.\n\nIf you like chess, the movie war-games or planning a nuclear winter, this is the game for you!\n","June 29, 2015","true","43.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Only instead of the USA and Russia being the ones who are having that cold war they could be any or all out of a preset of North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia. The only thing in front of you is a screen and possibly some high-rated generals. This is your "war room" At your disposal are radar-stations, airbases, nuke-silo's, and quite a few naval vessels. The carriers carry planes, the battleships battle, and the submarines do what submarines do. Best get your war face on, get your combat vessels in the ready, prepare for the inevitable nukes that soon will be flying overhead on this map. Send your battleships to engage other battleships, which in turn also carry nukes so you can guess what happens if they make it to the shore of your terretory. Submarines can do the same but they are below the surface, it is to anyones guess where they might hang out, untill they surface and drop a few nukes up the undefended side of your area. Fighter/Interceptor planes are best used in the sky because they can shoot down incoming bomber-aircraft from your opponent and incoming long-range nukes, unless if they can be shot down themselves. It is a game where you get twofold the points for anything you kill, and lose onefold the points for anything you lose.\n\nThis game will no doubt be very interesting upcoming LAN party, it will run on an old laptop of mine and as such will be running this game from the edge of my table, running the "diplomacy" game-type. In that game-type you're allied to everyone in the game, untill anyone decides to leave the alliance ( perhaps start a different one with a different player ? ). Scoring is determined on the amount of survivors left in your area instead of normal "scoring". And like with any game-type it takes 12 minutes to set up your pieces on the board, after that hostile actions are allowed, and after 30 minutes nukes are allowed. Playing this in real-time instead of fast or faster speed as is usually the case on many multiplayer games ( The speed can be changed by the press of a button ) should give the nessesary "why do you break the alliance now ? You know I just started on my pizza !" funtimes :)\n\nIn the end though, every game stops when 80% of all assets are destroyed, which can take infinitely long with the diplomacy game-type.\n\nEverybody dies.

It is a fun lovechild of Missile Command and Risk. You pick your country region, try to deploy as much of your bases/equiment and fleet during the "cold" war, then either declare war or respond to it. It is very fun and enjoyable. The music and sound effects put you in the feel of things and can be very stark and haunting as well. I have yet to see another game quite like this. There are simmilar games but this is the best missile war game I believe. Its more on the arcade side, so hardcore strategists may not enjoy this as much. One additional nice feature, speed up time.

And sometimes this feeling comes at a time that you are fascinated by the whole concept of neon-glow. DEFCON is an atmospheric/minimalistic approach to the time honored wargame genre. It does not exault in the slaughter of millions as so many games do. All it provides are the bare statistics of all those you killed at the push of a button, and a rather haunting soundtrack to give you the full understanding of what you have just done. Some games push realism in wargames through more and more complex and life-like gore, but as we all know, society is a master of desensitizing itself in the face of horror. Thus DEFCON proves that thought-provoking and yet satisfying gameplay CAN and does exist in the surreal sub-genre.\nEnvoy RATED: 10/10","December 5, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So i reversed the few options i had changed in order to start the process again and see what was going on, but sadly from there on out i was never able (or allowed it seems) to get back into 1920x1080 fullscreen.\n\nHaving only bought the game for 0.59p i can't say I'm feeling the loss, but then no one in their right mind would pay for a bad experience would they?... i guess if you are a liberal you would, but for the rest of us who aren't mentally defective liberals we don't want to.\n\nIf they were to update this with modern graphics and a command center view which isn't done in retro Atari 2bit style, then i might take a look at that game, otherwise, if you are looking to get this, you'll probably only play a couple of 'rounds' and then think why you just wasted your pennies on it.\n\nUPDATE: I decided to look for mods, since mods make the world go round an all. Ok so i discovered a mod called 'SatCon' which does away with the Atari darkness, and gives a proper view as if from space with the landmasses coloured and the seas represented in blue. Much better right away.\n\nHere is the link for the mod:\nhttp://www.introversion.co.uk/defcon/mods/\n\nAll you have to do is make a folder in the main DEFCON folder called Mods (if there wasn't one already like in my case), then unpack/unzip the mod you downloaded into that, then start the game up and choose Mods from the menu, then activate that mod and job done.\n\nNow I'll look for mods which give a proper representation of each of the nations powers, i mean, the US certainly has more than 7 radar stations and 6 nuclear weapons facilities to launch nukes from.\n\nAnyway, I'm going to change my not recommended vote to a recommended vote, next time I'll be sure to look into mods for a game before voting good or bad. Still though, this isn't really a deep detailed global war sim, more something along the lines of a game for your tablet device. I got it for 0.59p so i really shouldn't give a negative vote because it isn't at all bad, just not as detailed and deep as I'd like it to be.","December 19, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As gamers we've slain zombies, killed Nazi's and even exploded innocent towns in fallout.  And yet, through all the years of gore and hyperviolence this simple vectorized representation of the world has made me feel more guilt than any video game I've played.  This game is unsettling to it's core and has made a huge impact on me.\n\nThe soundtrack is, in my opinion, perfection and lends a staggering amount of gravitas and torment to the game.  Even when you're winning, it is disturbing to think you so easily caused 5.8 million deaths in Tokyo.  In the background you hear the final gasping cough of a women as she succumbs to radiation poisoning or the cry of a mother over the death of her newborn.\n\nEven if unintended, this game makes a moving and bold statement, all represented by a very detached and matter-of-fact way.\n\nAt least try the demo!","February 10, 2011","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirstrobey/recommended/1520/","sirstrobey","Stroberry <SteelSeries>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirstrobey/","54 products in account","DEFCON, in simple terms, is a simulator/game where you can destroy entire countries and continents by using nuclear weapons to decimate populations and cities whilst watching them burn. You can choose to be either North America (Canada, USA), South America (All South American countries), Africa (All African countries), Asia (Most Asian countries and far east countries), Europe (All European countries) or just Russia (Just russia, duh). There is a DEFCON timer, in which it starts from DEFCON 5 all the way to DEFCON 1, signalling nuclear war. The DEFCON system is a US defence and readiness condition system in which state the military should be readied at, depending on the current condition, five to one. Slowly or very quickly depending on what speed you want it on, the DEFCON level will drop until it reaches DEFCON 1 and nuclear war will begin. The game is based on a film called Wargames (1983) and is about a hacker who gains control of NORAD's nuclear missiles and threatens nuclear war. The GUI and game is very similar to Wargames' control systems and computer simulations. In order to start the game you need to select one of the continents, you can place down radars, missile silos and airbases. Each one of these has a certain strategic importance. Radars can detect incoming nuclear missiles from nuclear submarines or land based silos and show their trajectories. Airbases have the ability to launch fighter and bombers to city targets or fleets of ships in the oceans, the bombers can also drop one nuke onto a city or military target. Silos obviously have the ability to fire up to 10 missiles anywhere at a target. Silos can also become air defence systems in which they will shoot down incoming missiles, fighters and bombers within their range. There is also the ability to place fleets of ships (nuclear missile equipped submarines, battleships and aircraft carriers). Submarines can attack ships on the surface of the sea and sink them and can also fire nukes at cities within a shorter range than silos but they are more stealthy. Battleships are an all-round ship, they can attack all kinds of ships including aircraft. Aircraft carriers can launch nuke bombers to cities or military targets and attack them and launch fighter jets to attack ships. It is also worth mentioning, you can't win. It is impossible to win. As the games motto/slogan says "Everybody Dies". The whole object is to loose the 'least' by having less casualties. For each 1 million citizens killed, your continent gains 2 points, for every 1 million citizens killed on your continent, you loose 1 point. The game is easy to grasp but can be a bit challenging at times and difficult to use. It does take time to learn, but hey, its really cheap on sales and what isn't good about nuking the ♥♥♥♥ out of Africa?\n\nTL;DR\n11/10 would nuke multiple times again.\n","December 10, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However, if you like the former, then keep reading.\n\nImagine being in an underground bunker, for say the United States, and there was a massive series of crisis that unfolded. Your clock ticks ever so slowly towards zero as Defcon 4 approaches. You start mobilizing your navy to try to defend your coasts against the inevitable assault against your country. You establish airfields and silos along the coastline and close to your cities, so you can protect them. It's Defcon 3 now, and the enemy started to mobilize their forces against each other. Only 5 minutes later a battle fleet has come into radar range of your fleet. Your fleets start to open fire, aircraft carriers launching bombers and fighters while your battleships launch cruise missiles and fire massive guns at your enemy. It's Defcon 2 now, and you are being attacked from the east and the west. Finally, it reaches DEFCON 1. You hear a woman crying in the background, knowing that she is disturbed greatly by the outcome of the events beforehand. You start opening your missile silos and launch multiple nukes at your nearest enemy: Europe. Luckily, you had an alliance with South America, who was helping you defend against the enemy assault. However, 10 minutes after you launch a salvo of nukes, your radar detects a nuke heading towards your country. That nuke becomes 2, then 3, then 6. Your radar detects even more nukes coming from Europe. You then detect a strategic missile sub off the East coast, but you destroy it with depth charges before it can fire. However, you then see a wave of nuke bombers coming from Europe. Your defenses are spread thin, and only 2 bombers were shot down before they fired. You then launch almost every nuke you have against Europe, only to realize that Russia has also fought against you. You launch your last nukes at Russia, only to watch 10 nukes land in Europe successfully, of the 25 you have launched. You then admit defeat as tens of nukes tear your country apart in a glorious storm of radiation and fire, killing almost every human left in your country.\n\nThis is what you will experience in DEFCON. What I didn't mention in this, is the atmosphere is EXTREMELY effective at what it does. The occasional woman crying in the background, and the ominous, and slightly creepy, soundtrack just makes you feel remorse, even dread, just for launching fake nukes at a fake country. Yeah, it's THAT powerful of an experience. Hell, the game even comes with a manual on how to survive a nuclear war.","December 8, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

It isn't word for word realistic *How did Europe become one country? Why is Mexico conisdered a part of South America? Who the hell gave the Africans nukes? But aside from that. It is very balanced, and fun. It really has a horrifying nuclear end of the world feel to it. It takes place represented by a cold blu and black global map, with soft crying, screaming, and coughing. And very sad and somber music.                           Also, in global nuclear war, all that matters is your airforce, navy, and nukes. Armies mean nothing. On the surface, anyone can play and do a pretty decent job of it, but it takes a lot of skill to master it.                                                                                                                                               Overall, DEFCON is a very good game, in global nuclear war, nobody really wins, but maybe instead of your country being turned into a charred radioactive wasteland, maybe just 3/4 of it collapse from being blasted by nukes, and the remaining 1/4 is shaky, battered, a bit of radiation, but still standing, and life can go on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/1520/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","DEFCON borrows some of its lore and most of its appearance from portions of the movie WarGames. The multi player scene is still active, and it is very easy to find open matches with all kinds of different settings. Personally, I prefer playing against the CPU, much like in the movie. The map is fairly accurate, depicting the geopolitical era of the Cold War. Implementing orders to your units can sometimes be confusing and inadequate, but with enough attempts, you become used to the interface, and will be able to do all of the game's strategical requirements. What is most valuable in DEFCON is the replay ability. Certainly, each match has an ending, but the game truly shines when you play it repeatedly; alone or online. Winning is not easy. Several things must go right, and occur at specific moments in order to be successful. Because of these timing issues, sometimes you will win or lose depending on how quickly or how slowly your units execute orders in conjunction with timers. Nuking cities and other strategic locations doesn't exactly feel like you are killing people. There isn't very much tension. It all just feels like you are clicking around on the map and delegating orders. The feeling that lives are actually being lost is not truly present. At the end of each match, you will be shown a small statistics screen with how much of the enemy population you have killed, how many of your population have been killed, and so on. Each match takes between 15 to 20 minutes to complete, and it often feels like each instance ends abruptly without much of a climax or excitement in the confrontations. The entire atmosphere is very cold and impersonal. Setting up a new single player match means you will have to go into the advanced settings every single time in order to change a few options to single player mode. The default (which can't be permanently altered) is set to multi player, broadcasting your match as public. This is quite annoying and should not have been programmed as such. I am certain that there are many DEFCON players that prefer single player mode and this preference should not be hindered by permanently set options from the developers. The longevity of DEFCON is dependent entirely on the player's interest in its short matches, be it single player or multi player. Besides your initial location on the match, it feels like every single match is played almost exactly the same, with very little occurring differently or alternatively. The strategies necessary to play this game are limited and basic, regardless of whether you win or lose. The only major change as you become better at the game is that you will begin winning, but this does not mean each match will be played differently, or go through a different turn of events. As repetitive as it is, there is a small amount of entertainment gained from playing DEFCON for more than three or so matches at a time. The gaming experience quickly becomes dull, repetitive, tiresome, and almost identical to every other match you play. DEFCON is best played in short bursts in order to preserve its replay ability. Seriously lacking in variety, this diversion is suited for fast breaks and brief encounters.\n\nDEFCON is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Finally I could play the “WarGame”.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nBeing a gamer, I naturally was like “eh, tutorials, I don’t need those.” However, this is one of those games where you do need those without them telling you. And boy is that tutorial lengthy. So, 6 chapters and 30 minutes later I was thrown into the 7th chapter: use what you’ve learned to defeat this extremely-easy AI. Oh wait, did we say easy? We meant hard. as. ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and I still really didn’t grasp the game.\n\nWell, that was demoralizing.\n\nThing is, officially DEFCON is a multiplayer game. It’s possible to play against the AI, but that’s even harder than in the tutorial. When you keep in mind that one can’t complete the tutorial because the AI is too hard, you get really depressing ideas about what the AI in the actual game is like.\n\nBut it’s a multiplayer game right? So why not just face other players? Yeah, about that… There aren’t any other players, really. You’re going to need a friend to play, if they’re willing to play this ♥♥♥♥ at all.\n\nThing is, the game was “inspired by the infamous 1983 movie WarGames.” So, naturally, I had big expectations. I knew that I probably wasn’t going to play against Joshua, but still. When you make a game inspired by a movie about computer from the MS-DOS era, at least make the graphics resemble that era. Don’t make elaborate maps with perfect borders – make them liney and polygonal. Don’t make elaborate icons – make sure that the game looks like it could run on MS-DOS.\n\nSo what are you supposed to do? Well, the game starts off at DEFCON 5. It’s time to build a military defense system. Place missile silos, create fleets, create military airports, place radars. You know – a defense system.\n\nMany actions don’t unlock until you hit a certain DEFCON level. For example, you can’t dispatch planes until DEFCON 3, and nukes can of course only be launched at DEFCON 1.\n\nNow this is the point where you expect hell to be unleashed. Nope, that’ll take a while. You can use missiles to explode nukes in the air (because the radioactive material totally won’t fall on your territory if that happens above land), but it takes a while for those nukes to come. You can try to strike first – but if you’re Europe and your enemy is North America then you’re screwed because you’ll need nuclear submarines, and once those get above the surface they get destroyed because they’re suddenly visible.\n\nIt’s also really not clear what the goal of the game is. My best guess is “destroy the enemy’s cities” – but that’s damn near impossible because I needed all my nukes to destroy New York (I had like 40 nukes). So what then? “Destroy the enemy’s defense systems”? That might be possible. I’d rather just know instead of having to guess though.\n\nI feel incredibly let down by this game. It’s just not fun. There’s also some kind of alliance feature for when you play with 3 or 4 players, but I didn’t get to test it out because I didn’t grasp the game and only have one friend to play it with (and he uses the demo).\n\nKnow what I miss most? The command prompt. That stuff was awesome about the movie. It would’ve allowed for some great references as well. A missed opportunity.\n\nSo, all in all, this game is a huge letdown. It fails to deliver what looks like a fun game, and falls short on many aspects. Too bad, guys, too bad.\n\nScore: 4/10","November 25, 2013","false","0.6"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/recommended/1520/","dracohandsome","DracoHandsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/","207 products in account","DEFCON is an incredibly depressing, boring, bland, poorly designed, cheeky, insulting parody of real-time strategy games whose primary gameplay focuses on not having any care whatsoever for what happens during a round (read: the polar opposite of what you usually do when playing any game ever.)\n\nDue to its extreme callousness and its abhorrent, hamfisted gameplay, DEFCON is among a small collection of software calling itself a game that actually makes me angry every second that I am playing it (the only other I can name right now is The Stanley Parable.) That is because I cannot accept that someone was actually callous and asinine enough to put untold effort into this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and put it out with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, or that there are people in the world who actually enjoy watching this game.\n\nNote I didn't say playing this game, because that isn't really a thing you do.\n\nEach player is assigned a general region of the world in which they may place a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ they should not condone any attachment or value to. It seems to be that the only attacks you have are battleships, submarines, silos, and aircraft, the last of which are launched from carriers and airports.\n\nThe game will begin in DEFCON 5 and eventually progress to DEFCON 1.\n\nDEFCON 5: (Placement phase) No hostile actions are permitted; enemy units are completely invisible\nDEFCON 4: (Placement phase) Enemy units become visible to Radars / ships / planes\nDEFCON 3: Ships and planes may now attack\nDEFCON 2: APPARENTLY ♥♥♥♥ING POINTLESS AS NOTHING CHANGES\nDEFCON 1: Nukes may be launched (silos, subs)\nDEFCON 0: Basically if DEFCON 1 goes on for too long the war ends automatically and whoever's the least dead wins.\n\nYou will quickly find that the game WILL NOT ♥♥♥♥ING LET YOU PLACE UNITS except under incredibly specific criteria. That is, you have to click-hunt until you find a spot you can actually put something. This is most obvious when placing seacraft, because they have to be within your territory but also in fairly deep water, which is probably like 5% of your ♥♥♥♥ing territory.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is that it is little more than a long-exposure camera simulator. You are playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, nigh-unintelligible projection map based on some classic movie because creators who aren't able to make their own iconic content just poorly mooch off of someone else's already popular work (see Chris-chan, Borderlands 2's writing, etc.) You will give a few orders and then sit there and wait while their trails sloooowly fill the screen as they go do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing why do I even care in a game that tells me flat-out that nobody's going to win.\n\nThe projection map has a small problem called "you can't see jack ♥♥♥♥". This can be abated by toggling on or off the KIND OF IMPORTANT WHETHER THEY ARE ON OR OFF OVERLAYS that do such things as show you your radar range and where everyone's territory is, as this can affect how much the unit icons blend in with the background by shoving highlights and ♥♥♥♥ everywhere.\n\nI wish I could write more but I cannot stand playing this hunk of YOLO crap long enough to obtain further information on it.\n\nI honestly can't tell who this game is supposed to be marketed to. It's completely uninteresting and underwhelming in every possible way, and its message is an explicit mockery of human suffering.\n\nDon't play this if you have any respect for games or humanity at all. It's filthy.","December 30, 2014","false","0.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Completely unrealistic time-turn based combat where the computer always makes the right move and you can never win. The creator of this piece of junk has never read a book related to naval warfare in his entire life. This game does not follow any standardised military tactics whatsoever and seems to have been programmed by an idiot. In reality naval warships can attack land based targets quite easily. But not in this game. Also there is a thing called a Stealth Bomber which is impervious to any forms of radar detection and flies so high up in the atmosphere that land based missles can never reach it. But not in this game. Total waste of money. Do not buy, the childish gameplay will only aggrivate you. This is a game designed to steal your money not to bring you an entertaining experience.

Defcon 4 the radar starts to work. At Defcon 3 players can't build anymore but by then they should be trying to explore a little with the navy and find out the best places to attack when Defcon 1 is reached and players can finally deploy nukes. Single player Defcon gets really old fast but playing multiplayer can be really fun as players can make alliances with friends and attack their enemies together or turn on one another in the midst of conflict.\nMultiplayer also has some great alternatives to play like Office mode where the game is played in real time so it can take 6+ hours to finish and also if the player need to hide the game from the boss they just need to press Esc and the game is minimized and a word document is opened. Speed mode is what is sounds like as the game can finish in under 30 minutes and Diplomacy mode is where all players are on the same team and can see everything until one breaks off and attacks.\nGraphics are minimal but really stylish in bringing a real life WarGame game.\nSound is really simple and subtle that is makes you feel like the player isn't really playing game but playing real nuclear war.\nOverall the game is really good and can be found for under $20 some places so it's also a great buy.\n\n8/10","July 12, 2012","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought this had a single player mode - being as it's very old. My PC has high specs and is running Win 7 64. Maybe it doesn't run well on that operating system?

Defcon 4 the radar starts to work. At Defcon 3 players can't build anymore but by then they should be trying to explore a little with the navy and find out the best places to attack when Defcon 1 is reached and players can finally deploy nukes. Single player Defcon gets really old fast but playing multiplayer can be really fun as players can make alliances with friends and attack their enemies together or turn on one another in the midst of conflict.\nMultiplayer also has some great alternatives to play like Office mode where the game is played in real time so it can take 6+ hours to finish and also if the player need to hide the game from the boss they just need to press Esc and the game is minimized and a word document is opened. Speed mode is what is sounds like as the game can finish in under 30 minutes and Diplomacy mode is where all players are on the same team and can see everything until one breaks off and attacks.\nGraphics are minimal but really stylish in bringing a real life WarGame game.\nSound is really simple and subtle that is makes you feel like the player isn't really playing game but playing real nuclear war.\nOverall the game is really good and can be found for under $20 some places so it's also a great buy.\n\n8/10","July 12, 2012","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is, put simply, just beautiful! Granted, it's not a game you'd want to play for a long time, but trying to win against your friends in this game can be surprisingly challenging and fun. You just never know what your opponent might do next and you find yourself rooting everytime when one of your nukes finally gets through and destroys that pesky air base of your enemy. Alot of the appeal for me comes from the uncertainty where the enemy fleets, bases etc. might be. It is alot like playing a good round of Battleship, but modernized and increased to a global scale. In any case, Nuclear War never has been more beautiful and if you got a friend to play against, then get it. Multiple players are supported too, and you can even forge alliances (and, if you like, backstab)","November 30, 2011","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stoutwater/recommended/1520/","stoutwater","Meezermouser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stoutwater/","166 products in account","DEFCON is all about the most hypothesized and alluded to cause of the end of the world in popular culture: nuclear war. You are cast in the role of a high-ranking general from a mega-nation (like the European Union or the African Union) that has the ultimate goal of not dying as much as everyone else when the nukes start flying. What an original concept! There's no resources to collect or money to spend, just your bombs and their bombs, and nuclear annihilation. No surprise the subtitle of the game is "Everybody Dies". For having such a simple game design it's surprising how challenging and entertaining DEFCON can be. During the entire game you are situated in front of a world map that looks purposefully like something USSPACECOM might use during a nuclear war--with appropriately picked displays and sounds--even machine noises running in the background. You can also write on the map if you have battle plans and see fallout from detonations. It really makes you feel like you're locked down in a sophisticated military bunker somewhere, intently watching the monitor, waiting for the inevitable as you give the order to launch mass destruction.\n\nDEFCON follows DEFCON which is actually a five-phase/level state of alert system used by the United States to describe its level of preparedness for military situations. In-game the phases begin consecutively after a countdown of allotted time that you can choose to speed up or slow down. During each level you are restricted to undertaking certain actions. These restrictions are lifted as you progress through the different phases. For instance, in DEFCON 5 you are only allowed to strategically place radar, air force, missile, and naval assets. In DEFCON 3 you are allowed to have conventional naval and airborne combat. And in the final phase, DEFCON 1, you are permitted to start the nuclear holocaust from missile silos, nuclear submarines, and bombers. The ultimate goal is to have the highest population kill count (which sounds horrible). The action can escalate quickly and it is truly a sight to behold when you witness missile launches all over the world, creating webs of color, and watch the dashed tracers of missiles as they slowly seek out their targets. The audio and soundtrack do a wonderful job of setting the atmosphere, spine-tingling, especially after you just destroyed a population center, see the bright explosion with the tallied dead, and the faint cry of a women in the background. DEFCON usually turns into a game of chicken to see who blinks first. That's because when you decide to launch your nuclear payload and by what degree can make all the difference in the world, no pun intended. This psychological warfare can intensify if you have the full number of players and nobody is an ally or they're multiple alliances.\n\nI recommend DEFCON and for the price, the soundtrack as well. DEFCON is an easy game to pick up but difficult to master. Finding online players will be a challenge but you can always actively seek out people to play with via the forums or other resources, buy the game for some of your friends, or just play the AI. Either way I still would give it a try.","April 11, 2013","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmeindustries/recommended/1520/","tmeindustries","The Centipede","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmeindustries/","274 products in account","DEFCON has to hold a special place in the hearts of people who lived through the last decade of the Cold War, especially around the WarGames era of the early 1980s since the game is inspired greatly by that film. The thing it gets most about the era is the tone. DEFCON can be a distinctly uncomfortable game to play, coming from a background that includes growing up on Soviet missile targets and preparing for a career as a missileer, fortunately (I now see with the luck of hindsight) cut short. This discomfort is a very good thing, as I'll explain.\n\nThe visuals are reminiscent of the vector graphics of the era but, more importantly, add a clinical detachment to what it represents. The bombers, fighters, carriers, battleships, subs, airbases, missile complexes, and radar facilities under your command are all crewed. Thousands of people are working through the game-hours to fight this war--ultimately and obscenely senseless because there is no indication as to what political situation caused it--and they are simple vector icons to be poked at by other, smaller missile icons until they vanish in a little white burst. Cities are filled with millions of civilians and are just simple diamonds that report so many millions killed with each white-burst NUCFLASH (I don't think I need to decode that term; say it aloud if it escapes you). The default settings leave a sickly green glow afterwards, increasing in intensity and representing radiation, though it doesn't model fallout patterns since it's not that kind of game, and this is a very dry, very abstract and unsettling way of emphasizing the lingering destruction left by this global thermonuclear conflict.\n\nExtra credit goes to the sound design. Much like CAPSULE, DEFCON goes for 'theatre of the mind' sensibilities by intentionally leaving the graphics very basic and hitting you with well-done sound. In this case, the music is soft, in minor key, and discordant (and it may be just me, but it gets more so as the world situation destabilizes and the missiles fly). At times, it is accompanied by a very quiet woman weeping. Nuclear detonations are highlighted with, again, very soft noises that could only considered explosions if heard through kilometers of rock: low, prolonged, steady noise.\n\nDEFCON is not actually a nuclear war simulator; it is a nuclear war game and as such is distinctly simplified. Fighters kill bombers, bombers kill battleships, battleships kill fighters. Battleships kill carriers, carriers kill subs, subs kill battleships. No one has forward intelligence on anyone's (other than allies') facilities, and missile complexes are also somehow anti-missile systems. One shouldn't expect realism. However, it does capture the fundamentals of atomic war strategy in terms of nuclear triads (air, sea, and land-deployable atomics) first strike versus second strike and counterforce (hitting the enemy's arsenal) versus countervalue (hitting the enemy's cities). Perhaps the most perverse part of DEFCON, and what elevates it from simple game to an actual teaching tool, is how it accidentally illustrates how changing the scoring mechanism changes the tactics involved: scoring by defending your own citizens leads to counterforce strategies, scoring by killing others shifts to countervalue. It's a remarkably well-balanced game and I've seen various strategies, from counterforce first-strike to countervalue second-strike to staggered reserves, win.\n\nWhich brings us to the scariest part of DEFCON. It is a game; it is to be won. Most people, playing it for laughs, will happily backstab their alliances and set people against each other to get the highest score. This is recognized as part of the game. However, the people who play DEFCON and the people behind various national atomic strategies are not so very different; the former may be civilians and the latter professionals, but they're all human beings with the ingrained desire to win. In broad, human terms DEFCON makes the same point as Spec Ops: The Line (albeit more succinctly and earlier) that the only way to win is not to play, but "winning" is as arbitrarily defined as whatever conflict lead to the simulated atomic exchange to begin with--and in that sense, the winning strategy is taken off the table. The global alert state goes from peace to war on a timer, with no stepping back from the staged brinks. Escalation is inevitable and mandatory.\n\nOf course, this is necessary in the sense of making a game. Given my background, however, that inevitable escalation, bereft of any context or meaning to the war to end all wars, that scares me most. Luckily, I like being scared and even as a guy with a pretense to thinking I can fully recommend this game.","March 7, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not DEFCON. This takes the pure strategy approach to Mutually Assured Destruction, putting you in the seat of the head of state who gets to sit safely in some bunker while they watch the body count rise in the millions. It's very challenging, but also haunting when you really realize what you're doing exactly.\n\nThis is one of those simple games that is simple to get the concept of, but it takes a long time to really get the hang of it. Anyone expecting a grand victory for moderate work is going to be disappointed, as fortunes can change quickly from overwhelmingly good to horrifically bad in one salvo or even one white-hot nuke detonation. There's some initial challenge when you are learning the control interface, but with practice you can quickly issue orders and begin to focus more on strategy.\n\nThe best comparison I can come up with is the ages-old game of Chess. It's simple, it lacks flash and thunder, but if you are willing to apply your braincells, you can orchestrate victory for your nation. Whether you feel good for laying waste to millions of civilians or not is a whole other question...","March 1, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's coming and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The whole game is played out on a world map that resembles a NORAD command display. There are no fancy 3D graphics, just clean vector lines. It's pretty chilling, especially considering that the folks who would have to do this in reality would be looking at something quite similar.\n\nThere are many, many strategic decisions to be made over the course of one game. You have to manage your naval and air forces intelligently, and plan where and when you will launch from your silos.\n\nIt plays slowly and deliberately and requires some patience, but is worth it in the end.","December 29, 2011","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it has a lot to do with the community dying out and fresh blood being scared off by the old players with tons of experience blitzing them with ease. The enjoyment factor of getting owned is pretty much zero here, though sometimes getting owned feels intriguing and compells you to try again, but I think in this case you look at it and think, well he/she has pretty much done this 1,000 times, I don't see any intelligence to this as I hoped or expected.\n\nAny strategy game, whether it's a board game like Chess or an online fictional game like Age of Empires needs a rating system, such as Elo - in my opinion. I think this could have helped people stay on, as having a competitive factor keeps people interested and also at the same time most importantly keeps the very good players seperated from the very new and that's the ONE thing I would look into when trying to revitalize this game, but I guess the developers have long gone?","September 7, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it has a lot to do with the community dying out and fresh blood being scared off by the old players with tons of experience blitzing them with ease. The enjoyment factor of getting owned is pretty much zero here, though sometimes getting owned feels intriguing and compells you to try again, but I think in this case you look at it and think, well he/she has pretty much done this 1,000 times, I don't see any intelligence to this as I hoped or expected.\n\nAny strategy game, whether it's a board game like Chess or an online fictional game like Age of Empires needs a rating system, such as Elo - in my opinion. I think this could have helped people stay on, as having a competitive factor keeps people interested and also at the same time most importantly keeps the very good players seperated from the very new and that's the ONE thing I would look into when trying to revitalize this game, but I guess the developers have long gone?","September 7, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is, put simply, just beautiful! Granted, it's not a game you'd want to play for a long time, but trying to win against your friends in this game can be surprisingly challenging and fun. You just never know what your opponent might do next and you find yourself rooting everytime when one of your nukes finally gets through and destroys that pesky air base of your enemy. Alot of the appeal for me comes from the uncertainty where the enemy fleets, bases etc. might be. It is alot like playing a good round of Battleship, but modernized and increased to a global scale. In any case, Nuclear War never has been more beautiful and if you got a friend to play against, then get it.

You station your radar stations, silos, fleets and airbases in your terrority and then you slowly wait for DEFCON 1 to nuke your enemy, all while bombing cities with bombers, shooting down enemy bombers with fighters and blowing up submersibles (Submarines) with depth charges.

It seems that it appeals to a sense of nostalgia, although I do love the simplicity of the strategy and the overall design.\n\nThe music is wonderful and ambient, it really sets the mood and to me is probably one of the stongest elements of the game.\n\nThe game itself was part of a bundle and so the price I pretty good in terms of value, however the problems for me are with the gameplay itself.\n\nThe tutorials do give you the very bare bones basics, but really does not prepare you that well for what is coming. I enjoy a good learning curve and a good difficulty, but honestly I cannot say that the tutorials really helped that much.\n\nI think the problem with this game is that the strategy element is during the placement phase and if you place your units and elements incorrect at the beginning then the game is as good as lost, no matter how well you play after that.\n\nI had to laugh at one bug, which I screenshotted, I had won a game, and was waiting for the victory timer, after the timer ran out the scores changed, giving me a nice loss. I guess there really are no winners in war.\n\nThis game for a casual player like myself, has a learning curve that is just to steep, and gets pretty repetitive pretty fast. I'll bet if you are in to deep strategy games and were to read though pages of guides and websiges for how to best counter and place units etc then you may get a lot more out of this game, But I just cannot spend time doing that at the moment, I may take a look at a later date when I have time to look through some guides, and I'm sure the multiplayer element may be more fun.\n\nI found the most fun for me was watching the rolling demo's and predicting who would win, the music is great as an ambient background noise, it was actually quite relaxing, I can see me watching some of those when I don't feel like actually playing any games myself.\n\nOverall I perhaps expected too much, but this one just wasn't for me, not at the moment anyway.","March 2, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
