There's a saying that simplicity is the key to brilliance, and that completely applies here.  Everything from the story and gameplay to graphics and music is very minimal, but all come together to create something more magical than flashier games are able to achieve.\n\nOur story is fairly basic, a little girl sleeps soundly in her room when a monstrous spider sneaks in through the wardrobe and steals her teddy bear.  Venturing into the wardrobe to a dream-like world full of dangerous creatures and beautiful landscapes, she must find the spider and rescue teddy.  That's all we are given to lead us through the game, and despite the very simple premise, it works.\n\nThe mechanics is your basic adventure puzzle fair of finding items and using them on objects and creatures to further your progression through the game world. There is no written dialogue or item descriptions, so a bit of trial and error willl be needed for some puzzles.  Despite not having anything spelled out for you, there is a logic at play in specifically the music puzzles; as you slowly figure out the method, everything begins to make sense and the dream world in which you're lost doesn't seem quite as enigmatic as before. This unveiling is accomplished so deftly, it's difficult to explain without destroying the sense of discovery in figuring it out yourself, so I will just leave the point here.\n\nMusically, the soundscape is atmospherically ambient with subdued melodies that resonate an ethereal, dream-like quality. This complements the strange and mysterious game world and creates a base for the melodies in the music puzzles.\n\nHand-made pixel graphics make up the world you explore.  Knowing that the artists designed every image pixel by pixel is awe inspiring.  The colorful palette and gorgeous visual style incorporates impressionistic geometrical elements that give off an otherworldly feel. Everything from the landscapes to character and creature designs are imaginatively conceived, with the final world featuring some of the most creative imagery I've seen from pixel graphics. And to think this game was developed in only 4 months time...\n\nI have very little to complain about as I feel the design is perfect for what it accomplishes.  Some may find the lack of instruction or direction to be frustrating, but I believe this was a design choice meant to enhance gameplay and impress upon the player a sense of being lost in a strange world. I came across a few bugs in which the game froze or crashed, but didn't seem to be able to recreate those situations after coming back to it later.  Outside of those few bugs, there's not much I consider at fault with the game.\n\nAll said, I feel every element of Finding Teddy comes together so perfectly that it elevates the game to a digital work of art. $6.99 for 3+ hours of immense enjoyment seems very fair to me, although it has been featured in numerous bundles for a fraction of that cost and sees frequent sales.  Either way, if you are looking for a beautiful game with a simple yet unique take on the adventure genre, I highly recommend picking this one up.","September 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 98 of 110 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","98","110","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/259600/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Have you ever met a really pretty girl that you wanted to get to know better, but once you actually started talking to her you realised she was in fact bloody awful and all you wanted to do was get as far away from her as possible and never talk to her again? That's almost exactly what playing this game is like. I had really high hopes for it as I loved the art style and the trailers made it look fun and interesting, but playing it turned into a massive disappointment.\n\nYou play as a little girl whose teddy has been kidnapped by a scary monster in the closest. You follow it through and find yourself transported to a strange world with odd creatures that will either help you or kill you depending on your interaction with them. Half of this interaction is done merely by giving them an item you've found at some point, while the other half comes in musical form as you sing notes to them. There are 26 notes in all, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet which, when played in the right order, will spell out a word or phrase pertinent to the situation and allow you pass. The trouble is, getting to grips with the musical aspects of the game is such an infuriating chore that it grinds any fun to a complete halt and kills any enthusiasm you may have otherwise had.\n\nThere's no instructions given at any point, and aside from the spelling puzzles, no dialogue shared between characters. So the fact that the sounds are tied to letters is never expressly explained and leaves you with a massive amount of head scratching as you try to figure out what to do and where to do it. There is some attempt to teach the player this mechanic shortly after it starts, but it just felt too vague to make the connection the game wants you to make. Once you actually realise how it works it isn't entirely so bad for the rest of the game, but for me it was a huge misfire that rubbed me up the wrong way from the off then never won me back around. But even had this been handled better it still wouldn't have saved the game from the rest of its issues.\n\nIt's absolutely riddled with bugs. My own personal list of problems includes losing my save data when I exited the game, losing an essential item from my inventory that meant I couldn't pass through a door, restarting the game, reaching the same door again, walking through it, then being sent back to the start before then being unable to click on an exit to go any further, I also had puzzles glitch and become impassable as well as some characters or items not responding when I clicked on them, and that's all on top of the terrible UI and hugely restrictive traversal (you can't move around freely, but rather can only click on exits or interactive objects within each screen). It's like the last 30 or 40 years of game design never happened, it's just all so shoddy and ill-conceived. I had to restart my game several times as a result of all these bugs and began to increasingly resent the game with each instance of me having to retrace my steps over and over due to its own faults. Some of the game's defenders will say it's so short (probably takes about an hour to complete the first time around) that it doesn't matter and you can easily get back to the same spot again pretty quickly, but that's a pretty p*ss poor argument and there's no excuse for having to restart any game from scratch due to its own technical failings. Once or twice is bad enough, but multiple times is just unforgivable incompetence.\n\nI really can't see how this has received so many positive reviews, as checking out the game's discussion board it mostly seems to be filled with people reporting bugs and looking for solutions. And looking up the achievement stats, as of time of writing, only 22% of players have actually finished the game, and fewer than 43% of players would appear to have even completed the first chapter... two years after its release! When not even half the people who play your incredibly short game can pass the first area then I think that can only be an indication not of bad players but of poor design.\n\nThere's a good idea at the heart of this game, but it's so badly managed that I think most players are driven away by it. I would have loved it if these notes you sing were the entire language of the game, and as you learned new notes it would give you a greater range of vocabulary to solve problems. Maybe it could have played more along the lines of something like Scribblenauts where multiple solutions to a puzzle could be possible depending on how many notes/letters of the alphabet you had learned and how imaginative they could be with the problem. To me that seems like a greater refinement of the idea that still would have easily allowed the developers to maintain the artistic integrity of the core concept whilst also opening it up for greater possibilities. But, instead, it's just something that looks great but is actually pretty bad, a girl whose messages I'll be deleting and number I'll be blocking.","November 4, 2015","false","6.0"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","43","49","6","0"

I do not think that myself.\n\nYou click to move the unnamed protagonist to various points of interest on the screen and to navigate between screens, the core loop is simple. Find a place you can't get through yet, find the correct thing to open that passage and then go through that passage. The required items aren't even that much of a stretch, you get past the web of a giant spider by releasing ants into it to distract it, for example.\nHowever, there are two exceptions, one is small, the other gigantic.\n\nThe smaller one is that you gain several companions over the course of your journey and they can help you with certain puzzles. The first time this happens you actually get a helpful arrow that explains this, but later times you're just left guessing whether you're missing the item or need to select your companions to help. There are about four times where this is needed over the course of the game though, so it's not that critical.\n\nWhat really slows down the progress in the game though, is the music note system.\nNow, I love the concept behind this, picking up clues from characters you meet to slowly learn a musical alphabet that you then use to convey messages to others. A great example of a moment where this works well is that you encounter a mole about halfway through the game, minding its own business but singing the notes D, I and G (spelling 'dig') as it's digging. Then, a few screens further, you find a sleeping mole. Reciting the DIG notes wakes up the mole, and causes it to dig a new passage for you to explore.\nUnfortunately many of the messages you encounter are audio-only, leaving you to match and then memorize the correct notes without necessarily knowing yet which letters they correspond to or what you might need the message for. At the start of the game when the music system is introduced it isn't even clear that they correspond to letters yet...\nI can imagine that some players love piecing this system together, but to me it felt clunky and detracting from the fun.\n\nIf you feel like piecing together a challenge, sometimes not a very logical one, then this little adventure game might be a good fit for you. Don't say I didn't warn you though.","May 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","0"

So imagine the shock of waking up in the middle of the night to see a monster climbing out of your wardrobe and making off with your teddy bear. Finding Teddy is the journey of a little girl off to reclaim what is most valuable to her, plunging headfirst into an uncanny dreamscape full of bizarre creatures and even stranger sounds in a lightweight point and click adventure.\n\nNavigating the world by simple presses to the edge of the screen, you travel though nonlinear levels collecting items and solving basic puzzles. Many of these revolve around forming odd musical messages, in a bit of a call back to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, by which you communicate with the inhabitants of the strange world you find yourself in. As a musician I personally found these fun to solve and more original than the simple "bring object A to point B" that otherwise make up the bulk of the puzzles, but it should be noted that those with less of an ear for music or are even tone deaf will likely find them infuriating, perhaps even impossible. This is not to say only musicians and the like will be able to enjoy the game, but I feel it is wroth mentioning for those that find it difficult to pick out distinct notes, as this is likely not something for you.\n\nDespite its initially dark appearance it is actually very sweet, with a charming cast and a fantastic ending that left me feeling warm and smiling through the credits. The pixel artstyle is quite lovely to look at despite a few jerky animations, and the soundtrack while generally just ambient noise is quite good when it decides to take more of a center role. The one thing that might turn people off is that it is very short, as I finished it in just under two and a half hours despite getting stuck at several areas. Veteran adventure game players will almost surely burn through it in even less, and aside from a few secret achievements there isn't any reason to return.\n\nIf you are not turned away by the somewhat frustrating musical puzzles and brief playtime, I would definitely recommend Finding Teddy to any fan of classic adventure games. It wasn't the least what I expected, but turned into something I grew quite fond of over my brief tour and expect many will find a relaxing and welcome change of pace to most modern gaming fare","December 20, 2013","true","2.4"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","6"

There is little in the way of dialogue, but well-directed cutscenes do a great job of telling the (admittedly rather simple) story line. The protagonist is a girl looking for her kidnapped teddy in a strange dreamscape of monsters and spiders (arachnophobes beware). She comes across as very competent, and the game never overly sexualizes her or belittles her for being a girl, which is a huge plus for me. If I had kids I could definitely see myself playing this game with them.\n\nThe bad: The game is short, many of the high points are already given away in the trailer. Interface is somewhat lacking and difficult to navigate. New game+ switches to old art in animations. More damning, there being no option to save means it is easy to get stuck at some places in the game by advancing before solving puzzles vital to finishing the game. The inability to travel back to previous levels again means you can get stuck and be forced to replay the game from the start. This game requires a very good ear for pitch as most puzzles contains a step (or several) in which you must echo a sequence of high-pitched notes. This is a great gameplay element, but if you have less of an ear for music this game becomes a lot less enjoyable (this was the case for me) -- something that could easily be mitigated by giving players the option to show the letter-notes in every puzzle, and in any case ought to be better advertised before purchase. For the most part the music is great, but the high-pitched tunes can sometimes become a bit hard on your ear, which is a problem since the sound is too important to the solving of puzzles for turning the sound off for a bit to rest your ears to be an option.\n\nIn sum, this is a beautiful but short game with some innovative gameplay thet should have seen more work on the bugs and bottlenecks I mentioned above. I look forward to more games from this studio when they've found their proper sea legs.","December 16, 2013","false","3.9"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","45","65","0","1"

So if you are having trouble hearing nodes, you might have a hard time finishing this game\n\nAll in all I quite enjoyed this game, it took me about 3 hours to 100%, and then an extra hour for a last playthrough, it ran very smooth and lived up to my expectations, I give this an 8/10","June 21, 2014","true","4.2"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","0"

Prior to that you walk through empty passages until you reach a roadblock or an item.  If it's an item you pick it up, if it's a roadblock you use an item you picked up in order to gain passage.  Apart from the simplistic item using puzzles there's also a music system where you are either told the notes you'll need to play, or have to figure them out by ear.  One of those is very frustrating but I don't want to give too many spoilers and say which!\n\nI found that the choice to have no dialogue or flavour text of any kind (apart from musical notes spelling short messages) hurt the atmosphere.

And those that do contain something never have more than one purpose.\nThere's a bit too much backtracking (which is made worse by the previous point).\nOne "item" is quite pointless and the related puzzle relies on an unexplained mechanic that you will use only once in the full game.

I generally don't like these sorts of games but this is a proper exception.\n\nI couldn't like Finding Teddy more.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything for you so here are some superficial reasons why I would recommend this lovely game.\n\nAfter wishlisting Finding Teddy, I won this game free in a raffle and instantly started playing it. I was met with a cute point and click game with gorgeous graphics and a colour scheme that was refreshing and by far the prettiest I had ever seen, the scheme even rivalling Fez. The artwork is compelling and quite frankly, very sweet to look at. The gameplay is consistent and the puzzles are challenging yet easy to remember when you figure them out.

My heart sort've did a fluttering thing and I caught myself with a goofy smile on my face.\n\nConcerning negatives: at times it can be a little frustrating going through the game again and again whilst trying to get the achievements, if you miss one or two, but all in all it's a great experience.

It's main puzzle is based on hearing them clearly, and though you can get past with just visuals, it's far more difficult. If you are the type that just wishes to experience a story, a visual guide does exist out there for you to use.\n\nThe lovely artwork, from in game pixels to unlockable sketch art that is worth seeing even if you don't play it however.

Point and click adventuring seemed like it would be a more relaxed pace of gaming after the more action intensive games I'd recently played. For the most part, this game seems a bit split on how things go. There are elements I really liked and others that made pressing on feel more of a chore than something I'm doing for enjoyment, but ultimately I feel the balance is a bit too much into the negative to really recommend the title.\n\nThe pixel style graphics are charming in their own right and the colour usage seems pretty solid. The animations are mostly subtle but effective so I was very interested in what new sights I would discover. The audio is a bit mixed, as the various simple melodies that form part of the puzzles are interesting to hear sometimes but the actual background music felt too repetitive. The story is presented in a very minimal style - it's really just a tale of a girl seeking to reclaim her comfort in the form of her teddy and having to explore a strange unfamiliar world. There are some other story elements that creep into spoiler territory that are likewise effective without going into full cutscene mode for it all.\n\nThe puzzles are a bit mixed. Some are pretty clever and did make me realise how much sense a solution made after I'd done it. The puzzle involving the crocodile is the perfect example, which made me think of the items I needed and how. Then you get others that don't flow nearly as well. The game also tries a unique approach with music based puzzles. Some of these work very well too but those are mostly the ones with actual visual clues for those that can't quite get the pitch right, but others rely on sound alone and this can result in some major trial and error as you try to figure out the correct pattern (and hoping you're in the right area that needs it too).\n\nThe game isn't very big, where I clocked in at 1.6 hours for a playthrough. This doesn't take into account the new game plus the game apparently has or looking for any secrets. Unfortunately, what this does take into account is the lots and lots of running back and forth through familiar areas because sequential elements of certain puzzles are at opposite ends of winding paths you've already been through several times. Given that I was already backtracking a bit for things like picking up items I had previously missed and had to accept that as my own fault, the last thing I would want is to be forced by the game to do even more of that.","December 21, 2013","false","1.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

The graphics are quite amazing.\nThe trees have twisted branches and weird roots in the ground, the backgrounds are multicolored, everything well designed and high detailed. An unique look and feel. I was just taking screenshots all the time.\n\nFinding Teddy is a simple sidescroller and a point-and -click adventure. The story is easy told: You are a young girl. Oneday a big spider rob your teddy and you try to regain it. Memorize all tunes you hear around and then you can talk with some of the creatures. The puzzles mainly concentrate on learning musique notes like the ABC. You can use a tonescale to play literally words to NPCs. Great idea!\n\nUnfortunately the game is quite easy and also very short. Sometimes you get lost in the labrinth of tunnels and crossings but a playthrough will take about just a hour. And to be honestly these achievements are really silly. You must die of a spider, crocodile, snake, queen bee, etc. Then it's called "spidered", "crocodiled", "snaked" or "beed" ... hahaha.\nI wonder why I can't get "vultured", "flamingod", or "frogged"?","August 17, 2014","true","2.4"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","0"

The story itself is cute/quaint, and the sort of tale you could expect to come from the mind of somebody's little daughter (or having been written for somebody's little daughter). That said, the strength of this game was definitely the puzzles, which incorporate music into riddle form fairly brilliantly. Once you realize what is happening, you wont have any real issues solving them, but learning them initially will take most people a bit of time, and you will need to pay attention in order for the final puzzle to become obvious. Outside of that, there are also objects you find that you will need to progress, much like every point and click game, which this is (albeit, done in a refreshingly different fashion).\n\nAll told, this game probably took me about an hour and a half to finish, and there is replay value for the completonist.

Thus begins the quest to retrieve the stuffed toy and immediately problems with both the narrative and gameplay present themselves.\n\nFrom the moment controls are handed over to the player, nothing whatsoever is explained. Some random clicking around the screen will likely reveal the basic controls, and soon thereafter the deeply uninspired, vapid point-and-click gameplay becomes apparent. The rest of the game consists of finding the single thing in a screen which matters to the rest of the game and using the correct item collected from a previous screen to interact with it. Intermittently, sound puzzles present themselves and do as such things usually do, cause progress to grind to an absolute halt.\n\nNow in and of itself, the point-and-click gameplay isn't horrid, however it has several major flaws that pushes it from mildly obnoxious to outright annoying. It has no comprehension of "quality of life" improvements to gameplay, such as minimizing backtracking, the puzzles are more or less all either blindingly obvious or painfully obtuse, and the controls are minimal and surprisingly annoying.\n\nEven this could have been but a stumbling block, older games have certainly had all these problems and worse besides. However to compound all this, the story - such as it is - is frankly not even remotely as clever as it seemingly likes to think it is.\n\nIt consists of essentially five segments, of which only three are actually relevant to the "story", and of those, one is the introduction, and the other is the very final scene. Of the meat of the game, two of three "chapters" are essentially completely pointless. They add nothing, not even contributing in any real sense to an "Alice in Wonderland" atmosphere, because the insipid puzzles and the half-random, incoherent design ruin any such attempts. The attempt at purely environmental storytelling is in a sense admirable, but that still requires there to be an actual story! You cannot simply string together elements and pretend it makes sense!\n\nAdditionally, the finale completely breaks with its own thematics and mood. The aesthetics and the progression through the environments had a steady darkening of tone, and the brutal deaths the unnamed protagonist might suffer during the game imply that the otherworld she travels through is a fundamentally hostile and dangerous place inhabited by enigmatic and unnatural creatures that make no attempts to communicate. Yet the final puzzle has more in common with a quaint children's picturebook than what the game was seemingly trying to be.\n\nThe only verdict I can give is that the developers had no idea what they were actually trying to do, with their complete failure to understand how narrative structure and adventure game mechanics should actually work.\n\nStill. While incredibly flawed, it is not a bad purchase if the price is hanging around a single euro. If nothing else, the art itself is rather well done.","June 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

The solutions to puzzles are fairly straightforward, as are the achievements (which can be completed rather reasonably).\n\nA relatively short game but this means that you should have time left over to explore the game's new-game-plus features -- including an easier way to find the collectibles and an alternative ending clued in by one of the NPCs.\n\nThe story is very atmospheric, with some horror elements, but challenges the usual association of antipathy with the grotesque -- just because something's ugly and scary-looking may not mean that it hates you and means you harm.  But you must figure out how to communicate with it, and what to say to it.\n\nThe game also has a distinctive way of "communicating" -- a "musicom" that lets you type out a message letter by letter using musical tones.  It's fun to use.\n\nApparently the musicom also features in this game's sequel, Finding Teddy 2.  And this game does have a scene at the end that ties into FT2.  FT2 is a metroidvania, though, and I'm even more excited about that game.\n\n(Disclosure: I bought this game on the Humble Store, while it was discounted.)","May 2","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It might hide behind being retro styled, but it still feels a bit sloppy. I don't mind the retro graphics at all, I have been gaming since 1984, so the retro hits my nostalgic heart. What doesn't though, is the sloppy animations, controls and lack of creativity. Some of you might find this "musical" aspect new and refreshing, but it has been done before, and IMO it has been done a lot better. "Loom" is a game that comes to mind when playing this, and even though it is a very long time since I've played that I remember how much more fun I had in that game than here.\n\nThe game itself is a point & click like style adventure game where nobody holds your hand at all (not that it is needed). There is very little explanation of what is going on and how to play the game. It is mostly hidden in some vague clues here and there. For the game itself that doesn't matter much. Most will find out how it works quite easily, and the puzzles you need to solve is also quite easy. Well, at least if you have played a fair share of similar games or point & click adventures in general. It shouldn't take much more than an hour or two on the first playthrough, but if you collect achievements you need to play through it at least twice. I encourage you to use an achievement guide though as some of them are very hard to figure out without any guidance.\n\nThere is very little going on in this game, and even less to do. This whole game has less content than most first chapters in any other adventure game I've played. That being said, this game has a "to be continued" in the end, so I guess this is a first chapter too. I just wish that they just made the whole game in one, then maybe it would have a little more meat.\n\nEven though the game in itself is not THAT bad and is built on a good idea (just not done well) I don't feel it is worth its asking price of $6.99 (at the moment of this review). Many might enjoy it and find it original (especially if you haven't played "Loom" or similar games) and many won't mind it being short, so don't base your decision on this review alone.

The game is super slow paced and it has a lot of tedious backtracking in order to complete really simple and obvious grab-the-new-item-you-got-and-give-it-to-the-enemy-you-just-saw" "puzzles". The game has a musical note representation of the alphabet that you use to talk to the characters you find. But the problem is that when characters talk you can only hear the notes played, and you cannot see the actual notes. And so you have to use your music note book and try to match the notes they are playing by using trial and error. You can spend about 5 minutes trying to figure out which of the 26 notes he is playing. And that is just to figure out what letter he is saying. Often times he is saying a 4-6 letter word. And so you can spend up to 20 minutes trying to figure out just what the hell the character is trying to say. And then, after all that work you find out the "puzzle" is that he is saying "Happy". HMMM maybe I'll go play that "happy" song to the guy I found crying. So then you spend a good minute or so slowly walking ALL the way back to the guy you previous found, and you play him the notes that spell "Happy". Wow, what a top notch puzzle that was. Definitely worth that 15-20min I spend trying to figure that out.\nPoint is, these puzzles are barely puzzles and they are so obvious it does not feel satisfying to figure out. Majority of the game is padded out with sequences like that in which you have to figure out what the noises that characters make mean, and with the tedious backtracking. Overall there was barely a story, the puzzles were so straightforward they felt pointless, and the tedious backtracking will surely make you want to uninstall the game.\nTo its credit the game does have really nice ambient music and a really great pixel art style, but the gameplay just didn't do it for me.

The game has some minor faults that unfortunately detract from what could have been a better experience.\n\nA lot of the riddles are tied to solving words and sentences by pushing the right notes/letters. My using a "/" is because the letters are shaped like notes, i.e. the font resembles musical notes. Although the letters are pretty enough (for the graphical style) and creatively done, they also have the drawback of confusing the player as to what letter the note is supposed to resemble.\n\nExample: You're in progress of solving a riddle and it's nigh impossible to distiguish what is letter "e" from letter "t" because the "notey" font doesn't quite resemble a clear "e" or "t", causing you many times to press the wrong letter and having to try over and over until you get it right. Also, if you press the buttons to quick, the game will not register it, you have to take your time and wait for the game to "catch on" sometimes, registering the correct letters/notes. This makes some of the riddles frustrating for all the wrong reasons; it's not because you don't understand what the riddle is, and how you might solve it, it's because you are not able to distinguish the letters from each other.\n\nI certainly don't want to slaughter the game, because I find the execution okay, but it needs some patching/cleaning up. If I have to recommend or not recommend it, I would say you could get more value for your money by buying another point and click adventure game, but give it a try if you're curious.\n\nKudos to the developer for trying something new.","March 24, 2014","false","3.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Finding Teddy is certainly not textless. The game begins with an incredibly simple item interface, boiling everything down to single iOS clicks. Because of how paired-down the interface is, solving puzzles is painfully easy since one never happens upon enough items and roadblocks to have to even consider the question posed. Its cute graphics and simple puzzles could make the game work for a younger player, but the game shortly introduces a system of musical notes. A player must be able to identify different notes (inconsistently) by ear or symbol.   A brief analysis of the notes shows that they represent the English alphabet and are used to spell words.  This would make the game decidedly unfit to a player unable to read.\nThe hardest part of the game is locating unnecessary hidden objects throughout, that are never once referenced within the game and are only used to unlock concept art. Even then if a player knows how to look for them it is more a matter of trial and error than an invigorating exercise.\nWhile cute, it is hard to recommend the game. It is too easy for anyone who could manage its music system and too hard for anyone who is too young to be able to.","July 2, 2014","false","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And I guess that's a proper diagram for how this game makes me feel: Split down the middle.\n\nHaving just recently (re)played Loom, I could draw the obvious parallel there. But Loom A) didn't have an inventory system and B) only used 8 notes in a way that forced you to learn the spells along with Bobbin. Yes, it may be nitpicky for me to slam the inventory system and (mostly unused) music notes in this game, but a majority of it was unnecessary.\n\nFinding Teddy gives the player an alphabet with which to "communicate" with the world and get real feedback from it sometimes. You've already given the player a voice and immersed them into the experience. Why cluttler it up with items and allies? If the inventory was simplified or even removed (and absolutely scrap the cat and the fly. They're cute, but only perform two or three tasks the whole game), leaving only the alphabet, the game would have been so much more intuitive. Instead of hopelessly using every item in your inventory on every seemingly interactive thing in the game (in ADDITION to typing musical messages at them, or maybe using the cat or maybe using the fly), the player would have nothing but their words. It's a welcome limitation.\n\nActually, let's expand on that: The whole experience feels like a game that could be strictly text interactions, but has inventory items and allies shoe horned in. Instead of giving the text-based genre new life, it just causes a loss in momentum when you have to open your inventory on every screen. It causes the game to fall flat by having too many options.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I did enjoy this game. But I feel like text based games and point and click adventures are most rewarding when you hit on those "Ah Ha!" moments, of which this game has very few *because* of its varied mechanics. I do ultimately recommend it, however simply because of the graphics and ambient music.\n\nIt's too bad that it's an insult to your visual and music talents when the core mechanics are convoluted and sometimes frustrating. No spoilers, but I wanted the whole game to be just like the ending. Hell, the ending itself could have gone on a lot longer. Adventure games are all about using your key mechanics to keep the player forgetting that they're actually playing a game. And it felt like the ending put me in that immersive stranglehold only to let me go after a short time.\n\nFinal word: Never leave your player wanting to be strangled more. Let's hope the sequel brings out more of the positive aspects of this game and reduces the detritus.","July 26, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a point-and-click adventure, it's about the same length (just a couple of hours) and it has an amazing artstyle (even though Sword & Sworcery is just a tad more detailed). It's nicely animated, has a cute story and an unique way of solving puzzles, which rely mostly on sound. So you need a good ear to figure out how to imitate some of the tunes in it. After a while you'll figure out that the musical puzzles use a certain system. Once you figured that out the game will become a whole lot easier, believe me.

The most notable gameplay feature of it is it's primary puzzle-solving gimmick, which may take you a while to catch onto, and discussing it much is a spoiler since this is a short game at around 2-3 hours long.\n\nThe most interesting part of Finding Teddy for me are the character deaths.  There are various points where a failed puzzle solving attempt will result in an NPC killing the main character and they are effectively unsettling.  It's a good use of the disparity between the game's visuals and your expectations of what a failed puzzle will bring.  I recommend anyone playing through the game to try to trigger them, especially since dying has little negative impact on progression.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it just didn't pull me in.  The puzzles, locations, characters, and so on kind of washed over me and weren't particularly memorable or brought me much enjoyment.  Not a bad game, but I only finished it because I though the deaths scenes were interesting and  I wanted to see how the game wrapped up.  I don't think I would've completed it if were much longer since it had a tenuous grip on my attention.

It must have visual and audio effects that reflect a relaxing atmosphere. It must have a simple interface that makes you feel like a complete dullard when you inevitably fail to understand what you're supposed to do. Each solution must incorporate a logic that is completely unique to the creator and makes everyone else say, "Umm okay... I guess that makes sense..." when/if they find the correct solution. And finally, it must have gameplay that encourages the player to rub every item in their inventory against every interactive surface in the game, in hopes they'll get lucky and stumble onto the creator's train of logic.\n\nSo with that in mind, let's go down Fondling Teddy's checklist.\n-Calming visuals? Check.\n-Soothing ambient music and sound effects? Check.\n-Ridiculously simple interface? Check.\n-Puzzles who's train of logic just pulled in from the twilight zone? Double check.\n-Gameplay and level design that makes the player wander aimlessly back and forth throughout the game, mashing random objects together like a confused, alcoholic alzheimer's patient that just pulled themself from a car crash? Ultra check.\n\nIn fact, backtracking is such a huge part of Finding Tiddy that it should be one of it's big selling points. "Now with 75% more backtracking!", the store page would say. "Do you enjoy seeing the same 8 screens over and over? Too bad!", the store page would exclaim.\n\nBut all the backtracking pales in comparison to the absurd "solutions". The breaking point for me occurred when I eventually got sick of the usual, "mash item X against surface Y in a vain attempt to understand what I'm supposed to do" technique and committed the ultimate and most dishonorable sin of all: looking up a walkthrough. As it turns out, I was supposed to play a series of notes from my newly acquired sheet music notepad thing to make a rock happy. Which would make sense, but here's the catch, over half of the music notes were missing from the sheet music notepad thing and I had no donkey punching idea how I was supposed to get the rest of music notes. Or what order I was supposed to play them in. Or even if I was supposed to play music at all. None of this is explained. Even after I copy-pasted the solution from the walkthrough, nothing is explained. There wasn't any sort of message saying something like "hey you figured out the right music notes by giving a sensual massage to the tree of pounding" or "it's a good thing you booty bumped the stone of throbbing cause he had right idea" or anything at all to show what planet the developer was on when they made that puzzle. All I can assume is that I was supposed to look up a walkthrough. As far as I can tell, that was the developer's intended solution.\n\nIn short, Fondling Tiddy is your typical, mundane, nothing special, point and click game. Much like a stripper, it's fun to look at but once you get down to business, you'll see why looks aren't everything.\n\nIf you want a good point and click game, then check out Machinarium and Return to Mysterious Island.

The game is a strait forward, and can be finished in less than 2 hours. The art style make it seems like early platform games that was released in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nThe art and nostalgic feeling you can get from the game is enough for the price. There is little repayable value. It has hidden treasures and steam achievements that were put by the developers for those who want to have a 2nd try in the game.\n\nIf you want to spend an easy relaxing artistic hour of videogame and pixel art, look no further.\n\nI recommend this game.\n","October 2, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The objective is quite simple: Find your missing Teddybear. Just like its premise, the game is very innocent and charming, though you'd be surprised by how eerie it is. The music and art helps to set the tone of the game. It's very atmospheric and calming but also, at times, a little haunting.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is the puzzles which mostly revolve around music. No fear, if you do not have a  musical ear, you will after trial and error, and with accute observation, figure out the mecanics of the game and how to solve the puzzles and riddles.\n\nIt took me around 4 hours to complete and 100% the game. It might take less or more for some.\n\nI'd recommend picking up this game. It has enough charm and character for players who enjoy point and click adventures. It's a simple game to play that really makes you happy at the end of it ^w^b\n\nMy only complaint is that it was too short and left me wanting to explore more the strange land in which this little girl finds herself. And the puzzles might be a little too easy for some or irritating for others. If you are looking for a challenging game with long gameplay and replayability, this isn't for you then :P\n\nIt's more of a wind downed version of a game like Limbo with less traumatic deaths or creepy ambiance. It's simple, charming and adorable:\n\nEnjoy the game ~","June 1, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though it's fairly short and very linear it still provides you with a decent story of a girl who had her teddy bear stolen by a giant spider which came from her closet, through some kind of dimension or world other than our own, most of us knows how it feels like when loosing a toy we really liked when we were young. That is the goal of the game, to find Teddy. The game doesn't really present you with any actual puzzles, instead you have to just find the necessary object in order to use on a certain place in order to proceed. Other than that, Finding Teddy relies on on some sort of music riddles, in which the notes are represented and represent a letter of the alphabet and by playing those notes you communicate with the creatures from this weird dimension of sorts. At first Finding Teddy might look and feel like a weird and dark game where a child is lost, specially if you end up getting yourself killed often, but by the end you realize it's all about about friendship and helping others out. It's certainly not something I can safely recommend for everyone but considering it's fairly short, I'd say to give it a try if you have some time to burn and want to know if this is anything up your alley.","March 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even when accompanied with puzzles and gruesome death scenes (She's a little girl!) it still kept this whole relaxed, tranquil atmosphere.\nIt's a simple point and click adventure filled with puzzles. It took me a while to figure out how to decipher the musical notes, but once I did, it was a "How could I not see that" moment.\n\nThe story is just incredible, I'm not so sure why it really sparks this level of emotion inside of me. There are no voice actors in this game, no text narrative, all you know is that you have to reclaim your teddy. Yet come the end of the game, you'll see how much deeper the story actually goes. The ending made it for me. Completely reminiscent of Monsters Inc, and even the credits were fun to read, with the little notes the devs put in.\n\nThe only (and I mean only) downside of this game is longevity.

The items are not too problematic– if you are patient enough, brute force will eventually let you pass. But the code phrases…\nThey use a musical alphabet where you only receive the letters after you solved the puzzle tied to them.

When she follows after the teddy bear, she is transported to a fantastical world filled with musically-inspired puzzles and several animal companions that can be used to solve riddles and unlock secrets.\n\nThe majority of Finding Teddy's puzzles can either be solved by gathering and using the correct objects from within the level or by playing a specific melody on an alphabetical musical scale that the player slowly fills out throughout the game. The puzzles are thought-provoking without being aggravating. Often your goal is to find a particular item that will cause a creature that is blocking your path to move out of your way. As you progress further into the game, the little girl will be joined by two helpful sidekicks that will allow the player to reach otherwise inaccessible objects and areas.\n\nOne of Finding Teddy's most charming features is its naivety; the game never presents you with a problem that must be solved via an act of mean-spirited trickery, but instead offers you sad creatures whose problems you must solve in order to continue. In Finding Teddy, you'll find missing baby spiders, sing "Hello!" to a group of frogs, and retrieve food for globular monsters with gigantic tongues. Finding Teddy is very much a game that embraces the perspective of the little girl that you play.\n\nFinding Teddy's high points can be found in its disarmingly childish storyline, its lush and detailed pixelized backgrounds and characters, and its attractively dialogue-free, music-centered gameplay. Perhaps the only downside to this casual point and click game is its short gameplay time and low replay value—most players will finish their first playthrough in under two hours and completionists with quick minds will find themselves completing all of Finding Teddy's achievements in that same time frame.\n\nDespite its short gameplay time, Finding Teddy is a brilliant example of quirky point and click games. This game presents you with sympathetic characters, unique puzzles, and a wonderfully vibrant atmosphere, giving it more than enough reason to earn a recommendation as a casual, light-hearted point and click game to play between some of your more intense adventures as a gamer.","September 5, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is no dialogue and basically no story at all besides you getting your teddy. The game does this "music" thing that just gets annoying and loses its lustor after the first time they use it. A lot of game points out the problem with many point and click, the random logic and pixel hunting. As if I was supposed to know I have to take 3 rights and a left, in the confusing areas with multiple paths, click on this thumbtack in the background, then go 5 ups and 3 rights and down and use it on a hole in the wall to build up the pressure of water behind it, which makes it burst and shoots out a key you need to give to this penguin 10 minutes back, etc. One time there was a web I had a fang that I could have used to cut it, but the game wanted me to sing to something to cut it for me, even though I used the fang later to cut a web. It is this obtuse reasoning where they just want you to follow their prescribed logic instead of use any of your own. The confusing layout ads to the problem of there being no cohesion to doing things, just random scattered objects you take to different paths, but in no particular order or sense. Final boss was just kind of annoying. Not really many redeeming features. Pretty short game too. 4.5/10.","January 16, 2015","false","3.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You get this little girl who is trying to get back her Teddy bear from a mysterious world, pleasantly designed, though lacking imagination. I enjoyed a lot the artwork, the soundtrack, but not the game itself. The gameplay is just tedious and the puzzles are simple and minimalist, the mojority of them tending to be ridiculous. Even the achievements are tending to be negative. You get the echivements for being killed by the creatures you're supposed to please, so if you're not supid enough to get killed by them all during your journey - you'll have to start it over, and this time "remember" to die if you want the achievements. Another waste of time and money. Just doesn't worth it.","December 23, 2013","false","2.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Awake from her slumber, the girl takes chase and finds a fantasy realm beyond her closet.\n\nPros :\n- The backgrounds are beautiful and add lots of atmosphere.\n- Game provides the ability to run when switching screens.\n- Post-credits segment was a nice surprise.\n\nCons:\n- Walk speed is slow, despite the running, and the lack of waypoints makes travelling between screens a chore.\n- Game's pacing is hampered by the excessive need to backtrack to complete puzzles. The player is often forced to go back near the beginning from the lack of foreknowledge.\n- There is a decent number of puzzles that are either non-intuitive or have nonsensical solutions (and rewards).\n- Firefly hunting is troublesome due to some of them being exit points or where the player spawns.\n- Short (1-2 hours) with no replay value (new game + is a joke).\n- The lack of plot provides little incentive to explore and complete the game.\n- The character designs are either uninspired or boring.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- Dying shouldn't reward a player outside of a gameplay mechanic. It makes a game feel casual and puzzles like they're guesswork. However, in Finding Teddy, this only applies to achievements, so it's a minor issue.","February 13, 2014","false","2.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Puzzles aren't that hard, but you can get stuck at times. It's easily fixed by backtracking a bit. The biggest annoyance for me was unlocking letters and them not showing on the music chart which resulted me making mistakes that could have been avoided.","December 18, 2013","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is about a little girl who lost her teddy bear while she was sleeping. She then sets off into the cupoard to go looking for her beloved teddy. The puzzles in this game are really good and makes you figure out what you need to do. This game does not tell you where you need to go, so in order to get around you must look for clues as to what you are doing.\n\nPros:\n+Shows what it was like to lose something as a child.\n+Great artwork.\n+Great music\n+Good short adventure game.\n\nCons:\n-Feels tedious and repetitive.\n-Wish it was longer.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/259600/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Finding Teddy is a point n' click puzzle in which you play a little girls whose teddy-bear has been taken by a weird arm from the closet during your night.\nWhat else would you do? Just go through the closet to get it back! Then, you find yourself in a wonderland.\nThere, there are "monters" which you need to help, and they help you in return. Otherwise they'll just eat you. That's life.\n\nPoint n' click games aren't really my kind of game, and this one doesn't change that. It has the aspects of those games that I don't like, such as very slow and little actual gameplay, and puzzles are sometimes too cryptic and turn into a click-fest.\nBut I certainly liked this game quite a bit, and it has certain aspects that make it unique.\n\n\nFirst off, the artstyle. Despite very minimal, it's really well done. Every scenery looks very good, and the world seems alive because of it. You can see it from the screenshots, it almost gives me a Sword and Sworcery feel, but still stands on its own. Nothing to complain in this regard, and it's one of the aspects I liked the most.\n\n\nMusic didn't really standout to me, it was more ambience oriented, and that's ok, but I didn't find it particularly good. I wasn't bad either, but I barely payed notice to it. I'm talking about general music, and sound effects.\nThen, there is a really cool mechanic with it, about which I'll talk further.\n\n\nGameplay is mostly standard point n' click. You click on the edges of the screen you want to go, or the item you want to pick up. Then, you click on yourself if you want to use items.\nSo, pretty standard, I'd say.\nBut, you eventually get a flute. With this flute, you can play different notes and pitches, and each note represents a letter of the alphabet.\nWith this, you can interact with some characters, and even try to translate what they're saying by finding which letter matches with a sound. This is something I've never seen before, and it works well, for the most part. Other times, you have to respond back, choosing the letter, and so creating a melody.\n\nThis gives a whole new aspect to both the mechanics and the world, and it's what makes it truly unique!\nA big complaint I have with it, though, it that the background music sometimes overlaps with it, making it a bit too hard to figure out which sound you want. That's was really annoying at one point, but nothing you can't solve.\n\nYou go through 3 different stages, with different characters, and then you have a final "boss", which is all about communication, with a little easter egg in there.\nIn each stage, you have some optional monsters that may or may not be necessary to progress the story, and you should pay attention to them, because the Boss is mostly about things you've experienced before in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, you can probably finish the game in a single hour, or so. Then comes NewGame+. I think this one was pretty bad, to be honest. The wonder and surprise from the first walkthrough is mostly gone, and you're left to "collect" Fireflies that appear on some areas. These aren't really hidden or anything, it's just about playing the game once again. Plus, it's a really cheap way to increase the game's longevity... why not give you the option the first time?\nAside from the fireflies, you can have a different look to your character, which could be cool... but whenever there is a scripted sequence, your character changes back during it. I don't know why this happens, but it feels very awkward. Would be nice to see it solved for future players. Nothing too bad, but an annoyance nonetheless.\n\nAlong with this, the achievements were mostly really bad, in my opinion. Half of them are to reward you for dying in each encounter. Instead of rewarding to figuring out things before hand, it rewards for failing. ... Why? It makes people purposefully failing if they want the achievement and have played well on their first time... It makes no sense to me, and it is the exact opposite purpose that achievements should have.\n\nMy final complaint is not being able to Alt Tab the game, or even changing options during gameplay. There are no sliders for the music and SFX, Alt-Tabbing doesn't work, there are a lot of annoying things about it in a technical level. These could be very easily solved, but the developers seemed to have taken the easier way out and just made something quick that worked... somewhat.\n\n\nI've done everything there was to do in the game, it took my 2 and 1/2 hours, in 2 playthroughs, which is really short.\nIf you can withstand all the technical issues and annoyances, you'll actually find a really pretty game with some unique features to it.\nI think it's worth playing once only, in my opinion. I'm interested what else can be done with this concept, and I'll be paying attention to you, "LookAtMyGames".\nGo ahead and try it, it has its strenghts!\n","February 18, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While not really bringing anything new to the point-and-click genre, its beautiful aesthetic and well thought out world really set it apart.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy for the most-part, which may leave point-and-click veterans wanting more; although, there is a huge variety in the puzzles, so you won’t feel like you are repeating the same thing over and over...\n\nWhile its 4:3 resolution really shows its mobile roots, don’t let it fool you, it’s certainly far from a shabby mobile port. The game is a highly charming and memorable experience, not to mention the hysterical deaths I fell victim to along the way. For fans of point-and-click puzzle games, we give it a high recommendation, but don’t expect much in the way of narrative.\n\nThe verdict:\n+ Beautiful and well realised world.\n+ Wide variety of puzzles.\n- Lack of complexity in puzzles may leave point-and-click veterans disappointed.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10","February 11, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

The art style and the soundtrack serve to give the player a nice, ambient experience. Finding Teddy is short, but this is a point in its favour: I feel like adding more to it would have made the game somewhat tedious, as there is quite a bit of backtracking and the puzzles can be a hard nut to crack sometimes\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it never communicates to the player how to play. I understand that this is a stylistic choice, and for the most part it works very well, but it took me a long while to realise how to use my companions. There was also one puzzle in particular that made no sense to me. Without spoiling the game, I can say that you find an item that can be used to cut one thing but not another, practically identical thing.\n\nDefinitely recommended. Note that you need to have sound activated in order to play this game properly.","August 26, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManOfDisco/recommended/259600/","ManOfDisco","DISCOMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManOfDisco/","1022 products in account","Finding Teddy is a short but sweet adventure game. At first players may find themselves somwehat confused with some of the puzzles at times however I found that the puzzles are much easier to figure out wehn you don't spend too muc time on worrying about them and just try to explore and see what you can pick up. Once you pick the items up try experimenting with them in a logical way with the environment and you'll find your way through the game in no time.\n\nThe story is about a girl whose teddy is stolen from her by a monster through a wardrobe. Of course she wants Teddy back so she investigates the wardrobe and finds herself in another world filled with odd and familiar creatures among other strange things. The story was quite touching and I won't spoil it in this review - you'll have to play the game for yourself to experience it!\n\nArtistically and musically, the game has a lot to offer. You can buy the soundtrack on this page if you would like and I would recommend doing so if you enjoy the soundtrack in the game (which, might I add, is very good and well put together and definitely suits the theme of the game). The art style reminds me of the SuperBrothers game, Sword and Sworcery due to some of the backgrounds and generally the pixellated kind of style. Also clicking with the mouse cursor is reminiscent of that game too. The art and music are both very well done and suit the overall theme of Finding Teddy well.\n\nAs for replay value, there are numerous achievements to unlock in this game, most of which can be obtained simply by playing the game normally. There are even achievements for dying (and death is very forgiving in this game, so don't worry)! Throughout the course of the game there are 15 fireflies to collect, I believe that there is 5 fireflies per area. Myself I could only find one and that was in a black portion of a cave which I came across accidentally - so I don't think that they are going to be very easy to find and you can of course skip collecting them entirely if you wish. There is also some bonus artwork to unlock once you collect fireflies.\n\nI'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone - especially those that like the adventure game genre. Keep in mind that this is a point-and-click game and it originated on iOS so if you'd prefer to play this game using touch I'd say to go pick it up on the App Store instead. With that said the game has been ported over really well and doesn't feel like it needed to be any different as all the options are sufficient enough to play the game the way it was intended, which is great!\n\nAs a side-note, I'd even say that this game could be somewhat appropriate for children to play as it has that sort of Monster's Inc. vibe to it (looking at the screenshots you'll probably be able to see what I mean by that). However with that said there are a few scenes that could be considered violent or disturbing so please play the game yourself before allowing a child to play!\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and as stated previously would recommend it to pretty much anyone for a relaxing adventure game experience. Personally I'm looking forward to more from this developer in the future as I was very impressed with Finding Teddy. I hope that this review has helped (and hasn't been too long....?) your purchase of Finding Teddy!","August 13, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough to not feel too easy or obvious. It's rather cute, and the music-based puzzles can be an interesting challenge until you figure out how easy it really is (you're probably overthinking it).\nCons: The trailer music is about as good as the game's music gets. In most areas it can start to grate on your nerves. It's too bass-heavy to listen to for a prolonged period of time before you feel the need to move on to something else. Two playthroughs will get you all of the Steam achievements -- one if you use a walkthrough guide or are excruciatingly meticulous about seeking out the hidden things.\nReplayable: Not really. I finished all achievements in two playthroughs. I probably won't play again unless I'm showing it to somebody.

The pleasant pixel-art visuals are a blend of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery meets Fez, with a vibrant color pallette more closely resembling that of the latter. Sound design is another strong point of the game; not only is there solid ambient music to help set a moody atmosphere, but sound also plays a prominent role when it comes to creating some of the more interesting and unique puzzles that Finding Teddy has to offer. I also really enjoyed the simplistic and traditional nature of the game. The interface is very minimalistic and there are practically no hints of any kind. The player is allowed to explore these dream-like environments on their own without any assistance and the game is better off because of this. The story is a short one (~90 minutes) but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's the kind of adventure you can finish up in a single night and still be completely satisfied by the experience.\n\nIn all, I had quite a good time playing Finding Teddy. Nice art design, a minimalistic style, and an endearing story of friendship and loneliness.

Don't expect too much of it though, once you figured it out it hasn't got that much of a replay value - but if you want every achievement you have to play through it twice (beating the game once will unlock new game+ if you load the game you beaten) thus a short story is actually preferable as you unlock one of the achievements in the very end of the game the second time you play it. I like it, but I don't see myself playing through it more than I already have - it's a neat way to waste some time if you have an hour or two to spare :).","September 21, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it is a very pretty game and considering you get the soundtrack free with the game I would say £1.49 is worth that alone.\n\nWhen it comes to the game itself you play as a little girl who is adventuring through this magical land in search of her teddy. Do not be fooled though, this is not a game about sunshine and rainbows, in fact the game I would liken this to the most would be LIMBO, and for those of you that have played that you know what kind of deaths await you.\nThroughout the game you travel through different areas in order to help the creatures in your way. You do this in most cases by singing to them. It's a very interesting mechanic and I like it a lot.\nWhile the game is rather short the odds are that you will not see 100% of it on your first play through. I personally only saw 60% of the game on my first playthrough and because of that I will be playing it again to get 100%. Past that however there isn't much replayability here other than achievements and hidden artwork you can unlock and look at in the game, however for such a low price I wasn't really expecting something I would be playing for weeks to come.\n\nAs much as I love this game I did however have one problem with the final puzzle in the game. Without spoiling anything I'd like to say that I found this specific puzzle to be pretty poor. This is because in order to complete it you need to have completed it pretty much 100% on your first try, otherwise you will have to google the answer. While this wouldn't be a bad thing if you could back track and look for clues, you are instead stuck on the final screen until you solve the final puzzle. Personally I did not get 100% on my first run through and instead had to google the answer after a while and I'm sad to say that even if I had really thought about it for a long time I would never have gotten past this screen because I missed a couple of parts. This could reasily have been solved by only making the mandatory sections part of this puzzle. However they didn't and therefore it ended on less of a "Yay I beat  the game!" and more of a "How was I supposed to ever get that?".\n\nOverall I would still very much recomend this game to anyone, especially for the price it is currently at. Plus it has steam trading cards which is nice too.","April 1, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This made my actions feel less impactful as I had less control over what the character did. Other than that, puzzles are well thought out, even if it took me a while to understand the note system. After figuring that out, the end result was a suprisingly meaningful experience that fit the tone of the game.\n\nThe game looks nice, simple, but nice. The different areas and creatures look unique and interesting, with the exception of the third area, which mostly looks the same, but I feel that it helps improve the overall effect of the area.\n\nYou might need an online guide if you don't immediately understand the game.","April 10, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She goes on a quest to find him in a strange, foreign land. Don't expect it to hold your hand. There is no tutorial or guidance.\n\nIt is a point and click adventure that consists of three chapters, and I think that you could probably get through all three in about 2-3 hours, at most. During your adventure, you have to find items to help you get past obstacles, and there are a few hidden treats for achievements, but overall, I enjoyed my time with Finding Teddy and would recommend it.\n\nI want to make a special note that it has a unique puzzle mechanic that involves 'speaking' to the animals in the game to solve puzzles by using musical notes that relate to letters. I've not seen this in a game before and it was a neat mechanic. It's always refreshing to see something new that keeps the genre interesting.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, it has a new game + feature, if you missed anything (Like I didn't know about fireflies until I was into act 2... whoops!) and there is no punishment for death.

It just happens that the mechanics are very game-like. It is very short, but very beautiful and atmospheric, mixing a very creepy and a very cutesy environment.\n\nIf this story was put into a short film or a book, I wouldn't have bothered with it. It needs to be an interactive exploring experience.\n\nIf you have any respect for story, charm, art and creativity, you do want to play this game and the developer deserves all the praise they can get for making this. I certainly hope that they will make more stuff like this in the future.","May 23, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She goes on a quest to find him in a strange, foreign land. Don't expect it to hold your hand. There is no tutorial or guidance.\n\nIt is a point and click adventure that consists of three chapters, and I think that you could probably get through all three in about 2-3 hours, at most. During your adventure, you have to find items to help you get past obstacles, and there are a few hidden treats for achievements, but overall, I enjoyed my time with Finding Teddy and would recommend it.\n\nI want to make a special note that it has a unique puzzle mechanic that involves 'speaking' to the animals in the game to solve puzzles by using musical notes that relate to letters. I've not seen this in a game before and it was a neat mechanic. It's always refreshing to see something new that keeps the genre interesting.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, it has a new game + feature, if you missed anything (Like I didn't know about fireflies until I was into act 2... whoops!) and there is no punishment for death. You just start over on the same screen. In fact, it is often rewarded in the form of achievements :)","May 4, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManOfDisco/recommended/259600/","ManOfDisco","DISCOMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManOfDisco/","1022 products in account","Finding Teddy is a short but sweet adventure game. At first players may find themselves somwehat confused with some of the puzzles at times however I found that the puzzles are much easier to figure out wehn you don't spend too muc time on worrying about them and just try to explore and see what you can pick up. Once you pick the items up try experimenting with them in a logical way with the environment and you'll find your way through the game in no time.\n\nThe story is about a girl whose teddy is stolen from her by a monster through a wardrobe. Of course she wants Teddy back so she investigates the wardrobe and finds herself in another world filled with odd and familiar creatures among other strange things. The story was quite touching and I won't spoil it in this review - you'll have to play the game for yourself to experience it!\n\nArtistically and musically, the game has a lot to offer. You can buy the soundtrack on this page if you would like and I would recommend doing so if you enjoy the soundtrack in the game (which, might I add, is very good and well put together and definitely suits the theme of the game). The art style reminds me of the SuperBrothers game, Sword and Sworcery due to some of the backgrounds and generally the pixellated kind of style. Also clicking with the mouse cursor is reminiscent of that game too. The art and music are both very well done and suit the overall theme of Finding Teddy well.\n\nAs for replay value, there are numerous achievements to unlock in this game, most of which can be obtained simply by playing the game normally. There are even achievements for dying (and death is very forgiving in this game, so don't worry)! Throughout the course of the game there are 15 fireflies to collect, I believe that there is 5 fireflies per area. Myself I could only find one and that was in a black portion of a cave which I came across accidentally - so I don't think that they are going to be very easy to find and you can of course skip collecting them entirely if you wish. There is also some bonus artwork to unlock once you collect fireflies.\n\nI'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone - especially those that like the adventure game genre. Keep in mind that this is a point-and-click game and it originated on iOS so if you'd prefer to play this game using touch I'd say to go pick it up on the App Store instead. With that said the game has been ported over really well and doesn't feel like it needed to be any different as all the options are sufficient enough to play the game the way it was intended, which is great!\n\nAs a side-note, I'd even say that this game could be somewhat appropriate for children to play as it has that sort of Monster's Inc. vibe to it (looking at the screenshots you'll probably be able to see what I mean by that). However with that said there are a few scenes that could be considered violent or disturbing so please play the game yourself before allowing a child to play!\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game and as stated previously would recommend it to pretty much anyone for a relaxing adventure game experience. Personally I'm looking forward to more from this developer in the future as I was very impressed with Finding Teddy. I hope that this review has helped (and hasn't been too long....?) your purchase of Finding Teddy!","August 13, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not usually very patient with point-and-click adventures, but I love spiders and teddy bears so I had to give it a shot. I found it started a little slow, and there is a bit of running back and forth, but it didn't seem excessive to me. I thought the puzzles were balanced well; most of them required a bit of thought but nothing was so obtuse that it couldn't be figured out. My husband suggested some solutions when I was stuck, but at no point was I inclined to give up and look up an answer.\n\nThe game does a good job of creating a slightly creepy but still heart-warming atmosphere. A few of the death scenes are strangely gory and seem a little out of place, but overall the art and music combine to create a very engaging world. Technically my only complaint is that the animations in the new game plus mode revert to the original art rather than using whatever optional art upgrade you've chosen.\n\nOverall, a very nice little game. I'm looking forward to the sequel!","August 25, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pleasant pixel-art visuals are a blend of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery meets Fez, with a vibrant color pallette more closely resembling that of the latter. Sound design is another strong point of the game; not only is there solid ambient music to help set a moody atmosphere, but sound also plays a prominent role when it comes to creating some of the more interesting and unique puzzles that Finding Teddy has to offer. I also really enjoyed the simplistic and traditional nature of the game. The interface is very minimalistic and there are practically no hints of any kind. The player is allowed to explore these dream-like environments on their own without any assistance and the game is better off because of this. The story is a short one (~90 minutes) but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's the kind of adventure you can finish up in a single night and still be completely satisfied by the experience.\n\nIn all, I had quite a good time playing Finding Teddy. Nice art design, a minimalistic style, and an endearing story of friendship and loneliness. Recommended for those who are fans of the genre.","December 16, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are interesting and just challenging enough to not feel too easy or obvious. It's rather cute, and the music-based puzzles can be an interesting challenge until you figure out how easy it really is (you're probably overthinking it).\nCons: The trailer music is about as good as the game's music gets. In most areas it can start to grate on your nerves. It's too bass-heavy to listen to for a prolonged period of time before you feel the need to move on to something else. Two playthroughs will get you all of the Steam achievements -- one if you use a walkthrough guide or are excruciatingly meticulous about seeking out the hidden things.\nReplayable: Not really. I finished all achievements in two playthroughs. I probably won't play again unless I'm showing it to somebody. Even so, this fact doesn't make the game any less enjoyable.","December 23, 2013","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This made my actions feel less impactful as I had less control over what the character did. Other than that, puzzles are well thought out, even if it took me a while to understand the note system. After figuring that out, the end result was a suprisingly meaningful experience that fit the tone of the game.\n\nThe game looks nice, simple, but nice.

To be honest, when I was stumped and found out the solutions, it made sense.\n\nThe art style is very beautiful and I took a lot of screenshots. There were two interesting parts to this game that made me keep playing. 1) There is the aspect of needing to help others to get your rewards (informtion, objects, etc.) and 2) The puzzles incorporate music to figure out messages. If you play this game, you should be familiar with the English alphabet and have a good ear for music notes. You'll also want to keep a piece of paper nearby to take notes.\n\nAs a note, some people who are highly sensitive may not like many of the ways that the girl dies. I do not play any horror games because I don't really like scary or gruesome things, but I did not find that to be a problem with this game.","February 27, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A giant spider from another world kidnaps a little girl's teddy bear as she sleeps.  Your mission is to help her get Teddy back.\n\nThe game doesn't have any verbs or action icons for interacting with the world, thus making the interface pretty simple.  You can collect items and then use those items from your inventory with the environment.  There is no need to combine items  with each other via the inventory system.\n\nThe characters that you speak to don't have any english dialogue, but they instead communicate through melodic sounds.  There are many puzzles that can be solved through brute force trial & error, but it's definitely worth the effort to discover the cypher to the creatures' musical language.\n\nThe graphics are the old-school pixel graphics reminiscent of the point & click adventures published  back in the 90s.  The animations are fluid and beautiful to watch.  The music and sound only serve as ambient noise while you explore the world.  Unfortunately, you won't find any catchy theme music in this title.\n\nI highly recommend Finding Teddy and hope that the developer produces a sequel!","February 28, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of joy can come from stopping in a few of the areas and just enjoying the atmosphere.\n\n+ Atmosphere is peaceful, and yet suprisingly erie and unsettling at times.\n\n+ The game uses an interesting music/alphabet system. If you play it, you'll see what I mean.\n\n+ First playthrough lasts 3 hours or so (if you figure out the puzzles quickly), which is a good length for a game like this imo\n\n+ Second playthrough (New Game+) can last only 30 minutes or so, which is good for achievment hunters (2 runs are required for 100%)\n\n+ General feel-good game. Highly enjoyable.\n\n\n\nMeh things\n+/- Music is ehhh. There are some tracks that are really great, and some that are repetitive and a little obnoxious\n\n\n\nNegatives\n- There are hidden (literally invisible) collectibles in the game, which aren't explained at all.

The games decision to avoid -any- type of text leads to several problematic user experiences (such as controls or a total lack of options)\n-Only action seems to be left click (not sure since nothing is ever explained in the slightest bit)\n-Can't tell what you can and can't interact with\n-Can't tell if using an item on a monster will actually work or not, but if it doesn't it will replay the overly long death scene...and you can't skip it.\n-Not really any options of any kind (only "full screen/windowed" via an icon on the main menu)\n\nThe pixel art style is somewhat endearing, but pretty much everything else about this game is awful. The "gameplay" is nonsensical, consisting of randomly clicking on everything and often ending up seeing the same animation over and over.\n\nIt took me a good minute just to get the game started from the bedroom scene until I found out you have to click on the closet.

You play as a girl entering into a dream-like nature world of animals with puzzles to solve in order to find your teddy bear. This is fine, but the puzzles are very hit and miss. Sometimes they're intuitive and sometimes 'stuff happens', such as using a fly to lift a cat to extract a root in the background you didn't you could touch which contained a cooked chicken underground to take somewhere else. It sounds quirky, but puzzles need some kind of logical progression, otherwise it becomes mindlessly clicking things in hopes of triggering some bizarre game logic. Finding Teddy doesn't always include those. Contrasting, some puzzles are very simplistic and clever. There's just no even ground between the two.\n\nGraphically, this game is wonderful. It uses a simple palette to give it a cutesy appeal, and while you might not always understand what object you picked up is, the animals/monsters are pleasant to look at it.\n\nLastly, there's a weird theme with using alphabetic music notes to do some of the puzzles and damn if the font isn't incredibly hard to read. It's already masked, but the lettering is small and the letter characters look similar to one another. Many times I had to squint with glasses on to make sense of what something was supposed to be.\n\nAlso, fair warning, this game isn't for kids despite the graphical style. It's probably too nonsensical in terms of what is supposed to be done (the game doesn't explain anything, be it gameplay or controls) and there's almost fetish-like running theme of gory deaths for the little girl at the hands of the monsters and animals who all have to be placated or they kill you.

I got it as part of a bundle, and almost gave away my key before I watched a let's play, and that convinced me to hang onto it.\n\nI've played through the game three times tonight. There's a learning curve the first time through as you figure out all of the puzzles. The second time through I didn't load my old game, so didn't end up with a new game+ (hint: load your game before you second play through.) Finished up my achievements, and then went back through the final time to get the alternate ending and the few achievements you have to get through a new game+. Three and a half hours total, with most of that going to the first play through.\n\nDon't think that just because it's short means that it's not worthwhile though. The art style is polished, even if it's pixel art. It doesn't look cheap like many indie games do. It looks intentional and professional. And it's dark in almost every way, which I appreciate in a game.\n\nThe story is almost hilariously over the top. Or maybe it's completely and hilariously over the top. A giant tarantula steals a teddy bear from a little girl? Who then hunts down said tarantula because she don't give a ♥♥♥♥? Honey badger got nothing on her, son.\n\nIf that kind of thing tickles your fancy, then this one is for you.\n\nThere are some mechanics which I've never seen elsewhere, which did trip me up on my first play through, but which are totally what makes the game what it is. Namely, how it utilizes music/sound. If you're tone deaf like me, it can make certain parts of the game more challenging than necessary. There are some places in the game where there are audio cues and I was in desperate need of visual cues as well. A little glow on the fireflies when you get close would be nice, instead of just the volume of the ping. And showing the letters associated with each sound during all the puzzles would help out the tone deaf like me.\n\nStill, those minor quips fail to detract in any meaningful way from an otherwise enjoyable game. I definitely recommend it.","January 24, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

OK, 2.5: I picked up the jar, too.\n\nAt this point, though, even despite trying to utilize the hint system, it seems I'm stuck. I've explored every available area at least 3x, including viewing the hints to no avail. (Other than a few fail-achievements. Thanks for that!)\n\nI even tried to see it in the spirit of "back in the day" when games were way more abstract and not knowing what to do was seriously part of the fun!  (And I honestly miss that!

The decors are breathtaking and make you want to explore even more, and they can get surprisingly complex. The quiet music in the background and the sounds effects only add to the mystery and dream-like quality of the world around you.\n\nThere is no guide in this gamne, no hint of where you should go next, but it's fairly easy to figure out.

It handles its puzzles, player conveyance/teaching, and its controls very poorly.  The mouse clicking is actually touch screen "emulation" and is very, very inaccurate and causes problems.  I click on the fly and due to the touch screen "ripple" it also selects the cat or the inventory or makes me leave the area.  I click on notes and it clicks through the notes onto actions to walk to things which kill you instead or it will click two notes at once which is never what you want and is completely useless.\n\nI completed the game only having to look up the answer two things at the very end.  One of which was due what I think is a miistake or oversight in the game.  The big spider is the GREAT TARANT.  His mailbox says TARANT, he is referred to as TARANT in at least two or three places.  But, for some reason the yellow glowing lantern puzzle makes you type his name as TARRANT -- extra R.  This made me stuck.  I get that if you concatenate all the wall scribbles you get GRE  EAT  TAR  RANT, but IMO it's still an awful oversight by the devs.  Unless I am missing something...\n\nThe other thing I looked up was the response to "I AM SAD" beause the resonse to that was something the player would have learned at the very very beginning of the game before the player knows how anything even works.  In the beginning, there is pretty much no tutorial and I was mindlessly matching scribbles that I didnt even know were letters at the beginning so I did not properly learn that response to that question.  There is pretty much no tutorial and expecting the player to remember a nugget of infromation from before they understood the game's mechanics is just wrong.\n\nOverall, a nicely styled good idea, but poorly designed mess of a game that should have stayed as a distraction on Andriod/iOS and not a Steam game.","July 15, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pleasant pixel-art visuals are a blend of Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery meets Fez, with a vibrant color pallette more closely resembling that of the latter. Sound design is another strong point of the game; not only is there solid ambient music to help set a moody atmosphere, but sound also plays a prominent role when it comes to creating some of the more interesting and unique puzzles that Finding Teddy has to offer. I also really enjoyed the simplistic and traditional nature of the game. The interface is very minimalistic and there are practically no hints of any kind. The player is allowed to explore these dream-like environments on their own without any assistance and the game is better off because of this. The story is a short one (~90 minutes) but it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's the kind of adventure you can finish up in a single night and still be completely satisfied by the experience.\n\nIn all, I had quite a good time playing Finding Teddy.

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","This is a game that has a interesting story and good visuals, then suffers terribly because of the gameplay.\n\n\n~ Good ~\n\nStory:\n\nThis bizarre, yet sometimes adorable story is told mostly without any dialogue. It reminds a lot about ”Alice in Wonderland” with a dark twist. A strange world where you meet both kind and aggressive creatures. As everything is so weird, you don't know what to expect around the corner. I love stories that can be told without words, which is rare to find nowadays.\n\n\n\n~ Bad ~\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is one of the most tedious games I have ever played. Most of it consists of walking around and backtracking to get one object you need for another area. Usually these objects are ridiculously easy to get (click once, get item. Done.) and often it takes more time to walk back. It unfortunately reminds me of ”Secret Files 3” where the main character is deliberately dumped back to the start, so that the game will become ”longer” as you waste time walking through non-interactive areas.\n\nThis also leads to dissapointments in the story, because most of the strange creatures interaction are redused to ”Fetch item. Give item.” It takes away the sense of fear and mystery about them. As everything about them is solved the same way, it leaves them all quite samey despite their different appearences.\n\nAnother tedious design of the game, which could have been brilliant and unique, is that some puzzles requires the character to sing notes that another character sings. All notes represent the alphabet (which is not brought up by the game for some reason) and you basically repeat a message. The problem is that you have so many notes and when you first play the game, none of them are displayed on your notebar. So unless you have a good ear for tones (I do.. a bit), great memory (definately not my thing) or great attention to things (nope), then these puzzles becomes frustrating.\n\nThe high pitched notes are not only irritating to listen to, but they are also hard to distinguish. Even with the background music off (which was overpowering the notes), it's still hard for me to make out the sound.\nThe notes are also not written in clear letters, instead they are in a font which makes them hard to destuingish. And there are some creatures which doesn't even show the notes you have to click, forcing you to have perfect sense of tone, memory, visuals and hearing.\n\nThis could easily have been the best part of the game, with a better choice of sounds (less earbleeding) and clearer visuals for the notes. And allowing them all to be displayed from the start. It would make the puzzles fun rather than frustrating.\n\nGame bugs:\n\n- Obviously the game is designed for something wider than a mouse cursor, as some doors won't activate unless you click very far off screen.\n- The music in the start screen constantly glitches and skips.\n- Sometimes when you try to interac with objects nearby a door or ladder, then the character will just walk out of the room, despite not clicking anywhere close to the exit.\n- After I completed the game and tried to turn it off, the game crashed.\n- Not every "room" in the game allows you to practice on the notes, despite that you can always bring out the noteboard to "sing". This leads to two problems.\n1: There are only some rooms where you aren't "supposed" to sing. When you try to click certain notes, it will just click on the monsters in the background that will proceed to kill the character. How am I supposed to know she isn't supposed to sing in this room? Why can I click some notes while others clicks on the background?\n2: When you want to practice next to the characters that only makes sounds and no notes, the game will make a loud "DING" sound, because you are technically clicking an area you aren't supposed to, which blocks out the notes sounds. Even when you have the notes screen up, the game makes that loud dinging noise as if you are missclicking.","March 14, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s Too Obtuse To Be Fun.Genre: 2D Point & Click Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Storybird & LookAtMyGame, Plug In Digital.\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nFinding Teddy is a simple point-and-click game from a new developer. Featuring a 2D plane with rich pixelart and a musically inclined theme similar to a previous game that I’ve reviewed. Your teddy bear has been stolen so you’re going through another world, trying to get him back. That’s pretty much it, there really isn’t much to the story and the other “characters” don’t do or say anything of significance. I know they intentionally wanted to craft a game without dialogue, but there’s a lack of narrative that I can’t ignore.\n\nThe main mechanic is a lot of simple inventory puzzles. Find an item, give it a creature/thing for another item and keep going until you reach the end of the level. All the while, you’re being sung to by creatures and walls. Which you’re supposed to figure out that the notes are actually letters from the english alphabet. But the game doesn’t really clue you in and the notes look so alien that I didn’t figure it out until a guide clued me in. Even if I was willing to let go of this complaint, it’s not that fun a mechanic. It’s more annoying as you try to match the notes in the right order to progress through the game but there’s a lack of feedback as to whether you’re doing it correctly.\n\nFar too many of the puzzles are too obtuse to figure out, with clues too far and few between. There’s no real hint to what each item does and I had to use a guide to get through at least 50% of the game. I’m not the greatest puzzler on the earth but even for me that’s pretty bad. While I can’t fault a game for my incompetency, the obtuseness of the game with the rather meager puzzles and story can be faulted.\n\nPC Settings (Or lack thereof)\nThere is exactly one thing you can change in Finding Teddy: fullscreen on or off. Nothing else can be changed. There aren’t any .ini files that I could find either. It did run well during my playthrough but for such a short game, I do kinda expect that to be the case.\n\nSoundtrack is simply ok, not all that interesting or engaging to listen to. There’s also the other issue that the sound effects are too quiet over the louder soundtrack. Which would be easily solved if audio sliders had been put in but well, that didn’t happen. Even more odd is that there’s a lack of audio feedback. When you click on objects or move around, there’s nothing to really back up that you did that. It bothered me the entire while during my playthrough.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nFor a scant couple of hours, Finding Teddy is merely ok, not all that special. The lack of audio-feedback, the obtuse UI and puzzle design can be far more aggravating than I think it’s worth. I’m sure for the devs it was a great starting point and it’s got lovely pixelart to look at. But I just didn’t really enjoy myself with it, not helped by the constant need to refer to a guide in order to finish the game. All that combined with a minimal story and I'm finding it difficult to recommend Finding Teddy.\n\nRead this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","July 18, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The note system will throw you for a loop at first, because everything in this game is explained only to the slightest degree, which I understand can be frustrating, but understanding that you have to match words/notes to figure out words, remember the words so that you can use them when the time is right, and knowing that your items menu is pulled up just by clicking on her is really all there is that may be confusing to understand at first.\n\nHonestly, best game I have played in a while. 10/10, absolutely enchanting.","July 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It handles its puzzles, player conveyance/teaching, and its controls very poorly.  The mouse clicking is actually touch screen "emulation" and is very, very inaccurate and causes problems.  I click on the fly and due to the touch screen "ripple" it also selects the cat or the inventory or makes me leave the area.  I click on notes and it clicks through the notes onto actions to walk to things which kill you instead or it will click two notes at once which is never what you want and is completely useless.\n\nI completed the game only having to look up the answer two things at the very end.  One of which was due what I think is a miistake or oversight in the game.  The big spider is the GREAT TARANT.  His mailbox says TARANT, he is referred to as TARANT in at least two or three places.  But, for some reason the yellow glowing lantern puzzle makes you type his name as TARRANT -- extra R.  This made me stuck.  I get that if you concatenate all the wall scribbles you get GRE  EAT  TAR  RANT, but IMO it's still an awful oversight by the devs.  Unless I am missing something...\n\nThe other thing I looked up was the response to "I AM SAD" beause the resonse to that was something the player would have learned at the very very beginning of the game before the player knows how anything even works.  In the beginning, there is pretty much no tutorial and I was mindlessly matching scribbles that I didnt even know were letters at the beginning so I did not properly learn that response to that question.  There is pretty much no tutorial and expecting the player to remember a nugget of infromation from before they understood the game's mechanics is just wrong.\n\nOverall, a nicely styled good idea, but poorly designed mess of a game that should have stayed as a distraction on Andriod/iOS and not a Steam game.","July 15, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not too hard to figure out most of the controls on your own despite the lack of instruction. There were only two things that troubled me. One being some of the puzzles did not have the answers I thought they might so they took a little fiddling. The second being I could not read the musical notes as letters for quite some time, I think because I was looking at them as a foreign language or more as musical notes since they were assosiated with music. Several of the letters had such similar designs making them easy to mix up as well. I adored all of the music and sound effects, although I accidentally muted the sound at one point which made me panicked since I could not solve the musical riddles without hearing them! The graphics were both adorable and gorgeous, the color choice overall was awe inspiring when paired with the music or ambience! Interacting with creatures that lashed out when approached unexpectedly only to find they all could be very nice if you were careful and kind. I loved the story through and through. The ending made me happy as can be, going so far as to bring me to tears for how lovely it truly was. It leaves me wanting more for how short it is, but I still would fully suggest purchasing it. Thank you so much for creating this lovely game!","April 5","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
