We've all been there.\n\nI think we can say the game is a boss-fight-shoot-them-up/rythm-game that can be played with only the mouse.\n\nSound simple? It is! But you will need to be extremely focused and reactive to beat advanced levels or make the highest scores.\nAlso, each level has its own music, rythm and patterns, renewing the gameplay and changing your approach of the boss.\n\nIf I had to find a negative point, I would say I was not really interested by the story behind the game, but that's a very minor drawback.\n\nDefinitely an original game that you should try, it's the kind of title you probably never played before.","August 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

It get really hard, really fast but that's what makes it so rewarding. You don't need to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy it, though : earlier levels  are a decent challenge but really nothing insurmountable and you can very much progress at your own pace with the difficulty options.","August 24, 2015","true","7.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Light, colored light everywhere! Damn pretty!\nI like the atmosphere of this game, the light, the color, the soundtrack. On a gameplay level, the game is faster than your brain, really smooth (can't blame it when I loose...). I'd like to see it running on a touch device.\nOn the other side, I found it quite difficult! (Or it's my brain that can't process all the information).\nThere's a lot of things on screen (light beam, shields, power ups, rockets...) and it can be a bit hard to find where to shoot without dying.\nOk, so time to get back saving the universe!! (By the way, don't try the hard mode, you'll get hurt).\n","August 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It excels at pushing you out of your comfort zone, throwing shapes and rhythms in your face, increasingly challenging your brain at every moment.\n\nAn unlock-as-you-score modifier system allows for high replayability, and it gets quickly additcive.\nWhile the art could benefit some polish, the gameplay puts genuinely original ideas on the table, and it's something great nowadays !\n\nThis game sits close to Race The Sun, where playing require no effort, and where practise is its own reward.\n","August 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You will feel good after playing it. I'm not even kidding.\n\nSomewhat longer version:\n\nSimply said, this game is smart. Entertaining and smart. It's a game that, for once, you can't just go about dumbly mashing buttons and fragging mobs. You'll have a tiny smidgin of thinking to do every nanosecond, which - and you'll experiment this for yourself - will actually make you feel like it improves your brain.\n\nSynchrom could be a training program to help you play other games better. And it could be just that. But better yet, it has a theme. It has bosses. It has unlocks.\n\nAnd it makes every beat of music a pulsing weapon that just feels good when you're synced and unlocking upgrades.\n\nI don't regret downloading this, like I regret downloading 10 Gigs of DayZ.\n\n- Game was fun\n- Brain felt good\n- Beats were awesome\n- Shooting in sync to the beat felt great inside\n\n1010 would feel great inside again.","August 27, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/recommended/393740/","edgarallanwoah","Edgarallanwoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgarallanwoah/","1326 products in account","This is a unique title, that is at the same time difficult, yet relaxing. A game that is easy to lose yourself into and before you know it it’s been 4 hours. (offline playtime for the win)\n\nIt’s gameplay is simple enough, take your mouse and rotate around a cube, match colors and break the cube away. The art is simple, and gorgeous with flashing lights and a color palette that doesn’t overwhelm. Everything else does though. ALL THE LASERS\n\nThere is a story here, but I can’t begin to tell you what it might really be about. That sounds bad, and on one hand it is. On the other though the gameplay itself kept me going. The game is punishing and difficult, and as you proceed with a higher score (maybe) you unlock additional stuff. YAY, we all like stuff.\n\nSome issues I had, aside from the extreme difficulty spike (to be fair, I was warned it was hard.) Were that occasionally my mouse cursor (or Synchrom) would get stuck just for a moment at some point on the screen, as if my mouse was not responding. Then it would work, and I would die. I looked over other reviews to see if anyone else has had this issue, and I didn’t see any other reports. This could be something locally with our machine here though.\n\nI do agree with one other review that stated they would be interested to see the game with touch controls. I think that it would fit well with the game, and possibly even be better than a mouse for controls. If I had a choice though I would love to see a controller supported for this game on PC.\n\nFor the moment of truth! Do we recommend this game?\n\nYes, it’s addictive in the way that puzzle games tend to be with the “one more high score-itis” Is that a thing? It should be. On top of that the low price point of 9.99 makes this easy to pick up, and I’ve already spent as much time as a short triple A title with it. If you really hate yourself, or you think you’re the best thing since sliced cheese then you can up the difficulty and see how long you last before you break something, or your head explodes, so there’s lots of replayability. Unless your head explodes, then there’s probably not much.\n\nwww.8bitlanparty.com","October 28, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

And the color of your cursor will change according to the beat of the music.\nFirst you target protective blocks of the boss, and finally you'll target its core: Each stage is divided into several musical phases where the boss entity wakes up and evolves as millstones are met.\nThis game will make you retry a lot, and I can assure you the music is not repetitive, and that each time you'll progress little by little.","May 5","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
