The gameplay is extremely minimal, while the true soul of the game lies in its ambiance, art direction, and core concept.  This is the type of game which won’t appeal to everyone.  For those who appreciate the occasional artsy game with minimal gameplay, then you will probably find Year Walk interesting, relaxing, and enjoyable.  If you are looking to play a traditional video game, you shouldn’t be looking here.\n\nThe gameplay is roughly 3 parts “walking-simulator” and 1 part puzzle game.  Navigating the area is your primary “challenge,” with the addition of a few puzzles you will have to solve.  The answers to these puzzles can be a bit obscure, but there is a competent hint system if you want to avoid being stuck for too long and just want to enjoy the zen of the game.\n\nThe core concept of the game is also quite interesting.  Year Walk is based on the Swedish folklore of Årsgång, which I had never heard of before playing this, and which I found to be interesting.  After learning a bit about it, I was able to see that the developers did an outstanding job bringing the idea to life in video game form, even despite its inherently simplistic design.\n\nThe art direction, soundscape, and overall ambiance of the game make for a mysterious atmosphere which is very well aligned with the core concept.  Admittedly, the graphics are quite simple; but the simple graphics fit the simple game.\n\nShort, interesting, and atmospheric: Year Walk makes for a fun little experience that is well-produced and should be easily enjoyed by anyone who truly appreciates the genre.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 105 of 114 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","105","114","0","3"

The Steam version of this game is as beautifully made as the original, and the changed puzzles feel at home on the PC. The atmosphere is greatly enhanced in this version of the game, providing a creepier mood than the iOS version - so much so that surprises I knew were coming still got jolts out of me. The story behind this game is so intriguing and mysterious that I wish there was more information about it online; Year Walk is an amazing introduction into Scandinavian folklore that everyone should play.\n","March 6, 2014","true","4.4"," 89 of 93 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","89","93","0","1"

It's chilling and unnerving in a way that messes with your head, transcending its own existence into something that feels tangible; too close for comfort and so well crafted it causes you to second guess your own instincts that this is nothing but fantasy. As I sat staring at "The End" plastered across my screen, I could still feel my quickened pulse as I tried to shake the feeling of being on edge, something no piece of entertainment in any medium has managed in what feels like a very long time.\n\nYear walking is a practice (largely found in Sweden) in which a ritual is performed by the walker through which they are given a glimpse through time at what the future holds. However, it comes at a grave cost, and there is no guarantee the walker will  even make it through alive.\n\nWalking through a forest at midnight, snow blanketing the ground around you, you come face to face with the horrors that befall those that dare to year walk: The Watchers, twisted and greedy spirits, who demand their sacrifice for showing you what is to come. The deeper you get, the more vile and disturbing these encounters become, before you finally enter the church and see your fate.\n\nThis is when the game first ends, but it also marks the point at which the game truly begins. Up to this point you've been bustled along through this story with little in the way of explanation or reason. It's artistically brilliant and frightening to be sure, but all the same largely disconnected and without any real purpose, meant to alarm but ultimately lacking any substance. It's not then until you begin to walk again and the curtain is pulled away that the pieces fall into place and the true meaning behind your circumstances become clear. Terrifyingly so.\n\nYear Walk is a master at what it tries to be. It lets nothing on and leaves you wandering in the dark for a good while, which only makes it more unnerving when it finally lays its cards on the table. The expert use of Swedish folklore ties its world and ours together as it attempts to break the forth wall as it weaves together fantasy and psychological horror into a brief but immensely compelling narrative. If you've gotten this far you've likely realized I've said a lot of nothing in all these words, and that's entirely intentional, as to say what makes Year Walk so brilliant would be to completely ruin it the experience. No, this is one walk that you have to take for yourself, though I promise you won't regret it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","August 1, 2014","true","2.3"," 94 of 102 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","94","102","0","5"

Two, I almost exclusively dislike "puzzle games." I find them annoying and tedious. That being said, I found Year Walk to be a mesmerizing and enjoyable little game.\n\nIn terms of its gameplay, Year Walk doesn't break the mold - there's nothing revolutionary to be found here. The puzzles are relatively simple and only required me to doodle a few things down on a scratch pad to help me solve the majority of them. They're not overly difficult. And if you do find yourself stuck, there's a Hint system in-game that's actually useful.\nThe controls for the PC work well overall, and I had no problems or confusion in how to do anything. So, as a port from a touch based device, this aspect is done fine.\n\nSo, then what makes this an excellent game? As I said, the puzzles presented in the game are not challenging. In fact, as I finished this game I came to the realization I had been tricked. This game wasn't about the puzzles at all. It was about the experience; the visuals, the music, the story, and the atmosphere it all creates. The puzzles are just a way to move you along.\nYear Walk is ultimately all about the experience. And it's definitely quite the experience. It's visually striking - the art style is unique and hauntingly beautiful, and the music fits perfectly in with it. Together they enhance a weird, dark, and rather sad story.\n\nIn the end, Year Walk feels fleshed out and solid. It creates a unique atmosphere that's hard to compare and even harder to forget. Despite not liking puzzles games, I really found myself engrossed in the world that Year Walk so successfully creates.\n\nAddendum (3/19/2014) - After playing through the game completely, twice, and also messing around with extras and some achievements, I feel that I have to make note that this is a short game, and more importantly one that lacks replayability. I'd still recommend the game, it's just something to bear in mind when making a purchase.","March 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 76 of 84 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","76","84","0","0"

You move around the forest as you go on your 'Year Walk' and slowly piece together the puzzles and obscure story. It won the iOS GOTY award last year from many publications and I can easily see why it deserves the accolades.\n\nYear Walk is heavily based on Finnish Swedish folklore and has an amazing art style. You will run into all kinds of creepy demons throughout your adventure. The game does have a few jump scares, but, overall, is more unsettling than scary.\nI would mention that I found the atmosphere quite breathtaking. The mood is set by the oppressive musical backdrop that never distracts as you crunch your way through the snow of the forest.\n\nThe puzzles are where I really dove into the game. I assembled a full piece of paper covered with drawings, notes, and clues over the course of my travels. There is an in-game map, encyclopedia, and hint system to help you through the game and learn about the Swedish background.\n\nThe game is quite short, your first play through should take you about forty five minutes to an hour and a half depending on how quickly things click for you. Multiple play through are encouraged and, in fact, half of the story and the true ending are hidden away in subsequent play. The method of unlocking that ending and reading through the story is quite the ride.\n\nIt is unfortunate as the game has been looked over on Steam entirely. Possibly due to the stream of trash that has been coming down as part of Valve's policies lately. I hope that it gets some more attention going forward as it is a great title.\n\nhttp://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911022538/97EE52E11467DB99B64375A0F67863F9FF2CD941/\n\nhttp://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/595907053911021776/E37C57A854D089254D0BBE943EE2493554DA4930/","April 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","0"

Between the tragic story, dark world and haunting atmosphere it's a very unique experience. With gameplay and other technicalities pushed aside, there's nothing to distract you from immersing yourself in the game. And when you think you're finished, in a very self-referential twist the game reveals another layer of itself to complete the story. Striking and distinct audiovisual side perfectly complements the setting and folklore elements, making the game just as beautiful as it is grim and unnerving. Some criticize it for being quite short. While this is true, it doesn't have to be seen as something negative - the game is polished to the point of being virtually perfect, with no unnecessary content to better capture the essence of its meaning. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. It left me astounded and reflective. I have a feeling I'll be thinking about it for quite a while.","October 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","1"

You are often encouraged and rewarded by checking game's implemented mini-encyclopedia, which is full of interesting reads. As for gameplay itself - it's mostly a point-and-click adventure game, but very unorthodox one. Control scheme and feel is very unique and hard to explain, but it definitely works.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/269050/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Year Walk is best described as a sort of stylistic adventure horror game. It's not really a hidden object game, but more focused on atmosphere and puzzles. The story of Year Walk is that you play as a man named Daniel, who lives deep in the woods. You are about to perform something known as a Year Walk, which is an old Scandinavian legend to starve before the midnight of New Years and wander into the forest and night to seek a glimpse of the future. However, there are trials, and strange beings that are said will try to apprehend you, as the very act of Year Walking breaks the two truths of our world, time and space. As you play you have to overcome these trials, explore the deep and progressively strange and unsettling woods, and over it all maybe piece together why Daniel is so concerned about the future to risk his life.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is great. It's more unsettling, surreal, and strange than scary, but I had a constant uneasy feeling and yet fascination to events as they transpired around me. Everything dips into legends and myths from Swedish and Finnish tales, with a helpful encyclopedia if you're interested in knowing more of the origin of things around you. The whole atmosphere is backed by a fantastic soundtrack that, like the game, is appropriately off-kilter.\n\nYear Walk strikes me as one of those games that sticks with you long after you beat it. The story isn't entirely surprising in how it plays out, but it's executed very well, and the details are a lot stranger and help make the whole situation far stranger than what actually happens. It's sort of like a classic folk-story in that what happens is somewhat predictable if you have any experience with stories of a similar kin, but that's not what makes the story interesting, it's how it's told and how everything comes to that natural conclusion. And Year Walk has a lot of depth, things to look into, and intriguing mysteries that stay in the mind long after you find out what ultimately happens.\n\nGameplay is pretty simplistic. You move left and right along a first-person 2D plane, and occasionally can walk forward or backward to another 2D plane. You interact with objects, and solve puzzles. The game isn't stylized like many other adventure games, with hidden item to find, as what you can and cannot do and interact with is very visible and clear, but some of the puzzles are a bit tricky. My tip is to sometimes think outside of the box. Most of the answers are often more obvious than they may seem at first, none are too challenging, but some aren't pushovers either. I also heavily suggest you keep a notebook and pen handy, it helped me a lot.\n\nIt's a game with great atmosphere, an interesting experience that'll last you about two hours, and for many I'd imagine an interesting introduction to Scandinavian myths and folklore. If you have an interest in atmospheric horror experiences, folk stories, or games with a surrealistic edge, I'd definitely give it a recommendation.","April 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

Were I to sum up my feelings on my time with Year Walk, I could think of no other term or phrase that better exemplifies my experience. In the brief time that it takes to complete this surreal journey, I could barely pull myself away from my computer.\n\nYear Walk is a story of a Love that cannot be, and a man who seeks to know if his love may ever be returned in kind. What follows is a bizarre foray into Scandinavian folklore, of moving through time itself to see one’s future, and facing the terrifying creatures that block your path.\n\nYou’re limited to a two dimensional plane, from which you can move left and right, and to and from connected planes . The entirety of the map is relatively small, with around a dozen or so total planes from which you can move about freely. Given the game’s previous touch screen interface, it’s important to remember as such while trying to figure out puzzles. The game expects you to move your cursor like you would your finger, often quickly and in succession. Mind you, this never becomes a problem, as there are no reflexive puzzles to speak. I just feel it’s worth keeping in mind, as first starting out, it felt a bit odd solving puzzles in that manner using a standard mouse.\n\nGiven this title’s origins on mobile platforms, it is important to know that any limitations this may bring to its mechanics do not extend to its presentation. The world you explore is gorgeous, and the orchestral score and sound design is superbly unsettling, to the point where I could visibly see goose bumps forming on my arms. The visual design itself is equally divine, and combined, make even the occasional jump scare give me a notable fright. While I would recommend this for the score alone, several of the puzzles require you to recognize subtleties in sounds, and so headphones are a must.\n\nThe experience is short; it took me two hours to finish everything, and that was with plenty of incompetency on my part in regards to what I should be doing. Luckily, new to the PC port, there is a map system that always pinpoints your exact location. And there’s a hint system should you ever become lost on what you should be doing next. There’s also a series of journal entries that better explains the horrors you experience. While I would personally recommend waiting on these reads until after finishing the game, at the very least, you should refrain from looking at individual entries until you’ve successfully passed their respective portions of the game.\n\nIn fact, the journal provides something I often find lacking in other similarly surrealistic titles: explanation. The journal provides a background on the Scandinavian mythos that you will encounter in the game, and the entire experience is better for it.\n\nEven given the very short length of the journey, I wholeheartedly recommend it as one that any interested in the bizarre and the macabre should pick up. It is spectacular, and I was glued to my computer screen for the entire duration. My time spent in these woods will remain with me for some time.","June 29, 2014","true","2.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","1"

It is not a very long game, for I finished this in under 2 hours (was expecting 3 hours based on the iOS users comments), but then again I think I missed out on some secrets and feel like there's more to it. (Update: Yes, there indeed is more to it. But I'll just leave it at that!).\n\nThe puzzles here are fine. They're not very difficult, but just requires you to pay attention to the environment. Some of them I sorta "accidentally" solved by just clicking here and there, but otherwise the rest of them can be solved by looking at the environments and taking notes (yes, I actually mean taking notes as in using a pen and paper). Fear not as those that I accidentally solved were early into the game....the latter ones are complex enough that they're no fluke.\n\nOne puzzle was particularly not obvious for me because it uses an input method that is not used in the entire game otherwise (don't wanna spoil too much). Should you be stuck, you can use the in-game hint system, which is kinda like a guide but not always 100% direct. Try not to over-use it, which is exactly what I did initially sadly. In hindsight, I regret succumbing so quickly when I got stuck. But at least this ensures you don't find yourself stuck for prolonged periods of time and needing to Google the solutions becomes moot.\n\nThe atmosphere is well done. It is spooky and there are lots of unexpected things you can expect to see. I played the game in two sittings, the first of which was at around 1am. And my, did it raise my goosebumps! There was one particularly unexpected jump scare which made me say to myself "Ok I'm gonna continue this in the morning in daylight". Having played the second half in the morning, I feel the game's best played at night (past 12mn). Just so much more atmosphere then that cannot be replicated in daylight.\n\nSound is great as well. Kinda what you expect from top-notch atmospheric indie games. It ranges from calm to downright eerie, and complements the game at every turn respectably.\n\nControls are good too, though I would frankly have loved a keyboard shortcut for the map at least. Lost count of the number of times I needed to use the mouse pointer to get to the map screen. The area covered by the game isn't that big though, and there's a fair amount of backtracking required.\n\nAll in all, this is a nice little horror-puzzle-adventure game. The sound design that perfectly complements the haunting visuals sets a great atmosphere for the game. Year Walk received many accolades on iOS so it's good to see it make it to Steam. The $6 price seems reasonable for a two to three hour game that does not overstay its welcome.","February 25, 2014","true","2.8"," 125 of 199 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","125","199","0","16"

It's unique, it thinks outside the box, it's something you ponder over well after the game ends. Let's dive into what people are looking for in a review, shall we?\n\nStory: Pay attention. That's all I can say without spoiling too much. The post-game content contributes a lot in this aspect!\n\nGameplay: Original. This game does require you to do thinking, so don't expect to walk in (hah) and romp through all the puzzles- you won't. Puzzles can involve anything: memorization, sound recognition, unexpected controls, you name it. Solutions are never convoluted- you might be surprised!\n\nGraphics: Beautiful. Simply gorgeous, even when you're looking at a bloodied doll. Love it!\n\nSound Effects: Headphones on, volume up; the sound is superbly done. Everything sounds perfect- the snow crunching under your shoes, the creaking wood of a windmill, the water running in the creek. Is that a woman singing in the distance? Is that a baby wailing... wait. Is that the plippity plop of blood I hear as well?\n\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack is beautiful and immersive. It can range anywhere from "Wow, I could meditate to this!" to "Holy fudge I'm going to die!" Like I said: headphones on, volume up! Lose yourself in Year Walk.\n\nReplayability/Post-Game Content: Only finished one walk so far, but definitely looking forward to jumping back in! After you beat the game, you get access to a nice fat journal in which clues are scattered for you to find. The clues unlock the true ending- it's unsettling.\n\nSo is it scary?: To be honest, YW is not necessarily scary, but it's downright creepy. The atmosphere is done very well! There are a few jumpscares, so players with heart conditions beware!\n\nThe Bad: Just a tad too short (~2-3 hours). A wee more content would be nice!\n\nYear Walk is a solid puzzle/pseudo-horror game.

It really makes you immersed in the world.\n\nThe game isn't difficult. Some of the puzzles are difficult but nothing too head scratching. The game gives you clues  and even then you have hints which are helpful.\n\nThe map layout is the only bad thing about this game. It get's confusing really fast and it doesn't help when all environments look the same. I wish they could have given more indication where you need to go.\n\nGame is really short.

Year Walk was an amazing experience and the whole lore behind it is really interesting. Adventure game fans must own this little title as soon as possible. It's worth it at full price without a doubt. I give Year Walk a 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 22, 2015","true","1.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kassan6ra/recommended/269050/","kassan6ra","Kassan6ra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kassan6ra/","433 products in account","Year walk starts as a puzzle game, only to reveal a backstory that is inspired heavily upon scandinavian folklore and depending on your immersion to the game and your general way of thinking, has the potential to haunt you for days. You start off as a mysterious person who has decided to try what is called "year walking" in order to predict your future. This entails staying alone in the dark without food/water during new year's eve, and when the clock strikes midnight, you take a walk in the forest surrounding your cabin. As you explore, you meet strange creatures, that taunt you with puzzles which you have to solve in order to be allowed for a glimpse of what the future holds. Little do you know that this knowledge comes with consequences.\n\nYear walk's art looks beautiful and in combination with the soundtrack, it creates a haunting and creepy atmosphere. You essentialy walk around in a 2d first person view environment, trying to make sense of the strange things you encounter. Many of them have a meaning towards solving the creature's riddles, so make sure to note down important stuff. Depending on your puzzle skills, you can find them easy or difficult, but there are hint and guide options for the latter, and I believe your overall experience will not be ruined either way. Also, the game's duration is rather small, probably under 3 hours, however I strongly recommend it, especially to avid puzzle gamers and anyone who enjoys a particularly well set backstory.\n\n+ Great art style\n+ Creepy atmosphere\n+ Great story\n+ Simple, but cryptic puzzles\n\n- A few jumpscares (might be a + depending on your taste)\n- Short duration\n- Puzzles can be frustrating without hint use for some people","July 12, 2014","true","3.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","3"

And in a way it is, but not in the traditional sense. Yes, there's clicking involved and yes, there are puzzles to be solved (some of them are really hard, by the way) but it's more of a thriller/horror game with point-and-click adventure mechanics.\n\nI do have to say that I expected more horror here. The game is dark, and there are a couple of moments that are creepy but nothing truly scary. This disappointed me personally, because I like to be scared from time to time.\nThen again, I guess I shouldn't play this game for just that. There are tons of other games that *will* scare you.\nBut Year Walk does have a good story and it looks pretty good for an iPhone port.\n\nIt should be played if you like adventure games, or dark and creepy stories. I thought it was 'just ok', and nothing spectacular. But that's me. You might just have a different opinion.

Don't even get me started on how eerily creepy the game was, especially since when  I first started playing I hadn't been aware that it was a horror game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/269050/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","This game manages to take mythology, folklore and tales from Sweden's past and weave them into a pilgrimage of sorts with an interesting narrative with nothing more than simple puzzle mechanics. It's a lot more fun than many other games of similar ilk and it's clearly down to a lot of care and attention during development as well as a knowledge and emphasis of the lore. I found it short, quite different and refreshing and interesting to play through.\n\nHighlights\nThe things that carry Year Walk are most definitely the simple ambient design and the weaving of the story and lore into the world while staying true to the subject matter. It's carefully and smartly done and often feels as though you're part of a fairy tale or dark bedtime story as much as a video game.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nBeing a port of a mobile game, it suffers from a lack of depth from the gameplay, and while the hands off approach definitely works well with the narrative and story, it's still an issue when compared against other longer, deeper titles at the same price. Having said that though, I feel like had the game been any longer it may've run the risk of adding less enjoyable puzzles for the sake of length rather than story and ultimately, while short and simple, everything is fun to experience and discover.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at $5.99/£4.79/4.99€ on the Steam Store at the time of review, Year Walk isn't expensive and probably isn't overpriced, but there may be better alternatives around the same price range on Steam and mobile. Due to the interesting world, atmosphere and content though, and the simple enjoyable play-through, there's no reason to avoid Year Walk and it's worth a play for anyone looking to waste an hour or so.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/269050\n\n* Note: Purely by coincidence I seem to have played Year Walk at the perfect time and picked up a free achievement for my luck.

The puzzles aren't really that difficult if you're used to this type of game (though the musical sequences don't apply to this). There are several bits which can be a bit nerve wrecking (e.g. the safe just outside your cottage) and many of the throphies require you to play the game once or twice again.\nAll in all it really is a solid, little piece of work which is well worth the money. I don't want to spoil anything, seeing how it really is gratifying when you figure something out on your own.

There is a tension that accompanies the cold sounds and bleak environs. I was very impressed by the artistic style of Year Walk. It was minimalist, bleak but also beautiful. The colours aren't vibrant but they needn't be - hell they *shouldn't be*. This is the snowy wilderness of Scandinavia. I expect white, greys, blacks. Purples and reds are also used sparingly and effectively. The puzzles can be difficult, which I find helps the game a lot. It's a bit of a throwback to when games just sort of left you to it, with few or no hints. You're pretty much on your own in Year Walk, and I had to consult a walkthrough a couple of times. Some puzzles require some thought, and I found myself utilising the whole map to complete the puzzles, so no wasted space there at all.\n\n\nThe story is a difficult aspect to critique because I feel the gameplay tells the story itself. So to critique the way I play the game is to critique the story. That being said, there is some backstory, which is told through some basic dialogue at the beginning of the game, and there is an encyclopaedia which accompanies you in the game, which is pretty critical to completing the game - but the information in the (very small) encyclopaedia helps give background also. I find this method of story telling to be quite innovative and also found it really help immerse me in the game. The controls are basic - arrow keys for navigation, mouse for point/click. Can't really go wrong there.\n\nIn conclusion, Year Walk is a quirky, beautiful little game. Not particularly long, but it achieves a lot in that short time, particularly in regards to puzzle solving, immersion, horror and artistry.","October 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It is about the experience. It is enjoying your walk, hearing your footsteps in the snow, the scenes, the art and the little story. How good you are at this game is not how fast you can finish it or how easy you found the puzzles (and yes, it is short and yes, the puzzles are rather easy).\nTo new players, I would recommend to take your time and explore everything, read everything and avoid the temptation of hitting the "clue" button.

I certainly will. Some of the Steam achievements could be a good excuse to go back inside (like finishing a walk without using the map or skipping clues, which you can easily manage after playing it once).

You embark on a long walk in the woods, looking for signs and meanings, and you come across some very strange stuff. There's a very dreamlike quality to the game where the odd glyph or ghost you run into feels almost expected, but it also serves to take you out of the real world and immerse you with very simple, beautiful graphics. This makes the horrifying bits all the more effective, because they come in rough contrast to the feel of the rest of the game. I won't lie, there have been a few jump scares, but the feel earned instead of cheap. It's like a nightmare intruding on the edges of a pastoral dream.\n\nGameplay is simple, moving left or right through pretty landscapes, moving forward or backward to different areas, and clicking on things to interact. You have a useful map and an encyclopedia that helps flesh out the legends and signs you encounter. The game also has a very clever way of getting you to use the encyclopedia later on, which I found very effective. The puzzles are pretty simple as well, so don't go in expecting a lot of gameplay. It's mostly exploring the woods and delving into the myths you encounter, which for the price, I think is well worth it. An entertaining, chilling experience.","September 10, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

There is a bit of blood, but it serves a greater purpose. And there are a few well-done jumpscares. (I counted three that really made me jump, but I haven't seen the whole game.) The game is based off of old Swedish folklore, so there's a handy encylopedia in game if you have any questions about what you see. (It's better than going in blind!)\n\nThe puzzles are very insightful, and they require some thought. There are hints, so use them if you get stuck. Some of them require unusual means to solve. (One uses "keys" and even the game's interface to solve.) I really have to applaud the dev's creative thinking for these puzzles! Oh, and pay attention to your surroundings. Those hold the key to some of the puzzles. Especially in places you don't want to tarry too long.\n\nThe art is amazing, no lie. It's beautifully done, and the monochrome pallete sets you in a very somber mood. (There are splashes of color here and there, though)\n\nThe music is wonderful, and the song they play during the credits especially is both eerie and soothing, which ups the creepy factor by about ten. However, there is a part (In an old tree) where the music gets kind of loud, but don't mute your sound because you need it on to solve that puzzle.)\n\nAnd don't forget there's a new game plus feature! That box you can't open right near your cabin at the beginning of the game? Ignore it. You can only get to it after you've already done one walk.\n\nThis is hands down one of the best indie horror games I've ever played.

Do not let yourself be fooled by the "horror" tag some people have put the game under; this is anything but a horror game despite - or rather because of - its exploring of a dark folklore.\nYear Walk isn't just another video game, in that you won't have fun going through it. You will experience something.\nHave you ever encountered an Owl in the middle of a forest, at night? Stood silent in the dark, your breathing suddenly becoming less of an automatism, while these two bright eyes were staring at you? It is a very precious feeling; one that games such as Year Walk try to convey... and sometimes succeed in doing so.","February 17","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its tone is both wondrous and depressing, dictated very firmly by the Scandinavian folklore on which the game heavily leans. The game uses all the tools at its disposal rather impressively, creating auditory puzzles as well as visual ones and hiding relevant information in plain sight. Unfortunately, this may make some puzzles come off as obtuse and force people to look up solutions outside of the game proper.\n\nI'm giving this game a "thumbs up" despite the fact that I don't want to play it again. True to the folklore that inspired the game, there is no happy ending to be found in it. From the perspective of someone who appreciates game-world lore consistency, I love this, but it still does not compel me to replay the game (for achievements or otherwise).\n\nPersonally, I find the experience to be worth the full admission price, despite the tone.

Year Walk grabs you and drags you down into the dark and curious lore of early Sweden, where mythical creatures roam the night, questionable if they will help or harm on your journey to get a glimpse of the future. This game has a couple screamers, only two I believe, so be warned. A mix of mind grinding puzzles and a lonesome atmosphere make for an excellent envirment to get yourself immersed in. With every solution to a puzzle, you wonder where the game will lead you next, as it doesn't like to 'hold your hand'.\n\nYear Walk has two ending, the second requiring lots of attention to detail, as it's that other ending that really pieces together this whole journey and the risks of knowing what is to come before it's happened. The visuals are like art, mostly 2D, but able to blow you away when it switches to 3D. I completed the game, achievements and all, in three hours, so you can easily beat Year Walk in an hour or less, assuming you haven't gotten stuck on a puzzle. You must play this game for yourself in order to completely understand it's brilliance.\n\nMy final rating: 9/10\nOne of the most beautiful games I've ever played.","March 6, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Year Walk is a fantastic sleeper adventure/puzzle game.  The expressive, rough edged art style and oppressive soundtrack fills your journey with a forboding that you'll find consuming.  I'm no slouch when it comes to the horror genre but I found myself stepping away from the game for a short break at one point simply to rest my jangling nerves.\n\nIt begins rather abruptly with little sense of direction but, after the title card, once you've familiarized yourself with the navigation and have begun relating the entries in the in-game encyclopedia to the events around you the game gathers a full head of steam.  Presentation is unique and the control is sometimes unorthodox but becomes intuitive once you determine what the game is asking of you.  This version of the game also includes a map to assist in navigating the compact world and a tiered hint sytem to give you a nudge if you find yourself hopelessly lost without having to resort to FAQs, walkthroughs or spoilers that might lessen the sense of reward when you push yourself through to the next leg of your walk.\n\nAt first, with the main story arc itself taking only about 45 minutes to an hour to complete, the small asking price might still give one pause.  But I assure you that there's more than meets the eye and I've spent a solid two hours with the game at this point and just now feel like I've cracked it.  However, I did notice that I'd not earned a single Steam achievement, and several look to be entertaining enough to extend the game further.\n\nFor horror/suspense fans looking for a mood created with more than simply liberal brushstrokes of gore, Year Walk has it in spades.  Minimal jump scares and beautifully creepy art and audio are the weapons of choice here.  This is a game that screams for you to play it alone in a dark room.\n\nFor amateur slueths who enjoy a good mystery, the game will reward those both receptive and patient.  These are the folks that will squeeze the most bang for their buck out of Year Walk.\n\nTraditional adventure gamers might be put off by the lack of structured storytelling, extensive inventory puzzles and feature length run time.  However, the quality and originality of what is offered in Year Walk more than makes up for any perceived shortcomings.\n\nMy recommendation:  Buy it to reward invention and originality.  Play it to drown in the atmosphere.","March 7, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While clocking in at just under 1 hour, the experience is short, but doesn't detract from it's effect on you. The jittery cinematic flickers you would see on old films, combined with the old-style folk music and almost 'devoid-of-life-and-cutout' art syle immediately draws you into it's cleverly designed 2D, that's also loosely 3D world. This is only further enhanced by the muffled crunch of snow as you explore every inch and the under-your-skin noises that the otherworldy creatures make.\n\nThe gameplay is satisfying enough, with some rather neat puzzles encouraging you to wander the woodland. The scares, while few, are best described as 'cherry-picked' only cropping up where appropriate, allowing the world itself to slowly build a sense of dread.\n\nThe story behind Year Walk is an interesting one, with the otherworldly creatures both fascinating and nightmare-inducing in equal measure. In fact, it's encouraged me to look online to learn more about what inspired this.\n\nThe only cons I can think of with regards to this game, is that I wish it were a little bit longer with a few more puzzles to justify the full price. While it is certainly a game worth experiencing that I would recommend in anyones collection who enjoys horror or fascinating lore, the run time comes a tad too short to warrant a full price.

No, year walking is not a a real thing, but as we learned to write down our tales all to late it’s all quite blurry anyway.\n\nA few of the puzzles are infuriatingly hard and the overall game map is small enough to get away with the disorienting way of movement along it.\n\nI never missed the lack of narrative while playing, but the excellent writing in the ending showed a glimpse of what the game could have been with a bigger budget. It’s a couple of hours long, short on story but great on ambience.\n\nProbably only recommended for hardcore adventure fans and those interested in the peculiarly dark tales of Swedish folklore.","January 6","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would call this a visual story (not to be confused with a visual novel) and while most games are obviously 'visual stories', I'll try to give a reason as to why I call it that. I'll start with the gameplay as that will help me get my point across.\n\nYour character (never given a name) is put into this beautiful snowy landscape. The only movements you can make are to walk left and right, or forwards and backwards on paths. You have a cursor so you can click on objects here and there, but there aren't a ton of things to interact with. Hence, why I say this is more of a visual story. While you do have control, I feel more like you're just watching through their eyes.\n\nOnto the gameplay/setting. The term "Year Walk" (Årsgång) refers to a Swedish ritual that was believed to be done by people from the medieval times to the 19th century. The Year Walk was done on either Christmas Eve, or New Years. The idea is that you lock yourself in your house, void of light, no eating, drinking, or interacting with others. After which of 24 hours, the year walker is tasked with heading to their church in order to have a vision of the coming years future. There, they will have to pass the tests of supernatural creatures in order to be granted that vision.\n\nThe premise alone is very intriguing, and I knew nothing of it while diving into this game. Let me say this, I played through Year Walk in one sitting. Now, it only took me about 2.5 hours, but that time alone was very gripping and I couldn't wait to progress further along. The atmoshpere of the game is mind blowing. Play this with headphones on and in a dark room for full immersion. The game is also genuinely terrifying through it's use of the lore. Added that the soundtrack beautiful and the art is amazingly well put together, you've crafted a very serene yet eerie world that can totally draw you in and make you lose sight of things.\n\nWhile I would love to tell you much more about this game, I really need to leave it up to you to discover what it holds. It's not terribly hard, puzzle wise, but there are some here and there. Also, in game, if you'd like to read up more, they provide an encyclopedia that provides some descriptions of what you'll encounter. I've also heard you need to play it more than once to really get the full picture. So, I hope you will play this as I highly recommend it. It's something that will stay with you long after it's over.\n\nP.S. Don't worry about the box. Yet.","February 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Weird thing is that you will play the entire game strafing from left to right and then only moving up or down to different areas through authorized corridors. This makes the whole movement scheme feels rather clunky and not very immersive. This game could also severely be improved by accessing the map through TAB since you already navigate with WASD. Unfortunately this keybind was absent. I had to beat the game in one go since I could not see any way to save my game. I had about 3 hours of gameplay but I did rather poorly. There is a lot of running around in circles in this game, and you should definitely play with headphones on as this game relies a lot on its music score and on musical clues as part of its immersion strategy as well as an additional way to provide clues in solving puzzles. The toolbar icon can be hidden and the already rather nice graphical direction is improved with occasional use of old film grain styled black spots which is kind of neat. The story revolves around a re-rendition of old scandinavian myths, since basically no one knows anything about Scandinavian myths anymore, they included a miniature in-game encyclopedia to help give you context. There is nearly no dialogue per say in this game but most of the time the non verbal language of the creatures you meet are often enough for you to guess what you need to do. Failing that there is an in-game hint system which also comes in very handy. All in all the use of myths, and the setting are very nice, however the clunkyness of the engine, and the guesswork nature of some of the puzzles detract from the experience and I had to consult metagaming sources to avoid frustrating stalls and keep the story moving. I will therefore offer a careful recommendation since by the time i was all done with the game it still left me with the feeling that I had gone through a rather unique and satisfying experience.

In old Swedish culture, one who wanted to know their fortune in the future, be it in love, money, luck or longevity, stuck themselves in a pitch black room for 12 hours on an important calendar day (such as May Day, New Years Eve, Star Wars Day, or Talk Like a Pirate Day, that sort of thing) and emerged at midnight, they went on a walk around their local area, whereupon ghosts and spirits would appear upon their travels, with various meanings and motives. Their final destination would be a local church, where upon they would face their demons and have their fate told.\n\n"Year Walk" explores these travels in regards to a character's love life, and shares snippets of encyclopaedic knowledge of the Year Walk ritual. Have a maze of scenes that have the construct and aesthetic of illustrated lateral dioramas made of flattened layers. You move between, as you stumble around looking for spirits who will progress your journey.\nYear Walk is roughly only an hour long, though the puzzles are a little tricky, there are very few of them, and the map is not overly large. However, the game warrants two play-throughs to experience the whole story.\n\nIt's a curiosity of a game. Its creepy and unnerving. Informative and narratively interesting. It’s hard not to recommend for its unique approach alone. My only bug bear is that the asking price (about £5) is probably more than I would normally expect to pay for a game of this length, but then again I'm a stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who got this game in a bundle...\n","April 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In old Swedish culture, one who wanted to know their fortune in the future, be it in love, money, luck or longevity, stuck themselves in a pitch black room for 12 hours on an important calendar day (such as May Day, New Years Eve, Star Wars Day, or Talk Like a Pirate Day, that sort of thing) and emerged at midnight, they went on a walk around their local area, whereupon ghosts and spirits would appear upon their travels, with various meanings and motives. Their final destination would be a local church, where upon they would face their demons and have their fate told.\n\n"Year Walk" explores these travels in regards to a character's love life, and shares snippets of encyclopaedic knowledge of the Year Walk ritual. Have a maze of scenes that have the construct and aesthetic of illustrated lateral dioramas made of flattened layers. You move between, as you stumble around looking for spirits who will progress your journey.\nYear Walk is roughly only an hour long, though the puzzles are a little tricky, there are very few of them, and the map is not overly large. However, the game warrants two play-throughs to experience the whole story.\n\nIt's a curiosity of a game. Its creepy and unnerving. Informative and narratively interesting. It’s hard not to recommend for its unique approach alone. My only bug bear is that the asking price (about £5) is probably more than I would normally expect to pay for a game of this length, but then again I'm a stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who got this game in a bundle...\n","April 14, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/269050/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Year Walk is a game that first came out on iOS, but it caught my attention very early on. Above all else, you have to know what you're getting into, to properly enjoy it. This is not a game, in the traditional sense, but it certainly requires player input! Even more than many games, somehow.\nIt's a very unique experience, certainly worth trying! Plus, you might learn a bit more about swedish folklore.\n\nContext\nI find it very similar to Fez, in a way. Year Walk is a riddle in and of itself. Its challenges rely on concepts more than anything the game directly teaches you, but all the clues are present for you to succeed. Also, it was clearly designed for multiple playthroughs (at least 2.5 - 3), and it was brilliantly made, with that in mind.\n\nI'm a sucker for mythology and folklore in general, so I had been interested in this game for a while. If you're trying it just "because", you might be lost for a while, and find it frustrating.\n\nGoing back to the Fez point: Fez was much harder and more cryptic, because its clues were very spread apart. There were lots of different areas, and it also relied on many skills completely unrelated to the game.\nYear Walk is not like that. While the game is mostly a riddle, you can get everything you need inside the game. I'd advise either taking notes, or screenshots and being very aware of your in-game surroundings, otherwise you'll probably be walking in circles.\n\n\nPresentation\nThe game is certainly fairly minimalist in its design, but I think it knew exactly what it needed to be. The visuals are digital, but made to simulate paper cut-outs, which goes hand in hand with old folklore. Its use of color is also noteworthy, and while very subtle, it very much contributes to the overall atmosphere.\n\nInterface issues\nThe interface looks, perhaps, a bit too modern, but it's not too bad. The port is mostly okay, although there's a bit of disconnection to the pc, clearly. While there aren't big, intrusive buttons, they haven't really mapped any hot-keys that would have been really useful (using M for map, or E for encyclopedia, for example), and you have to click everything. Then, in a puzzle, they have you use "u" and "n"! It was the hardest puzzle for me, haha! It clearly said "u" and "n" on the screen, but it felt so out of place that it took me a while to try it. Oh well.\n\nThe sound-effects are a bit space-y, which feels a bit weird, but it sort of fits. They're well done, but I would have liked something more traditional.\n\nThe music, thought, is definitely one of the aspects where it shines! (Of course, this is biased.)\nIt's mostly quiet and atmospheric, but it gives you an eerie feeling at times, through two main aspects: slight dissonance, and using what seems to be aged instruments, that don't sound quite right. These two aspects have been in my mind for a while, on how to make creepy music... So there you go. Of course, I found it great! But honestly, I think it works, and gives it a very natural feeling. Good job!\nThere's a problem, though:\n\nNo sound on the menus\nWhenever you open the map, or the encyclopedia, the music stops. That... is a problem, and a big one, in my opinion.\nIn a game that relies so much on atmosphere, a continuous flow of sound is critical. If you need to open the map (which should often happen, especially during your first playthrough -- a the one that relies the most on atmosphere!), the music stops, and it completely breaks immersion. I seem to mention this in a lot of games, recently, but it's really important!\nHaving the music cut-out when you have to do something as simple as opening a map... that's bad. Furthermore, it makes those menus seem completely out of the experience that the game was going for.\nI'd like to see this changed, at least in future games, but hey... it's not game-breaking, I guess.\n\n\nGame Mechanics\nTo start off, this is an adventure game. Instead of being a point n' click, however, you can walk in 2D, in several lanes set in 3D. You can go back and forth to change lane, at specific points. It can be a bit confusing, at first, but there's a map, and while your first playthrough feels a bit alien, it all makes sense after that. And it's still very compelling.\n\nPuzzles vs. Riddles\nI'll make this clear right away. A puzzle, in my eyes, is based on mechanics that a game teaches you. Most games work like this.\nA riddle, on the other hand, relies on something beyond the game. These skills are mostly learned outside of the game, and makes what could be "puzzles", mostly unrelated to one another.\n\nThis is why I say Year Walk is more of a riddle.\nThere are clues inside the game, of course, but it never teaches you anything. It never starts easy and gets progressively harder. Not at all. Every riddle is like a self-contained puzzle, reliant on combining the clues, and skills you have acquired outside the game.\n\nSome of the puzzles are based on listening cues, some are based on softcryptography, etc. But I think it's balanced. I managed to go through my first playthrough without getting stuck  at any point, and without using Hints. But again, you need to be in the right mindset to enjoy it!\n\nThese riddles are based on the mythological creatures you'll find in the game. You won't, of course, know what these creatures are, or why they're there. And that's normal. To complement the game, there's an Encyclopedia. This is merely a collection of texts, one about each creature or event you're playing. It's not a direct guide for the game, as it doesn't really help with the solving a puzzle, but it gives context to what you're doing! And may also give you some clues on where the solution may lie.\nI've found it very interesting, but it's still about reading outside the game! It's the same problem that Type:Rider had, the way it never taught you through gameplay, but through wikipedia-esque articles.\n\nYear Walk doesn't function this way! But it has some similar problems. Still, the creatures are stillin the game, but it would have felt much better to have some more integration of the Encyclopedia in the game. Maybe some more clues to the puzzles... I believe the Encyclopedia was a companion app for the iOS game, so that's it doesn't quite feel a part of the game, unfortunately.\n\nSymbolism in the game\nI think this is the best part of the game, by far! Every encounter has some meaning. It will not be apparent at all, the first time. However, the game always gives you slight clues on what to do next. On your second playthrough, it's quite different. I don't want to spoil it, but it's about reading an Historian's "diary" while he was investigating the tradition of Year Walk. It's all reading (and there's a lot of it), and also taking notes to solve the last puzzle in the game. Again, it's completely detached from playing the game, but it's as interesting as it makes you feel like a detective!\n\nThis diary tells the actual story of the, as if it happened a few centuries ago. While you're reading this, everything you encountered in the game starts making sense.\nThis is the first part of the journal.\nThe second is far more conspiracy-like and esoteric, but due to the very believable first part, you start questioning everything that's happened in the game, up to that point! It was one of the most compelling experiences I've recently had in a game!\n\nEvery symbol is explained in the game! Not initially, but it is. And that's the way to do it! You won't leave it feeling like it was just pretentious gibberish. It's genuinely interesting, and the questions extend the game itself!\n\nAlready out of words... Seriously, this is one of the most interesting experiences on Steam, and is one that's based on real folklore, which is always a plus!\n","January 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game looks like its made out of paper, like its a pop-up book, and it really heightens the creepy factor for me.\n\nThe soundtrack is very atmospheric and subtle, and the melodies are haunting. Usually, I get bored by a game's soundtrack halfway through, but I really enjoyed Year Walk's.\n\nThe only disappointing thing would have been the ending. At first i was pleasantly surprised by the originality of th ending, which did something i never actually saw anywhere else, but the very end kind of fell short. Still, i had very high expectations of the ending because of the rest of the game, so i dont think i would have been satisfied with pretty much anything.\n\nIf you're debating whether getting this game or not, get it. Its relatively cheap and you can get a good five hours of gameplay from this indie jewel. There's some replay potential, if you really want to get immersed in the story like i did.\n\nAll around, i would give this game a 8.5 out of 10, for the graphics, the soundtrack, the story and the originality, but i  had to take out some points for the ending that wasnt really as good as the game itself.","September 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn’t saying  so very much. It’s about two hours. You only have to work up a little obsession, a little checking and rechecking, a few scribbled notes, light diagramming. Year Walk is not difficult. It only asks mindset enough to engage with its premise. Yes, engage in minor self-deprivation, fast, avoid festivals, and set out into the night to find the future, if you can only face everything within these woods.\n\nI am not always the greatest player of games like this, due to impatience and a tendency to try to solve even straightforwardish puzzles by overthinking, but the strength of Year Walk is its dark folklore tone, its eerily blocky art, the loneliness of the forest until you’re suddenly not alone. This is 90% atmosphere, but it’s great atmosphere. And you do have to read the encyclopedia, which contains my favorite style of game lore, all mildly oblique supernatural rumor contextualized with cultural rooting.\n\nThe story framing the Year Walk itself relies on some tropes that I won’t spoil, but don’t do much for me. However, it’s also beside the point. The presentation is creepily fantastic, the mood is perfect, and what else are you playing for?","March 25, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While starkly simple, YW capitvates its player with a completley unique sountrack and quite obscure historical and mythical items. I can't possibly explain the story line, but the premise is that you, in your crazy swede mindset, decided to follow the traditional avenue of the "Year Walk"; a ceremony of sorts where the person in question isolates themself for a whole day in a dark house without food, water or exposure to anything whatsoever, then ventures into the remote woods at nightfall to encounter beasts, magic and possibly see the future.\n\nBefore you ask, yes, this was a real thing that people did. I'm proud to be swedish, but good grief are my people wierd.\n\nAnyway, I would recommend this for PC, not for a phone though - I can forsee some dificulties trying to navigate if you would have to use your fingers instead of a mouse.

If you have a massive boner for any sort of mythology, and want to spend 20 minutes reading the game's codex, then a walkthough for the game, its not half bad. The real sticker is the price; there are much better things to be had both real and virtual for $5.\n\n","April 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a first person adventure horror game based around the little known Swedish folklore of the "year walk", a ritual where individuals go without food and drink all day and then wander the woods at midnight, hoping to gain visions of the future but also potentially encountering dangerous supernatural beings. As such, the setting and story are fantastic and really draw you into the game. The great soundtrack, creepy sound effects, and unique visual style that looks like a mix between a pop-up book and a silent film help to enhance the setting even further and make this game a very emotional experience. While playing Year Walk, I truly felt the sensation of being all alone in a dark forest. In this way, the game was simultaneously comforting and terrifying in a way that I can't quite explain. Another enjoyable aspect of the game is that it essentially drops you into an open world and leaves you to explore and solve puzzles on your own, much like Myst or The Witness.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Year Walk. It's an experience not easily forgotten and best played on a dark snowy evening with a good set of headphones.","March 31","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game did have a few jump scares, although for the most part I did not find the game to have a scary atmosphere, until after playing the game the second time through to get the final ending. I liked the story and found my self interested in it, more so in the second walk. I do think the mechanics weren't very good. The puzzle with the  box was clever and inventive. But the rest of the puzzles sucked. They were usually super ambiguous, and many people needed to use walkthroughs and help such as myself because you were supposed to write down all these different symbols in random places, and if you missed one you couldn't solve it. You didn't know when to use what, and one even made you use a keyboard to solve which hadnt been implemented before the entire game. Also I didn't like navigating, as it felt kind of sloppy with all of the linear paths you had to find. The game had no direction either, and you never knew which one of the 15 spots to go to next. If I hadn't used a walkthrough I would have wandered around a lot, as the game wants you to, but I find that dumb and artificially inflating the game. Some people love how "existential" the game is and how smart that makes them feel, but I just thought there could have been more direction. Overall it was poor gameplay, with an interesting twist with the second playthrough, and a story that picks up. Better, more interesting gameplay with direction and puzzles that make sense, and this game would have been a recommend. 5.5/10.","May 21, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

There's an encyclopedia in-game that you can reference as well (And adds a bit of structure to your journey), and the lore it contains is a bizarre guide to the mythology of "year walking."\n\nNow, the trap that most point-and-click games fall into is breaking their own logic for the sake of difficult puzzles. This results in bizarre, non-intuitive puzzles that takes, at best, some serious imagination to find solutions to, and at worst, brute-forcing. Year Walk does not do this. It stays very grounded in the world it builds, and everything can be deduced through environmental exploration and logical deduction, giving the player satisfaction with each puzzle solved.\n\nNow, it is a short game, but it's far more memorable than most games I've played.

It's exceedingly rare to find an unsettling game that really captures the feeling of slowly discovering the horror for yourself. The encyclopedia providing a background on the creatures you'll meet, the runes and symbols which slowly develop meaning and the puzzles themselves which frequently extend beyond the 4th wall make the game deeply uncomfortable and frightening.\n\nThe actual scare beats are limited but very well timed. I played the game initially on the iOS release and found myself still jumping - and at one point quitting the game to take a walk - at some of the better moments.\n\nThe art and sound design are both great, wandering the woods feels appropriately lonely and tense. The adaptations to the iOS controls for PC are fine and even feature some adjustments to some of the puzzles.\n\nHighly, highly recommended. It's not a long game, probably only 90 minutes to 2 hours but the price is right and it's an experience that has stuck with me since I first played it on my phone last year. It's smart, creative horror and it might teach you a thing or two about Scandanavian folklore.","March 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In many ways, Year Walk is like an adventure game with some truly unique puzzle designs put in to help lengthen the adventure. On more than one occassion did I get jumps at the horrors Year Walk threw at me, making me feel tense and disturbed while never wanting to stop. The only downside is that the puzzles can be so frustrating at times that it could lead to others quitting early on, but if you do know the puzzles, Year Walk suddenly becomes a 20 minute game rather than 2 hour game.

Using either the companion application for an iOS device or the built in one on the PC makes the game a much fuller experience. It helps make the bridge between the player and the lore behind the symbols easier to cross, and you get that feeling of "OHHHHHHHH, NOW I get it!".

I finished the game - no I did not restart, which is apparently where most people say the 'real game begins'. I just don't have the motivation to continue after all the weird puzzles and really abstract messages.\n\nFor those unaware - this is essentially a  point-and-click adventure with dark, abstract overtones. You meddle around the woods and solve riddles/puzzles. If you are thinking about purchasing this, I would consider getting it on your mobile device instead because it would be easier to play laying in bed or really wherever you want since there is no advantage of having it on your computer.\n\nPros:\n+Wonderful artwork and ambience\n+It certainly gets points for being unique\n\nCons:\n-Puzzles are way too abstract in how you solve them - I think I even looked some of them up in the later game. But, ya know its funny, because I picked up Device 6 on my iPhone which I believe is made by the same team, and the puzzles were equally silly in their solutions (I quit playing it), so maybe their games are appreciated by a select audience that I am not apart of\n-I kept waiting for some enlightning moment of having some concrete understanding of the storyline, even right up until the credits, but nope - I still pretty much have no idea of what was going on\n-Overall, I found this game to be more frustrating than it was worth, it was a struggle to just finish it\n\nI wouldn't even recommend this on a sale.","August 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

So much so that I am unsure whether I consider it to be a traditional adventure game, a walking sim, or its own tiny subgenre. If it is a walking sim, it is one of the best I've played.\nThe plot is simple, or at least straightforward. You want to see the future, so you perform an ancient Swedish folklore ritual that lets you see the future, called the Year Walk. During this time you will walk around the forest surrounding your cabin, helping the various spirits that live there. Once you have helped them all, they let you see the Church Grimm, who shows you the future. The climax of the game is abstract, maybe unfittingly so, but at the end it shows you that your friend will get injured and might also die. Incidentally, this friend is the one that told you not to perform the Year Walk. I suppose that we are supposed to learn a lesson about not messing with powers beyond your understanding, but I had so much fun that I would be tempted to year walk anyway.\nThe most immediately apparent aspect of Year Walk is its art direction, particularly its color palette. This game contains many horror elements, and it can easily be classified as a horror game. Despite that, the color palette is quite bright, with a strong emphasis on cyan and white. It's also very desaturated, creating an atmosphere that is usually serene and peaceful, but can instantly change to be scary and desolate. The characters have similarly stylized designs. They are awe-inspiring and spooky, but also approachable, even cute (except the Huldra). The Brook Horse and Church Grimm are the standout designs, and I think the designer knew this, as the Church Grimm's icons are used frequently throughout the game. In fact, the game is icon-heavy in general, with each creature having a distinct symbol, almost like a hieroglyph.\nI only have three complaints, so I will just list them. First, the navigation of Year Walk is unusual; it's from a first person perspective, but movement is restricted to 2d planes. The player scuttles from side to side like a crab, and can only walk forward and backward onto new planes in certain spaces. This is fine, even fun, but on certain screens I could get a headache if I walked too fast from side to side. I don't consider this to be the game's fault necessarily, but if a game causes me physical distress I want to note it. My other two complaints have to do with two specific puzzles. Most of the puzzles are actually very good, and the hint system is one of the best I've ever seen, but there are only two notable exceptions. The first puzzle is when the player is trying to open a furnace. The furnace door is locked, and the only way to open it is to press the corresponding keys on the keyboard to what is engraved on the locks. This might sound obvious in retrospect, but since those keys are not used before or since, it bothers me that the solution is so strange. The last problem I had was with the Huldra's maze: it is a puzzle where the player is expected to listen to aural queues, and the background music of the section is about as loud as the queues.\nI don't really have much more to say about Year Walk. The art design is great, the mechanics are finally crafted, and the story is unique and educational. Even the achievements are meaningful. Anyone who is a fan of atmospheric horror, mythology, or adventure games in general should absolutely check it out.","May 27","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is also well-written and fascinating. The only major gripe I have is the translation of the controls from touch screens to mouse and keyboard. Some actions are not very intuitive using the mouse and keyboard setup. Dragging, spinning, pulling objects feels strange and doesn't work like you would expect them to. It would be very intuitive on a touch screen though and that's where the game was orginally released. If you can get over the control hurdles, Year Walk is a very strange and dark adventure.","February 18, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A story that you cannot alter no matter what you do. You only move around on the map, do a few puzzles, and the story progresses. The sad thing about the puzzles are that it is impossible to solve them without looking at the hints and still it's extremely difficult. Chances are you'll be utilizing an online walkthrough to guide you through a story that you have no control over. It also has ZERO replayability as it's only appeal is the unfolding of the story.

I like fairy tales, folklore, fables and ghost stories. I thought I would really like this game based on the video and description. In truth, I love the art style and music of this game. The map is cool and not hard to figure out.\n\nFor starters, it's kind of annoying not knowing what to do without using the clues. I play a lot of puzzle games, but I very rarely use hints or clues. I had to use them every time with this game. I would have liked this game despite this aspect though.\n\nI feel like this game was misrepresented in the description and video/screenshots. The first 5 minutes were okay. I just wandered around, figured out the map, viewed the encyclopedia. Most people have said that there are just a few times that things jump out at you or are horrifying. So far almost everything after that first 5 minutes happening in the game is VERY scary/horror to me... not just eerie/creepy. It isn't just a few times. All I've seen/heard are  screaming, scary images, bloody scenery, and dead babies.  There should be more emphasis on the horror aspect in the video and description.\n\nUnfortunatly, I just can't finish this game. It's too scary, graphic, and bloody. As a warning, don't play this game if you are  pregnant or planning to have kids any time soon.","January 31, 2015","false","1.0"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

There are a lot of strange creatures to interact with and the puzzle design is pretty great, but the game is over very quickly and can be played start-to-finish in some 10-15 minutes if you know what to do.\n\nAnd there's also a second ending you can get after beating the game the first time, which is what really makes this worth playing, in my opinion, but...

This is now one my favorite horror point&click puzzle games.  SO, basically you are doing a Year Walk which is a spiritual journey to discover the future, either bad or good.  It shows both 3d and 2d graphics and blends them together perfectly IMO. If you are like me and get into the storyline and the mood the creators try to portray, well you are in for a treat.  I was at the edge of my seat the entire time I played.  Its horror is really cool but not the typical horror of todays hollywood movies, but that just straight up creepy horror that sends chills down your spine.  If you are looking for a game that is fun and tests you, well here it is. You can use hints that they let you click but really, only use if you are extremely stuck and have no idea what to do next.  At the end of the game it never says "THE END" but there is an end. So pay attention, cause unlike most games that you just get up an walk away during the credits...THIS YOU WANT TO STAY! it gives you vital info that you will need for your next playthrough and to access parts of the game that can not be accesses without that info. SO ENJOY YOUR YEAR WALK...it just might be your last..MWUAHAHAH XD","August 27, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The strange format works pretty well, the games movements are a bit resrictive though, but this allows the game makers to put in some really great ideas. The story is easy to follow and though there is an air of mystery, like many great horror titles should have, most things are explained in the end but not all of them. This leaves you with even more questions than you began with. Overall this is a wonderful game, highly recommended.

If that shows any indication as to whether or not you should pick it up if you're easily frightened, the answer is yes.\nIt's a bit on the short side of things, but that works just fine as you need multiple playthroughs in order to reach the true ending.\nThe story is much deeper than it originally presents itself to be, and I was left speechless at several points.\n\nYear Walk took my expectations and delivered higher than I even anticipated.\nI'm in a difficult time in my life right now, and can put myself inside of the protagonist's shoes perfectly. Just reverse the sexes and there you go.\nThis game gives you a lot to contemplate about your own life and what exactly you are willing to give up for a glimpse of what is to come.\nI no longer yearn to see the future, as enticing as the notion seems to be.\nAt what point do we play into fate's hands or carve our own path?\nThat decision is yours, just like the decision to play this game.\nI can't help you figure out the prior, but the latter is definitely pointing towards trying it out for yourself.","July 23, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why not. While it has its issues, I found Year Walk worth its price tag and an interesting game.\n\nMovement\nWalking side to side and moving forward and backwards through panes, the movement system is interesting at first and compliments the art style well, but eventually it becomes slightly tedious.\n\nPuzzles\nOverall, the puzzles were enjoyable, the majority being based off memory, fetching, and reference. While the puzzles themselves are fairly easy, the most difficult part is realizing what gives you the answer. An example of this being one puzzle where you need to look at the pattern that one object moves in to know which order to click two other objects, meanwhile these objects appear totally unrelated and are halfway across the map from one another. Some may appreciate the adventuring it takes to find this out, others may just become frusrated.\n\nStory\nI found the story to be of little importance besides setting up a beginning and end for the game. During the meat of the gameplay I gave the story very little thought. With that being said, I did enjoy the little amount of story that did occur, I only wish there was more of it.\n\nDat Spookiness\nWhile mostly just eerie, there are one or two jump scare moments that catch you off-guard. I enjoyed the music, it is definitely used well in the game and adds to the tension, even if that tension never really comes to a boil but simply simmers on the back burner.\n\nInterface\nConstant checking of the map, while not excruciating, does become a slight burden. The inclusion of a journal, which I did not use, could make for more a immersive experience if someone were to. A Hints section is well done, offering at first very general advice as to how to go forward, however if you continue with the hints they do become fairly direct as to what to do.\n\nConclusion\nI found Year Walk to be a unique experience. While not without its flaws, the great art, folklore aspects, and acceptable puzzles make it a game I can recommend to most.\n","June 29, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention it's absolutely breathtaking to look at.\nWould I describe it as a horror game? Short answer: Yes. Long answer? Well, it isn't exactly a traditional 'horror' game. The atmosphere is perfect but not exactly what I would call....scary? Its a little unnerving at times, and it does have about 2 jumpscares (but like most jumpscares if you play the game more than once you won't find them spooky again)\nThe games story is (relatively) easy to follow, but the puzzles are brilliantly challenging. More often than not you should expect to find yourself checking the hints.\nBetween the beautiful graphics, simple and nice story, and secret true ending I'm sure it's worth the money to get even at it's full price of 6 dollars. I whole heartedly reccommend this game to anyone.

This horror component adds to the overall atmosphere of the game, the main purpose focus being a series of puzzles that you must unlock with your keen senses.\n\nThe early stages of the game are frustratingly vague however, the first few moments are spent wandering around uselessly until you realise there is both a map and a hint section. Once you get the hang of it however, Year Walk sucks you in, driving you deeper and deeper into delirium.\n\nWhile a little short, there is an option to play again and unlock the secrets that bested you the first (or second) time around.\n\nFor me it crashed out a few times in the early stages, refusing to load the first time so I was allowed to stare at an empty screen for five minutes, but I won't hold that against it. Year Walk saves automatically which is a definite plus when playing on temperamental computers.\n\nDefinitely worth the price. 10/10 would walk again.","June 24, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're into those this game is for you.\nThe artistic direction for this game is very well put together. The music is perfectly synched with the events in the game, not once did I ever feel that it was out of place, add to taht the imagery which simplistic and less is in fact more and complex. It adds a layer of mystique and intrigue to our wonderful cake.\nSome people maight complain to the fact it is short and in a speed run, which is an achievement, you can finish it in 20 minutes or less, but of course if you've already played the game or read cheats, if not you might end up spending quite some time in it, especially if you're like me and play without the map or hints.\nThis game is worth it's money, it might seem short, but it does not feel short and seeing the price for it I say this is not a major inconvenience. All in all this game deserves more attention and praise for that you can see the work the people making it had put and the lasting impretion it will give you is indeed one worth playing for.\n\n\nP.S.

Why not. While it has its issues, I found Year Walk worth its price tag and an interesting game.\n\nMovement\nWalking side to side and moving forward and backwards through panes, the movement system is interesting at first and compliments the art style well, but eventually it becomes slightly tedious.\n\nPuzzles\nOverall, the puzzles were enjoyable, the majority being based off memory, fetching, and reference. While the puzzles themselves are fairly easy, the most difficult part is realizing what gives you the answer. An example of this being one puzzle where you need to look at the pattern that one object moves in to know which order to click two other objects, meanwhile these objects appear totally unrelated and are halfway across the map from one another. Some may appreciate the adventuring it takes to find this out, others may just become frusrated.\n\nStory\nI found the story to be of little importance besides setting up a beginning and end for the game. During the meat of the gameplay I gave the story very little thought. With that being said, I did enjoy the little amount of story that did occur, I only wish there was more of it.\n\nDat Spookiness\nWhile mostly just eerie, there are one or two jump scare moments that catch you off-guard. I enjoyed the music, it is definitely used well in the game and adds to the tension, even if that tension never really comes to a boil but simply simmers on the back burner.\n\nInterface\nConstant checking of the map, while not excruciating, does become a slight burden. The inclusion of a journal, which I did not use, could make for more a immersive experience if someone were to. A Hints section is well done, offering at first very general advice as to how to go forward, however if you continue with the hints they do become fairly direct as to what to do.\n\nConclusion\nI found Year Walk to be a unique experience. While not without its flaws, the great art, folklore aspects, and acceptable puzzles make it a game I can recommend to most.\n","June 29, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The musics are just wonderful, each brings up the right emotion to the listener in the right moment.

If you're into those this game is for you.\nThe artistic direction for this game is very well put together. The music is perfectly synched with the events in the game, not once did I ever feel that it was out of place, add to taht the imagery which simplistic and less is in fact more and complex. It adds a layer of mystique and intrigue to our wonderful cake.\nSome people maight complain to the fact it is short and in a speed run, which is an achievement, you can finish it in 20 minutes or less, but of course if you've already played the game or read cheats, if not you might end up spending quite some time in it, especially if you're like me and play without the map or hints.\nThis game is worth it's money, it might seem short, but it does not feel short and seeing the price for it I say this is not a major inconvenience. All in all this game deserves more attention and praise for that you can see the work the people making it had put and the lasting impretion it will give you is indeed one worth playing for.\n\n\nP.S.

This game is something.  It will not be for everyone.  The game is not huge, but I know there are a couple different endings.  The gameplay itself focuses on exploring the forest and solving puzzles from a first person perspective, but you do not walk around like a normal first person game.  You kind of slide from side to side and move forward and backward to different areas.  This is a little confusing at first but you can get used to it in ten or fifteen minutes easily.  This game is mostly focused on solving puzzles, as mentioned above.  Actually this is one of the only games to really give me the same vibe that Myst gave me all those years ago… I am not sure what it is about it.  Some of the puzzles are pretty abstract, but a lot of them have hints in the game world if you look.  But this game has a great serene atmosphere that becomes more creepy and unsettling over time.  A very melancholy but thought provoking experience, if not a short one (I beat it in two hours, but there is a speed run achievement for something like 20 minutes).","November 12, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the story is very unique, I can't think of another game that's quite similar to this. The game maybe short but it's a quick and creepy experience for anyone looking to play a fun game at midnight.","June 25, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of folklore/history, engrossing atmospheres, or bite-sized games well worth their money, buy Year Walk now!\n\nThe game has you adventuring through a solemn forest on New Year's Eve to attempt an archaic Swedish ritual known as year walking, which allows a person to see into the future of the next year. Year Walk astounded me by how much care it gave to the Swedish folklore. An in-game Encyclopedia allows you to read the details about each creature you'll encounter in the forest. The games developer, Simogo, does a brilliant job of translating these stories into memorable gameplay and artwork. The soundtrack is equally chilling yet captivating, and provides the perfect backdrop to many of the game's distinct moments.\n\nI only have two, measly warnings about Year Walk. First, of all, it’s very short. My first playthrough on iOS took less than 3 hours; this is the longest it should take anyone. I still found the experience incredibly satisfying, enough so that I bought the version here on Steam as well. Secondly, I enjoyed how the Encyclopedia and Journal were in a separate app on the iOS version (I won't say why for spoilers), so I wish the Steam version forced players to view them in a similar form as well.\n\nOverall, Year Walk is worthy game for any horror or puzzle fan, and one of my favorite games from 2013. I recommend playing it without using the map, hints, or walkthroughs - besides you'll get a couple achievements that way :)","June 30, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It may be short but you will have goose bumps the entire time. Creepy, sad, but ultimately beautiful storytelling, this is a game you should play with no distractions (lights off if you can handle it!). The art, the music, and that sound of thick snow crunching under your feet suck you into the forest so that when a scare comes you really feel it. And there is some really creepy stuff in that forest!\n\nAs for gameplay the puzzles are not too hard but a pen and paper is necessary later on. Completing one opens up another somewhere else a when you first stumble across the beginings of one the eerie sense of the unknown is one of the essential feelings that you take from the game. Feeling your way through the forest negotiating mystic apparitions without really knowing your final destination (you know it's the church but you get what I mean) all lends to the games unique experience. First time discovery of the forest is where most of the games charm lies so of course replay value is reduced but this is a game that you will remember! (In actual fact I was mid way through my second playtrough when I made the biggest discovery!)\n\nThis is one of those really cool games that lives up to its style. You'll have images from this game in your head forever and the story wont fade fast from your mind either. Short but well worth the price for the experience in my opinion.","April 19, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let’s dig in.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nYear Walk is an indie adventure game from Simogo. The game begins with a young man (the player) visiting his lover. She hints that she has received a proposal from another suitor which she intends to accept. The player then informs her that he plans to go year walking (a vision journey rumored to give the walker a glimpse into the future), which causes the girl to warn the player against the dangers of the activity; stating that her cousin died doing that very thing. The player returns home and wakes at midnight to begin their year walk. Throughout the night, the player encounters several supernatural entities and puzzles that must be solved in order to complete the year walk.\n\nI’m stopping the story retelling there because I absolutely refuse to spoil it. It is. hands down, incredible.\n\nII – UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface was extremely minimal, which did wonders for the immersion in Year Walk. You have a small, circular reticle which is present on the screen for the majority of the game, but, beyond that, there’s not much. Your HUD consists of directional arrows that fade in and out on the bottom and top of the screen when you can move in that direction. An unobtrusive, collapsible bar in the top right corner of the screen holds everything else you’ll need to get through the game.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nYear Walk was very much like an interactive storybook. It played like an intricate pop-up book and was incredibly unique. Actual gameplay in Year Walk is as simple as can be. Manipulating the W, A, S, and D keys (or the arrow keys, alternatively) allows you to navigate around the game world. Any interactions are performed via the reticle. Any control scheme that was more complex probably would have ruined the whole feel of the game. It all worked perfectly.\n\nIn addition to this, you’re predominantly left to figure things out all on your own. There are hints that can be accessed for each chapter of the story, but if you use your head, you can puzzle everything out for yourself in a few minutes.\n\nAlso, be prepared to do a fair bit of reading. You’ll see what I mean when you play the game.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nYear Walk I initially thought would be hard to pin a score down for it’s level of content. However, after some careful consideration, I’ve decided that it had the perfect amount of content for it’s story. In fact, it had a lot more than I originally anticipated.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nBy now, you all should know that I’m a complete sucker for morbidity and hand-drawn art. Year Walk was absolutely no exception to this rule. The artwork was gorgeous. Everything was very dark and somber. If you’re exploring the world and you don’t find yourself pausing to admire the landscape and the landmarks every once in a while, you’re playing it the completely wrong way.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe soundtrack of Year Walk routinely sent shivers down my spine. The song at the end credits is chilling, especially in the context of the ending of the game. Or should I say, one of the endings. The sounds of Year Walk were sheer brilliance too. You’re guaranteed to feel creeped out at least once during a playthrough, but probably more than once. Aurally, Year Walk is a beautiful smorgasbord of music and sound.\n\nVII – Overall [10/10]\n\nOverall, Year Walk is a fantastic game.","February 17, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention it's absolutely breathtaking to look at.\nWould I describe it as a horror game? Short answer: Yes. Long answer? Well, it isn't exactly a traditional 'horror' game. The atmosphere is perfect but not exactly what I would call....scary? Its a little unnerving at times, and it does have about 2 jumpscares (but like most jumpscares if you play the game more than once you won't find them spooky again)\nThe games story is (relatively) easy to follow, but the puzzles are brilliantly challenging. More often than not you should expect to find yourself checking the hints.\nBetween the beautiful graphics, simple and nice story, and secret true ending I'm sure it's worth the money to get even at it's full price of 6 dollars.

The art is superb.  The music and sound design is flawless.  The puzzles are a joy to piece together.  The ambience gets progressively more chilling as the game goes on.  There are secrets that you must discover after your first playthrough, and I say MUST because you would be doing yourself a great disservice by failing to follow through and finding the  "real" ending that can only be found using clues given to you after you "beat" the game the first time.  There is actually a reason for more than one playthrough explained in the meta-narrative you'll discover if you do.\n\nDo yourself a favor and play this game and find all of the secrets embedded within.  The secrets aren't extras, but vital for you to get the full impact of this very unique story.  Beat the game, open the journal, and then use the clues there to finish the game.  Don't cheat and look stuff up, you will cheat yourself out of one of the most unique narrative structure and reveals of any game I've ever played.\n\nWonderful job by the developer. Absolutely fantastic.\n\n(p.s. -- I would also reccomend reading the in-game encylopedia as you start the game the first time.

The story builds up slowly as you play,  explore and walk through a silent, odd winter landscape, leading you  to a most unexpected creepy discovery in the very end.  It ain't look great on first sight but you might change your mind when reaching and finding out the "true" story end of this Year Walk.\n\nI've always been fascinated by Northern cultures and their dark and strange fairytales so I was very happy to finally get a chance to dive into this hunting, confusing part of an old Swedish folklore custom.

It has a unique visual style, and there are no glaring flaws in the game.  However, after hearing it praised by so many reviewers, I was very disappointed when I finally got around to playing it.\n\nIt isn't exactly a bad game, but it's nowhere near as impressive as its current "94% positive" rating might lead you to believe.  I'd give the game 7/10 at best.  Aside from the art and atmoshperic soundtrack, the game is rather bland.  It's just point and click with puzzles.  Not exactly a rare treat.\n\nI think I would have enjoyed it more if there had been more story and character development.  Year Walk provides the bare minimum in these areas.  Since I knew so little about the character I was playing, I simply wasn't invested enopugh to be scared - or emotionally affected in way at all, really.  For me, Year Walk was just a series of spooky pictures.

Plötsliga och onödiga skrämselmoment förstörde upplevelsen av den annars lugna och mystiska miljön. Tack och lov förstod jag snabbt att det är bra att ha papper och penna till hands, annars hade jag garanterat sett fler genomgångar än de få jag faktiskt såg.\nDet finns riktlinjer för vad man ska leta efter, men de kan vid tillfälle vara subtila (vilket nödvändigtvis inte är en negativ sak).\n\nTrots det negativa med spelet så rekommenderar jag att det spelas, två gånger. Varför det ska spelas två gånger förstår ni när ni spelat igenom första gången.\nStoryn är mycket intressant och utförandet konstnärligt, man utbildas i svensk historia samtidigt som man spelar, och jag gillar både att spela och att utbildas.\n\n\nThis game made me experience a part of Swedish history in which I was not aware and made me curios to find out more about the subject.\nThe creators could have thought more about the workmanship though.\nThe way you navigate is a bit irritating and you almost never knew where to go so you had to go through bit by bit of the map about every time you were to go somewhere. Sudden and unnecessary ways to try and frighten spoiled the experience of the otherwise calm and mysterious surroundings.\nThankfully I early realized that a pen and paper may come in handy, otherwise I guaranteed would have needed to see more walk-throughs than the few I did watch.\nThere are guidelines to what to look for, but they can be very subtle (which necessarily is not a bad thing).\n\nThough the negative parts of this game I do recommend it to be played, twice. Why it should be played twice you'll know after played it through the first time.\nThe story is very interesting and the design artistic, and you get educated at Swedish history while playing.","June 27, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story line is simplistic but the use of Swedish's cultural folklore is absolutely marvelous.  Exquisite art, and an alluring soundtrack to match.

I'm glad I bought it, and I'd suggest it to anyone interested in old world mythology. However, the plot was fairly uninvolved and I ended up finishing the entire game in an hour and a half by accident. I'm still impressed with the game, but I wish it was longer by half and the plot was either more or less in depth. As it is, you get some vague weirdness about what I guess is a secret affair at the beginning, which tries to explain your character's motives for going on a year walk and ends up just kinda falling flat. Honestly, I'd still recommend it though, if only for how truly unique it is.","December 27, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So please, Year Walk a second time and you'll appreciate this game a lot more.\n\nThe plot is fairly straightforward when you play it the first time, then when you re-play it (if you want) it will get rather confusing especially  when you opt to open the journal and get the knife with the initials of D.S  .\n\nThe graphic is minimalistic yet beautiful.

Let’s dig in.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nYear Walk is an indie adventure game from Simogo. The game begins with a young man (the player) visiting his lover. She hints that she has received a proposal from another suitor which she intends to accept. The player then informs her that he plans to go year walking (a vision journey rumored to give the walker a glimpse into the future), which causes the girl to warn the player against the dangers of the activity; stating that her cousin died doing that very thing. The player returns home and wakes at midnight to begin their year walk. Throughout the night, the player encounters several supernatural entities and puzzles that must be solved in order to complete the year walk.\n\nI’m stopping the story retelling there because I absolutely refuse to spoil it. It is. hands down, incredible.\n\nII – UI [10/10]\n\nThe user interface was extremely minimal, which did wonders for the immersion in Year Walk. You have a small, circular reticle which is present on the screen for the majority of the game, but, beyond that, there’s not much. Your HUD consists of directional arrows that fade in and out on the bottom and top of the screen when you can move in that direction. An unobtrusive, collapsible bar in the top right corner of the screen holds everything else you’ll need to get through the game.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nYear Walk was very much like an interactive storybook. It played like an intricate pop-up book and was incredibly unique. Actual gameplay in Year Walk is as simple as can be. Manipulating the W, A, S, and D keys (or the arrow keys, alternatively) allows you to navigate around the game world. Any interactions are performed via the reticle. Any control scheme that was more complex probably would have ruined the whole feel of the game. It all worked perfectly.\n\nIn addition to this, you’re predominantly left to figure things out all on your own. There are hints that can be accessed for each chapter of the story, but if you use your head, you can puzzle everything out for yourself in a few minutes.\n\nAlso, be prepared to do a fair bit of reading. You’ll see what I mean when you play the game.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nYear Walk I initially thought would be hard to pin a score down for it’s level of content. However, after some careful consideration, I’ve decided that it had the perfect amount of content for it’s story. In fact, it had a lot more than I originally anticipated.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nBy now, you all should know that I’m a complete sucker for morbidity and hand-drawn art. Year Walk was absolutely no exception to this rule. The artwork was gorgeous. Everything was very dark and somber. If you’re exploring the world and you don’t find yourself pausing to admire the landscape and the landmarks every once in a while, you’re playing it the completely wrong way.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe soundtrack of Year Walk routinely sent shivers down my spine. The song at the end credits is chilling, especially in the context of the ending of the game. Or should I say, one of the endings. The sounds of Year Walk were sheer brilliance too. You’re guaranteed to feel creeped out at least once during a playthrough, but probably more than once. Aurally, Year Walk is a beautiful smorgasbord of music and sound.\n\nVII – Overall [10/10]\n\nOverall, Year Walk is a fantastic game.","February 17, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a unique visual style, and there are no glaring flaws in the game.  However, after hearing it praised by so many reviewers, I was very disappointed when I finally got around to playing it.\n\nIt isn't exactly a bad game, but it's nowhere near as impressive as its current "94% positive" rating might lead you to believe.  I'd give the game 7/10 at best.  Aside from the art and atmoshperic soundtrack, the game is rather bland.  It's just point and click with puzzles.  Not exactly a rare treat.\n\nI think I would have enjoyed it more if there had been more story and character development.  Year Walk provides the bare minimum in these areas.  Since I knew so little about the character I was playing, I simply wasn't invested enopugh to be scared - or emotionally affected in way at all, really.  For me, Year Walk was just a series of spooky pictures.  And that's simply not enough to make a great game, even if those pictures are well done,\n\n","June 28, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A short but extremely satisfying game with excellent visuals and mood.\n\nFirstly, I loved the visual style of this game - the 2D illustrations are incredibly beautiful. I also loved the way 2D blended into 3D in terms of gameplay from a first-person perspective. While disorienting at first, I think that is intentional and it works well with the fact that the game itself blurs the lines of time and space.\n\nThe Swedish folklore this game is based upon is rather enthralling too, and I greatly appreciated the little encyclopedia that works in-game. That you have to understand basic folklore to play the game is a wonderful approach.\n\nThe puzzles are strange and challenging, but not so difficult as to discourage casual players.\n\nAlso, the sound design is excellent and provides for a truly immersive experience. As is the secret mini-game after the first 'ending', which leads to the true ending.\n\nDespite being able to complete the whole game in only three hours, this was well worth the full price for me.

While this is considered a horror game, its primary draw is its clever puzzles and deceptively quaint and calming atmosphere that seem to take some inspiration from Tim Burton films. The sound design is excellent; both the music and sound effects are extremely crisp and know exactly when to go all out and when to draw back. There are even some music-based puzzles that will rely on your sense of pitch to be able to solve. However, most of the game is very quiet, with little to no music in many sections (though what music is there is quite well done), and only the eerily realistic sound of footsteps crruching in the thick snow will accompany you.\n\nOne of the key selling points of the game is its focus on Swedish folklore, which is told through a companion app (included in the Steam version) and, while it is not necessary to read, I highly recommend going through it so you will know about the different creatures you will encounter on your journey. I found myself fascinated with the folklore itself, and some of the legends are truly frightening. However, the horror elements are mostly intermittent and not exceptionally scary (most of the "scary" parts I would classify more as unnerving than outright terrifying), I think this game is perfect for anyone who is new to horror games and will do a good job easing you into the genre.\n\nHowever, despite my glowing recommendation, I would not recommend playing it on PC if you can get it for another device. This game was originally developed to be played on mobile devices, and while the cursor is perfectly functional, it feels a bit clunky and does not have the same seamless feel of dragging across the screen as using your finger. I would say the ideal version of the game would be the Wii U version, as it has the touch controls of the mobile version, the convenince of having the companion act on the GamePad, and is presented on a large TV to let you truly soak in the visuals. However, if you don't want to play on mobile and/or don't have a Wii U, you experience will not be significantly hampered if you choose to play it on PC.

The navigation takes some getting used to because you're travelling horizontally a lot.  It's challenging, for sure, and I had some pretty frustrated moments.  I also had moments where it scared the crap out of me and I shrieked.  The music is haunting, nothing is predictable, and the setting is mesmerizing.\nThis game is like nothing I've played before, and I definitely recommend spending an evening with it.  It only takes about 1-3 hours, but it's worth the $5.  Without spoiling anything: read through EVERYTHING.  Do everything.  Write things down.  Don't skip anything.  Super easter eggs and secrets. 8.5/10","February 3","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A story that is told by discovery. You pan the camera left and right and and move in and out of scenes. There are some stumpers for puzzles, but for the most part, if you take some notes (no really) you should be able to make it through without too much help. The game also offers help if you are totally stumped.\n\nGood short experience.","January 20","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of few games where following the clues after your first playthrough leads to larger revelations of the story, rather than bells and whistles. But in a true twist, leaving the world of the game to do your own research leads to a surprising discovery. Though similar to Never Alone in its ability to extend cultural lore to a wider audience, Year Walk is not built with the purpose of accurate celebration of ancient Scandanavian folklore. However, it is a lovely game full of lonely visuals that harken to a time when people believed in the things that go bump in the night. If you enjoy folklore and visual artistry, this game is worth the few hours of your time it will take to complete.","May 30","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
