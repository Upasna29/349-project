The bulk of the challenge comes from watching your fat American customers shed pounds on the treadmill, while cleaning up their dirty towels and getting them more water. This takes a lot of skill and is no easy feat, believe me.\n\nI cannot praise this game enough, it will forever be a classic in gaming history.\n\nAlso please, give me your password.","July 3, 2011","true","0.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","0"
