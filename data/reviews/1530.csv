(I owned this long ago, before I used Steam, I have many more hours than listed here.)\n\nMultiwinia isn't a direct control RTS type of game so to speak, they have a bit of their own mind. They will battlewhen near enemies, and mill about when without orders. Yet they loyally follow the orders of their own commanders. That's where you come in! Now you can grab a few or group and give them a general move order, they do the fighting needed there and along the way. But for better results you can upgrade individuals to leaders marked with a simple flag. Now those guys can lead a tightly orginized group with direct marching orders. Or they can simply create a movement vector marked by an arrow on the flag and a small pulsing line across the ground.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279038171\n\nSo you set up a line of movements to get those coming into the area to head out to a rally point or simply swarm an area. Once the "pulsing line" movement order is on the ground they will follow it like ant, and as long as it's active they wander nearby, as other movenear the path they take up the order too. In any place you can quickly put together a formation, and these will have better fighting skills and will automatically resupply its troops from nearby unassigned troops. Basically it's ant trails and battle lines for movement and warfare.\n\nThere are some support itmes and "data" to retrieve during battle.  Bombers, troop transports, turrets, and even some resource collectors which basically collect the little glowing digital souls of all those fallen. And fall they will!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279037151\n\nMultiwinia is a hands-on and hands off-game in a way. You will most certainly be involved in your efforts to win or hold a battle line, but you will also find yourself gladly zooming in to watch the epic little retro digital warfare! You WILL hear theri screams! You'll see men running on fire! Bodies fly through the air as a Bomber run lays waste to an area! Hold a ridge or hilltop and fight off swarms of AI. Control the flow of battle by locking down choke points, controling spawn points and grabbing all the field drops you can. And enjoy the wonderfully colorful retro arcade epic battle graphics.\n\n\nNo need to worry about massive tech-trees or specialized units. Not major economic structureto build up. Just get the spawn points, resources you can and take the high ground. They will do the rest! Sit back, relax and enjoy!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=279037804\n\nAnd remember: no matter how many adorable little lives are lost, or the endless digital screams that fill your gamer nightmares, it's all okay; they are just pixel men. See, look at them march, oh... that's cute. And...they're all dead.","December 24, 2014","true","11.6"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","41","45","15","0"

Actually, it's about as simplified as an RTS game can possibly get.  There is only one type of unit, and the only real control you have is to give a vague direction to them.  Occassionally you'll use an item or pull off a clever pincer attack, but Multiwinia is very simplistic.\n\nDespite being simplistic, or perhaps because of it, a large chunk of the gameplay is a grind.  Send your 100 units to kill the enemy's 100 units and try to stop them from spawning more, so you can send in more and take a base that they can no longer defend.  Of course, you'll be sending these units in waves, usually immediately after they spawn.  As far as gameplay goes, there really isn't a lot there: you'll end up automating most of your units' movements.\n\nThere are a few different game modes but only a few of them really work well.  King of the hill and generic base capturing are fine.  There's a mode that involves capturing bases to fuel a rocket as well, but it's similar to the general base capturing mode.  Another mode features capturing statues and returning them to your base (permanently) and while different enough, doesn't really get away from the base/king of the hill modes much.  The last type I wouldn't recommend to anyone.  It involves capturing a heavily fortified position.  One army gets very frequent respawns while the other doesnt, but as there is little to no strategy in this game, it's very painful to play.  The attacking team either sits and hordes units, or sends them in as he gets them.  Either way, they almost all die for little to no progress against the defender.\n\nThere's online vs and it works well enough, but like I've said, the lack of any unique units or strategy really bogs this game down to a grind and you probably won't have a lot of fun with your friends.  It's good for a game or two but after that you'll probably want to move on.\n\nOn the plus side, the AI is competent enough that playing against it isn't boring, especially if there are several enemy teams.  Watching enemy teams duke it out is quite entertaining.\n\nOh, some really cool/scary things can happen if the aliens or darkwinians get out of control.  ♥♥♥♥ those aliens man, they are god damned ridiculous.\n\nFinal note?  The way items are distributed is pretty biased.  I do like the idea that if you want the items then you have to send units to go collect them because you have to decide whether or not the reward is worth the risk of leaving an area unguarded or unharassed (pro tip: it usually is).\n\nI liked it but I think I'm also in a very small minority of people that would.  It's just so basic.","July 11, 2014","true","63.5"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","29","33","2","0"

Make sure to play on mulitiplayer (preferably with skype), the experience is wonderful.\n\nIs it worth ten dollars? Probably not, so wait for a sale. That said, if all of your friends already have it and you've got money buring a hole in your pocket, Multiwinia isn't a bad choice at all.","January 2, 2014","true","16.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

This game takes an RPG perspective except every base you get spits out units every so often. You as the controller are given special powers such as transports or air strikes to help your troops in battle. The battling is simplistic (none the less entertaining) and you are allowed to assign one of your soldiers as a major who can control a brigade. This makes it useful when trying to corner an enemy. What adds a bit of depth to the game is the fact they include certain additions to your arsenal. You may have an armoured transport, air strikes, dark forests which engulfs enemies, nuclear strikes and even defensive turrets you can control. There a few different game types : domination, king of the hill, capture the statue, rocket riot, blitzkrieg and assault. All game modes are great, my personal favorite is domination.\n\nVisually, the game sets its own standard. It's neither good nor bad, but these graphics specifically define what multiwinia is. I really enjoy the path the devs took regarding the appeal to the game. The sound is basic but varied (which is good). Whether your launching a nuclear attack or an alien abducting your dead multiwinians, there is a sound for each action.\n\nOverall, a good game and I would recommend a buy on sale. It's a neat little breakaway from other strategy games and really pits you against your online opponents.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.5/10.\n\nI wish this game however had more players to play with! Servers are often full or sporadic. Definitely buy a four pack for friends (when on sale of course)!\n\n\n\n\nScreenShots :\nI just deployed a turret, I can take control of it if I wanted to\n\nArmor transports troops across channels\n\nKing of the hill\n\nThe boxes or square that you see are available pickups which land periodically throughout the game (time can be adjusted)\n\nMy opponent used a nuclear strike against me\n\nGood luck defending this\n\nRack em' and stack em'\n\nNo chance","January 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Well let me tell you:\n1. Unlike most RTS games, Multiwinia features one main unit: The Darwinian.\n2. Despite there being only one unit, there are CRATES that can give many different power-ups that can turn the tide of the battlefield. Whether you get reinforcements, turrets, viruses, NUKES!, and even Dragons!\n3. Multiwinia also features different game modes, like Capture the Flag/Point(s), Domination, Assault, and a few more.\n4. All Multiwinians are the same, nothing counters another. In Multiwinia, the only thing you need, is a STRATEGY.\n\nOk, I said some things that make the game unique. Now I'm going to tell you some other things you need to know if you plan on gettings Multiwinia:\n1. Multiwinia is the MULTIPLAYER version of Darwinia. There is no campaign for Multiwinia because Darwinia has the campaign, if you want story mode, get Darwinia.\n2. Multiwinia is FUN. Whether you get addicted or not, is beyond me. But one thing is for sure, if your bored, play this game!\n3. Multiwinia is cheap. The game is really old, so I mean that's probably why it's cheap. BUT, your paying for plenty of fun content!\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nOF COURSE!\n\nMultiwinia is 10 bucks, but on sale, it gets as cheap as 2 dollars!\nBut I recommend you get Darwinia + Multiwinia, so you have the campaign AND multiplayer. It's probably 4 or 5 bucks on sale.\n\nTL;DR Multiwinia is a multiplayer version of Darwinia, which has the campaign. Multiwinia is a very fun and unique RTS game. If you want a RTS with simple mechanics and fun gameplay, get this game!","February 21","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

But fear not, for the Creator drops in random intervals supply-crates that can bless the weak or damn the unfortunate. Each 'crate', one can aquire a much needed turrent or be screwed with a pleague. Or even worse...'Dark Darwinians'.\n\nAgain, don't be fooled by the simplistic visuals; this game means business, there are alot of multi-tasking to be made with this amount of troopers, there are multiple tasks to accomplish each game beyond the main objective. Against multiple enemies, one must assess his/hers situation and take advantage of a foe's lack of attendance.","October 30, 2011","true","88.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's slightly better but is still unplayable. It explains the basics in 2 tutorials, like, controlling the units, making a formation, capturing stuff. However, as soon as you try the single player mode vs the AI (there are no players online to play against) immediately you get questions you don't know answers to and you always lose because you don't know what's happening. Like, where the hell those grenades (or whatever, you just see explosions) come from and wipe out half of your formation. Can you use grenades, too? If so, what button does that? Or where the hell from do ships appear and send rockets from all sides at a location? Why suddenly the battle slowed down etc etc. It seems that the AI takes some bonus crates which have all kinds of special effects, but it's not clear what those effects do, how many of them there are etc. It's not even clearly visible who a spawning point belongs to - there are small colored dots indicating that but in a huge colorful mess of particles this game is they get lost completely.\n\nThere is still the same strange camera control system: moving the mouse rotates the camera (!?), and the cursor is fixed at the center of the screen as if you were controlling a minigun on a helicopter with the task of shooting targets on the ground. The mouse wheel zooms in/out in the same reversed and unconfigurable mode as in Darwinia. Deselecting units is done with Space. It should have been right click (or left click, if right-click is for giving a movement order - depends on whether you like C&C or AoE system better)... Formations work clumsy, as it's not possible to send a formation a bit forward - the destination point must be in front of the whole formation. Selecting groups of darwinians with a long mouse-down is a novel idea but works not so good as it spends too much time. Why didn't they just let people use the old good dragbox or double left-click to select, say, 50 darwinians?\n\nBtw, the basic gameplay here is much like in "virus rts" type games, where you have a set of points on the map, spawning tiny units of one fixed type at a regular rate, and you can pick 50% of them from one point and send to another connected point - there are plenty of mobile games like that now. Surely, Multiwinia is much more complex, and there are more modes, but the basic idea is just that. If you get it (almost) for free in a bundle, it's maybe worth a look. Just don't expect much.","December 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

My good friend bought me this for $0.99 and I was just thinking it was another gag game that we were going to play and then delete. However, this was not the case. I, not being a big fan of RTS games, however really enjoyed this. I love the very simple style of the game where everything is very basic from the land to the ships and power-ups. Even you and your enemies troops are flat little stick men. The only problem with the gameplay is the fact that games do tend to get gridlocked and most of the time, my friends and I just end up quiting. So, in total, this game gets a yes from me, but only if you can get others to buy it so you won't be alone.","December 30, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/1530/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Even though Multiwinia is mostly a multi player upgrade to Darwinia, it is an immensely better game than its predecessor. Nearly all aspects of the game have been improved to the point of near greatness in short bursts. In this iteration of the series, the focus is placed on multi player style game modes, which could also be played against the CPU. Multi player servers are available, but the amount of people playing in public games is scarce to none. This is not a problem, as the single player mode provides much entertainment, challenge, and excitement. Unit placement, movement, and orders have been polished beyond comparison to the nearly broken Darwinia. Everything is fluid, fixed, and sleek. There are also many power-ups and surprises that enhance the game play to the extent of limitless replay ability. In everything Darwinia went wrong, Multiwinia corrected and got right. There are so many maps to play in, and several game modes that will guarantee the almost permanent installation of Multiwinia on your system. You will go back to this game time and time again. The fun and excitement it provides is timeless. There is no reason to play the defective Darwinia if you have Multiwinia. The controls are outstanding, especially when you compare them to the controls and path finding disasters of Darwinia. Each game plays differently, as the variety in maps, game modes, random power-ups, and AI will change your experiences throughout. All difficulty levels are challenging and fun to play, even if you lose. Each match takes between five and twenty minutes, and time flies by quickly, as you are constantly paying attention to your enemies, your units, and ordering them around the map. The action is non-stop. Unfortunately, Multiwinia does not keep track of your personal statistics besides Steam achievements (which I do not care for). There is also a lack of leaderboards of any kind because of the non-inclusion of statistics keeping. It would have been extremely nice to have access to both, even if it were for single player only. Sometimes, you may be losing by a considerable amount, and you will still be able to pull off the win. Power-ups are important at times, depending on the luck of the draw. You will develop a liking to some of them, and apathy for others. While Multiwinia is a short-lived gaming experience, it is Introversion's best effort so far. This game is a perfect example of something you keep installed for years to come, always going back to it for quick matches action packed with fun and entertainment.\n\nMultiwinia is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Suddenly, violence was embedded in the minds of the Darwinians, and they split themselves into factions to vie for control of the realm.  In Multiwinia, you play as these factions trying to gain territory or launch a rocket or WMD before the other factions.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, Multiwinia has almost no story to speak of.  All the lore is contained within the little snippets that describe each level, but there’s no order to them.  This is truly exactly what the title describes: Multiplayer Darwinia.\n\nThe controls are largely the same as in Darwinia, though now you can directly command individual groups of Darwinians, as well as promote captains to give them standing orders while you attend to matters elsewhere.  The difference here is that there are many different game modes to play.  King of the Hill, Rocket Building, and even an Assault mode where one player defends a base and the others have to attack it by any means necessary.\n\nAgain, you’ll grow attached to these little guys, but they’re not as innocent as before.  They will happily slaughter any opposing forces they come across, and you won’t have too much time to grieve them if they die, because they are replaced almost instantly.\n\nThe action is fast-paced and hectic, though the battles are won in minutes, not seconds.  You’ll need to think out your choices minutes in advance, and hold territory as best you can while waiting for reinforcements.  Though if you fail, it isn’t very disheartening.  Just fire up another round and try again.\n\nThis is a fun little game, though it is not very deep.  It’s a passable RTS for fans of Darwinia, though you’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone online to play with nowadays.","April 5","false","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is no coding involved in that.\n\nThe remaining 75% are extremely difficult to achieve.  The only people who play now have been doing so for a good while and you'll struggle to beat them at all, let alone stomp them into the ground as the achievements require.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it's alright I guess.  I'm a fan of RTS games and have played a great many of them.  This one is very simple and dumbed down.  It's fun with friends for a while but I wouldn't go much further with it. For a guy, like myself, who has just under 150 games in his library, this one will not likely see much play time from me.","November 8, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Simple as that. You control an army of small, mishaped, exotically coloured "men". As you progress you will encounter a variety of challenges. The first challenge will be your friends trying to use the colour that you wanted to ♥♥♥♥ing use. After you have bribed your so called "friend" to allow you to be purple, you have the issue of coming up with the most insulting name possible. After aquiring a high quality insulting name such as "Oli is a degenerate" the game can commence. Oh wait, no, you need to get that last toss pot in your game to ready the ♥♥♥♥ up. Once this has occured, you will need to do this again for some unknown reason. When the game begins, you will most likely get into an argument with the person occupying the base near to yours. This will go on for around 20 minutes or so. At this point the greatest danger of all will arrive promptly. The black men. They are mishaped even more so than the usual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Anyway, the game will end for you when the first player dies, as they always pick on YOU. You will find yourself inundated with ants, spiders and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to take your men away/murder them on the spot. You will also most likely find meteors raining down on the craniums of your men. Goodbye.\n","January 10, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
