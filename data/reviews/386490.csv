Until the story unfolds and you get sucked into it. Wanda is that game. You see the robots speak to each other and you try to see what they're trying to say. The world seems pretty persistent on it's own and as a player my curiousity grew. Which very much got me sucked into this game.\n\nThe puzzles are very logical thinking. It draws a little from Portal as in trying to flip switches and portals but it's unique on it's own where it's not a direct ripoff. However, this game is a bit short I think. But honestly, disregarding the puzzles the story and atmosphere is where it's main focus is. Don't expect to enjoy a full-fledged puzzle game. That's only like a snack or morsel, compared to the story presented in this magnificent game.\n\nNow, can't forget one thing about this game that just gave it such a big wow factor. The music. I never experienced something so phenomenal and such a surprise hit to me. The music just blended so well with the in-game cutscenes and the way the story presented itself. At the end of the day, the game was just so damned good. Atmosphere, music and story but damn, it's too short. It's like when you finish it it's like saying bye to a good friend. I think it's worth the purchase just for that.\n\nSo if you're into puzzle games or even people who enjoyed Undertale and even Earthbound where it has it's own unique world I highly recommend it. Please, if you start playing. Just be ready to embrace the FEELS. Damn.\n\nPros:\n\n+Logic based puzzles that give you that "AHA!" moment\n+An interesting game world packed with mystery and intrigue\n+God-tier soundtrack done by David Lister\n\nCons:\n\n-Short. The game was real good that I wish there were more to do.","June 3","true","7.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Little game with Huge Feel Trip. Music and the story telling are like bean and pea,water and fish.Hand drawing arts and beautiful over world graphic and very well polished. I sometime forget that I'm playing a game because this game is like a very beautiful movie about two cute robots. Puzzels are very well made and give you this satisfaction. This game will make you laugh,happy,sad,and emotional attachment. This is truly a Wandaful game. oh and btw .. if you don't skip the puzzels and solve it all , there is a secrect story at the end ;)\n\n9/10","June 4","true","0.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It's about a heart-warming journey of two robots in a post-apocalyptic world. Frankly, I am not a big fan of puzzle games but I played this game for the reason of the art-style, the soundtracks , the story and of course the amount of efforts put into this game by the devs. A big applause for the game made by my friend , a fellow gamer and a game developer Ko Chit Ko Ko who is from Myanmar.","June 3","true","0.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Which was a real shame because this title has a really good emotionally driven story, with an amazing musical score.\nI also believe the title is a bit expensive for 3 hours (at a stretch) worth of gameplay. I did enjoy the game, but unfortunately these two factors make me advise against picking up this title.\n\n\nPlease watch my video below for alot more information.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEz0SvyBWj0","June 3","false","4.5"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","9","24","3","9"
