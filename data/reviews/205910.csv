I also like this crazy story. You can cut and move almost every stone you encounter.  I'm loving cutting stones! Try to find your own path and search for different secrets.\n\nSome levels demand the player to arrive at certain places without a well pre-established way. So one need to cut, drag, push stone cubes/pillars/walls/beams etc. You can find alternative ways to beat levels, for example without cutting anything. There are also boss fight stages, where you should evade or cut down the stones thrown at you.\n\nAt last I talk about the achievements, 100% completion is not hard. The collection of all flashing stones in episode 4 is quite challenging. Pay attention to the stones on the top of all blue pillars (no guide or video for this achievement). It took me 10 hours in total to get all the achievements.","March 17, 2014","true","16.1"," 133 of 153 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","133","153","0","6"

The screen shots generally don't do it any justice making it an easily overlooked title; the name doesn't help either.\n\nThe graphics, although strange, are a suitable stylistic choice that fit well with the theme.  Likewise, the music is unusual but enjoyable.  A couple new tracks are hidden in each level, so finding them is a good idea if you want to expand the game's song list.\n\nThe most noteworthy design element in the game is the physics engine with the ability to cut pillars, statues, boulders and most other stone items.  It feels amazing to push, pull, and hack apart such large objects and dynamically alter the game environment.  The simple act of cutting objects at any angle without the use of voxels was something I had never seen before.\n\nI appreciated how the designers encouraged experimentation; most of the trial and error situations encountered aren't that painful.  Despite my low tolerance for gaming frustration and rather poor platforming skills this game won me over and I fought through.  It's a short game at 3-5 hours, but it has a lot of replay value if you enjoy achievement hunting.\n\nThose whom enjoy the exploration of platformers, will surely love hunting down hidden objects and discovering the various Easter eggs that Tiny & Big has to offer.  I enthusiastically recommend this somewhat underrated title to everyone.","December 10, 2014","true","14.3"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","82","89","4","7"

And you wonder why they havn't made a second one?!? :D Tiny and Big Grandpa's Leftovers is crazy. The music is crazy (and fun!), the gameplay is crazy (and fun!) the story is VERY crazy (and a lot of fun!), the characters (there are only 2 in the game) are comicly funny and entertaining. The gameplay is sandbox"ish". You can cut, pull and push almost every obstacle in the game. Carve yourself stairs to the top of that tower? Go for it. :) It's unique art style combined with that crazy music even creates a funny atmosphere. The game is packed with secrets and stuff to find. I replayed it twice, just to get most of the achievements (which are hilarious, too). The main character is accompanied by a radio that has the right phrase for every situation. Unfortunatly there are no voices in the game, so you have to read everything. That's kind of hard, while you're running for your life, trying not to get crushed.\nThe game is not very hard (but no, it is not EASY) and you'll see the credits after 3 hours. Plus achievement time. This game is worth every cent you spend on it. Stop reading!

Remember when you put your underwear on your head and tried to convince your college roommate's mother that you actually were a pseudo-Aztec god of the mole people?  And how you spent the next night in prison, where you met Thorn, who gave you that really sweet tat of Maya Angelou fighting a 4-winged serpent on your forehead?  That's what this game feels like.\n\nTiny and Big feels more like a dev studio showing off a fun physics engine than it does a fully fleshed-out game.  The platforming is sometimes difficult to figure out, mostly because you have to learn the mechanics of the game as you go along--after the tutorial levels, the hints are few and far between.  The "rocket" tool seems to have no reasonable use except to move large objects in unpredictable ways, leading to hilarious results.  And most of the game's challenges can be bypassed by using your cutting tool in ways that I do not believe the devs envisioned.\n\nRegardless, if you want to spend some time in a fun physics sandbox, where nearly the entire landscape is destructible, TaBGL is not a bad way to spend your hard-earned prison cigarettes while Thorn sterilizes another safety pin for round two of Angelou.\n\nBy the way:  GREAT name for a Kendrick Lamar cover band.","June 30, 2015","true","5.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","31","33","20","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/205910/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","There is a question that is posed to every man in his life.  One question that he must endeavor to answer to his own satisfaction and to hell with the naysayers.  One choice between confining support or uncertain freedom that will ever after determine the fate of his junk:  boxers or briefs?  Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers would emphatically tell you that tighty whiteys are worth fighting for, yet everything about it feels loose, free, and spacious.\n\nWhy on Earth are you talking about underwear to describe a 3D platformer/physics puzzler, reviewer?  Because in T+B, you play as the titular Tiny, a young man on a quest to recover his grandfather's hand-me-down underpants that have been stolen by an unscrupulous bandito.  That's one of those ideas I can't possibly make more ridiculous than the game presents it.  And as a framing device, it works.  I've played more than a few puzzle games that have forgotten that you need to give your game a definitive character to make it stand out from the piles and piles of mental exercises that boil down to merely an expensive Sudoku.\n\nThe visual style looks like something Pendleton Ward might come up with if you limited his palette to muted blues and oranges and does a good job of communicating the game's overall character in a sort of graphic novel way.  The soundtrack to the game is also special enough to note.  It takes the form of cassette tapes that you collect and listen to on your radio and, in addition to providing more reason to explore, covers a wide range of engaging jams from latin beats to funk to rock n' roll.\n\nThat's all well and good, but if I'm going to put myself into Grandpa's Leftovers, I'd better get some play and the experience had better feel good!  Relax, reader.  Thanks to Tiny and Big you'll feel great grabbing your stones and watching them swing free and easy and that's nothing to say about whipping out your rocket and blasting away a huge load.  Yes, in Tiny and Big you will use your mining laser to cut up your environment and a winch and rocket to move the pieces you cut into place.  What did you think I was talking about?\n\nAnyway, the game strikes a nice balance between levels that are more freeform and open, like a sumptuous pair of boxers, and more puzzle-focused linear affairs that are tight and clean, like the familiar TWs.  This lets you get the most out of these unique mechanics as you move between trying to literally carve your own path to your objectives and examining your environment to find just the right object to cut or pull so everything falls into place.\n\nIf there's one fault with Tiny and Big, it's that it feels a bit short: five levels and a boss fight.  This might be a bit of a dividing point for some players.  If you just want to cruise to the end of the game in the most efficient way possible, you'll probably be done in a couple hours.  But if you enjoy hunting down tricky secrets and trying to make alternate routes, T + B will occupy you for quite some time.\n\nIf there are two faults, it's that Grandpa's Leftovers contain a few bugs, which, as you can imagine, can make your experience a bit uncomfortable.  None of them are explosively bad, but when you combine them with inevitable physics screw-ups, you'll find yourself losing a little hard-earned progress hunting for the tough secrets or flailing angrily because you've just lost your no-death run of a level.  As I've implied, you won't have a lot of issue with them unless you're going for the optional challenges that add a lot of meat to the game.\n\nYou can get Grandpa's Leftovers for less than the cost of a fresh bag of undies when it goes on sale and I definitely recommend you do.  It's a stand-out game that delivers on all those promises of "fully destructible environments" that almost always prove to be a disappointment.  Most importantly, it's a fun game; fun in the vain of things like Psychonauts.  And that's why you should definitely slip into Grandpa's Leftovers.\n\nThis game certified by inspector no. 28","February 19, 2015","true","15.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","33","39","15","0"

Judge me by my size, do you?” -Master YodaTiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers is a relatively short Indie title that follows the story of an individual-with a murmuring voice similar to that of Tom Kenny-named Tiny as he embarks on a journey to seek the only heirloom his late grandfather bestowed upon him: a pair of all-powerful underpants that the main antagonist, Big, obtains. I know how this sounds, and you have every reason to be skeptical because of this description. However, the relentless rivalry between Tiny and Big’s primary protagonist and antagonist-aptly named Tiny and Big-is a very amusing struggle. Tiny is equipped with a radio that seemingly has a mind of its own, as well as a set of three gadgets-rocket attachments, a cutting tool, and a hooked rope- that aide in manipulating the environment.\nHere are just a few reasons to give Tiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers a chance:\n\nGameplay - This title is a physics-heavy game that utilizes the three previously stated tools-each obtained progressively through the game’s story- to allow the environment to be altered, and to, subsequently, allow for progression. Though not all of it is, a large part of the environment is destructible, allowing the player to create varying ways in which to solve puzzles and proceed to the next portion of the game. In fact, so much of this game is able to be manipulated that it is highly possible to discover multiple solutions to a single problem, which adds to the replayability of this relatively short title. The control scheme for this title is quite simple, with the standard W, A, S, and D movement layout providing movement, the Space Bar acting as Tiny’s jump button, and all three of the gadgets being accessible by utilizing the mouse; moving the mouse aims the reticle, LMB activates the cutting tool, MMB allows rockets to be placed on objects-with another click of MMB, once attached, to send the mass flying within the rocket’s trajectory-, and RMB connects the grappling hook to a target. The cutting tool takes a bit of getting used to, but is extremely fun to utilize after a short time of learning.\n\nHumorous Dialogue - Both Tiny and Big share not only a physical rivalry but a verbal one. Speech is erected through text bubbles and is acted out through voices that are jabbering gibberish, but with tones unique to each character. Even Tiny’s radio lends notable dialogue to situations while lending a hand with hints and sounding like someone is constantly changing the station. Combined with its cell-shaded graphics, this game’s approach to conversation is both minimalistic and highly enjoyable.\n\nCollectables and Secrets - You can definitely see the developers’ sense of humor within Tiny and Big’s collectibles system. The most prominent pickups in the game are known as Boring Stones, and pretty much describe how, in general, objects such as these are tossed into games as extra content to add to the replayability; it is quite a silly satire. The developers also have self-inserts hidden within the game which prompt Steam Achievements. There are other secrets  such as hidden game cabinets that take the player to a variation of Tiny and Big that is reminiscent of a retro video game’s color palette but I will allow you to figure out what and where they are throughout the landscape.\n\nTL:DR - I must admit that I was skeptical about purchasing this title due to its completion time, but the overall feel of the game entranced me into reviewing levels I had already cleared just to retain the same sense of prior enjoyment, just to experience this game’s overworld, conversations, secrets, and themes. Admittedly, Tiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers is one of my favorite physics-based adventures, and I have been secretly awaiting a sequel though I know this aspiration is highly unlikely at the given moment.

It's super fun, fluid, and addictive, and what really defines this game.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is quite simple, Tiny (who you play as) is looking for his Grandpa's white, fine rib underpants - who Big (your arch nemesis) is wearing.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe artstyle in this game is unique and gorgeous, I've never seen a game with a similar artstyle, so I can't give you an example. Watching a video is OK to get an idea of what it's like, but when you're in-game is when the graphics really shine. So yeah, the art is fantastic, but don't expect Crysis 3-esque graphics, the highlight in the graphical department is the artstyle, not textures, lighting or any of that.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe sound effects are satisfying, and are complimented with cartoony "BANG", "SMASH" and "FIZZLE" pop-ups. The soundtrack is fan-f*cking-tastic, you add to the soundtrack by collecting tapes in-game, and they're all (in my opinion) awesome. I would recommend getting the game+soudtrack version, but first search YouTube for some tracks from the game to see if it's your kind of thing.\n\nSome other stuff:\n\nI finished the game in almost 4 hours, but i have nowhere near 100% completion - the game is full with stuff to collect - tapes, and tons of rocks (yeah, you collect these special rocks). So if you take you time to enjoy the game, have fun with the slicing, and make an effort to find secrets (there are secret rooms with easter egg-ish stuff in them), you can probably sink twice the time I did into the game in one playthrough.\n\nAlso, I would say the game deservees a higher score than metacritic's 75, it's a real Indie pearl.\n\nDefinitely recommend!

The title makes it sound like the game is about leftover food, but it's actually about a pair of underwear the player character's, Tiny, grandfather once owned. You see, this pair of underwear is magical, much like Mormon underwear.\n\nI will say though, this was one of the most interesting platformers I've played in a while, mainly because of the amazing physics and cutting edge laser cutting that was wildly accurate when cutting apart statues, rocks, pillars, etc. The devs did a thorough job of making sure the game has its own art style without trying to imitate platformers of the 90's or the early 2000's. The only difference between this platformer and others is there's no hub world. The game is in constant adventure, through 6 different stages of varying atmosphere, difficulty and length.\n\nThe plot is that at the beginning of the game, Tiny gets in a car crash with his radio robot that's trying to guide him, presumably to these pyramids that are seen throughout the game. Well, this other fellow, Big, steals the underwear from the car crash and gains the powers, throwing big rocks and levitaion and what not. Anyway, radio robot helps you along the way while using your tools to fight Big throughout 5 of the 6 stages.\n\nPretty great game overall though, might have benefited from a full soundtrack of orchestra, platformer music, instead of jams and beats.\n\n8.7/10","February 7","true","27.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","16","18","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/205910/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Tiny and Big is a rock cutting simulation first a 3D platformer second, both in focus and quality. There are some really cool ideas here to be sure, but the inconsistencies between the various elements makes it a rather uneven experience, and one that is over just as quick as it begins.\n\nDiverging from genre tradition, Black Pants Studios doesn't give you many conveniently placed platforms and instead asks you to make your own using a high powered laser to cut a path through the environment. Physics naturally play a role and make finding the perfect point to slice a rock or beam a largely freeform affair. Unfortunately this also works against the game in many ways do to how easy it is to make a small mistake and have to restart the area (which also resets any collectibles you recently picked up, or cutscenes that played out). On the whole there is simply too little direction, and I found myself getting lost or stuck on numerous occasions.\n\nTiny's unimpressive jump and fickle controls present yet another problem and make navigating the world largely unenjoyable. Movement is jerky and the camera far too slow to compensate, while attempting to cut a rock as it flies through the air (something that happens quite often) typically resulted in me being crushed beneath it as I wrestled to place the cutting line where it needed to be.\n\nArtistically T&B is what I expect the illegitimate offspring of Adventure Time and a Graphic Novel would look like. It's a display of deliberate strangeness and creativity, but unfortunately the muddy textures and poor animations don't do it justice. If the developers got anything right though it is the sound effects, which makes you feel like a boulder lumberjack as the booming crashes threaten to blow out your sub. This was easily the highlight and has me wishing there was simply a mode that allowed me to do nothing but tumble giant rocks, and I daresay would almost make it a game worth playing in and of itself.\n\nWith only six levels which take 15-30 minutes to complete, Tiny and Big falls halfway between an extended demo and a full game. A handful of great moments stand out, but given how short the experience is they hardly justify the price. If not for the poor controls I could see myself recommending it anyway, but for now it's a very hard sell.","October 30, 2013","false","3.6"," 86 of 149 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","86","149","2","0"

You can literally slice through chunks of mountain ridges and columns to create your own pathways, which is encouraged considering how many secrets there are to find. The music is also pretty cool. It's a big mish-mash of artists, similar to how Hotline Miami went about their soundtrack.

If you don't like platformers, don't even think about this game. Lots of jumping around, lots of progressive movement. The unique catch is how Tiny can shape the rocks, making his own platforms.

It took me 3 hours to fully complete the story, with only 22 of the 53 Steam achievements completed; so if you're an achievement hunter there's tonnes to revisit and work on.\n\nOverall, a small, fun game.

It has a quite brilliant game mechanic in that everything can be cut up using a laser tool to provide platforms to reach.\n- Its a different kind of puzzle games in which you have to be creative to reach your goal, it poses practical challenges based around physics.\n- Different every time you die, naturally when you die it means you have to find a different route using the tools provided and it allows a clean slate.\n- Its a fairly simple logic, find the pants. An odd pro for an odd game. Theres pretty much a nonsense no story, its almost as if the gameplay is enough, which it is.\n- Theres a nice style to the game, not exactly pleasing to the eye but it works. Looks almost like sketches.\n- I really liked the idea around finding tapes which changed the music, the music was great too.\n- The end environment was thought provoking and a nice challenge, really loved it.\n\nCONS:\n- Its a shame is so short, about 2.5 hours. It took me about 4 hours to complete as I liked finding stones/tapes, oh and I died a lot. I enjoyed it enough to really want it to go on for longer maybe with more environments,\n\nVERDICT?\nA really fun little game which is a fantastic addition to anyones library, hugely fun!","August 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

I didn't fully know what to expect, but after seeing the laser cutting mechanic in the first 10 seconds of the trailer, I was sold on my purchase. This game does not disappoint! All three tool mechanics are widely used in the game in multiple ways, so gameplay never falters, even when replaying. Discovering secrets and extras is exceptionally rewarding, occasionally leading you to decimate entire cliff faces in an attempt to get that one stone down at the bottom and then climb back up again, only downside is saving is checkpoint-based. All in all, I feel that no other game gives the temple-desecration-puzzle elements of this game, and at any price, it's a worthy pickup.

Not even a bit, if you actually take your time and explore all the places and have fun with the mechanics. Surely, 6 levels might seem not enough for a game like this, but they're pretty big and with different ways to complete them, so you'll eventually end up in replaying them. You can create your own level as well, thanks to the modding kit on their site. Pretty fun for speedrunners, as there are leaderboards for every level (and hackers with records such as half a second). The achievements are actually fun and rewarding since they offer a challenge such as complete x level without dying or do this certain thing, without any grinding ones (except the 1000 boring stones one). The soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard (I still have 2-3 songs from this game on my phone even though I last played it 4 months ago): a mix of indie music, sort of electronic trippy 8-bit music, blues and jazz. It's even part of the game itself, letting you collect a music tape for every song giving you the choice to listen to that particular one by choosing it in the menu. The ending left me a bit disappointed, but I guess the devs didn't expect this much success with their game. Hope they'll throw more good games like this at us eventually.","September 24, 2014","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'd called it a physics based puzzle platformer.\n\nThis game is a very short, weird under the radar game that I really enjoyed. You get a laser that can pretty much cut everything in the world into how ever many pieces you want. Though it being a platformer you'll want to take heed on how you cut things because there is a lot of climbing. You'll also get a grappling hook use to pull the pieces around as well a deployable rocket to knock things over and have a bit of fun.\n\nThe game has a very nice art style. Some mix of comic book and paper aesthetic making the material in the world very interesting to interact with. The game is roughly 2 hours long. So depending on your view on the cost/gameplay length debacle I say this errs on the “worth it” side as even though the campaign is rather short.

Although due to the physics, it’s annoying that you could do the exact same cut twice and yet one fails and one works because they both fell differently.\nThere are collectables in the game, which I’ve always liked collectables in games. Gets my OCD gotta-catch-em-all urges going. You collect music tapes that play throughout the game, so the more you find the more music you have to listen to while you play, which is quite cool.  Alongside the tapes there’s boring rocks you can collect, which I think are just exactly what they say on the tin, a boring rock. That does nothing at all.\nAnyways... the music is quite nice, the graphics are pretty and it’s got the whole borderlands, nothing but sand, dirt and rocks, middle of the desert, bare wasteland kind of thing going on. Which, looks nice, it’s decent. But made the game feel a little to bare to me. It wouldn’t hurt to throw in a tree every now and then. I understand that it is supposed to feel like that, which it does really well, I just personally would have enjoyed looking at a little more. You know, jazz that ♥♥♥♥ up a bit. But maybe that’s just me.\nIt’s fairly short and the storyline is a little bizarre, but I think in general I enjoyed it.

The title makes it sound like the game is about leftover food, but it's actually about a pair of underwear the player character's, Tiny, grandfather once owned. You see, this pair of underwear is magical, much like Mormon underwear.\n\nI will say though, this was one of the most interesting platformers I've played in a while, mainly because of the amazing physics and cutting edge laser cutting that was wildly accurate when cutting apart statues, rocks, pillars, etc. The devs did a thorough job of making sure the game has its own art style without trying to imitate platformers of the 90's or the early 2000's. The only difference between this platformer and others is there's no hub world. The game is in constant adventure, through 6 different stages of varying atmosphere, difficulty and length.\n\nThe plot is that at the beginning of the game, Tiny gets in a car crash with his radio robot that's trying to guide him, presumably to these pyramids that are seen throughout the game. Well, this other fellow, Big, steals the underwear from the car crash and gains the powers, throwing big rocks and levitaion and what not. Anyway, radio robot helps you along the way while using your tools to fight Big throughout 5 of the 6 stages.\n\nPretty great game overall though, might have benefited from a full soundtrack of orchestra, platformer music, instead of jams and beats.\n\n8.7/10","July 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was expecting a relatively generic indie platformer, but what I got was a portal-like physics based puzzle platformer that really got me thinking and being creative.\n\nYou can utilize 3 tools, and I very much like that it gives you all three within the first minute of the game. There is a small tutorial bit explaining some of the things you can do with the tool before the opening scene, but it's very quick, and outside of that the game never really limits which of the 3 you can use.\n\nLeft click activates a slicing mechanic, which locks onto an object, but allows you to strafe around it zelda-style. I would be interested to see what a more point-to-point dragging variation would be like, but the center and drag outwards control works well, and I guess it does allow you to react a tad faster. Right click activates a stiff rope that can be used to pull just about anything. It doesn't retract, but only follows your movement. And finally, Middle Click launches a sticky rocket that will attach to nearly any surface, and a second click will propel the rocket and whatever's attached to it forward.\n\nThe great thing is, that the levels have such a huge sense of scale to them, and these tools can manipulate pieces of stone hundreds or even thousands of times the size of your character. You feel really powerful, and it's awesome when huge walls or pillars come crashing down next to you.\n\nI'd very much recommend a mouse and keyboard. The platforming feels a bit better with a controller, but the speed of the mouse can really add a lot to the experience. You can catch objects mid-air with all 3 of the tools, and manipulate them in ways that require timing just too fast for a controller.\n\nThe game is very mentally stimulating, and there are tons of secrets to find and quicker ways to do things if you really think about the environment and your tools. And that's one of the best features of the game. There's a lot you can interact with, and you can go as far as chopping off the path forward. Don't worry, you can simply respawn at the generous checkpoints, but I just like the fact that it lets you do so much that it can be impossible to progress. It really feels like a genuine adventure, and not just some path that you walk down.\n\nThe visuals have a unique and interesting style, although the fidelity isn't amazing, especially the texture resolution. The soundtrack also feels very unique, and while I didn't love all of it, there were a few songs that I really enjoyed, even more so because the music tracks are actually hidden collectables. I found all but 3 on my playthrough. There's so little dialog that I think it could really benefit from voice acting, and it would be quick and easy to get done. Your radio  has a personality and talks to you, but it's easy to miss much of what he says because it's just a text bubble on the bottom of the screen.\n\nPerformance wise it should be very easy to run. It runs extremely well, and does support 120Hz. There's no FOV adjustment, and while wasn't the 100-110 I'm used to, it was definitely high enough to not cause any issues for someone like me who sits pretty close to my display.\n\nChances are you probably already own this game from a bundle so go ahead and play through it! It's not a long game, and even though I would have liked more, it's a concise and genuinely enjoyable experience. There's a lot of creativity both on the part of the developers, and on yourself and how you play because of how open it is. And if you don't already have it, you can pick it up for $2 on sales or less if you trade for bundle key. I completely recommend it for everyone but small children, only because of the thinking and platforming skill required to progress.","June 24, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

TL;DR version below.\n\nYou control Tiny going after Big who stole his pants and he wants them back. With you have the Radio and some tools that cut, rocket and pull rocks and mountains apart. It's a platformer where you can create your own paths and destroy almost everything in the levels for fun, or for exploration. Some fun pysichics and mechanics, when you stand below a mountain and cutting it off, just to see this movie like seen where the mountain falls over you, trying to run away from it. It looks great. You find your own music, which is a fun mechanic, they are not hard to find, so don't worry. And the soundtrack fits and gives that little extra feeling to it. The stages can be a little to linear and you can't redo cuts, this can be a little trick, let's say you cut a bridge you need to cut, and the checkpoint first comes when it's cut, then you have to restart the entire map. But the stages are interesting and fun to maim about, and still a lot of secret things to discover here and there. Though even well designed stages, there is only one way to reach the goal. In a game with mechanics like this, where you cut your own way through mountains, there should be multiple ways to reach it. There is, but not to that extend it was intended and you go through hell if you mess up and try to make another piece of mountain fit has a bridge.\n\nThe game is done comic book like, with textbubbles and grunting for speech. It has humor and done well. I don't think I have much more to say about that... Oh, the game also needs workshop, this game has so much potential for that.\n\nWhat is also good about this game, is does something more games should do. The game is enjoyable at all times, nothing in it seems like a chore, at least not to me. The puzzles could be a tad irritating in a good way (You know, the way you just need to do this and the satisfaction when you suceed). Even the tidious tasks as collecting boring stones, opens up for exploration and secrets. This game makes you want to explore, destroy that mountain and see what's behind it. So it's a huge shame that the maps were as linear as they were and short.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS:\nExploration and destruction of everything\nGood humor\nGreat Soundtrack\nFun psychics and fun to play around\nWell made stages that are fun and challenging to play\nNothing seems like a chore\n\nCONS:\nI bit tad short\nMaps are a bit linear for what the game offers\nCan't create to many of your own paths to progress\nNo workshop :(\n\nConclusion: A really enjoyable game. Even though you can complete the game 100% in 13, it's a really fun, enjoyable way to spend 13 hours. So for 10 euro, this game rocks. I am hoping for workshop and or a sequel that is even more ambitious. If you like platformer and exploration, this game is for you.","July 12, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's too short. Now I wasn't dissatisfied with the game, I wanted there to be more; more blocks to slice, more sliced blocks to pull, more pulled sliced blocks to rocket thrust, more wide open areas with simple yet engaging scenery, but as I said before content quantity is this game's shortcoming.\n\nBut fortunately this brings me to positive points.\n\nWhat this game is is a large scale 3D platformer in which the goal is to go from point A to point B through the manipulation of large chunks of stone to work your way through very large areas (primarily ancient ruins) full of platforms, bridges, pits, tunnels, secrets rooms, the whole lot. Utilizing your three tools effectively provides a wide palette of techniques to progress through each level: whether you create a bridge to reach another platform, or create a ramp down to a platform with potentially more resources, or maybe you're like me and you decide to strap a rocket to the back of a stone slab and surf your way to your goal. But the point is nothing is set in stone (everything is stone hah get it) here, you make your way to the magic pants in whichever way pleases the tastes of your inner mason.\n\nThe story, while short, is both simple and goofy as well. Take that as you wish, but unless you have a fetish for black briefs and have a lifelong feud with your brother, the story is a meaningless accessory to what is actually fun gameplay.\n\nSo in summary yes, I like the game and I'd pay 99 cents for the game again, full price however, no.","July 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You have a laser you can use to cut through stone, a grappling hook to drag stone around, and a rocket that you can use to launch anything it attaches to.  And then you have physics.  And that's pretty much it; get to the end of each section using your tools and physics.  It's hilarious how easy it is to get things wrong and get yourself stuck, or smash yourself under a pillar, or miss a jump and fall to your death.  Way more fun than I ever would have guessed.  The game design and graphic style is very unique, and the music is varied and interesting too. There's only 5 real levels and a final boss level (that was kind of annoying), for a game I played for 2-3 hours total, but I could easily go back and try the levels again to go faster, or make fewer cuts, or get all the collectibles. This is the epitome of indie games, unique concept, unique look, and a world that you'll never get from a AAA developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/205910/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers is a quirky little game I received through a Humble Bundle Indie Games bundle and it sat on my "To play" list for some time. Like many things involving Steam and the Humble Bundle, your games library can increase almost exponentially and like many others, this game was buried until a song from the soundtrack came on while I was driving home one day and I immediately put the whole album on and listened to it, especially the highly catchy track, Little Pretty Thing by 3typen featuring Bryan Kessler. I also logged onto my mobile Steam app and began downloading the game remotely (How many people forgot that you can do that?). Developed and Published by Black Pants Game Studio.\n\n\nGameplay: 86/100 B\nThe basics is all that exists here, in the world of Tiny and Big, with three added mechanics, a grappling hook to pull stones and statues around, a rocket gun to push stones and statues out of the way, and the main "weapon" of choice - a laser powered stone cutter. A majority of the game involves literally cutting your way through levels of stone in order to get to the next part of the stage mixed in with some platforming, that can be a little frustrating as your character, Tiny, does feel just a tad loose in the controls, but nothing a little adaptation can't fix. The niche mechanics are really nice for a good portion of the game, planning ahead in some cases as you try to figure out if you cut a platform, will fall in the direction you plan and land where you want it to. It can be really satisfying to watch a pillar fall and come crashing down to form a bridge for you to cross, makes you want to yell "TIMBER!" every time it happens. Unfortunately, at least for me, the charm wore off around 3/4ths of the way and I found myself just wildly cutting away, creating a pile of rubble to climb upon instead of a carefully crafted structure, but there is a deterrent to this strategy - wildly cutting around may inadvertently remove the support structure of something next to or above you and, much like [SPOILER WARNING] Clayton madly slicing away at vines in the climax of Disney's Tarzan, it will most likely become your downfall. That said, it's probably best to be careful when cutting away at a wall, because almost everything you can see is able to be cut by your laser tool.\n\n\nStory: 83/100 B-\nThe story of Tiny and Big is silly at best, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It's charming and even cute at times, but make no mistake, it's not for children. The occasional curse word will remind you of the target audience. The basic premise of the story revolves around Big taking Tiny's underpants. Though there isn't really anything in terms or talking, it is all text driven, much like a comic book in motion. There's even "Bam," "Fizzle," and "Boom" word effects when stones crash to the ground ala Adam West Batman, further adding to type of story the game is presenting. It's simple, starts in the middle, and ends in the middle. It is not a plot meant to be taken in anything, just as it is and with that, it delivers. It's not crude, but it's also not classy. It's almost like a toned down Borderlands.\n\n\nAudio: 95/100 A\nThe music of Tiny and Big is broken into two parts: there's the ambient game music and then there's the "Buckets full of Indie Music" to be collected and found by "hardly known, but genuine indie bands." While it may sound like a disingenuous advertisement for the music, a little tongue and cheek has to be taken, since the game itself doesn't take itself too seriously as well. The gameplay music is composed masterfully, invoking emotion and matches the environments perfectly, much in the same way Borderlands did, but much like Borderlands, Tiny and Big makes you long for something more as you gaze out into the horizon. At times, the soothing music makes you want to just wander off to see what's out there instead of fulfilling your mission.\n\n\nVisuals: 93/100 A-\nMuch like the music, the art direction mirrors that of Borderlands, the heavy black lines and vibrant color schemes makes it stand out and is very easy on the eyes, a welcomed break from the bleak gray and brown color schemes that is so overused in video games these days. As mentioned before, Tiny and Big even has "caption" effects like "Crash," Splat," and "Pow" and adds to the effect in a charming way, although there was more than one instance when the words got in the way of a pillar falling in my direction and couldn't see it. Not really a problem, but it did make me slap my forehead on occasion. The design of the game is also very consistent, even though you only get to explore a small portion of the world you're on, you are given a fairly good idea of what it's like. That kind of direction, not just in art styles, is what builds a fan base and community, and with that, often sequels and support.\n\n\nContent: 75/100 C\nLike most indie games, they are designed to be taken in small doses, played as a relaxant or in between major sessions and Tiny and Big is no exception. One could easily finish the game in an hour or two if they wanted. There is a motive to explore, finding hidden items, mini-games, and music tracks and despite the general length of the game, exploring is often worth it in this case. Finding the mini-games especially was fun, going into a hidden room behind a wall or turning a corner to find an old coin operated arcade machine is a pleasant surprise.\n\n\nDesign: 88/100 B+\nLike I stated in the Visual aspect of the game, everything is consistently designed, from the characters, to the tools, to the environment, definite thought was taken into account and not just tossed together based on someone's cool concept art.\n\n\nVerdict: 87/100 B+\nTiny and Big is a nice little distraction and a wonderful first game by Black Pants from the choice of music to the art direction. It is another sign that the indie market still has a lot to offer which the AAA market won't risk or toy with. Goofy story telling, basic mechanics and a swagger of being just itself gives it enough of a push to be shared and recommended to all your friends. Yes, it does have some problems, but like with many indie releases, the ideas and games overshadow the flaws, something AAA can't seem to get right, especially when the flaws are so simplistic, makes you wonder how they ever went unnoticed.","August 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a fairly short game with a very unique look and a fairly unique concept.  You have a laser you can use to cut through stone, a grappling hook to drag stone around, and a rocket that you can use to launch anything it attaches to.  And then you have physics.  And that's pretty much it; get to the end of each section using your tools and physics.  It's hilarious how easy it is to get things wrong and get yourself stuck, or smash yourself under a pillar, or miss a jump and fall to your death.  Way more fun than I ever would have guessed.  The game design and graphic style is very unique, and the music is varied and interesting too. There's only 5 real levels and a final boss level (that was kind of annoying), for a game I played for 2-3 hours total, but I could easily go back and try the levels again to go faster, or make fewer cuts, or get all the collectibles. This is the epitome of indie games, unique concept, unique look, and a world that you'll never get from a AAA developer. Definitely worth a look if you like quirky experiences.","December 13, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art style is superb, I never tired of the 3D, comic book-esque, sound effects popping up and the cel shaded graphics works well. The mechanics are unique and solid. You can interact with way more of the environment than necessary to complete the tasks which leads to quite a bit of goofing off, tearing things down and blasting them around. The story actually ends up having a bit of depth once you get through a few slow bits in the middle. Given how this game was developed and published it is unsurprising to see a few issues, like some occasional control bugs, but all the things it does right gloss them over. I can certainly recommend this game but I would caution against buying the soundtrack until you've heard the music.","January 6, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Cutting up stuff with lasers is quite fun and constructing your own walkways and platforms from debris is neat.\n\nHowever once boss fights come into play the entire game falls apart as you're grappling with subpar controls while trying to aim your gadgets and wait ♥♥♥♥, just fell down a pit/gap because nearly everything coming at you does so from above. The idea is good; cut projectiles coming at you! But when the windows for movement and progression are minute it becomes quite frustrating and you begin to rely on finding blind spots where you can carry out your tasks without being pummelled.\n\nTiny & Big is worth a look at, and the first hour is pretty fun to mess about with but I wouldn't go out of your way to get this game. It's incredibly short and finding all of the collectibles is intended for the incredibly patient and/or autistic.","July 18, 2014","false","4.1"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","0"

Big stole your Grandpa's pants, so you have to get them back. Simple right? Well, not quite. Big got a super power from the pants and he wants to destroy the world...\n\nPros:\n-Very unique gameplay, I liked the laser mechanic a lot!\n-Simple graphics which fit the game's atmosphere.\n-Not bad soundtrack.\n-Secret places (I felt like a god, when I found some of these... :DD)\n\nCons:\n-There's some parts in the game that has a cutscene before it. These cutscenes cannot be skipped... I watched one half minute long cutsene at least 10 times because there's a very hard boss fight after it.\n-Sometimes can be very hard, but overall, this game is too easy in my opinion.\n-You can collect "Boring Stones" in the game and I found a place where it's almost impossible to get them... You have to be very lucky to get some of these. So if you want to get 100% of the achevements, then prepare for these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the game, it was really unique and sometimes funny.

Big stole your Grandpa's pants, so you have to get them back. Simple right? Well, not quite. Big got a super power from the pants and he wants to destroy the world...\n\nPros:\n-Very unique gameplay, I liked the laser mechanic a lot!\n-Simple graphics which fit the game's atmosphere.\n-Not bad soundtrack.\n-Secret places (I felt like a god, when I found some of these... :DD)\n\nCons:\n-There's some parts in the game that has a cutscene before it. These cutscenes cannot be skipped... I watched one half minute long cutsene at least 10 times because there's a very hard boss fight after it.\n-Sometimes can be very hard, but overall, this game is too easy in my opinion.\n-You can collect "Boring Stones" in the game and I found a place where it's almost impossible to get them... You have to be very lucky to get some of these. So if you want to get 100% of the achevements, then prepare for these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the game, it was really unique and sometimes funny.

Now about the game itself:\n\nIt's a nifty little physics-based puzzle platform that actually has a really awesome core mechanic: The ability to slice and dice objects and then manipulate them with a grappling hook or a high-powered rocket. It's incredible fun, intuitive, and innovative. The graphics and aesthetics of the game are incredible as well, with tons and tons of work put into to giving the game a non-realistic, but consistent look. It also has a small set  of very interesting indie tracks to go along with the dry visuals of the desert.\n\nHowever there are two somewhat major negatives, one of which has to do with why I said what I said in that very first sentence of this recommendation:\nFirst, the game is very short, two hours is about the average playtime required to beat it if you look around a bit here and there for secrets, and second, I must've seriously missed something, because the "BIG CHARACTER" promised on the Steam store and GreenManGaming pages is not there at all. As much as I don't want to say this, I did not laugh a single time at any of the dialogue and the characters not much more more than text-spouting heads and plot devices.\n\nAll in all, a great little puzzle game to get if you can find a deal on it somewhere as long as you like the overall audio-visual style and don't expect or want Portal-like humor and character.","June 5, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's "translated" from the original German in a way that adds to its ridiculous humour. Explore, destroy/build, collect, battle, repeat. More fun than frustrating.\nWorks great with KB&M, and takes about 3-4 hours to complete - 10 if you want to collect everything.

You cut up stone blocks and pull or push the pieces around to create a path for yourself and get ahead. It's all physics, so it gets pretty messy and there's not really one correct solution. Also you'll fail a lot by making too many wrong cuts,  falling down or getting crushed. The game is short, which is the right length. There's also things you can collect, but that gets frustrating at times so I didn't really bother after a while.","June 4, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No dear reader, they are underpants with mystical powers. What a premise!\n\nIts a really interesting platform game, the concept of creating your own platforms by slciing them to size is a fantastic one. The main flaw is that the controls simply aren't as tight and responsive as they should be, it can lead to some real frustration at times. Particularly in boss battles when there's a lot going on.\n\nNevertheless it is still a really good game, it looks great, has a good sense of humour and is truly different to most other platformers on the market. It isn't without its flaws, is only brief and it has the aforementioned control issues but considering how regularly it's on sale I'd definitley recommend picking it up!\n\nwww.jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk","February 16","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was never really annoyed with being unable to solve the puzzles because I could solve them in any manner than I chose. The games played well on my really not good laptop.

No dear reader, they are underpants with mystical powers. What a premise!\n\nIts a really interesting platform game, the concept of creating your own platforms by slciing them to size is a fantastic one. The main flaw is that the controls simply aren't as tight and responsive as they should be, it can lead to some real frustration at times. Particularly in boss battles when there's a lot going on.\n\nNevertheless it is still a really good game, it looks great, has a good sense of humour and is truly different to most other platformers on the market. It isn't without its flaws, is only brief and it has the aforementioned control issues but considering how regularly it's on sale I'd definitley recommend picking it up!\n\nwww.jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk","February 16","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is right up there with psychonauts, except it's got more focus on puzzle solving.\n\nYou can expect to die a lot on your first time through.   Some people will like this aspect, others won't.   However, it is very typical of platformers.  Fortunately they don't have the archaic lives cap that some games still have.  This the constant dieing less of a problem, and more of a challenge.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game is that it is designed in such a way that there is often more than one way to do things, even though there is usually at least one fairly obvious way.\n\nAnother thing many players will love is the sheer level of collectables and hidden places in the game.   You may get through the game quite qickly on your first run, but it will take a long time to find everything.\n\nThere is a trial mode for perfectionists where you can perfect the level in various ways: speed, rockets used, cuts used, collectables gotten.  This adds significant replay value, and is something more games need.  I find it unfortunate that you have to finish the game to unlock time trial mode.   This is probably the only thing I don't like about the feature.\n\nFor Linux users, the Linux port works excellent, and is a full port of the engine, not a simple wrapper.  It laregely uses Open Source libraries, which many Linux users will find as a plus.\n","October 31, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything about this game is stylish.  The soundtrack is a varied collection of multi-genre tunes from a bunch of bands I've never heard of before which suits the game perfectly, and the overall presentation throughout the game is excellent.  The story is silly, and light (although it gets darker towards the end), but the game still does a nice job of building up to the final confrontation.\n\nFans of platformers and physics games: you are doing yourself a disservice if you have not played this.","July 17, 2013","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The core of the game lies within its unique and satisfying puzzle platformer gameplay, along with an eclectic soundtrack and a hand drawn art style to bring it together for a fun game about cutting rocks and finding your grandpa’s pants. The premise of the game might be strange, but it’s the style that this game oozes that adds to the destruction gameplay in many good ways.\n\nThe story does need some short explanation since looking at it, it does sound very strange. Grandpa’s pants were stolen by a man named Big, and it’s up to Tiny to get the pants back. In addition there is The Radio which acts as Tiny’s sidekick in his adventure to retrieve the pants. It’s a simple story, and the game tells the story using cutscenes and dialog boxes. There is quite a lot of small dialogue in the game which tends to add to the humorous nature of the story, ranging from the main dialogue of the story to shorter lines for finding some of the secrets in the world. Tiny and Big does the humor in a good way with some funny situations and lines between the characters, and of course has the strange story as the vehicle for the comedy.\n\nTiny and Big is a third person physics puzzle platformer, but with a focus on destructing the environment to navigate to the end of each level. Tiny has at his disposal a laser, a grappling rope, and attachable rockets in his set of tools. The grappling rope allows for pulling objects and the rockets allow pushing debris out of the way. Tiny can also push any object by walking into them with more control than the other methods. The laser is the most interesting and exciting part of the game, since it allows cutting of objects with any angle. Cutting things is seamless, all it takes is the length and angle and the game presents the cut object complete with physics. It’s a marvel at how seamless the cutting process is and the robust physics engine is with the cut objects. After a while, cutting becomes intuitive with choosing how to slice things to get across a gap along with using the other tools to position objects into place. The levels in Tiny and Big are quite linear, using the physics puzzles as ways to navigate over gaps and obstacles. The general platforming is not the most robust however. It can be tricky to judge how far a jump can go, and there are times when walking up a slope and moving forward, you actually move to the side and might fall off. Still, these are minor with the amount of checkpoints and the relatively short and linear levels. Of note, the game does have many achievements and secrets, so it does encourage exploration and might make the game longer than 3-4 hours if you do some exploration. Overall, the rock cutting gameplay is fantastic, with the simple levels and straightforward platforming encouraging a good use of the physics puzzles.\n\nWhile the game does excel at the unique physics gameplay, it also has some great style too. The game is presented in 3D for the physics engine to do its work, but the art style is something different. The textures look hand drawn and cartoony, which matches the somewhat strange story perfectly. Some sound effects are accompanied by visual text, much like a comic book. It’s quite a different style from most games, but the hand drawn cartoony textures works great for the story and adds to it in good ways.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is excellent, as it also acts a great fit for this game. The music is comprised of songs by several indie bands and wasn’t made for Tiny and Big, but boy do the songs sound great. Most of the songs are some funky beats, so trying to cut apart the landscape is more interesting with it. Again, the overall music style does fit nicely with the story, so it’s a nice touch and makes for a good listen.\n\nTiny and Big places some fun physics puzzle platforming with the ability to cut rocks in any shape and angle you want, and it also has some great style and story for a fun experience. Most of the game is cutting rocks and using physics to get to the end of the level which is immensely fun, but the art, music, and story also plays a role in making a unique experience. With some pretty simple and straightforward levels and mechanics, Tiny and Big puts fun physics gameplay along with strange story and style for a solid game about rocks and pants.","March 13","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

You are "Tiny" and fight your way through puzzles and boss fights with a laser, a pulling hook and a rocket launcher.\n\nPros:\nGreat music.\nGreat graphics for an indie game.\nYou can cut down almost anything!\nIt's humoristic.\nRewarding as for achievements.\nYou can go really crazy cutting-pulling-pushing the whole map (inside map's boundaries ofc)\n\nCons:\nI give a "thumb down" for the character's movement. Until you get used to it, you gotta die many times. The negative spots i found, is when you have to run/walk near edges, it becomes kinda unpredictable the result of you intention. And after that just a small detail, that bad physics on jumping. Gravity acceleration is to sudden, pulling you down.\n\nOverall it is a game I recommend for anyone who wants to have fun. Really enjoyable and you'll remember these words once you spend some time playing it.\n\nPrice is just fair, if you got spare money to buy a game.

For reference the actually jumping physics feels a bit like Psychonauts. The games aren't similar but if you enjoyed the platforming in Psychonauts minus the double jump then you'll probably get along fine with this title as well. I enjoyed myself but the game is only around 2.5 hours long. Whether or not that's worth $10 is up to you, but for what it's worth I recommend it.\n\nThree out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )","December 25, 2013","true","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

While the game is pretty short there are many secrets to find such as several hidden temples and extra levals. I never hit any bugs, but i did get fustrated because there is one part where big hovers a giant boulder over your head and just drops it. Gameplay wise i would say it does a good job of being a physics game, not so much on the parkour bit though. You can tell this game is trying to be hard core parkour, but when you can pull down a support beam and use it as a make shift bridge, there isn't much parkour. The art style is actually kind of simple but when a physics game is based off getting a pair of pants, a simple art style is for the best. The only thing that bothered me is the goal, you are after a pair of "pants" but it is underware. It's almost like black pants had a miscomunication with it's dialoug team. Other than that i have no problems with the game, so on my end i give a 10/10.","June 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But once you start to play it, it reveals its greatness.\n\nThe game follows a weird-looking "Tiny" and his attempt to retrieve his grandpa's underpants that a similarly weird-looking "Big" has stolen.\n\nThe basic premise in this game is that Tiny is an inventor, and you use his odd little gadgets to help you through the game. Included inventions are A Radio that talks, A laser that can cut rocks, a grappling gun to pull said rocks, and a rocket gun that can push those rocks.\n\nThe simulation behind the destructible environment is very good. The game can handle just about any cut you throw at the destructible rocks, and disintegrates any cut rock that is irrelevant to simulate.\nThis game can be controlled with a controller, or a keyboard and mouse. Both work, but I find that the mouse offers more precision.\n\nThe way the levels are designed is very good, offering pretty large areas to explore, and subsequently cut apart and destroy. It really does a good job of making the place look like an old civilization.\n\nThe cartooney cell-type shaded graphics in this game are very nice, and the textures applied to the environment are likewise good at portraying an abandoned desert. I do find that the textures applied to character models are a bit odd though.\n\nThe sounds in this game are great, both from the environment itself and the weird sounds the characters make instead of speaking. That goes well with the speech bubbles.\n\nThe great thing about this game is that the physics, sounds and look of the rocks make it so incredibly satisfying to just cut up the massive rock structures and enjoy them falling apart.\n\nMy only major complaint is that it is far too easy to die in this game by running into a rock that is moving. The devs should really have raised the limit of how much force is needed to kill the player, in my mind.\n\nOverall, this is a gem of a game that I don't think has enough attention. Styled like a playable comic book, with a great gameplay experience, it is definitely worth a play.\n","December 20, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There any many problems which keep this game from a higher score. The good involves an interesting and inventive mechanic and usually good physics system. The bads involve many things. The platforming is pooly done as the jumping doesn't feel right because right when your guy gets in the air he starts falling at a disproportionate rate for some reason. This makes jumping annoying and hard to judge. The physics can sometimes be wonky as I have pulled something and then it goes flying away for a reason. The game has a lot of trial and error/luck. You cut a block and for some reason it doesn't fall the way you want to, so you start the point over and keep trying till it does. The cutting mechanics usually work well but some things like cutting out an overhead block make no sense, as you can cut it in half length-wise and it won't fall down to you, you have to cut it vertically too for some reason. The game is pretty short as well. The story is basically non-existant as you have to get pants from some guy, and that is literally it. The game likes to make jokes about pants/underpants and it gets old after the first 5 min but they keep going which it, which just makes it more annoying and less funny, if that was even possible. The final boss was the most poorly done. You couldn't cut a block right in front of you, for no apparent reason. Also, the blue indicator which shows you can cut something no longer works when cutting the blocks he throws at you. I spent 10 min trying to cut blocks that should have worked but the game mechanics couldn't support me doing the right thing, and you have to keep starting from the beginning. One of the worst boss fights I can remember because it is soo poorly done. It is fun in the game improving and making your own way to get to somewhere, if only mechanics and things were done better. Stupid steam recommendation system ruins this because this game is in the middle and deserves neither but I must give one. 6.5/10.","January 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The key mechanic in the world is that (almost) everything is destructible, allowing the player to shape his own paths to victory.\n\nThe player takes the role of Tiny, who is chasing the antagonist Big to reclaim a pair of legendary undergarments. Armed with only a machine known as "The Tool," Tiny must climb towers and spelunk into ruins on his journey.\n\nGameplayUnlike other platformers, the game is neither reflex- nor combat-based. Instead, you use a laser, grappling hook, and rocket to shape the 3D world and create new passages. Nearly everything in the game can be cut and reshaped, giving the player lots of freedom to destroy and rearrange the world to suit his needs. As such, there is seldom ever one way to beat the puzzles in this game.\n\nHowever, although it is very well executed, Tiny & Big does suffer from a lack of content. Since the game relies so heavily on its game engine, it features only five levels (and the final boss). The overall difficulty is fairly low, so don't expect a challenge. However, there are tons of hidden collectibles and achievements that extend the game time for several hours.\n\nAudiovisualsSoundtrack is A+. Visuals are unique and have this adorable comic book style to them, including copious amounts of funny hovering onomatopoeia.\n\nVerdictI really liked this game. I think it's definitely worth a buy if you're into puzzle platformers, especially if you are interested in exploration games too..","December 8, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tiny and Big has a good visual style going for it and some nice ambient music, and the environmental destruction mechanic is great. Unfortunately, out of the 6 short levels in the game, only one actually comes close to reaching that mechanic's full potential of letting you find bizarre solutions with haphazard cuts to huge, towering walls and rocks. All the other levels are more about being delicate or making very few cuts in very precise places. The game is just too reserved for its destruction mechanic, and with only one level in an already short game taking advantage of it, it's not worth paying full price.

On paper it would sound great but games are not played on paper. The game also serves as a good example as to why publishers can be a good thing. I think that with additional play testing and someone higher up to reign in the focus a little, Tiny & Big could have been another entry into the growing list of awesome indie games. As is, it's a game with solid base but one that fails to do anything with it. Likewise, this game is like any other 3D puzzle platformer. The graphics are pretty cool, but that's not what most people play games for. The puzzles are repetitive and dull, and don't ever seem to use Tiny's arsenal to its full extent. The controls are awkward and almost broken, and it is riddled with glitches. All in all I bought it on sale for 99 cents instead of $9.99. In my situation, it would be good money spent, but certainly the game is not worth $9.99 keeping in mind the game's short length, Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers.","June 18, 2014","false","2.0"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

All three are used to manipulate the stony environment that you jump, push, pull and roam around in. This game is essentially a platformer where you create and modify the platforms. While this idea in itself is enough to keep me interested, it’s the game’s style which really captivated me. Tiny and Big is a 3D, third-person platformer with a simple and slightly under-developed cell-shaded graphical style. And by simple and under-developed, I don’t mean anything negative as it only adds to the graphical style of the game. Like no-one having noses… odd. Even the menu displays look like they’ve been sketched.\n\nDo you know what’s more irritating than a game that keeps crashing? A good game that keeps crashing. I am very much in two minds about my time spent playing this game. While I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I played, when the game crashes every 20 of those moments, you’re left with nothing but bitterness and anger in your heart. I tried re-installing, trouble-shooting and Google-ing, though to no avail.\n\nI can cautiously recommend it.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2013/11/29/tiny-and-big-grandpas-leftovers/","January 4, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're given access to all your tools immediately, meaning there's no character progression in sight, but the mechanics are solid and fun to use. Level design offers a bit of exploration and is done so in a way that you progress through levels naturally and will rarely find yourself lost. You're getting about 3-4 hours of gameplay from the story, and the only other content is user created. Despite this, I find myself recommending this game, simply because it was fun to play and a good way to spend 3-4 hours of your free time.","March 10, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are like me than you love physics in video games. And not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics like in Goat Simulator which are just down right awful which I will probably write a review about soon. Anyway back to Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. You play as Tiny who is assisted by his radio. Through the game you use a plethora of different tools to help you enjoy the physics that this game offers. The gameplay is outstanding! The tools are fun to use and my only complaint is that the jumping felt a little awkward for me but that is just my opinion. The graphics are great for it's cartoony style. The levels are fun with different ways to beat each one. Overall I give this game my approval and I hope that if you come to this review wondering if it is worth your money I say yes. These devs deserve every penny this game makes!","July 3, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/recommended/205910/","rabcor","Easter Bunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/","382 products in account","This game is beyond awesome, I almost regret buying it on sale for 1$ because I'd value it at 15$ (same as soundtrack edition costs, which is what you should be buying as the soundtrack in this game rules!) if it was a bit longer, I'd value it a lot higher than that.\n\nI played it on (Arch) Linux, it took me 3 hours to finish, and it ran flawlessly from start to finish, It also supported X360 controller just fine on there. I'd say the game's length is going to be roughly 2 hours if you rush through it, 3 hours if you fool around and enjoy it a bit like I did, and even more if you actually bother looking for the secrets and easter eggs which I very much missed out on in my first playthrough.\n\nThe game is highly replayable as there are many ways to solve most of the puzzles, and a lot of secret areas. The game can also be modded and custom levels can be made (although sadly no workshop support for that content) but most important of all, this game is fun.\n\nIt was probably the most fun 3 hours i've spent for a number of years, the graphics were (intentionally) really cartoony, and the gameplay was a lot like one of those 3D puzzle games in their early days (I'm thinking Gex: Enter The Gecko) and as a result, I was taken back a good solid 15 years to back when I was a child and playing video games for the first time ever. It brought me a lot of joy.\n\nIt is worth noting the game is also child-friendly as the most questionable part of it is a small piece of the world lore narrated through wall paintings late in the game, and basic slapstick/cartoon violence.\n\nThis game is like a breath of fresh air, it is funny, it is fun, and it is cool, for a hands down rating:\n\nStory 9/10 (Really original and fairly unpredictable too)\n\nGameplay 9/10 (It was a 3D Puzzle game with a physics simulation that allows you to create your own paths through puzzles by cutting objects down and moving them around, almost every object in the game could be cut)\n\nGraphics 8/10 (The environment delivered the intended effect, the shortcoming of graphics which dropped it a bit was the character textures and how simple the textures of everything else was, models were also simple but that was a necessity in a low budget indie game like this with the gameplay mechanics. I can say though that one thing I loved about the game is that it has no UI/HUD, all it has is a crosshair to help you aim which is all you really need, it creates a nice immersive feeling not to worry about health bars or ammo or anything, the text messages that followed up with sound effects when objects smashed into each other was also really cool in my opinion.)\n\nSoundtrack 10/10 (Hands down the best soundtrack (system) in any video game ever, it was an intergrated part of the gameplay, you would unlock new music tracks by picking up audio tapes and then you could switch between them whenever you wanted with just the press of a button, there were several music tracks fitting like a glove on each of the environments the game offers and if by any case you didn't like a track, you would just change to the next one! Apart from how the system handled soundtrack, the music itself was awesome and personally for me good enough to listen to outside of the game even, you can use the two trailers as examples, I'm a fairly harsh critique when it comes to music too, so me endorsing a games soundtrack this much is extremely rare, the only other game I can think of I would ever score this high is The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind)\n\nControls 6/10 (This is the games weakest point, the game is very well playable on a keyboard and mouse, but aiming the laser is sometimes a little bit annoying and unintuitive, especially since it is limited to the field of view of your camera, and playing it with a controller just didn't work very well for me at all, I couldn't aim for ♥♥♥♥ with the controller which was the main issue on there (using the right analogue stick, but maybe it's just cus I suck with analogue sticks, there's also no auto-aim.) but I also noticed it was a lot harder to control my character with the analogue stick than with the keyboard, using the D-Pad works great though!)\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nThis game is a Masterpiece!\n\nThis would've been 9.5 out of 10 if the game had been just about twice as long as it was, but like I mentioned, it can be modded and players can share new levels with each other which I imagine would be really cool! if only it was more popular and had a few dedicated modders, this would go a long way.\n\nReally great game, it surprised me a lot how good it was, I did not expect this! And the game ran like a well oiled machine without a hiccup on Linux which is more than can be said for most ports!","July 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If your an indie gamer supporter and are wondering if this game is good Well here is what I think.\n\nFirst of all for a Indie Game this game is amazing to look at. Everything from the actual character models to the backgrounds to even seeing stuff in the distance is pretty awesome. The Game uses Celshaded visuals much like games such as No More Heroes, Legend of Zelda Windwaker, and Borderlands 2.\n\nMovement is solid whether your using Keyboard & Mouse or using a Controller and feels spot on. Jumping, Using your hook,  & rockets  are very simplified. You can take all the time you need as you start off in tutorials which the game very easily walks you through to get a feel of the game.\n\nThe Story is you are The Loser Tiny chasing after your nemesis & Thief Big who stole your Under pants and finds that they have Hidden Powers. (No do not go putting your Under Pants IRL on your head cause they dont have any of this kind of Power sadly D:)\n\nThe worlds are all very big and vast and you can practically do anything you wish in the game. You can roam around and look for boring stones or you can go use your rockets or hook to pull on blocks that you cut with your laser. The Entire area you roam around in Can be cut and used to help you. (up to about 95% of everything your near Minus certain parts.)\nYou can cut portions, flip them with your rockets & move across them to get across other areas to reach your destinations. When using the Laser in this game I felt it copied exactly the percision that was used in games like Okami on the Playstation 2 literally perfect control which i give a great big Thumbs up to the developer.\n\nWhile I'm only a few hours in the game I'm loving every second of it. For such a small price the developer is asking you would literally be a fool not to give this game a chance. Its made by a caring developer who really I believe wanted to make the game while something very random it was also something amazing all at the same time.\n\nDefinite Buy from me and I hope I have persuaded you as well to give this game a purchase.","June 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenJellyHome/recommended/205910/","GreenJellyHome","GreenJelly MIC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenJellyHome/","570 products in account","I spent an hour in this game getting to the door at what I thought was the exit of level 1.  After getting to the door, I found that it went out of the map and into nothing.  It was never finished and I ended up dying.  Turns out I was in a secrete room, and I got to a place your probably not suppose to be.  This is disapointing, as it is clearly accessable to thoose that try.  Wasted opportunity.\n\nI then got to the real exit, and when I started cutting the puzzle I found my patience completely gone.  The Puzzle was frustrating as the reason I can't do it in the required 90 seconds has more too do with the poor design of the game and its inability to allow you to cut things even when you line it right.  I just don't want too be judged by the developers lack of completion.\n\nThe game is nifty, allot like portal.  Its a physics game where you have to get Grandpa's Underwear. Wow, sounds like they where making a joke with the games objective.  Its not funny, but it does achieve the feeling that your wasting your time.  You have a grappling hook, a deployable rocket pusher, and a cutting laser.  You can cut certain things, but not everything.  The laser cuts in angles.  There seems to be allot to do, and lots to explore.  There are hidden places and achievements.  If things fall on you, you die.  If you fall, you die.\n\nIt starts out in a simulation that has a green filter in it.  After a few simulations, you get to level 1 which is in full color.  Thats when the "fun" starts.  Its interesting, but there are things like the puzzle at the end of level 1 only beign on the wall, and if you don't notice it you will get frustrated wondering why they only show you the solution for a split second.\n\nIts sad, the game could of been fun, but instead is unfinished and frustrating.  Its plagued with design and story challenges and it really makes you question why your wasting your time in it.  So I can not recommend it.  I am sorry, I usually play games for 10+ hours, but so far I am only left frustrated. :(","March 9","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely a great game first time around. Took me about 2 hours to finish the game without collecting much of the hiddem items and music tapes etc. Not sure how much it would've added to complete levels "perfectly" but I felt that it would've been too booring task for me. The gimmick of cutting rocks with lazers making your own path feels great but I feel that after my initial playthrough it already wore thin.  Controls are a bit clunky which sometimes make you miss a jump but overral decent enough. Graphics wise the game looks a bit like Borderlands, cell-shaded and it suits the game. Music is a matter of taste and I didn't like it, way too apathetic for me. There is also this layer of humor in there as you are on a quest to get back your grandpa's leftovers, aka magical underpants that grant superpowers. This also felt like thin excuse of a story and I couldn't be bothered with it. Tried to start my second playthrough to gather the items I skipped the first time but it didn't hold much replay value for me.

Finished this game in 4 hours. I didn't get too many achievements, but that's ok, because I'm just glad to be finished playing through the story. While I will give the creators an A+ for effort in coming up with a decent physics sandbox and a tool set to play with (rocket launcher, grappling hook and laser beam), the rest of the game is full of fail.\n\n1. The story line is non-existent, save for one meaningful cutscene. Dialogue, which would have been fairly humorous if they had used voice actors, is meh because the characters just squeak at eachother while you read speech bubbles.\n\n2. The controls, physics and surfaces are all tempremental. You can walk back and forth on a plank a handful of times, but then suddenly the next time you walk on it, you fall through it. Not off, *through.* Sometimes the laser freezes the object in mid air so you can cut it, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes that beam you just cut falls perfectly and lands right where you want it, sometimes it bounces, spins out of control and kills you for your trouble. So frustrating...\n\n3. The game is criminally short for $10 dollars. Particularly in light of the fact there is no real plot moving you forward.\n\n4. I bought the sound track along with the game for an additional $5 dollars. Sadly, about a third of the music is amusing and catchy, the rest is "meh" at best and elevator music at worst.\n\n5. Achievements are basically grind quests... use this item 1000 times, or collect 1000 of these boring rocks (a quest for boring rocks? I bet that will hold the player's attention...).\n\n6. I get that the art is supposed to be weird and unique. I get that we're in a desert. But the color palette was really bland and the lack of contrast sometimes made it difficult to gauge distances, depth or to distinguish cuttable surfaces from non-cuttable.\n\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. If at some point it goes on sale for $1, then sure, pick it up. But until then, you're better off buying a better physics sandbox like Garry's Mod.\n\nAgain, I will give kudos to the creators for the level of freedom (or total absence of direction?) when it comes to solving the puzzles and navigating the environment in the game. With the tools at your disposal you can theoretically shape the environment to your will. In practice, however, what surfaces are cuttable, the effectiveness of your rocket launcher and grappling hook on moving things in the environment, and your ability to slide and stack stones without getting snagged on something in the environment is somewhat arbitrary.","December 10, 2014","false","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Movement is jerky and inconsistent, which doesnt gel with having to pull off well-timed jumps or navigate along, very often, very narrow bridges and ledges.\nThen we come to the cutting mechanic which, while fun, is not intuative to control, at all. This makes it often frustrating when a misplaced cut can mean having to reload to the last checkpoint.\nIt also means that when the game puts you under preasure, forcing you to line up and perform cuts very quickly, you will die. A lot. Having a very cumbersome, slow and counter-intuative aiming mechanic does not partner well with having only a couple of precious seconds to aim, line up and cut a giant rock that's flying at your head.\n\nAnd then there's the problem with using physics to place your platforms. When you cut down a pillar to make a bridge, because of the physics, it often won't make a bridge. It'll tumble down that gaping crevasse you were trying to cross. Also, if you're the type of gamer who wants to get every last collectable, you will watch them tumbling down that crevasse, even if the bridge lands properly, because they too, have physics, and will bounce and roll straight into the abyss.\n\nThe soundtrack, though, is truly awesome, but I wouldn't reccomend this game unless you are very patient, or a masochist.","February 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"

The story was charming, the graphics were nice, the soundtrack was superb and the physics were AWESOME... But why the hell did they have to make this another puzzle/platformer? The best parts were by far when you had a massive world to explore and collect all of the objects, but instead they focused on the imprecise physics engine. It just wasn't mechanically functional enough to do the twitch aiming, pixel-perfect jumping and very specific object manipulation required to beat the game. This comes to a head during the incredibly painful final boss. Prepare to die countless times through no fault of your own. This also reveals how incredibly awful the checkpoint system is.

Sure, the game mechanics are a neat little experiment that was done pretty successfully, but there are other personal problems I have with this game.\n\n-For a start, this game is weird and somewhat clunky with a gamepad. Odd, considering this is a platformer where a gamepad would be perfect, but nope, mouse and keyboard works confusingly better. Not so much of a complaint but more of a nitpick.\n\n-Jumping is super weird. I kept on dying on the god damn tutorial because either the game is incredibly picky on where and when you should land or the camera decides to be a bee-atch when you most need it (like with most games in this genre, so I can give it a bit of a pass).\n\n-The gameplay, while innovative (I guess), got boring at a quick hiccup. Playing this seems like a chore rather than being fun.\n\n-The game has this somewhat irritating hipster attitude that kept on reminding you that this is a indie game, with indie music, and a indie story that is far more "wacky" and "random" than any other tripe-A game.\n\n-Speaking of music, this game's "oh-so-important" music is actually quite lame. Nevermind the fact that the game outright gives you a radio just for the music itself. As a video game music enthusiast, this one's soundtracks I did not even bother getting.\n\nSo whatever, I don't like the game. 4/10.

So many cutting puzzles and pretty terrible boss fights! Cut your way up to the top of a pyramid! Then cut your way down all the way to the bottom of the pyramid! Woo hoo! Now fight this boss, the same guy who keeps chucking rocks at you and ruining all the sandbox fun you're having cutting buildings in half to make ramps up towards the top of the pyramid! And on top of that, not so good checkpointing!\n\nI'm actually kind of sad that this game was ruined because the antagonist is too much of a ♥♥♥♥ who celebrates me making progress by dropping a ton of bricks onto my head while I'm trying to make that perfect cut.

I paid $1 on sale and it wasn't really worth it.\nI was not a fan of the ambient music, which plays as a radio station type deal, except for a few select tracks.\nThere are some limits on the number of cuts you can use per level that getting under gets you an achievement or something. I personally just used tons and tons of cuts on each level. Most of the rocks in the world can be cut so why not cut them.\nMy biggest complaint is that the game is extremely boring. There is hardly any sense of discovery. The rock cutting mechanic gets pretty stale. I found myself using the grapple a  lot but the rocket almost never except when it was required to advance.\nThe control is pretty bad too. You'll notice in the first couple seconds of moving around in the game that the movement is extremely stiff for some reason and Tiny's jump is terrible. Sometimes the most difficult thing was just walking around, trying not to fall off, die, and have any collectibles you got since you passed a checkpoint return to their original positions.","June 19, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The game is only fun if your goal is to get to the first large area, and seeing what you can phase through a wall, without the game's camera, and clunky controlls making you walk off a cliff and respawning 20 min back.","February 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

That is until the BOSS FIGHTS start in the last third of this about two hour long game. From here the game descends to a extremely frustrating trial and error dodge run and jumping puzzles, in a low light environment, that you you repeat over and over to find that one solution, while giant rock blocks are raining down on you. All the freestyle puzzles are thrown out of the window.  This and the fact that game mechanics do not really support that kind of dodge run, while shoot blocks out of the sky, totally ruined  the great impression of the first 2 thirds. I finally did not care enough to finish this game.\n\nAnd 'teh fanbois' obviously started hating this review.","November 23, 2014","false","6.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The concept was there, but the game wasn't. I have about 2 hours in the game, and I beat it pretty easily. Once you get the hang of the game, most of it is pretty straight forward and simple. However, the controls are weak and clunky. Half the time  you freeze blocks in the air as you click on them to make a line to cut them, and the other half of the time the block freezes after the cut starts. This randomness of the gameplay causes unessisary deaths at the hands of thrown rocks.\n\nThe game was somewhat comical, but I've played much funnier games that used this silly, almost dry, humor. I was sorely disappointed in the fact that it was so short. As much fun as the concept is, I'm regretting putting money down for this game.

The physics are pretty glitchy as well and the controls not very precise, so be prepared for a few frustrating/unavoidable deaths.\nNew levels don't add any new gameplay elements, and the graphics (which are not great looking) aren't varied either, adding to the feeling that all levels are pretty much the same.

Well, that title is half-right.\n\nI'd probably replace "Big" with "Mediocre", though!\n\nTiny and Big is a game that has a lot of good ideas, a really solid engine with some great physics functions and not much else. The gameplay ranges from mildly enjoyable to downright repetitive and quickly grows old. Luckily, it doesn't have much time to stay boring because it ends after a mere two and a half hours.\nThe story is nonsensical, full of exposition, and bland while the characters are bland and not well fleshed out. That doesn't really matter, though, because by the time you've decided which of the three main characters you hate more, it's over.\n\nThe writing is awful and full of spelling mistakes and the graphics are one of the few redeeming qualities of this game. The game itself breaks often, leaving you stuck post-checkpoint with no option but to restart the level. The "boss fight(s)" is repeated two or three times identically and only really gets enjoyable the last time... and then ends.\n\nI paid $2.50 for this and it (just barely) managed to make my $1/hour ratio. I would not advise paying more than $2.50 for this game, as I feel I pretty much wasted my time with this game overall.\n\nIf they had fleshed it out, gave it better pacing, and ditched the story entirely, it could have been great.\n4.5/10","December 5, 2012","false","3.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","5"

The physics system isn't always perfect but there's something immensely satisfying about being able to manipulate the geography around you to achieve new heights. It's nice to do out of the box manoevers and actually finding it lead to a super secret room or an easter egg. Boss fights perhaps more tedious than fun but fortunately not a huge part of the game at all. The first level alone could take you a long time to find everything tucked away.

It often felt like the controls were a little off.  You would walk straight but it seemed like your character (even on level ground) seemed to want to go either left or right.  This, in a 3D platformer, is very awkward and led to several untimely deaths.  The game was pretty short, but don't let that fool you, it was also extremely entertaining.  I loved using the tools to rip apart the structures to use as bridges, ramps, etc.  That said, there was a lot of "planned" maneuvers.  You would enter a room, or situation, and there would be only one way to solve it.  Didn't leave much for creativity.  Not all of the game was like that though, there were many areas (like the bridge) where you could easily improvize your own method of defeating the challenge.  This, at least, gives you a little replayability in seeing if you could improve on the time it takes you to beat the game.  Tiny and Big is a bunch of good with just a little bit of bad.  Scaled, I'd give it a 7/10 with it loosing points for the shortness of the game and the drifting controls.","June 7, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the ridiculous plot. If you can ignore the immaturity of the storyline, you're in for a real treat.\n\nThe game mechanics are surprising; the innovation in the cutting and pulling concept caught me as almost Portal-esque. Being able to slice through the environment, and manipulate it as smoothly as this game allows is a wonderfully fun experience. The art style is superb, and more than makes up for the lower graphics. Lower graphics are completely fine by me anyway, given the gameplay. The soundtrack is unique, nothing super noteworthy but not bad either.\n\nMuch of my praise for this game apart from the unique gameplay concept is the amount of love that went into all of the hidden secrets. Cheers to Black Pants Game Studio. If you are one of those people who likes to wander into random, dark corners of the world to hunt for easter eggs, you will like this game. The in-game text even jokes with you at points for wandering into such a corner. The main storyline (apart from the actual plot) is pleasant as well. I would bet that even if you were to run straight through the game, you'd be pleased with the environments.\n\nUltimately, I was quite surprised with this game. It cost me about $2.50 on sale, but I would gladly pay much more having experienced it. This is basically the game I would make if I could make games.\n\nIf you can grab it for this price and you've liked what I've mentioned, you can't really go wrong picking this up.\nDon't be another boring rock.","December 31, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It told a story(As goofy as it may be) it has some AMAZINGLY fun game play mechanics behind it and the way the game looks is just perfect for the style of game it is.\n\nNow with that said, I have to point out that the level design is so muddled at times, I find myself unable to figure out which way to go and just end up building a bridge out of walls or boulders to get to new areas. Even when following "the boring stones" I still managed to lose my placing or just destroy my path entirely. But I suppose that's my fault, cutting everything I see in half just so I can stand atop it like a elvish king of pants.\n\nMaybe it is worth the price tag... Had fun [Check]...

Well, I installed it, gave it a try, and I must say it is a strange game but quite amusing.\nIn the game, you play as Tiny, chasing a guy named Big. The basic premise of the game is to get from one area to the next, and the main way to do that is with a cutting laser. You basically carve your way through the terrain and hack up large rocks and ancient ruins, while trying to get your 'pants' (read 'underwear') back from Big. Or were they your Grandpa's pants? Doesn't really matter.\nThis game is fun, and very different. Have a look at the videos in the store and decide if the game is for you. I didn't pay for it directly, so I'm not sure if I would pay the $10 for it, I never had to consider if I wanted to buy the game or not.

The sound and visual design to the game is decent enough to not make me sick after a couple hours, and (for the most part) the objectives and puzzles aren't monotonous.\nAside from these, the foreign design is quite obvious by the gradually apparent mistranslations, the game gets very repetitive towards the end, and it's hardly worth a few hours of gameplay.

It was a fairly new approach to the usual physics-based puzzle genre, and with the price from the sale how could I refuse?\n\nThe game has great bits. You play as the main character named Tiny, whom inherited apparently some pants (underwear) from his grandpa. Sadly, his brother/cousin/related person Big had stolen them, and fleed to a desert with something about qualms for it's ancient power.\n\nThe game puzzles work entirely off of physics, and as such utilize a device pack that Tiny has. With it, you can cut, grapple, and rocket anything you please to complete puzzles. The music is pretty nice too, with the ability to switch BGM's with N and collect more in the game. There are a multitude of ways to complete a single puzzle usually for the more creative.\n\nLIke a great side though, the game also has a bit of a downside or two. For one, the game is short. 6 stages to be exact (Excluding tutorial level), though fun all the way. The game also has a habit of not notifying you if you messed up a puzzle, for those puzzles that are more of a one-solution rather then a multiple.\n\nIf you find it inteesting, download the demo. It gives enough to work with to get a feel for how the laser tools work. Like it? Then buy it, it's only like...6 bucks right now isn't it? Maybe 3?","July 18, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I prefer games that aren’t super long (maybe because I have tons of games waiting for a play through) and this had a nice length. Played it through in one session, took about 2-3 hours but then I half rushed through it and didn’t care to search for all collectables in each stage.

Well, I installed it, gave it a try, and I must say it is a strange game but quite amusing.\nIn the game, you play as Tiny, chasing a guy named Big. The basic premise of the game is to get from one area to the next, and the main way to do that is with a cutting laser. You basically carve your way through the terrain and hack up large rocks and ancient ruins, while trying to get your 'pants' (read 'underwear') back from Big. Or were they your Grandpa's pants? Doesn't really matter.\nThis game is fun, and very different. Have a look at the videos in the store and decide if the game is for you. I didn't pay for it directly, so I'm not sure if I would pay the $10 for it, I never had to consider if I wanted to buy the game or not.

If you are the kind of human who complains about games being short, make sure you are getting this in a sale.\n\nThat said, I had a lot of fun with this game. The graphics style is unique and interesting, the dialogue is witty and charming, but the strongest point of the game are the tools that are at the games core. This is a first game that I am aware of, that gives you a tool to cut up 3d blocks in realtime. You can also interact with most of the environment and basically destroy most of the level that way.\n\nCut up, pull or push blocks as you are trying to cross over multiple beautiful levels in this game while following a quite silly story of the game. You are on a quest of retrieving the pants that your grandfather left you as a heritage. Sadly your big brother stole them and run off to some desert.\n\nLook, the game is weird, but that's what's great about it. I totally recommend it for a short fun experience. I hope the developers do more with the technology they have at their hands.","December 28, 2013","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can cut, push, and pull your way through the world. I see some players had a lot of issues with this game, which I didn't... not until, of course, the very end of the game, when it became the most frustrating.\n\nIf you're familiar with platformers and puzzles, you can glance around you and see what you have to do. There's secret casettes to find, and you can change the song playing, which is neat. There's a few boss encounters as well. Everything went over for me without a hitch, until the very end, when suddenly there was a lot of lag and glitching.\n\nBecause you cut your own levels, sometimes you can get stuck somewhere in the worst way possible, and you will seriously have to kill yourself by cutting a slice of rock and pulling it down onto your own head so you can start over. You can also cut so many pieces that the game doesn't seem to know what to do with its own physics anymore.\n\nOther than that, I really did love the art, the characters, the music, and the feel of the game. It was silly and serious at the same time. It was a fresh perspective on platformers. It was fun to build my way to get to the secret rooms.\n\nOh, and the radio you carry has an attitude.\n\nI would recommend giving this game a try. I think it's pretty appropriate for anyone 12 and up. I think I recall a bit of light swearing, but because I can't entirely remember, there mustn't have been much of anything.","December 29, 2013","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Making my own way through the levels was interesting (extra so in later levels) and I found myself just wondering around sometimes looking to see what else I could cut and where else I could go, but if I had paid full price for this then I might have been very upset.\n\nFor the current set price, no, I can not honestly recommend this. There isn't enough to keep me busy for $10. There just isn't. The game is short. The story is a bit nonsensical (though amusing and will keep you entertained while you play). The game mechanics are great, though Tiny's movement controls did sometimes seem a little weak (at least when compared to others in the genre).

This game puts you in the feet of Tiny - a person who inherited a pair of underwear that give ultimate power! But, those pants were stolen by Big - Tiny's brother. The main goal of the game is for you to get those pants back from Big, which never happens. I wont spoil the ending for you. The game is very much worth the 10 euros ( AKA the 0.99 I paid for it during sale ). The game provides you with a cutting tool, a pulling tool and a pushing rocket. The rocket is mostly useless, but it does come in handy sometimes. In the background, you discover the story of little black animals that live in the desert, it is sad and a little bit disturbing, but it makes the game more interesting. The only downside is the time it takes to complete it. There is no multiplayer mode, no coop, no minigames. It took me 2 hours to complete the game and so did my friends.

Probably one of my favorite platformers since psychonauts. innovative game play makes the game feel more intense with what possibilities are available to get around a map. its a little rough around the edges but it adds to its quirky charm.\nthere is a sense or replayability to the levels since you can complete some defined goals of only cutting things a certain amount of times, pick up all of the rocks and find all the music and game machines. the music in this game is awesome but i wish there was more. a little over 4 hours to beat and i wasnt going fast at all but taking my time to goof around. im hoping a sequel is about to come in the future.\n7-8/10 for me.","September 24, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is as unique as it is interesting, and it's a welcome break from other serious storylines.

The game itself reminds me of them goofy THQ Spongebob platformers when it came to the atmosphere and the characters you come across is well, the Main Character, A Radio that talks to you and mostly gives you the tutorial advice and the Over the Top Jerk that mostly stole your pants and basically leaving you to battle him to get them back.\n\nThe Level designs for this game are nice to look at and leaving you to sometimes retrace your steps when trying to find the right path to your journey. The 3 tools you get to have in this game are a Laser tool that is usually one of the most used to help cut things down so it can be used to your advantage to get to Point A to Point B. Next would be a Grappling hook like tool that helps you pull items towards you and helping you move things into position or out of the way. Last tool you get is a Rocket tool which can be used to fire a rocket that attaches on a object leaving you to shoot that item across an gap which starts to get more useful later on in the game.\n\nThe gameplay was quite nice and refreshing for a change for me after playing countless games that just pretend to be like other games, However the game is quite short and at the moment crashes on me after getting pass the second fight with the Over the Top Jerk which is really disappointing since of how much fun I was having with this little unique gem.\n\n\n----Overall Verdict----\nWould I recommend this game? Well depends, I got this when it was on sale for 90 cents and usually it's hard to find likable games under a dollar so for what it delivered I was pretty much fine with it but for how much it normally costs which in US currency is $10, I think it could deliver a bit more for the asking price and seeing how there are lots of games listed for that price point that have longer replay value I feel this little beauty would be worth a bit less due to the playability duration it delivers. The rating I think this deserves at the moment would be a 7.2 out of 10 just due to the crashing issue I experience but if it gets fixed I would say easily 8/10 as long as you get it on a good deal.\n","June 20, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only element where it had me wanting more was its length, but I would gladly take this shorter (but still long enough to keep you busy), but much higher quality experience.\n\nI played with a controller, I can’t say much about the gameplay with mouse/keyboard. Just a 3D platforming experience, the gameplay was pretty much flawless. But on top of that are the physics mechanics and the tools you are given (no spoilers!) and that makes for a really refreshing experience. The tools at your disposal don’t feel at all like gimmicks, which is a risk many developers face when trying to incorporate interesting mechanics into a game. The levels are also designed really well to make use of these mechanics.\n\nThe story isn’t ground breaking but there is one and I find that really important, it is present enough to have me keep playing and it doesn’t feel like an afterthought. The fact that there is another character that really does engage with you helps in this regard. The scripts are also written well and leads to a pretty funny experience. It helps build the sense of charm around the game.\n\nAnd boy is there charm! You can see it firstly from the graphical style of the game, it just looks really good. The comic book style sound effect labels are awesome and were always accurate. I love the level intros and the game has pretty good graphical diversity for being based entirely in a desert - especially towards the end.\n\nWhile it is short, it has all of the bells and whistles - collectables, secrets, plenty of achievements and goals to complete each level in ridiculous ways.\n\nIf I had to come up with some complaints, I thought that the death sequence was a bit long. It also seemed kind of arbitrary how far you had to fall in order to die - it seems to prevent you from going to parts of the level in the wrong order.\n\nIf you’re looking for a good 3D platformer, I don’t think you could look past this.","May 2, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, this is a mess."). The sound and visual design to the game is decent enough to not make me sick after a couple hours, and (for the most part) the objectives and puzzles aren't monotonous.\nAside from these, the foreign design is quite obvious by the gradually apparent mistranslations, the game gets very repetitive towards the end, and it's hardly worth a few hours of gameplay. If you're looking for a quick passtime, this'll do nicely (especially if you can get it on the Humble Bundle or an appropriately likewise pricing).","September 9, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game where you can destroy and move giant clumps of rock with a stone cutting laser beam, a grappling hook and a rocket launcher.\n\nWhen I played this, I got a vibe as if I was playing Super Mario 64 again. Must have been the 64 bit graphic design. Or the fact that this game is sort of a collectathon with lots of achievements.\n\nThis game isn't too impressive in the graphical department, but its makes up with unique and fresh 3D sandbox puzzle environment which I never experienced like this before. Comes with a collection of indie musician tracks from an all time portable radio. Choose your tunes while being a stonecutter.\n\nYes, the game has no enemies whatsoever, some bonus levels are kind of derp and the few boss battles against the one and only other human character are practically all in the same fashion, but this game was made by a small indie studio and should not be scolded for such shortcomings too much.\n\nI hope Black Pants Studios will make a follow up to this game with some Coop. If this series gets some polishing and a better publicity it could aspire to be a competitor to Portal!\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking for a challenge, consider acquiring this. Its fairly cheap and often on sale. Definitely an enrichment to your steam library.","August 25, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mostly consists of getting from A to B by cutting bolders and other structures, with no real enemies to speak of except for the main antagonist Big (who will sometimes hurl rocks at you) There are also "boring stones"  and indie tapes to collect if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe platforming isn't good enough for a solid platformer and the "puzzle solving" will often leave you wondering if the puzzle was even supposed to be solved the way you did it. It's quite possible that stones you need will fall off the edge and you'll have to kill yourself to get them back and progress further in the level.\n\nThe story itself is odd and poorly written, but the character designs and art are unique and some of the indie tracks are pretty good.\n\nTiny and Big feels more like a tech demo or proof of concept than a fully fleshed out game. It only takes a few hours to beat and a few more if you hate yourself and want to get all the collectables.\n\nAt $9.99, this game is very overpriced. If you can get it for a few bucks on sale and cutting up rocks sounds fun, you might have fun with it.","July 4, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read the system requirements carefully, if you have an Intel Graphics chip, do NOT play this game.\n\nI did, and I suffered massive lag spikes no matter what I did right into the first non-tutorial level. It was horrible. After dying several times I tried to quit, where my game promptly froze and my computer bluescreened.\n\nIf you have the right graphics card, go nuts.

You've got 3 tools to manipulate the world around you:\n1. You've got a laser, and you can cut nearly every gameobject to make your way towards the end of the level.\n2. You've got a grappling hook so you can hook onto gameobjects and pull them anywhere.\n3. ...and you've got a rocket launcher, so you can shoot a rocket onto an object and then make it fly!\n\nThe design is great, it's a bit like Borderlands, but I found it better. The music is 6 out of 5. I loved it.\n\nCons:\nIt feels like the game wasn't taken seriously by the developers and after they came up with the basic gameplay idea they just threw together something to publish it. The story is.. well... nearly nothing, even a kid could come up with something simple like this.\n\nThe levels are pretty cool, but after playing like 1,5-2 hours, and just when you get used to the game mechanics and starting to like it, the game suddenly ends. I was extremely disappointed when it ended, and felt like I wasted my money. Thank god I bought it for 1€, sadly, with this story and gametime, it doesn't worth more. I was really upset and angry by the way this game played out. Awesome visuals, sounds and game mechanics, and just when you started to like it, it spits you out, and gives you exaclty NOTHING, for playing it. No rewards, no fun, nothing. I was really sad. When the game ended, I felt like "come on, I didn't want to buy a demo game...." I tought I just finished the first chapter and there will be at least 5 more, and the credits came in... I wanted to break my mac and my desk into pieces...\n\nSo at the end, it's very difficult to recommend it or not. I would recommend it, because the mechanics are awesome, but i would definetly NOT recommend it, because it's gonna make you feel disappointed. Buy it when its on 90% sale and maybe you won't feel like it's a money wasted.\n\nI'm gonna click recommend though, I loved cutting those rocks. But I hope the devs are reading these: Give us a second episode, with 10 times more levels and I'll gladly pay even 20€ for it.","June 27, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WIll only take you an hour or two to beat the game fully. With that is it worth 9 dollars? Probably not, but on sale this game would be a great game. I picked it up on bundlestars I think for like 50 cents, so I am pretty happy with it. There is some replayablity to it, so you could definitely get 9 bucks out of the game if you assume 1 dollar = 1 hour.\n\nOn to the story, it's pretty funny.

By dragging and turning you change angle and length of a cut. Then you let go and the lase WILL cut along the marked line.\n\nThe art looks really great and handdrawn and most of all unique.\n\nSigh.\n\nIt's isn't perfect though and makes two mistakes that don't break the game but are undermining what this game would be best at.\nThe first is that far to much of the game is spend in boss battle like stages that force you forward and take you any opportnity to play with the laser.\n\nThe second is in a later, otherwise amazing, challenging stage in wich the biggest difficulty is the needlessly minimzed few distance. The confussiong thing here was that the massive building this played out in was still visible in the backround. So the darkness only affected the platforms but not the mostly black and blue backrounds (wich still looked nice).\nThis caused me to waste time on guessing where to go next because i couldn't actually see where the next platforms were instead of using my brain and time to creatively cut my way trough the level.\n\n\nThe game was at it's strongest when you could make your way in peace and even explore the world to some degree.\nThe game really would need more of this exploration.\n\nI wished it had a sequerl by now. :-p\n\nWOULD I RECOMMEND IT?\n\nYes. Looks great, plays really well, with a Gimmick that is REALLY well polished.\n\nTotally worth the prize it asks (at this time 9.99 Euros).\n\n\nEDIT: And the Soundtrack is really cool!","October 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it is though it's still good, especially if you like platformer puzzle games.\nGood to support original titles and ideas and hopefully they make a sequel with more gameplay! Because I suppose my main complaints are that the game isn't longer... But there is some replay value in getting all the achievements and finding secrets.\nSo I'd recommend this game if you're already showing some interest.

Really it's the only option you have besides wandering around these bricks forever. they haven't even let you know what a battery looks like in this world. what are you suposed to be looking for if they even bothered to put one in, in the first place. There is bricks in the air but they are to far away to affect them in any way.  how is this a game? you can not even make it out of the totorial.
