No sense of progress. Unsatisfying.\n2. Upon completion of a level, it CLOSES THE GAME AND RE-OPENS IT.\n3. Unclear objectives. Sometimes you have to stand on platforms to open doors, sometimes you have to collect items, sometimes you have to kill enemies.\n4. Useless radar in top left of screen. Absolutely useless.\n5. When you get hit, the game lags for 2-3 seconds.\n6. Awful color/theme/style. No consistency, can't see where you are half the time.\n7. Horrible controls. Scrolling the mouse wheel ascends/descends you when you are a helicopter. 'Nuff said.\n\nI had more fun writing this review than I did playing the game. Don't waste your time with this game.

I love FPS games, I never feel sick playing games from motion issues or otherwise.\n\nThis game made me feel queasy.\n\nSeems like it could be interesting if it wasn't so .... gross.\n\nWhomever designed the color scheme and graphics must have been severely colorblind.... and I'm colorblind... that's telling you something right there.\n\nFurther, there is no settings menu in game to control things like music or sound level... but the menu that is there loves to jump around when you try to select things.... like someone discovered what they thought would be a good idea, but seriously... just annoying.\n\nOverall: 2/10 - Stay away or puke","May 7","false","0.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I didn't really play that much, but it seems like a fun game. It isn't professionaly made or anything really, just... game on Steam. It is worth the $2, and it isn't that bad of a game. After 4 edits I think I finally made had enough time to make a somewhat professional review. At first I thought this was a horrible game, but after actually sitting down and writing an actual review... it seems like a decent game. The developer seems like a pretty honest and active person, and I like that. The game seems inspired by the game 'Armored Core' ... and it is.\n\nWelp time to edit this 7 or so more times...","August 31, 2015","true","0.2"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","19","37","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zibuddha/recommended/399100/","zibuddha","The Surprise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zibuddha/","755 products in account","Spheroid is product of a fan of the Armored Core series by FROM SOFTWARE. Spheroid is like the original Armored Core from original PlayStation in concept, but without providing any form of customization and adding in a few unique changes that make it feel more like a blend between Armored Core and Transformers BeastMachines. The music used in the preview was created in similararity to music from Armored Core Nexus. Not sure if Frame Gride or Murakumo Mech Assalt were also inspiration in the design or if I'm entirely wrng and its VirtualOn in the mix.\n\nWhy do I not recommend this? Mainly it is the lack of controller support, the fact that the menus are weird, and the game appears to do a full reset after completing a "mission".\n\nIt doesn't seem terrible, just it seems like I paid for a fairly polished preview that will hopefully fund the next (improved) version -which is what FROM SOFTWARE did every console game on PS1 into the last title for PS2. Every game was playable, but always had quirks, or had implemented entirely new concept dynamics from previous that were not fully tested and ironed out for any kind of balance, etc.\n\nI can't say enough how its the lack of controller support that is the main reason I can not recommend this.","October 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

I thought you know if I could make a wise crack. Be a little bit of a jerk, I knew I couldn't do any better. Guess that's what happens when you are on the internet. You get people thinking you actually don't know what windows 8, or what an i7 core is. Don't get me wrong, This game has major potential, and I thought I poked a little bit of innocent fun. But I guess not.\n\nSo without further ado,(since my satire is not welcome here) let me write a serious and heartfelt review.\nDon't let my previous review keep you from buying this game, it could be great, but right now it is pretty buggy.\nThe graphics are simplistic but hard to use to spot enemies. There are no options menus and I think if he gets enough sales he should remake it on a better engine. There are no checkpoints and whenever you die you restart the whole program that is the game. Some features are not actually stated, like the way you fly in the second level. No apparent plot and bad voice acting. Weird doppelganger bots randomly walk around. Ai is impeccable at shooting you and there are no healing stations.\n\nTo be honest, I thought this looked like one of my favorite childhood games: Custom robo. But it wasn't.\n\nRemorse-over-previous-review/10  (couldn't have zero satire)","August 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 14 of 46 people (30%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","30","14","46","8","8"
