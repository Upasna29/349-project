In fact I was actively watching the countdown to steam release at work just waiting to get home and get it. was playing 1.9.2 beta at work when it was slow once. My superviser saw it and decided to give it a whirl. he spawned next to a fire elemental and almost instantly died. I coulden't stop laughing.\n\nI have played this game on and off since a few years back and I can say that it is not for everybody, but for anyone that this game does suit, it suits like a custom tailored Hugo Boss. Creative, exciting and tactical, it is everything you want from a refreshingly unique roguelike/survival game... except maybe a little easy. you might not agree if you haven't played it before but the game is all about progressive knowledge and discovery, so once you know what you need to do to survive its fairly easy to do so if you take things slow and think ahead. It has great potential and I would love to see some event like situations and more diversity in the future!\n\n10/10 would repair glass bottle with stone hammer again","April 22","true","54.7"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","26","32","9","0"

This title has been in active developement for some time now, and it definately shows. First-and-foremost, what is most notable about Wayward that sets it apart from other similiar titles is that it is turn-based.\n\nEssentially, you are stranded on an island and must survive. Sound familiar? Sure. While Wayward seems to share similiar characteristics with other clones - it is truly exceptional. What really makes this title stand out is an excellent user-interface, a truly deep crafting system, and steep-yet-fair difficulty which combine to create a really addicting experience. While I have played countless survival/crafting clones over the years, nothing has given me that thrilling experience of trying to survive and learn mechanics similiar to my first time playing Don't Starve. With that being said, this isn't Don't Starve - it has a personality all of its own. I would highly recommend trying the free version - get past the moderate learning curve and then the addiction begins :)\n\nPros:\n+Everything is fairly logical. With each death you will have an 'aha' moment, where you will almost immediately know how to correct your actions on your next run. This really makes an addicting experience.\n+The user interface is really easy to use and makes a complex system fairly intuitive.\n+Tons of items and crafting recipes that make sense.\n+Tutorial is a warm welcome from the web version.\n+Graphics are well done and fitting.\n+The moderate-to-steep difficulty is great, and keeps you coming back for more.\n+Super cheap asking price for the quality hours you can get out.\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes I get stuck with trying to figure out a simple crafting recipe. Perhaps a recipe list has been added in-game since the Steam launch, but I haven't found it yet. I usually just alt+tab to the Wiki, but this can be tedious at times. Once you learn the recipes, this is not a big deal.\n-Just be aware this is a much slower paced game than others in this genre. Not necessarily a 'con' per se, but be aware.\n-Sometimes movement can feel janky - ie. accidentally walking into a fire pit or bumping into trees and gathering stuff you don't want to.\n\nIf you like survival/crafting games, and enjoy turn-based play, this is a no-brainer. This stands far ahead of the others. I totally recommend this game.","April 23","true","1.8"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","27","35","3","0"

With a plus of not being another zombie survival game)\n- Modable\n\n\nCons:\n- Awful UI - Hotkeys (You can put itens on hotkeys, this is nice but the hotkey use will only apply the first "option" of the "actions" menu of that item. Ie: an axe has the options "Carve" and "Gather"; if you assign the axe to the hotkey 1, when you press 1 it will try to "Carve" with the axe, even if the target is not carveable)\n- Micromanagement (All the time you will need to have your inventory open. Do you want to mine rocks ? Change your equiped itens on hand for a pickaxe; Do you want to cut down a tree ? Change your equiped items to an axe, is an enemy incoming? Change your equiped itens. )\n- Awful UI - Itens action menu (The way the action menu is set on the itens, you are prone to missclick and do bad things. Ie: The "Glass Bottle with Seawater" actions are "1 - Drink", "2 - Pour"; you would not want to drink the saltwater for various reasons but pour it's water on a still to clean it. But unfortunately the option 1 apears right in front of the item as soon as you click, so chances are you will drink it)\n- Almost no help (The only help you have is a simple tutorial quest to get you to make a campfire and water still, and a set of hint messages. Itens also have a standard description related to their main use, but many times it is not clear their function at all, nor does the game tells you that the purple number at the top of your interface increases as you skill up and get milestones and it affects the spawn rate)\n\n\n\nOverall, it is a good game if you don't care that much to graphics nor to it's dificulty curve. If you don't like micromanagement and prefer action focused games, run away from it.","April 23","false","3.0"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","45","76","4","7"

I first, fell in love right away once I got the first seemingly complex UI (which I do hope the devs improve on) but once I got a handle on it (via the tutorial) I found that the game has an already complex crafting system and a well crafted balance of RPG and extrapolation.\n\nThe one thing I will state is that the game is pretty solitary and there are some sever bugs right now:\n\none being the awkward UI and system. I think it should be obvious to developers now that people like to hit escape to get to the exit menu not clear the UI, also the scrolling in the UI can make a player want to pull their hair out while trying to get to the third row of the crafting menu ( something a scroll locking system can make go away)\n\nThe most troubling thing in the game is that it is turn based so it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ when the game decides to make the player go crazy and depending on the automatic turns the game can make the player go it can make the player randomly run into danger. . . basically it seems the game doesn't clear commands or button presses so it cues up; up left right down commands and randomly chooses a command order or something. . . basically you are playing and going right right and you press "d" to go right and then you watch your player go up, up, left, left, and so on until it stops.\n\nSeeing as the game is playable and partially feels like a full game I can give a thumbs up now that I've played the game long enough to have a sustainable home running and now ready to try and brave the rest of the world . . . I can say I'm 3 hours in and will be playing this game much much more. . .

On the plus side, resources aren't particularily generic like "wood" and instead there are five different groups of harvested tree material- leaves, bark, twigs, branches, and logs, all of which have multiple and different uses.\n\nIf you're still on the fence, go try the alpha. There's an old version available online that you can play in your browser. There are numerous differences between the web version and the Steam version, most notably smoother animations and slightly better graphics & interface. If you enjoy that version, you'll definitely enjoy the up to date version.\n\nThere's mod support and there's been two updates with significant tweaks and a couple new items since I got the game last Friday, so that's cool.

I played the free betas before the Steam release quite a lot. So what can I tell you about Wayward? Well, it's a turn-based island survival game. There's a lot of crafting, there's a lot to discover, and there's a hell of a lot of danger. This game does not hold your hand.\n\nThe crafting system is surprisingly pretty easy to use. You make discoveries through crafting basic things that guide you towards what resources you will need and what you will want to consider crafting yet. The hints that pop up give you a bit of insight, but it leaves most of the hard work up to you.\n\nSurvival is hard. It's easy to starve, it's easy to become dehydrated, it's easy to become overtired or overencumbered, and it's sure as hell easy to run into an enemy that you weren't ready to face. The first little while you play the game will consist of you figuring out the basics. If you're turned on by games that force you to die a ton before you can actually get anywhere, this game won't be for you.\n\nAll that being said, the game is crazy charming. The graphics are very simple and cute. The sound effects are very basic, but certainly not bad at all. There isn't a whole lot of animation, but somehow the game doesn't need it. The music is actually fantastic. It coats the game in an atmosphere the seems to flesh out the game world in a way that it wouldn't be otherwise. It almost reminds me of the Donkey Kong Country 2 OST or something.\n\nIt's a great little survival game that's always growing. It's hard as hell, but it's harder not to love it. Not only that, it's pretty darn cheap. A very easy recommendation for me.","April 22","true","5.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I may even try making a simple mod or two.\n\nFor the price of $7.99 for what the game offers currently is a definite steal and it supports the team to work on it further down the road. They've already intended to continually add to it whether or not they make millions. They interact with the community through Twitch streams, and show what they intend on adding through their Wayward Trello.\n\nOkay so with all that said maybe you are completely new to the game and haven't played the earlier version; this is a roguelike, you die and lose your world then you need to start a whole new one. It's a bit of a challenge for a new player, you will probably die the first night and perhaps again the second night, but that's okay! You'll learn from your deaths and continue to improve in survival until you get to the end game which is full of riches!\n\nPros:\n-Can spend hours playing.\n\n-Can save and resume whenever. (thank you turn base!)\n\n-Each world is a new experience since it auto generates.\n\n-Crafting, there are a ton of things to craft.\n\n-I love that I can hotkey all my windows to one button to open and close my inventory, equipment,  crafting, milestones and skills all at once.\n\n-The caves are extremely fun exploring, more so than the world above in my opinion. Having true darkness in a game that can only be illuminated by a torch is the best.\n\n-Hand Drill is probably by far the best item in the game. This has to be the biggest pro of them all as this item has nearly no weight to it and provides so many fire starting.\n\n\nCons:\n-Combat is simple yet not simple. You walk into creatures to attack the complexity of combat comes down to which weapons you have equiped. Although since the devs are continually adding to the game and modders will have a shot the combat could get really interesting.\n\n-It's still early access so there's very few choice of mods and whatever small kinks are in the game are still being iron out, although any kinks there are get patched quickly or aren't noticed through normal gameplay.\n\n-Early game at times can feel unfair only leaving you the option of running and hiding from creatures. This is mostly a personal peeve, the game needs danger of course.","April 24","true","385.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

(For those of you who like ancient obscure freeware, it's basically the game Schiffbruch but with many more features and a lot more to discover.) It's the kind of game where you can die within the first five minutes, or do awesomely for an hour and then die to some silly mistake. Easily frustrated people be warned-- this game will kick your butt!\n\nIf you can get past that, however, Wayward is a game that can be strangely peaceful, punctuated with moments of intense drama. You've finally finished building a little shelter of wooden walls and you got a campfire started...but oh no! There's a zombie at your doorstep. Do you hurriedly craft a snare, or run out the back of your shelter and hope to lose it in the nearby woods?\n\nYou got a ton of awesome loot in the cave, but a pirate ghost is suddenly chasing after you!\n\nOh no, you forgot to get a second glass bottle or flask before constructing your water desalinator-- how are you going to carry water from the ocean to distill??\n\nYou forgot to repair your axe, and now you have to dig stone with your bare hands! It's okay though, you have 50% in mining...\n\nWhat's great is that even when you inevitably screw up and die, there's always something to be learned. Fight spiders and snakes before taking on a shark. Supplement your health with berries and sutures while you're hurriedly running around trying to find freshwater to save yourself from dehydration. Don't walk into the campfire because it REALLY hurts. It's a game that appears simple on the surface, but is actually complex and has quite a bit to discover.\n\nThe best part is, there are many paths to success. You can become a burly tough guy and beat up all the monsters. You can build a small farm and create your own pixely homestead. You can be an explorer and hunt after that sweet, sweet ectoplasm to enchant your armor. You can build a raft and explore the seas, collecting treasure and fighting krakens.\n\nOr you can just die a bunch. That will probably happen too. As with many roguelikes, this game needs to be approached with a good sense of humor and a bit of an inner masochist. I recommend watching streams, or playing with friends if it gets frustrating-- it's hard not to laugh when you build an awesome cabin in the woods, only to have a fire elemental burn it all down. Sometimes you accidentally drink the unpurified water, and you get poisoned. And sometimes you just can't hit that rat, no matter how many times you try....\n\nI've been following Wayward's development since at least 1.5, and it's wonderful to see how far it's come! The graphics are even more beautiful, in all their pixely glory, the 80bit music is still adventurous and lends an aura of wonder and imagination, and the gameplay is better streamlined.\n\nMy main complaints are mostly cosmetic-- for example, the font size is a bit small still, and the various game windows you have to navigate can, at times, be overwhelming or feel cluttered, especially if you're new to the game. And I do unfortunately still have some lag, even though i'm using a newer computer than i had the last time i played the 1.9.2 pre-Steam release (it appears to have something to do with how much weight i'm carrying? I'm confused). But all of these issues are to be expected in a beta and can be ironed out easily.\n\nIMO, the biggest and most promising new feature in this release is the Steam Workshop support! The possibilities for this game are now endless. Even before this release, there were quite a few nice mods on the Unlok forums. It will only get better!\n\nPlease, grab this game while it's on sale! 7 bucks is a steal, and if you don't like it at first, you can come back to it tomorrow, or in a week, because every game is a little different.\n\nThe island awaits...\n\nEdit: For people who are mad about a free game going paid, there's still a free version of the game available on the official website. http://www.unlok.ca/wayward/introducing-wayward-free/\n\nAlso, because you all are being petty for complaining about a game that has probably given you 30+ hours of enjoyment, here's a sampling of what you could buy for the same cost as Wayward!\n\nTwo frozen Pizzas\nThree glass bottles of Coke.\nTwo large bags of chips.\nTwo chicken breasts.\nAlmost two bus tickets.\nTwo beers if you buy them in a store, maybe enough for one if you buy at a pub.\nOne high quality coffee at a coffeehouse.\nFour liters of gas (about 1.05 gallons).\n3/5 of a movie ticket, or less depending on the theater (LITERALLY AN HOUR OF ENTERTAINMENT)\n1.5 coffees from Starbucks\n0.5 of a new shirt\n0.25 of a cheap pair of jeans\nHalf of a CD (LITERALLY 30 MINUTES OF ENTERTAINMENT)\nHalf a barbie doll\n1/4 of a board game\n1 Book, used\n\nYeah, shame on you for not supporting this extremely dedicated developer-- one who worked on this for three+ years without getting paid a cent, with what amounts to a PITTANCE.","April 22","true","4.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

If you like roguelike survival games and/or pixelated games in general, you'll get a kick out of Wayward. My only (very miniscule) complaint is when starting a new game, all my interface windows I've spent so much time aligning and putting in order are completely reset and it's very tiresome resizing and remaking the layout I had before. I haven't encountered any bugs that I know of so I would consider it bug-free, so there's that too.\n\nJust a little P.S.\n\nThe game is challenging!

I understand this game is in early access and the devs are still working on the game, but that's why I'm writing the review, to hopefully get in touch and get my points across.\n\nCurrently the tutorial is pretty bad, if you're a new player I don't think it will help you much at all. The tutorial teaches you the bare bone basics and that's it. I believe that it should teach you how to get your first piece of iron (not wrought) gear. Since this is already a hard process without looking up how to do it. I feel this would be enough to perhaps even propel a new player into the late game.\n\nChests don't work the way I think they should. This may be just a personal thing, but I think that if you are doing crafting and you're within a distance of the chest (obviously small to keep it realistic) that you should be able to use the items from that chest. Just a convenience thing to make it easier to do crafting at your base. On a somewhat similar note, backpacks are over complicated, they should just add extra carrying capacity.\n\nAnother pet peeve of mine is what gets used as a sharp edge. I have had gold swords and iron axes go out on me from crafting sprees, so either make it where you can pick what is used, or have the worst item be used first (small rock-golden sword)\n\nI'm pretty sure I already saw that this was in the works, but it would be awesome if sprites looked different as you put items on. Right now it just kind of feels weird when you have full iron armor and you're walking around with a tee shirt on.\n\nAgain, I understand that the game is still in the works, and I thinks the game is a lot of fun and worth the money, but I hope the devs look over these suggestions and think them over.\n","May 14","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

A very challenging survival experience where each permadeath teaches you the things you need to know so you could get a little bit further every time.\n\nMy main thought is that this looks and feels a lot like a browser game you'd find on a site like Kongregate but in all honesty i've seen browser games with smoother, more streamlined gameplay and better UI design. It may not seem like something to complain about but it's death by a thousand cuts if you are easily annoyed or perplexed by things like searching in your crafting menu for a minute to find a thing to start a fire with or why you even have to do so in order to do something as simple as lighting a furnace.\n\nI hope the devs work on making the gameplay more streamlined and cleaning up the user interface to make things easier to navigate.\n\nIf you enjoy highly challenging survival games like Don't Starve than you might like this one. If you are put off by the permadeath and clunky gameplay than give it a miss.\n\nThumbs down because it still has a ways to go before I can recommend it to everyone.","May 30","false","34.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It needs some serious overhauls to the tutorial, but if you're willing to try and fail, this game is a fun time.

Being placed on an island with no rock (which is needed for every tool except wood spears, and harvesting without a tool can hurt you) means that you're doomed to a slow death.\n\nOverall, Wayward is a seriously fun game.

At $8 it's a bargain, especially for an Early Access Game this well developed.\n\nThe world is interesting and worth exploring, although the backstory is sparse. Crafting is well thought-out and strikes an excellent balance between reality and gameplay. Crafting recipe discovery is a very strong draw, and you can build atop your early failures with a system that brings what you learned the previous playthrough into each new start (unless you’d rather start from scratch, which you can do!). There's a wide array of skills and possible gameplay strategies, although they are not all fully balanced just yet.\n\nThere are some bumpy spots, as expected of a game in development, but the dev team is incredibly responsive. I've yet to encounter any instability with the game engine. As I write this the in-game tutorial already does a good job of easing you into the survival gameplay. The difficulty spikes up fairly harshly right now, but balance is a moving target for any game in development. Modding is enthusiastically supported by the devs, who have provided tutorials and open-source examples to get the modding scene started.\n\nThis game has apparently been in-dev for years. You can play the previous version of this game for free on their website, and it should be a great demo. If you like the free version, quickly buy it on Steam to support their great team. They’re quick to reply to feedback and take suggestions seriously. They even provide a link to the team’s dev tracker tool, where you can watch each new update come together as it progresses.\n\nI’ll say it again: if you happen to enjoy TBS, survival, crafting, exploration or just supporting an indie team doing good work, you could hardly do better than giving this game a try.\n","May 7","true","47.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Wayward was kind of overkill for my purposes and but its been a good fit. Plus its a damn fine game for $8.\n\nEnvironments are appealing, the crafting system is robust, disease/thirst/hunger are interesting and complex mechanics. Inventory weight and durability might be a bit too realistic for me. I like that my character dones't just drink big gulps of seawater to replenish thirst. RPG skill ups that kind of remind me of Runescape. All in all the game is a lot bigger than I thought it'd be, maybe the simpler graphics allow the devs to focus on a fuller game world. I have yet to encounter a bug which is amazing for early access.","May 17","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is it bad? Not even close.\n\nThere's always a challenge, a real tough challenege to have an immersive world and yet keeping it free and non-linear. Survival games are always a tough place to be where you sacrifice open world play for some form of progression. Eventually, the kinks in these types games will smooth out.\n\nThis is def worth a try as it focuses more of real aspects than fantasy ones. (They're there though haha). The most important part of this game that will need better item organization (always a tough thing with these games) and better UI (fluid environment and action commands). Recommend if you are into roguelike and survival type games for sure.","May 17","true","167.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There have been a tun of changes in that time ,  now your getting it for $7.00 (approx) its well worth that. as you can mod the game which is awsome. those who are used playing the free version thats fine too. but there are many changes and tweaks that you'll be missing out on.\n\nThe Devs are actively working on the game, active with the community and very approachable\n\nI haven't tried my hand at modding yet but i'll give that a go soon too.\n\nIs the game perfect. and easy to play , Short Answer NO. its got a semi unique interface and setup, it has a learning medium  curve, and can be frustrating at times\n\nIs it a finished game (no game really ever is).

(at least it felt like it)\n\nAt the moment, I try to record some gameplay of it. For me, OBS has small issues with recording it - sometimes, some other times it works. I will try a few fixes on my end, then I might report it to Drathy, the dev. He is very active and helpful, same as behind any supportrequests the community has. For those that dislike EA (Early Access) Games, this might be a reason to buy it, because the Dev does not seem like he would abandon his project. If you still can not trust in that, go to the website (unlok.ca), click on "Wayward" and play version 1.9.2 for free. No time-limit, no testaccount required. Nice, huh? ;)\n\nThe game itself is described in at least 32 other reviews, which you should check out as well. Everytime you spawn in a different world, on a different island. The things you can craft are the same - IF you are able to find the resources. Which needs you to survive long enough. Can you do that?\nThe game really is unforgiving. One mistake and you start anew, everything you crafted, gathered and built is lost. Quite repetitive you think? No. As I said: A new randomly generated map brings new resources, new difficulties and new secrets to explore everytime.\n\nI do not want to tell you and spoiler more about it, just go and try it for yourself!\nBut... be careful out there, okay? ;)","April 25","true","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's not a bad game by any means, just not the game I wanted it to be. I was hoping for something right in that sweet spot between Don't Starve and Minecraft, with some fun turn-based elements to keep it interesting. Wayward was almost able to scratch that itch, but it didn't quite land there. The gameplay and interface are just awkward enough to keep me from really enjoying it. The learning curve wasn't exactly steep, but the more I learned about how to play the less I actually felt like playing.\n\nThat said, I don't want to dismiss the quality of the game. If you're looking for a top-down Minecraft-like game at a fraction of the Mojang price, you could do a lot worse. But in its current state, there was nothing new or exciting in the experience for me to latch onto.\n\nAs the game goes through revisions and updates, I'll check back in. Maybe there will be a new feature that will change my mind. I hope so.

I recommend it to anyone that enjoys old-school pixel graphic sandbox games with rpg, crafting, and building elements.\n\nIt is in alpha/beta phase, so just keep in mind that many things ought to change over time. Devs appear to be very professional and friendly, also active in the community (on reddit, Steam Discussions, their own webpage, etc) which is a huge plus. This little gem has great potential.\n\nThings to consider:\n- Turn-based (when ya move, craft, consume something, build, etc; other creatures move, time/game ticks forward)\n- Very old-school pixel graphics (which I personally love)\n- Lots of craftables, though building options are a bit limited right now.\n- RPG elements: tons of different skills to level up as you use them/craft stuff, which increase your 'Talent' points (purple points to right of health points)\n- Combat is very simple, so far. Ranged weapons and traps add a bit of tact to it.\n- You will most likely die and it will most likely frustrate you\n- Perma-death (you die, you have to start a new randomly generated world. I'd recommend the Reincarnate Mod, by dev in Workshop, to randomly respawn in same world so all your progress isn't down the drain. Though, your skills do carry over, no matter if you use mod or not)\n- Micromanagement is tedious and clunky right now, takes a bit to get use to. As well as using some tools.\n- Tutorial is very brief, the basic of the basics. No hand holding and you're left to figure most things out on your own. I don't mind it, but you may.\n- Difficulty is sporadic, especially if you haven't read up on the mechanics. (Some folks find it very difficult while some find it very easy, though I wager that a lot of it depends where you randomly spawn at and what creatures randomly spawn in your vicinity).\n- Difficulty does scale with your progression/Talent points (purple numbers by health), so keep that in mind. It means that stronger/different monsters can spawn and I believe their hp and damage does increase, but not too significantly.\n- It's a lot like Minecraft, where I'd advise to mess around to figure out some things until ya die a few times, then take a few to read up on some tips/advice/game mechanics, etc before restarting again to ensure your survival.\n- Music is great\n\nSome folks have beat it pretty quick, indicating that it's not necessarily that long of a game (at the moment of development), but if you take your time, build a place or town or whatever, collect stuff, explore the large world, hunt down different monsters, etc; you should easily get 20 to maybe 30 hours or more before ya run out of stuff to do.
