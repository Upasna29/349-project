If you're into "riks" like games, give it a shot and you won't be dissapointed. The game is basically a "spam armies" type of product, but it has some nice little mechanics built into it.\n\n//\n\n1) Economy aspect:\n\nLike in all strategy games, there's the financial aspect which here is represented by gold. Each province you conquer earns you money and that's the basics. Now, the mentioned gold can be invested in a province to either bost it's defense (building walls), use the province as an observation post (useful at border provinces), increase the local population (= more gold at the end of the turn), raise the local happiness (lowering risk revolt and increasing the amount of gathered gold) and finally raise armies. That's pretty much it: keep your lands safe, happy and developing to have a steady and ever growing income of gold.\n\nWhat's also worth mentioning is the taxes system. The level of tax burden increases the gold income rate and happiness of your people. So sometimes you have to hold a bit with conquests for your people to become happy again in order to avoid going bust or loosing land due to rebelions. Also, you can decide how well you upkeep your armies either giving them a small boost in strenght or a debuff (if not financed at 100%).\n\n2) Military aspect:\n\nAs mentioned above, you raise armies. And once you have troops, you send them to take over other provinces and if by any chance there's a defending army stationing there, a battle starts and typically the side that has higher numbers on their end wins. Walls (fortified provinces) can shift the balance as they give a 50% bonus, but in general you want to mass your troops when taking on fortified areas and usually you will overcome the resistance.\n\nArmies can travel by sea as well, however you need to pay a ship "boarding" fee so you are actually limited in how many troops can be hauled overseas by how much gold you have.\n\nOne importaint feature are the "kings" (if enabled in the game creation menue) - if your king "dies" in battle (meaning you lost an army with which the king was stacked), you loose a significant portion of your country to the enemy that kicked your behind. So keeping your king/ruler is eessential if this mechanic is present in a given gameplay.\n\n3) Diplomacy:\n\nNothing fancy here - a choice of relations ranging from war to alliances. What's interesting is that declaring a war, or having it declared on you will decrease the happiness of your people. So while fighting a war on many fronts might sometimes be a tempting option, it can turn into a dissaster when your provinces start going rebel and your income dries out.\n\n//\n\nAnd that's pretty much the major aspects of the game. You get 1 map for free, others have to be bought by either hard cash or in-game currency that you earn by logging into the game once a day and/or actually winning games. That very same in-game currency is needed for establishing multiplayer games, so it is a bit of a let down, but in the end that's the price for a "free to play" model I guess.\n\nTwo thumbs up as it's fun to play as always!","April 6","true","5.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","29","36","5","0"

For example my friend sent 300 troops against 150 expecting to win but lost. He went away from the game infuriated because of this; the game just didn't explain what happens and why battles like that are lost.\nThe purchasing of maps I can understand because the developer has to make a profit somehow, right? However the use of virtual currency to even host games bemuses me. You pay 5 gold to host a match, every match. This model restricts play and I believe you only get 1 gold a day for free by signing in. Any more VC you have to pay for. I also have a similar, albeit much smaller, complaint about having to pay for cosmetic avatar creation, but as it's merely cosmetic it really doesn't affect anything.\nThirdly I find there isn't enough depth to the game; the only things I can build is either a Watchtower or soldiers and there are only a few things you can do in terms of events (Fertility Festival, anyone?).\n\nIn all, I can see the appeal but I don't think it's worth my time to try and play this simply because the game doesn't explain itself well and as that has turned away my friends from playing this game, and the virtual currency has turned me away from playing this game, and as I think there isn't enough depth to satisfy me, I don't see the need to continue playing.\nPerhaps it's the Europa Universalis in me speaking, but I don't recommend this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Review- There's no search feature for Multiplayer games and there is no option to invite friends to your games. I downloaded this to play with friends; if I can't even let them join my game (which costs virtual currency to host or create) then what's the point?","April 8","false","2.6"," 54 of 84 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","54","84","5","7"

But no, it's much more fun and advanced than that. I love how you can collect taxes every year, adjust your levies on commerce, throw nationwide and or certain territory parties, how you can fortify your cities, and how you can send all sorts of messages and requests to other players. Basically, I love everything about it. It's also extremely addicting. So yes, I absolutely recommend this game. It's very much worth taking the couple seconds to download it. There are a couple things I have questions about, however. 1. How do the towers help you at all? I find that I can always see enemy troops next to my territories. Are they supposed to see enemies within a certain range? 2. When are you going to make all of the maps free? Me being a Bernie supporter, I want everything to be free. (Kidding). But seriously though, I feel like there should be at least two maps available. It would entice me to buy the rest of the maps.\n*EDIT- A second map was made available to everyone in May!\nHowever, the only thing this game really needs is more players, so download the game now and join our Conquest Community!

It's cool to see the formula has been applied with a bunch of different skins that you can unlock by playing more of the game. For those of you unfamiliar with these types of games, you essentially get a certain amount of gold which you use to buy more troops. The more land you have, the more troops you can hire. To defeat your enemy you will certainly need far larger numbers of troops, generally double or so if you're attacking.\n\nThis version of the game has added in different unit types, economic upgrades and even buildings that can be built which provide bonuses to all of your troops generally in defense.\n\nIn summation, this is a fun game, just as addicting as the ones I used to play on my ipod touch in French 2 back in High school.

It doesnt do the same thing over and over again like in EUIV(as belgium you will always  be targeted by Germany in the beginning and get crushed in EUIV) in AoC, the AI has alot of different tactics and behaviour. Here I played as belgium & Britain sofar and had alot of allies, in other Games Enemies. Played As India yesterday in WW3 map and conquered Russia together with Japan and Australia. Makes sense huh.\nGame is highly costumizable for the user. Different Timelines to play with, WW3... Rise of rome... and more to come :D\n\nMultiplayer score: 8.5/10\n8.5 Score because it can be annoying to find games since most have already played and don´t like to replace, prefer to play from scratch. Also people leave games often when they fail something. Still short wait time for turns and is quick!\n\nSingle Player score: 9/10\nNever gets bored with AI!\n\nGraphic Score: 7/10\nCute enjoyable graphics, tho more unit graphics would be good. Also the option to view map flags of which nation has provinces (like belgium and germany are yellow color, this makes confusing and would be better to have a nation flag instead of color)\n\n10/10 would play again\n","May 28","true","26.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The graphics are whatever; I didn't buy it for flashing animations, I just wanted strategy play.  The multiplayer seems fine; maybe a little punishing if you're new or not that skilled in long games.\n\nThe downside here is not that it's P2W (Pay to Win), it's P4FP2P (Play for Free, Pay to Play).  As others have voiced, it has a not so great way for accruing credit for new standard content maps.  This means that single player is pretty limited to one map until you dl a few more maps through multiplayer games that are hosting them or ditch money into a game that really is only a dollar store deal at best, at the moment.  The multiplayer download maps are OK, but nothing pioneering, or even really worth going back to.\n\nThe novelty was nice for about 8 hours of play, then it just downhilled it from there.  Not enough game here to recommend spending money on, at all.\n\nTL;DR\nPlay it for free first, I wouldn't ditch any money into it unless you can put at least 24 hours of solid gameplay into it and still be confident you will enjoy it in another 24 hours of solid play.","April 22","false","14.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","2"

Being so easy to learn normally meens it is to easy to play, but it isn\'t because there\'s always someone better than you at the game to challenge yourself to beat. Third, you never can get bored.

It's simple enough to pick up and play, but with pseudo currencies like per province population and happiness, as well as adjustable taxing and military upkeep, the game finds a perfect balance of the simple "click to attack" style of risk as well as a series of just deep enough economic and political options to keep each game fresh and interesting.","April 17","true","82.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is also the option of games with days per turn, for some more slow-paced and nerve-wracking games.\n\nThe game has a few issues here and there, such as being able to attack a player in the same turn as accepting peace treaty/alliance if currently at war if the actions are issued before the acceptance of the treaty and a few other minor things, but this review is written about a week after the launch and with the dev being online every single day and patching something every other day, I am fairly certain that they'll be quickly resolved.

This game is a game of risk and strategy. Their are ingame maps you can get. You don't have to get them, their not expensive unless you buy them all. Getting the maps is a good way to play with the devs as well as some more experienced players.\n\nSecondly I have played about 30 mutiplayer games, not once has it crashed for me. But personly you see crash problems on all games, its likely just stupid asses with a ♥♥♥♥ computers complaining because they can't play on a computer past its time.\n\nLastly, if you send 150 troops at a army lead by a king in a defened castle with 100 troops don't expect to win. You can use kings and brought up defenses to help defend. It can mean the difference between winning and loseing. A lot of this is also explained in the tutorial...If you don't know how to play the game don't complain about loseing.\n\nThe only problem I see in this game is paying coins to make games, that shouldn't even be a thing. I also think maps should be released over time. It could see this makeing the game more fun, and I could see that keeping the game going for a long time.\n\nIn conclusion I recommend the game, but a call out to the devs. Please don't make people who play the game have to use coins to make mutiplayer games.","May 3","true","51.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

First thing you'll notice in this game is that you can only play in europe and you need to pay extra to get anything els. Next the game can be very glitchy at times. And finally it combines game mechanics that dont work together. Its turn based but every one chooses theyre actions at the same time. That means if you and someone els both want to grab a new piece of land its completely random who gets it first. And if its not you that means your units just ran towards nothing an wasted a turn. Next if you want to attack a small stack of units. Most of the time you'll only send a small amount to kill them. But as soon as you press ready that small amount of enemy's triples in size and kills your soldiers. Im never sure when im gonna win a battle, Ive won and lost battles with the exact same odds. Either thats a glitch or theres a bit of luck. Both are bad, this isnt a game that should rely on luck. This is a game that should be played with pure skills.  While these might sound like minor problems they can decide wether you win or lose. The game is very dificult when played againt people who know what theyre doing and the hard AI isnt very forgiving. But when you play on the easy AI you always win and thats boring. Ive had a lot of fun playing it but its a real patience tester.  I recomend playing it but its not a good game.

There is absolutly no logic to this game what so ever. I will list the reasons why this game sucks:\n1. The game doesn't even explain how the economy works. The tutorial is absolutly crap.\n2. There is no such thing as a capital city. Not only that but even if you keep your army in the city and defend it gives you barly any bonus to defense.\n3. Contry leader aka "King" is seen as a normal troop you could simply send him to fight - once he dies game is over. In my opinion; for example if you have 5 armies you would obviously keep the king somewhere in the middle souranded by armies most likely safe in capital city not together with an army.\n4. Random enomy troops apear out of no-where. Enomy can spawn any amount of troops close to your land and attack you once your army isn't there. No one raises an army and sends it straigh away to battle. Training troops should last 1 turn so that it's fair.\n5. For strategy game there is no strategy to it what so ever. I seen smartphone games more developed than this.\n6. Alliance and other intaraction with other nations is crap. For example Denmark offered me alliance. I accidently declined it. Straight away I offered them an allaince but they refused.\n7. Historicly wrong - Only few civilasations in BC were that advanced. Another anoying thing is that there is no kingdom of Poland, or Litvinia and another few countries which in my opinion is disrespectfull to them. Another thing is that the alliances that existed at this time simply don't exist in the game.\n8. The map of Europe isn't full. It shows egipt but doesn't show all of sweeden and othe rscandinabian countries. The Baltic sea is also incomplete along with the whole map which doesn't look like Europe should.\n\nIn my opinion of you want to play a game like this do it on an emulator for a Android/Iphone or acctualy get a game on your smartphone - there is plenty of them like this that are enjoyable to play.","April 7","false","1.5"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","9","24","2","0"

And for right now, I am glad I did. now:\nReview Time!\n1: gameplay: now, the gameplay is good, not as easy to pick up as Civ, but when you get the hang of the menus you will be fine. But when I started playing a small game to myself, It was fun to BURN THOSE WHO DO NOT JOIN MY MAFIA OF DEATH!!! *insert evil laugh here* Oh... moving on...\n2: graphics: All I have to say is this. FE & Civ have a baby. Done.\n3: community: while I cannot say much about this let (becus it just came out) the creator has been on all night helping new players... (me) with the game. He/She Is very nice and is looking for people to help make it better, so if you are good at coding, I suggest you help make a map or two.\n4:P2W While most of the game is locked out with DLC, there is no P2W motto here, not way to stack the odds with stacks of cash.\nOverall I give it a 8.5/10.\nIt could be better, but for those wanting another Civ/FE game.

All you get for the free version is the Fall of Rome map, which really only consists of Europe, some of africa, some of asia, some of the middle east but thats it.\n\nIf you want the complete world map or anything larger you will have to purchase them...\n\n$20 for ALL maps, even future ones.\n$5 ish for individual maps.\n\nIts a better version of Risk in my honest opinion. More extensive economy/military management.\n\nWorth the $20? depends on how much you will play.\n\nI am an avid Risk player and I am 50/50 in purchasing or not.\n\nSad to admit it but the more I play it the less I like it. Its fun having 60%+ of the map and being taken over by an AI that has literally 3 territories SOMEHOW............. Somehow they went through all of my defenses and territories and hit my leader... Somehow......... even when you're pretty limited on how far you can go each turn.... Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Gameplay is awesome but the principle is broken.\nThe principle is:\nYou have 100 coins.\nYou have 1 map and if you want to play another you have to pay 500 coins or 5.USD\nYou receive 1coin a day.\nYou have to pay 5coins to play a game.\nResult:\n1. pay 5 coins to play one game and receive 1 coin every day. So you can play only once every five day and only one map.\n2. This game is not pay to win but pay to play :(\nDevelopers pls do something\n\nI am so so sorry guys.....  :D","April 10","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"
