Let's get that out of the way first- it is absolutely stunning. And with about three hours put into the game and 100% of the achievements obtained, it's a good game for achievement hunters as well. If you're looking for a pretty game to sink a few hours into, then you could do worse than Sparkle 2 Evo, especially when it's on sale.\n\nThe sound track ranges from the advertised 'relaxing' to 'wasps in eardrum' noises that made me check my speakers, but that may just be a matter of taste.\n\nIt's in gameplay itself, and execution, where the game could've been great, but turns out to be just mediocre. In the beginning you're presented with the idea that eating certain types of food within the game will change the way your Spark evolves. This could have been very interesting, with different tactics for different branches, but the only difference in the 'food stuffs' is color. So yes, you can eat a non-meat fish. Maybe it's swimming algae. Even with the vivid color scheme, it can be difficult to tell which of the more advanced creatures correspond to which color without some trial and error.\n\nFinally there's the 'boss battles'. The bosses do not fight back, and one of them barely moves- victory consists of slowly nipping suicidally-depressed mega-fauna to death.\n\nBut hey. It's pretty.","February 1, 2014","false","3.5"," 206 of 237 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","206","237","3","1"

I presume they are referring to the very first stage of a Spore game which is just a mini-game. To be accurate, Spore (2008) actually copied flow (2006). Flow was originally a free flash game and was part of the creator's masters thesis.\n\nYes, this game is VERY much like the game Flow on the PS3. But it is not the same game nor created by the same people. The mechanics are largely the same but this game goes for a more complex evolution where there's three different kinds of food (instead of 2) and you have to eat a LOT more to increase your creature's size.You get to look at the creature's stats as it grows and guide them by eating different types of food.\n\nIf you enjoyed Flow you'll very likely enjoy this game. It's graphicsa are very vivid and colorful. It's slow paced with no set time limits or precise goals, so it's good for just chilling out. There's a few flaws like having to hold down the left mouse button constantly but you can use the keyboard to control it. But really it's quite enjoyable, especially if you are into playign zone/chill games\n\n","December 2, 2013","true","0.3"," 108 of 127 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","108","127","0","3"

Single player can become boring very fast, because all you do is eat a certain amount of food (orbs) to finish the stage. Competition mode is fun because the AI actually challenges you and you can only go to the next stage if you win against the AI. But it also can become boring very fast, which didn't happen to me considering the game only has 14 stages and 2 of them are specifics to get achievements.\nThe controls are easy enough most of the time. It can be a little frustrating depending on the evolution of your spark, but easy to manage.\nThe game leads you to believe that your spark will evolve in different ways based on the type of food (orbs) you eat. That's not true. Not only the evolution of your spark is the same no matter what you eat, but you can't actually choose what to eat (not in competition mode at least, since you gotta beat the AI). You can choose what to eat in single player (the game only requires you to eat the necessary amount of food of at least one color), but it makes no difference whatsoever.\nThe game is not worth the full price, but for 90% off I say go for it. You get trading cards and 22 achievements in a few hours. I didn't regret buying it. I suggest you watch a video of the gameplay though, just to be sure.","October 23, 2014","true","5.3"," 54 of 59 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","54","59","0","2"

Start as a microscopic larva and build your way up the food chain as you evolve based on what you eat.\n\nPros: Graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The game captures the transparency of actual microscope observation, while bathing it in a rainbow of colors. Your stats and appearance changes depending on whether you eat carnivore, herbivore or omnivore matter. You get to confront other microbes in a speed and twirl competition, trying to eat out its weak spots while avoiding its head until it's the only thing left. Music is calm and soothing.\n\nCons: There is no behavior difference between your prey: the exact same creatures simply exists with different colors, making you wonder why a herbivore would eat fish, squids or other animals. You can't die, the extent of risk you face is getting pushed back up one level of depth, or getting a light red glow in the screen if you cannot be pushed up any further. Little replay value: there's a set number of levels with no randomization. There is little complexity over your evolution, and you might accidentally eat matter you wanted to avoid.\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nThe game might look and sound exquisite, but there is little more to it. A few hours is all it will take to go through the entire game, do every level and max out your evolution. As it stands, Sparkle 2 Evo doesn't offer enough for me to recommend it.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","April 4, 2015","false","3.8"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","41","52","0","0"

Graphically it is a simple but gorgeous aquatic landscape, accompanied by a lush ambient electronica track, which changes as the levels change. It offers some incentive to finish the level quickly as the tracks, as ambient music is apt to do, can become somewhat repetitive and tedious. Movement and speed controls via mouse/keyboard are basic and intuitive, though game controller support would have been appreciated. Gameplay itself is very much a rinse and repeat, but the boss levels and species customization are fun. If Forever Entertainment chose to, they could pump in a few more updates and expand the look and feel of biomes, additional music tracks, and co-op options which could really add to the shelf life of a game like this. Still, I was very pleased. Fun game to chill out to, minimal learning curve, immersive environment, and a solid value at its curent price.","April 11, 2014","true","9.7"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

However the green sparkle is in my opinion the best looking sparkle.\n\nAs you grow more and more instead of eating stationary microelements you start encountering species, most of which have ways of stopping you eating them often in the form of a slow trap. others take a long time to be fully eaten and until they are they will keep pushing you a level upwards if you touch their head, and others are relatively peaceful but require you to find a way into their body to eat their guts and finally decapitate them.\n\nEach stage of evolution your sparkle evolves visually, at first growing longer and developing a type of sac to show you its road to the next level by the size of it, after that it will grow jaws or in the case of the omnivore it will grow even longer, after that evolution truly branches and  every sparkle will go it's own way, i will not spoil this because they look too beautiful to explain.\n\nThough the levels are few (there are only 14) there are 2 optional boss battles, The Squid-Worm and the Octury.\n\nThe Squid-Worm is a large worm that requires you to eat all of his segments before eating his head, not too hard but it looks great and it's a fun way to show yourself how far you've come in your mad dash to become the top species in the sea.\n\nThe Octury is a humongous octopus that will make you eat all the glowing orbs on it's tentacles before entering it's head and devouring it from the inside out, though -once more not very challenging it's a huge monster that is great to look at in comparison to your little sparkle.\n\nThis is a great game and if you like Flow or need something relaxing in your library i definitely reccomend you to pick it up, it's very cheap and there are even trading cards to be gained.\n","December 28, 2014","true","3.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Your goal is to make him evolve and reach adulthood. To do that, your little guy can eat microelements, that will determine towards which category he will fall.\n\nIndeed, while you don't have any control over the DNA in itself, you can choose to eat only a single kind of element or juggling between them, knowing that when you're leveling up, you can change your form and by doing so use a special ability.\n\nYou can be a carnivore (by eating red elements) with a sprint as special power, a herbivore, with the possibility of eating elements away from your mouth (for that, you should search green elements) or an omnivore, with a repulsive ability (the blue element will be your best friend).\n\nHowever, through different worlds, you're not alone. You can find octopus, fishes, etc.. that you can eat. They're also belonging to each color: you will find blue, red and green fishes for example. You're generally alone in the world if you choose the casual mode and your goal is to eat one element until none is left. You can choose to continue to explore the rest of the level, which will allow you to level more.\n\nBut you can also enable the competitive mode, where other sparkles, controlled by the AI, will fight you for dominance. Your only way to win is to ensure that you ate more elements than them. When you win, you can clear the level as in the casual mode.\n\nMy great regret in that gameplay is that I don't have a real control over DNA. I can't choose the elements I really want. The only way to do it is to eat only the microelements and when you're in competitive mode, you can't really choose to avoid some elements if you don't want the AI to give you time.\n\nAlso, some enemies tend to swap layers, with a resulting chase being difficult.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. You're really in another world, with bright colors. And the soundtrack is really relaxing.  It's fitting to that deep world.\n\nAnyway, Sparkle 2 Evo is a game, despite its flaws, that is very entertaining. If you want a total control over your sparkle and have quests, you should orient yourself towards Genesis. If you want just a sparkle without any goal, without any worry about being carnivore/herbivore/omnivore, head for ZERO. However, Evo and Genesis are the best in the series, so, you can purchase it without any problem.","April 17","true","6.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

It's also simple to understand: Eat, grow, eat some more, rinse and repeat for all the levels. The difficulty doesn't really increase, but the areas become larger and there are more elements to collect in each level for completion, as well as a larger array of different kinds of life as you progress.

That mode isn't fun, but I just turn the option off.\n\nOverall, I recommend because it's easy and relaxed, and I had fun with it.\n\nOnly issue is that it's repetitive once you've done it a single time, so nothing really feels new.\n\nIt's worth buying at discount, but probably not full price.","December 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Upon inspecting the achievements I could not turn down an easy to complete game as an achievement hunter. In the same night that I bought the game, I completed the game 100%  in around 3 hours.\n\nDuring the course of the game I was not sure if I was expecting more or if I was expecting too much. The mechanics of the game were fairly basic and never evolved a whole lot. There were some interesting levels and others felt like they took too long to complete. The use of layers in the game suits it very well and they used that quite effectively at some points while at other times it felt like there should be layers when there weren't any at all.\n\nThe mechanic of eating is simple and the evolution based off of that feels somewhat lacking. I did not feel like I was ultimately challenged in different ways because of these changes. As such, the level of difficulty was not remotely close to challenging in my experience. At times, I was not even sure exactly on what I supposed to do in some of the boss levels. Even when I did figure it out, it felt like it took unnessesarily long to wait for the boss to be interactable.\n\nSo was this game worth it for the amount of fun? I don't feel like I wasted my time due to the achievements I decided to get, but I personally feel like something is missing.

The graphics show that it isn't native to PC and any resolution larger than 800x600 is going to show every pixel. People have described this as "not a game". They are right. But unfortunately it isn't great as art either. I bought it for $5 on sale and I don't think it is worth even that much, at least with how they described it. If they listed this as a port and not as an "artistic non-game" I might not feel tricked like I do. I don't know what kind of gameplay other's have experienced but I was unable to evolve my creature, and that was the only interesting thing about this game that would have redeemed it. The soundtrack is awful, and I also don't know what kind of people were saying that it was beautiful and entrancing. It's cheap sounding and doesn't sound at all professional on a decent set of speakers (which I'm guessing is due to the upscaling from iOS to Windows).

I hoped there would be a chance of manipulating the genes, and really have an influence on how your organism evolves but all you do is swimming around in a sometimes kind of psychodelic looking environment (with some kind of coral-structure in between) and search for green, blue or red coloured things your organism can eat.\nUsually after 5 minutes in a level you have to search for them a lot and maybe I´m short tempered but after 10 minutes I think it´s super annoying. Other people might call it relaxing but I see no point in searching forever for dots.

It started like "let's just try this one" and finished about 3 hours later with the very last boss battle. Problem is this game seems like unfinished!\nYou are supposed to "evolve" but after playing for 3 hours trying to figure out the way it worked, I gived up. Let's put it very simple: you just collected colored bubbles and if you get a lot of one color your "animal" will change its color and shape. That's all. No real evolving. No real challenges.\n\nGame is very easy (you cannot die!), music is unobtrusive and the world is colorful (but requires a hell of a PC at the highest setting). So it's easy to get hooked in.\nBut after 2 hours you will still be wondering "and now? is this still the tutorial?"... Game itself gives you the response: "this game is supposed to let you pass some time, it has no real objectives". Looking at the achievements you will also realize that you have just finished it.

The game is very fun. It consists of a casual simulation of an evolving life form you control that floats in water and tries to feed itself in order to evolve. The gameplay mechanic is somewhat reminescent of Spore's first stage. The graphics are dreamlike and the art style is impressive, the music sets the ambient rather well and the gameplay concept, although so simple and basic, manages to captivate you for a good few hours. Difficulty wise, the game is incredibly easy but it is meant to be a time-occupier (waster is innapropriate in this context), not a competitive game, although you have that option. While the game is fun, it lacks a few concepts that would have greatly improved it, and it kind of bugs me in a game that is concentrated on evolution: the lack of creature customization, as the creature grows soley based on what type of food you eat, and the lack of an endless mode, where the level is randomly generated. Other than that, it is a great game to spend your "Im so bored" time, and though not perfect, a great indie title.","October 21, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The sound is sufficient for the game. While the controls are not the most intuitive the game plays well anyway.

I have written this after completing the game and all achievements.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nYou explore three-dimensional levels by navigating along the X and Z axies and collecting colored orbs. Once you think you've got all the orbs you want on a layer, you can then go up or down layers. The colors of the orbs are very important because they influence your evolution. Although many of the evolutions seem to add only minor visual effects and slight stat bonuses, you can get special abilities and end up looking really cool.\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nNo one is perfect, but the graphics here are spectacular. While not overwhelming, they definitely enhance the experience, from the awesome range of colors and enviroments in the game to the look of your... organism... thing... they really amazed me.\n\nPerformance: 8/10\nEven on my low-power computer (two cores, $100 video card, 2GB RAM), this ran very smoothly even with everything turned all the way up.\n\nFeatures: 5/10\nThis has no online multiplayer, as far as I could tell. You could play against a bot or create more organisms, but the lack of real multiplayer was a real bummer. The achievements were fulfilling, but not too hard to get, just the way I personally like it.\n\nAmbience: 8.5/10\nI got sucked in to the game immediately. The sounds were soothing and enveloping, and coupled nicely with the graphics. This is one of the few games I would not want to play my own music instead of their music. It was really nice.\n\nReplayability: 4/10\nHonestly, you could replay the game, maybe go down a different path, but the levels are the same, and coupled with the lack of multiplayer and very straightforward gameplay it would be a grind.\n\nSummary: 7.2/10\nGood game, it was a certainly a worthwjile $1 (I think I bought it while it was on sale) and probably a worthwhile use of $5. I had a very good time with it and I feel like it was less of a time-waster than other games, and more of an experience.","August 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Don't expect Spore Cell Stage nor Flow)\n\nAs someone with a great intrest for evolution and with a weak spot for every game that tries to simulate evolution I had to try this game. At first sight this game reminded me of Flow (awesome game), and not as much of the Spore Cell Stage as others where saying. If you're expecting a game like Spore, don't buy this game.\nDue to the beautiful and original visuals the game feels wonderous, mysterious and very alien. But nonetheless the first few stages of this game are very boring and confusing (imo). You're really waiting for stuff to happen, but instead you only get to eat blue, green and red balls untill you ate enough of them to finish the stage. After eating enough of these balls, you'll level up and you're creature will change it's form, but that doesn't really feel like evolution.\n\nAfter a few stages of boringness other creatures start to appear you can eat, even bosses you can eat and defeat. This was quite a (positive) surprise to me. At this point I realized there was atually some challenge to this game. See, throughout the game you've got a 'nemesis' who will try to eat as much as it can, just like you, after you or you're nemesis has prodominemntly ate most of the food in that particular stage, one of you will win. I think that is pretty cool and original.\n\nWhat's also a cool aspect of this game is that your creature will gain all kinds of stats that will improve your creature performances, I haven't played around with that much so I don't wan't to say to much about it. But I think that is part of the game that is meant to be the evolution part.\n\nI feel like this game needs more polishing, it just doens't feel complete. I would like to see more evolution aspects and more challenge, that isn't repetitive.\n\n\n","February 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With in between I want to say it is a good time waste if you need some relaxing fun. If you are a powergamer, this game isn't for you. You'll fly through the levels without much thought and won't even see the fantastic artwork that the designer set the game in.\n\nYou'll try to evolve, get bigger and the largest critter in the pond. But don't mistake this game for a "Spore" spinoff or something even related to it. You'll grow by eating other life, and you have to be careful to not be eaten yourself. If you want a Spore-like game, buy Spore, but leave this game alone. It is more an complex and animated version of a circle of life sim, and it is very casual.\n\nThe artwork and the music have drawn me into this game, the simplicity and reasonable learning curve of the game were some interesting things. And it was at the time I bought it very cheap.\n\nWhen you buy this game and want to play it, take your time and play it slowly. There is so much to discover, see and hear.

I loved Spore, and yes, as so many other gamers have pointed out, this is quite exactly like the first 15 minutes and stage of evolution in the creature/4x game Spore.\nI had hoped the music would be something that would surprise and impress me. But it's some of the most, mellow, ambient of all the mellow ambient music out there. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing, but there just isn't as much variation as I'd have hoped to hear.\nThe visuals, to me, are really impressive. It feels like yesterday I was playing pop-stations and tiger handhelds trying to wring a few grams of enjoyment out of them. Now I'm playing a game that looks like the closest thing I've played to what I always expected "virtual reality" (in a wire-frame style) to look like. I really like it's look.\nThe gameplay is a little numb, but no more so than say PacMan, and I loved PacMan.\nI have hit a bug in what little time I've been playing though. I didn't expect to find any, but since the controls are a little bulky feeling and I can't get the ASDW to work, I often barrel right into obstacles, and I accidentally buried my little guy into what I guess was some kind of paralyzing jellyfish thing that was caught in a whirlpool with the tide pushing me further and further into the jellyfish. After about a good minute and a half of me anticipating some kind of glitch out of where I was stuck, my little germ rocketed up and appearently clear out of the level. Everything raced by and once it finally slowed down, it turned around and restricted my movement to normal speed and only back towards where I came from. I waited about 5 minutes but never made it back to the play-field before giving it up for the time being.\nGet it while it's on sale, I might've been a little unhappy with a typical purchase of Sparkle2Evo, but as demonstrative games go, this one is a decent enough piece of eyecandy that I've so far enjoyed.","January 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There are around 10 levels available, and each level is filled with resources and other organisms you can eat. At first I thought that you just eat everything, but it's best to eat one color resources, so you evolve further. Green resources make you bigger and slower yet you can eat faster, red ones make you move faster yet reduce your eating speed, and blue ones are in between.\n\nGame is fun little time killer that is around 3 hours long with easy achievements.

Just a Flow clone?\n\nMany people say and think this is a Flow clone, I personally have never played Flow, nor have I watched videos so that will not be influencing this review.\n\nSparkle 2 Evo is about a three hour long game, where you control a microorganism where your goal is to eat to evolve. What you evolve into depends on WHAT you eat, so eating red makes you a carnivore, blue an omnivore, and green an herbivore. Depending on which of the three you become you get special little extra stats, for example the carnivore being the fastest. What you eat ranges from bits of food floating around, to giant squids fifty times your size. Also, each animal you eat requires a specific tactic to beat, for example, using the tactic that’s used on a glass squid wouldn’t work on a skeleton, which makes the latter levels in the game more interesting, and creates some great, well thought out boss battles. There’s also an GenLab, so you can see which of the three traits you use the most, and what your current bonuses are (developers said you can use the lab to change your creature, leading to people believing you're supposed to do it in the GenLab, but they were more getting at the fact that you can change your creature based on what you eat). There’s also a competitive mode where you try to eat more than the opposing AI, fun but not too interesting.\nA lot of complaints come from this game 'not looking good' or being pixelated, and not having the option to change resolutions. Well, don’t listen to those, because you can adjust resolutions, and it can look damn near perfect on the highest settings. With that having been said, the visuals are beautiful, absolutely just full of vibrant colors, and this may actually be my favorite part of this game. Various corals, and other large debris define the maps, and change depending on the depths of the levels, and location, which I think can be really good at times. The music, well, isn’t amazing. It’s not BAD, but could have used a little more variety.\n\nNow for the problems, this game is buggy as heck. One of the more infamous glitches causes you to not be able to progress any further on a boss battle you just spent eight minutes trying to beat, forcing you to restart, and possibly having you do it a third time. Another major bug was a missing species that was required to be killed for an achievement, but recently this has been patched. The last bug I’m going to mention is when the keys stop working. Yes, they completely stop, even when you exit to the main menu and the level reloaded, they still won’t work, forcing you to shut down the game and restart it. And the biggest problem in the game, you can’t be hurt. Did a creature ten times your size just bite you? Well, better throw you up towards the surface then. This completely removes any urgency in the game, making it more boring than it should be (entertaining nonetheless).\n\nPros:\nbeautiful visuals\ncomplex evolution system\ngood boss battles (sometimes boring though)\n\nCons:\nbugs, glitches, etc.\ncontrols are… off\nyour “compass” is confusing at first\ncant take damage\n\nI would recommend waiting for this game to go on sale (as it often does) if you get it.\n\nScore: 5/10\nScore (if the three mentioned bugs were removed): 7/10\n\nCurator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/","May 8","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unfortunately, the gameplay is one part pac-man and one part screensaver--there's no risk and therefore no challenge; you can't be harmed, you can't die, you can't lose your progress and nothing tries to hunt you down or harrass you.  I understand that there's an element of ideology here, and I respect the movement toward peaceful gameplay (like the freeware Floating Point); but that model isn't well-matched to a game ostensibly about about predation and survival.\n\nThe idea of branching choice-based evolution--which could have been outstandingly interesting--seems to have been implemented as a hard three-path trinary without significant middle ground between paths.  From what I can tell, if you spend two hours as an exclusive herbivore and switch suddenly to a carnivore diet you don't develop small carnivorous features; you just morph directly into The Carnivore Model for that level of gameplay.\n\nI was hoping for a dreamier, more abstract kind of Spore; Sparkle didn't deliver.","June 14, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The visuals are some what nice, if not a bit painful to look at after long periods of time. The actual gameplay consists of playing as a long serpent-like creature that swims around and eats certain food items to gain a specific trait. In the end, it feels like the cell stage in Spore, only a bit watered down. For five bucks, there are much better games. I might reccomend it if it goes on sale, but even then, a game like Terraria when it goes on sale is almost always going to be a better purchase.\n\n","May 12, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also it does not make any difference, whether you play as carni-, omni-, or herbivore, other than having to collect a different colour of food bits, that lie around the map, doing nothing. You can't attack your opponent or have to protect from him, your playable little worm does not gain any traits and so every level and the goals are pretty much the same every time and the whole thing gets repetitive and boring incredibly fast.\nDon't be fooled to buy it only because it's dirt cheap while on sale - that doesn't make your time spent on it more worthwhile.","October 25, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Most of the time you just slowly swim around and eat evolving pills or harmless creatures.

You are an ocean dwelling creature. You eat and grow. There are basically 3 colors of food. Which color you consume the most will determine the type of creature you'll become:\n- red (carnivore)  => you'll move fast but eat slowly\n- green (herbivore) => you'll eat fast but move slowly\n- blue (omnivore) => medium movement speed and medium eating speed\n\nAt first red, green and blue blobs just float in the ocean and you eat them to practice the movement of your creature. In later levels, you'll encounter other sea creatures in a variety of shapes but basically you always need to stay away from their head (or they will push you away) until you've eaten what parts of their body you can eat, and then go in for the kill by eating their head.\n\nYou can play the game in two modes: competitive mode (default) or 'casual mode'. I strongly suggest leaving competitive mode on and only switching it off if you find the game too hard, which isn't very likely. You see, the game gets pretty easy once you figured out how it works. You start at the top layer' of the ocean. You will see radar 'pings' in red, green or blue telling you in which direction there is food of that color. When you don't see any pings anymore, you go down to the next layer and look at your screen for radar pings. Again you hunt and eat until you don't see any pings anymore, then you go down to next layer and so on. If you want, you can focus (more) on one type of food to become your preferred creature type (carnivore, herbivore or omnivore) but in my opinion that is something better left for casual mode because in competitive mode, it's better to just eat everything you find.\n\nThe graphics are very nice. The music is very subtle and fitting. The Steam Achievements are easy to complete (you'll most likely complete them before you complete the game, unless you happened to miss something). It's a nice game to play for a few hours but don't expect something it's not. Don't expect a twitchy action game or a puzzle-like game that will challenge you for dozens of hours. If the game looks like something you might enjoy, I recommend giving it a go, especially if it's on sale.","May 26","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When I first played it, the game looked pretty nice. Beautiful graphics, whole evolving idea to explore, spore-like gameplay, 3 paths to choose. But after first few levels illusion of "evolving your creature however you want" ended when I saw you get 3 preset creatures depending on which color blobs you ate the most. Gameplay gets pretty repetitive and is not challenging at all. When you first time encounter a new creature, working out how to beat it and which parts to attack first etc. is nice but when you have to kill it for the 30th time all the appeal wanishes. After killing the second boss and getting 100% achievements I've decided to stop playing, because I saw no further motivation to grind through teh rest of the levels. Another con I will give this game is for it's GUI. At 1080p resolution menu items are extremely pixelated, you can't tell between green (completed) and yellow (not completed) level tiles to see which level you should go to next. At least it wasn't botehring me inside the levels because there isn't any UI at all.\n\nPros:\n- beautiful graphics\n- creative enemy design\n- trading cards?\n\nCons:\n- repetitive\n- not challenging at all\n- no customization options of your evolving creature\n- ugly GUI\n\nTL;DR - if you are really bored and it is on sale, it can entertain you for a hour or so (I've completed it in under 3 hours). It is nice to look at and you even get som trading cards and achievements.","May 23","false","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nothisg really kills you, so no action in there; this game is no where near simulation. The only part of it that pushes you to try harder is the ai that tries to pick more points, and fater than you. In that regard it's like a racing game, sort of, since when you reach a certain point count, you win. It's really casual, as much of what you need to do to get points is to gobble up as much food as you can, and little strategy or tactics to do that except to do it fast.\n\nThe other thing that bugs me is the class system, there are the carnivores(red), the harbivores(green), and a blue class i'm not sure about. This game is barely tries to stay accurite to these classes as all of them can gain their colour points by feeding on other organisems. carnivores will often eat inanimate red sphreres too.4\nOne might think that in such a game, where it pretends to simulate an evolution the traits of one class will hold throughout the game... Well this is not the case since every time you level up you might change your appeaence to the other class, seemengly at random. Sometimes the visible traits will transfer to another form, line the carnivore's tail, but it still quite un logical. The only thing that does pass are the mechanical traits, like carnivore's speed, or herbivores agility.\n\nIf you're looking for a beautiful casual arcade game, this is it.\nIf you're interested in an action, or a simulation, do yourself a favour and pass.\n","November 30, 2013","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

One of the final levels was apparently cut short to prevent more bugs from occuring. Also, the level requires an input command for diving that is normally not used (double-click on target area).\n- The game could use a bit more documentation about how things work.\n- Gameplay as a whole is boring. Maybe because there is no fail condition. (OK, if you activate competition mode, it's a bit of an arms race, but that's it.) It lacks a certain something. It is almost mindnumbing.\n- If you really do try to only collect one color as advised, the game is very short. The whole evolution thing also seems very simplistic.\n- Achievement system misses some opportunities for more interesting and motivating ones. They're all mere milestones of normal gameplay.\n\nOverall very forgettable experience. I don't feel like I got anything out of it. I initially bought it almost purely because of the visuals, but they're not as exciting as I thought, since the gameplay is so dull. After 5 hours of playing, I deleted the game data and hid the game, without thinking twice.","June 5, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Nothisg really kills you, so no action in there; this game is no where near simulation. The only part of it that pushes you to try harder is the ai that tries to pick more points, and fater than you. In that regard it's like a racing game, sort of, since when you reach a certain point count, you win. It's really casual, as much of what you need to do to get points is to gobble up as much food as you can, and little strategy or tactics to do that except to do it fast.\n\nThe other thing that bugs me is the class system, there are the carnivores(red), the harbivores(green), and a blue class i'm not sure about. This game is barely tries to stay accurite to these classes as all of them can gain their colour points by feeding on other organisems. carnivores will often eat inanimate red sphreres too.4\nOne might think that in such a game, where it pretends to simulate an evolution the traits of one class will hold throughout the game... Well this is not the case since every time you level up you might change your appeaence to the other class, seemengly at random. Sometimes the visible traits will transfer to another form, line the carnivore's tail, but it still quite un logical. The only thing that does pass are the mechanical traits, like carnivore's speed, or herbivores agility.\n\nIf you're looking for a beautiful casual arcade game, this is it.\nIf you're interested in an action, or a simulation, do yourself a favour and pass.\n","November 30, 2013","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It was a simple, enjoyable pac-man sandbox that was meant more to make a point than to really be a full fledged game. They did not charge for it.\n\nWell, Sparkle 2 Evo is a more fleshed out version that game, for money. The problem is that they completely missed the point. This game has objectives that can act as sources of frustration, and like discrete levels that interrupt gameplay. That isn't neccessarily bad, you don't have to take too much after your inspiration, although I'd argue in this case it was.\n\nIs it a good game? No, not really. It's definitely fun enough but the fact that they somewhat missed the point of what they copied does make for a somewhat worse experience than what you'd get if you just googled "flow in games". However, it's not a bad game either.\n\nThe music is quite decent, but the main thing the game has to recommend it is how it looks. Sparkle 2 Evo is a decently pretty game and being pleasant to look at seems to be a large part of the point of this game.\n\nIf you're looking for any kind of challenge, don't get this game. This game exists because of a few goals added on to a design for a sandbox with difficult that was totally determined by what the player chose to pursue in real time.\n\nIn the end, I'm recommending this game because there's no "meh" option, and because they took the effort to port it to Linux. Along with the price, that sways the balance toward "recommend".","April 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a casual game, not meant for people looking for anything deep or innovative, just a little something to waste some time on your phone while waiting for a bus.\n\nYou evolve your creature by eating either red, green or blue food elements, and the different colors influence how your creature evolves.  These food elements are scattered around the environment and are supposed to evolve you into either a predator, herbivore or omnivore, respectively.  Consuming different amounts of each color produces different visual combinations on your creature, but no change in gameplay.\n\nWhether you evolve as a predator, herbavore, or an omnivore, you still guide your creature around eating food elements.  You don't actually become a predator chasing down fast prey.  You never become an herbivore, swimming around to avoid predators.  You never become an omnivore.  No matter what you do, the game is the same: guide your creature around the world eating pellets.  Nothing is hunting you, nothing is trying to fight you off, prey does not illude you, and your competition AI never attacks you, so there is no reason to evolve in any particular direction.\n\nReally, the whole challenge is in the controls.  This game was designed for touch screens, and I imagine playing it on a tablet or phone would be incredibly difficult.  I played it with a gamepad, and that made everything too easy.  The difficulty should not stem from the controls.\n\nStill, if you're looking for a casual expeience that's beautiful and a challenge on a touchscreen computer, this is all right.

While the game has multiple z-axis "planes", it is a game largely played on a 2-dimensional field, where you basically just guide your little critter to eat things until you grow up.  There are three "paths" to go down, which you traverse through eating colored blobs of three colors.\n\nThere are two modes.\n\nIn the non-competitive mode, you basically just get dumped on a map, and get told to eat everything of one color to go to the next map.  There's essentially no way to lose, but to quit, which I suppose is what makes it "casual", and it's not like games need to be hard to be enjoyable, but there's no particular story, here, to make the world more compelling without it.  There's some "exploration", just to see all the different critters, but once you have seen every level, you've seen everything the game has to offer.\n\nIn the "competitive mode", you have an AI-controlled critter competing with you for food, where victory is measured in hogging more food than the other guy can get.  While hypothetically, this means challenge and desperately trying to hunt creatures for food faster, regardless of color, in practical effect, you can just stay green and vacuum up everything far faster than your opponent, since the extra bits of food from dividing food pieces all count to your total, and you can consume more food from critters than the game expects to count. In general, I could eat several times more food than the opponent, and never once seemed like I was in trouble unless I completely abandoned attempting to eat for a while.\n\nThe big choice in the game about which critter to be is somewhat defeated by the imbalance in the practical use of the different criters.  The "carnivore" red is quick to accelerate, and gets a "dashing" skill to "attack" other creatures.  The "herbivore" green (and I put "herbivore" in quotes because you still hunt and eat other animals, you just want to eat the green ones) has faster eating time (making it so you can eat as fast as you ram through food, rather than skipping over food for a second or so) and has a super AoE suction attack that consumes all food in the area.  The "omnivore" blue (which, somehow, eats a different food entirely from both carnivores and herbivores, rather than just eating both in roughly equal measure,) gets a better turning radius and a defensive sound skill that makes creatures flee from it.\n\nHypothetically, in a game where combat mattered, the difference between an attack skill, a defense skill, and a resource-gathering skill might mean something, but since all you do in this game is eat, the herbivore skill is fantastically useful and makes the game significantly faster and less frustrating, while the omnivore defenseskill is useless since you need to hunt critters, rather than have them flee you, and the carnivore dash attack is pointless since the only enemies that run from you do so across the z-axis, which the dash will not go across.\n\nUltimately, I recommend this game only on sale for the sheer color and fascination of it.  It's odd and interesting, and worth looking at, and on sale, you can get it dirt cheap enough to justify buying it for aesthetics alone, but there isn't enough actual gameplay to keep you in it.  This is a game you can completely "play out" and feel you've experienced everything it can offer in just a half-dozen hours.","November 15, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I found it out in game after discarding the tutorial.\nOne time the AI competitor bugged out somehow, and stopped collecting food.\nObviously, this isn't meant to be a GOTY material here, but I'll give it thumbs up because it's perfect for what it is - a stress relief game, as it has pleasant trippy graphics with soothing ambient music.

There are 3 colors, and each has its own special ability, so if you've gathered majority red organisms, you will have the red special ability and so on for green and blue.\n\nPLAYTIME: Completed every level and gained all achievements in the playtime shown.","May 22","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now when i first saw this game I thought to myself two things. This reminds me of The Munchables (a very kiddish Wii game) and Electroplankton from the Nintendo DS from Nintendo. The game is about you starting off as a newly born organisim in a huge world where you must fight for survival by eating other types of food under the floor of the Ocean area you are currently in. As you "eat" more certain organisims your character will level up and become anything from a balanced character to a Herbivore to a Carnivore based creature. The Controls for this game are simple you can either use keyboard moving with W A S AND D or using your Mouse you can click and hold to make your character swim to the area. The control is this game is very tight. I thought for a game that was only being offered for $5 Wasn't going to be worth my time at all But it is a very awesome game. The Graphics are pretty damn impressive for a game that only wants $5 for it. The Controls are easy to get used to and seeing all the changes in the scenery as you dive or rise in the water (using X to Dive and Z to Rise) all change in real time. Everything from seeing huge Coral multi colored reefs, to even seeing a Whirlpool almost suck you in it is all very colorful and this game should be given a chance. Only thing That is missing that would make this game EVEN better is Steam Trading Cards. Here is hoping the game recieves an update for them. They would be pretty awesome to collect. 9/10","December 24, 2013","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each girr has a different ability, red girr has a speed boost, green girr can have a vacume mouth and blue girr can scare away outher girrs but you have to be in your second or third evolvement in order to use this abilitys To beat a level you must eat all of the food of a serten colour and hunt all the inosent outher girrs of that colour.

Very beautiful and chill, relaxing music.\nThe gameplay is like the first phase of spore which I personally enjoyed a lot but even that was more in depth than this and spore was supposed to focus on a lot of phases and gameplay mechanics whereas this focuses on only the first phase and it doesn't really do it that well.\nYou can choose between 3 different type of sparkles but in reality it doesn't really matter. Each sparkle can eat pretty much everything with ease.\nYou  can't  choose any stats / upgrades and generally there is no real RPG element to eat regardless of there being a level up system.\nI guess if you want a chill 4 hour experience you could buy it on a sale or with a discount coupon but for 5$ kinda hard to recommend.","September 6, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's less a game, more a cyberpet with levels. However, there is something to enjoy here. It is calming, pretty to look at and (as I just did) you can lose three hours without notice.\n\nHere is the problem. The lack of explanation is a big thing. Not being told what your 'special power' does leads to ignoring it. Activating it requires you to stop moving and double click on the head of your sparkle. It breaks the flow of the game to do that. Would it have been such a problem to assign it to a key?\n\nI ate only green and blue food, looking to create a slightly different type of herbivore, but it doesn't matter. You eat enough of one type of food, you level up and turn into that type of creature. I got trapped in red food, had to eat my way out, and changed into a predator. Not satisfying at all.\n\nThere is a really sound basis for a brilliant game here but it feels like it is still in early beta. It feeds the eye and the ear very well, but your mind goes hungry.\n\nFinally, I think it was a boss fight... not sure. A level called the octuary darkness. The control method and view point change in a very strange way. It feels like a bug. Imagine stepping from our universe and into another where up down, left right and back and forwards suddenly meant different things. Like that. Not fun, and not acceptable.\n\nIf you want to chill out, turn your brain off and just relax (why are you lookikng for a game to play?) this will do it for you. Just understand it is VERY limited. I feel bad not recommending this game, because I enjoyed it, but I got lucky and this is bugged and quite empty.","December 1, 2013","false","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Honestly, Spore does a better micro-organisim eat/evolve game. The problem is that despite the level having more dementions, the gameply is very linear. If you've seen the video and read the description, you've half played the game already. Your evolution is essentially random, as you inevidably eat whatever you come acreoss as fast as possible for points, and there is no way (that I found) to modify your creature in-between rounds to say, prune out the junk to try an sculpt the creature you wannted. Nope, only way is to be picky about what you eat, and that wil likely cost you the rounds, as the AI will not be so picky. ... Which basicly turns the game into competitive 3-D Pacman...\n\nIn a competitive 3-D Pacman sense, it's not bad! I, however, expected more... depth, options, and complexity (at least a much as Spore has to offer) and the concept has potiential, but alas, it's just not there now.\n\nThat said, it truly is a casual game, and perhaps the lack of complexity is a feature not an oversight. You may enjoy Sparkles 2 Evo, I for one, am spending time on other games.","December 3, 2013","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You feel like you're trying to guide a tank, not a snake-like organism.\n\nSimilar to flOw, there are multiple layers you can transit through in each section. Each layer contains various other enemies and DNA strands you can consume. The different types of DNA alter your creature's genome, enabling different characteristics. This concept is central to the game, and quite innovative.\n\nThe visual design is superb, with great design cues for the various creatures. The environment feels bare, but that can serve to help focus your attention.\n\nMusic is relaxing and sounds are unobtrusive.\n\nWith better implemented controls and movement, this might have been a fun game.

I bought this for around a dollar from a sale Sparkle had.  For someone like me, who attempts to game on a system that is not meant for gaming, it runs very well and offers mesmerizing graphics.  Gameplay is very relaxed as it is meant to be, and I enjoy watching my organism  grow with every little thing it eats.  Definitely not a hardcore experience - this is meant to relax a gamer after a brutal encounter with the outside world.  The only drawback is the lack of variety the game has.  As an indie, this game has great potential to expand on possibly more evolutions, more nutrients, and  changable characteristics to the organism.","May 31, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played non-stop when I first got it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few bugs (minor spoiler):\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n-Some of the levels were marked as "completed" even though I haven't even got to them yet.\n\n-The boss battle in Octury Deep is literally unbeatable because the game seems to prevent me even touching any of the octupus' tentacles. I understand that you have to use a special in order to descend deeper and become closer to the tentacles, but even when I do, the bulbs are unable to be eaten even though I head for the lowest one first.\n\n-Another Octury Deep bug may be using the special in order to descend deeper into the boss' tentacles. For me, I was only able to use my special a grand total of three times (without being able to even descend) before I'm stuck swimming forever without hope of defeating the boss. It required me to exit and restart the battle again, and at one point even restart the game because the pause options didn't appear. I retried many times, but unfortunately, the bug remained. I couldn't progress through the battle.\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion/TL;DR:\n\nAside from the major bug in one of the boss battles, the game is worth playing. The details are stunning, the controls are pretty smooth, and it overall piqued my enjoyment.","June 9, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, Sparkle 2 does address a few of the issues I had with flOw such as the time it took to eat a group of creatures and the lack of a major change in the appearance of the player creature.\n\nThere is one thing I will specifically praise:\n-Visuals. The colorful, almost alien world of Sparkle 2 is definitely one of the highlights, creature design is overall just as impressive.The Sparkle's appearance also actively changes based on whichever color of food you focus on in that evolution segment. Even focusing on one color has dramatic changes as the Sparkle starts out as a small larva and eventually develops wings, legs, and assorted appendages.\n\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws, and they aren't in short supply:\n-Above all else, the game is relatively short (easily beaten with 100% in 2-3 hours) so don't expect a particularly engaging tale\n-The collision detection is somewhat off and sometimes the passable and impassable barriers were difficult to distinguish.\n-The beginning decision, carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore is little more than a "Choose your color" decision and overall has little effect on gameplay as your Sparkle can eat all colors regardless of their current forme.\n\nOverall, Sparkle 2 Evo is a short but enjoyable title that I recommend if you can get it on sale.","July 17, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely a different game, but far from a good game. The first problem I had with this game was the lack of explanation. It told you the basic idea of the game at the start and immediatly threw you into the deep end hoping you'll figure it out by yourself. There were multiple hours acrossed a few days where I had no idea what to do to progress further in the game. I finally gave up and looked up some form of help, which thankfully there was some in the steam guide section for the game. The gameplay itself is really simple and fun once you figure the game out.\n\nThe graphics on the other hand are amazing. It reminded me of geometry wars. The design for all the different species and environments took me by surprise each time I saw them.\n\nSo TL:DR pick this game up if you can get it really cheap, otherwise I'd wait.","August 25, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frankly, I enjoyed the Spores far better.

The creatures do have certain attributes and some kind of a skill (except for the "carnivore" guy, I have no idea what they are for...

I consider it as wasted potential a bit...\n\nAnd I can't omit to mention that level 13 Octury Deep, which really left deep negative feelings that I won't get rid of easily.

Gameplay is very relaxed as it is meant to be, and I enjoy watching my organism  grow with every little thing it eats.  Definitely not a hardcore experience - this is meant to relax a gamer after a brutal encounter with the outside world.  The only drawback is the lack of variety the game has.

Played non-stop when I first got it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few bugs (minor spoiler):\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\n-Some of the levels were marked as "completed" even though I haven't even got to them yet.\n\n-The boss battle in Octury Deep is literally unbeatable because the game seems to prevent me even touching any of the octupus' tentacles. I understand that you have to use a special in order to descend deeper and become closer to the tentacles, but even when I do, the bulbs are unable to be eaten even though I head for the lowest one first.\n\n-Another Octury Deep bug may be using the special in order to descend deeper into the boss' tentacles. For me, I was only able to use my special a grand total of three times (without being able to even descend) before I'm stuck swimming forever without hope of defeating the boss. It required me to exit and restart the battle again, and at one point even restart the game because the pause options didn't appear. I retried many times, but unfortunately, the bug remained. I couldn't progress through the battle.\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion/TL;DR:\n\nAside from the major bug in one of the boss battles, the game is worth playing.

The ability to customize your creature is somewhat difficult to use, you basically eat different things and hope for the combination you desire.\n\nIts very buggy, and chrashes frequently, fortunately the levels aren't particularly difficult (or long), so don't worry you shouldn't end up loosing too much progress. The game is also updated infrequently, so many of these types of bugs (and a multitude of smaller ones that don't mean much) will hopefully be fixed incrementally.\n\nOther than the players creature (which is reminiscent of a copepod) all of the creatures in the game are real species, which is something I found neat, don't expect to recognise most of them though (unless you are well versed on abyssal marine biology) because some are fairly obscure (its never a bad thing to include obscure creatures in  games, I appplaud it)","March 19, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tutorial is also wrong, it shows opposite key bindings at one point.\nThere is also more visual clutter that has no gameplay relevance, I suppose that comes down to preference though.\n\nThe controls aren't really precise enough to account for the differences between this and flOw. Since in this game you have to pick between different food and manoeuvre obstacles, I'd expect the turn radius and eating cooldown to be lower or the world to contain more empty space and be zoomed out. Currently it doesn't mix too well.\n\nThe menu controls don't seem polished, for example ESC works for backing out of some menus but there are screens where it doesn't do anything at all. The equivalent button is sometimes in the top-right corner, sometimes in the bottom-left one. The menus are also slow instead of calm and reactive (but I don't know how flOw handles in that regard, since the PC one doesn't really have any).\n\nFinally, the default control scheme isn't adjusted based on locale: If you have a QWERTZ keyboard for example, you have to switch to English or reconfigure it before starting the game. (Which is possible, so this is just a minor point.)\n\n\nAt least the music is nice, but it's not memorable by any means.","February 27, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that I haven't found a way to die yet is quite odd, meaning you can't lose unless you play against AI. (Which at the moment isn't providing much competition.) Graphics are lovely eye candy though, so that's a great plus for me.\n\nOverall:\nNot the most engaging game out there, which might explain the 90% discount when I got it, but entertaining for those slow afternoons.","October 27, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely a different game, but far from a good game. The first problem I had with this game was the lack of explanation. It told you the basic idea of the game at the start and immediatly threw you into the deep end hoping you'll figure it out by yourself. There were multiple hours acrossed a few days where I had no idea what to do to progress further in the game. I finally gave up and looked up some form of help, which thankfully there was some in the steam guide section for the game. The gameplay itself is really simple and fun once you figure the game out.\n\nThe graphics on the other hand are amazing. It reminded me of geometry wars. The design for all the different species and environments took me by surprise each time I saw them.\n\nSo TL:DR pick this game up if you can get it really cheap, otherwise I'd wait.","August 25, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weakest point is probably the two large bosses, which admittedly can be a bit tedious compared to the rest. All in all though a very nice experience, though admittedly quite short.

You swim around in liquid eating colored particles which give you different growths as you progress in evolution.  You cannot die and you cannot lose the game unless you are playing competitive and you fail to eat faster than the AI controlled Sparkle.\n\nWhat made this game fun was the layer shifting mechanic.  You can swim in to the background or the foreground while hunting for food.  The effects are great and the animations on the creatures encountered are fantastic...  it reminded me of watching microorganisms with a microscope in college.\n\nI bought the game on sale at $1.24 and I enjoyed the game, but I know it is not for everyone.  The game gets repetitive fast and there is little difficulty, even during the boss fights.  Over all the concept in the game has potential to become great, but as it is Sparkle 2 Evo is more an "experience" then a game.\n","April 8, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The competitive mode faces you off against an 'opponent' (i use the term loosely as yourarely encounter one another and the only evidence that there is an opponent is a small bar at the bottom telling you how much it has eaten) Whilst the gameplay is bizzare to say the least, It is oddly calming. In conjunction with the ambient soundtrack and the beautiful (allbeit bright) neon graphics, this game is an escape from many games and offers a wy to 'unwind'.

They are just bigger, thus taking longer to defeat in the same way you defeat everything: by eating it.

There you start as a bacteria, which eats the smaller ones but have to get away from the bigger ones, until it grows and gets revenge on those suckers. Well, Sparkle 2 Evo is similar to that part of Spore with some exceptions. For example, here you simply cannot die - the worst thing other organisms can do to you is kick you to the previous layer. Also, levels are similar to each other - you swim, eat elements, go deeper, sweem, eat elements, go deeper, level complete, start over. And that makes the game really boring. Yeah, I know it is meant to be relaxing, but it's not - at least for me. When I'm bored, I don't get relaxed - I get annoyed. And that game annoyed me as hell. So I strongly don't recommend it - that stage of Spore is a lot more fun, and there are more stages. Well, if boring equals relaxing to you - you can give Sparkle 2 Evo a try.

For future reference, I bought this game during a steam sale but I might have just bought it full price if I discovered it before now.\n\nART 10/10\nSo, the art of the game is very very veeeerrrry good, so much so I would say its the highlight of this game, despite the other features. It is absolutely stunning. I have a decent PC so I immediately turned the graphics up to full, and they do not disappoint. These are some of the best visuals I've seen, with everything from the color-faded background to the transparent 3-D 'walls'. I love these graphics.\n\nMUSIC 8/10\nThe music has a kind of tranquil feeling to it, and helps to relax into the game. It flows very well with the gameplay, and the sound effects aren't dominating over it, nor vice versa. There is a very good balance here in my opinion.\n\nGAMEPLAY 6/10\nThis is pretty good as well, although its not a revolutionary game in this aspect. I have had fun so far playing this game, and I think I will continue to do so, but the art and the music are the main hooks for me. It has a very similar feeling to the early stage of Spore, but it is the entire game. If you liked that, you would probably like this game.\n\nSTORY 2/10\nYou are evolving a thing. That's it. That's the whole story. Not that this game really needs a story.\n\nCONCLUSION 7.5/10\nThis game is very fun and relaxing to play, and is great if you have a spare 5 minutes to kill.  This game doesn't quite make it to an 8 as I don't think it has the ability to entertain for a long period of time. Also, some of the mechanics in the game could use some refining but that's just me. I would recommend this game, though getting it in a sale is probably best.","June 2, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very cheap. Under a buck.\n\nYou control a "creature" and move it around to eat things. You have the option to eat red, blue, or green things. Each one will help shape your creature. Red to make a carnivore, blue for an omnivore, green for an omnivore. Each type has different eating speed, movement speed, and maneuverability. There are 14 stages. You have two options for play. Solo or vs computer AI. In solo mode you need to have your creature eat all of one color of items in a level to clear it. In "competitive"/vs computer mode your creature must consume more of/all of one color object before the computer controlled creature does.\n\nControls are simple, either point and click with mouse scroll wheel to move up and down in depth, or keyboard. Simple controls, fun to play. The background music is nice ambient music. The visuals are great, lots of transparency and light.\n\nIt's short, but still very fun for the short time it takes to finish it.","June 13, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed the entire game with all achievements in 2.4 hours, so while the experience was fun, it was short and lacked content. While the gameplay itself does not break any new ground, the game was essentially an interactive light show. It is fun, relaxing, and provides a nice afternoon activity when you are sick.\n\nI also went into this game expecting what was essentially a standalone version of Spore's cell stage with relaxing music, but this game lacks some key features such as customizable creatures and other RPG elements. The creators may want to consider incorporating some of the elements of what made Spore so fun, and give more freedom to the player. A branching RPG system could also elongate play time and make me more inclined to purchase a sequel in the future.\n\nI have heard this game has some bug issues and the creators have a thread dedicated to finding and patching these bugs, but I personally did not experience any bugs and found the game ran exceptionally smoothly for a graphical masterpiece of this caliber.\n\ntl;dr I like this game, but it has plenty of room for improvement.","June 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eating some helps to progress while other times that same animal does not contribute to level progress.\n\nAm I upset I bought the game?  No,.. I spent $0.49 and played it for about an hour.  If I can get one hour of game play for every dolllar spent on Steam, I consider it a good deal.  Spend $20 = 20 hours, spend $1 for 1 hour.  So in this case I hoped for 30 minutes and am happy I spent an hour on the game.\n\nAny more then $1 and I would pass on the game.\n\nq77\n","December 19, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed the entire game with all achievements in 2.4 hours, so while the experience was fun, it was short and lacked content. While the gameplay itself does not break any new ground, the game was essentially an interactive light show. It is fun, relaxing, and provides a nice afternoon activity when you are sick.\n\nI also went into this game expecting what was essentially a standalone version of Spore's cell stage with relaxing music, but this game lacks some key features such as customizable creatures and other RPG elements. The creators may want to consider incorporating some of the elements of what made Spore so fun, and give more freedom to the player. A branching RPG system could also elongate play time and make me more inclined to purchase a sequel in the future.\n\nI have heard this game has some bug issues and the creators have a thread dedicated to finding and patching these bugs, but I personally did not experience any bugs and found the game ran exceptionally smoothly for a graphical masterpiece of this caliber.\n\ntl;dr I like this game, but it has plenty of room for improvement.","June 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That may not sound appealing to some people but in all fairness, I don´t think this game was made with the purpose of raising excitement. The game does look beautiful and that´s probably it´s one strong aspect because it lacks depth in everything else.\n\nThe game is supposed to induce a sense of relaxation but because of all the swaying motions and camera view I found it more nauseating than anything else. For that matter, it´s a good thing there´s only 13 levels which can be played through within two hours. Two more levels if you´re planning on going for 100% achievements.. in which case I must warn you that one of the two extra levels is almost impossible to beat with the keyboard & mouse because of some apparent bug that causes you to get stuck in empty space. Either use a controller or switch to one for this particular level and it should be fine.\n\nMaybe a fun game to pick up on a sale but because of it's simplicity not worth full price in my opinion. The only thing that could justify the price would be the 'pretty graphics' but if that's what you want out of a game, you can do much better.","May 12, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks so nice and sleek, the design is all shiny and beautiful looking, but the gameplay itself is terrible. You basically swim around with clunky controls (which where the developer's intentions, mind you, but they're a little overdone and can just be down-right infuriating to use) and eat small pieces of food. You either eat red, green, or blue, to become a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore, respectively. But it doesn't really matter, since you can't control evolution anyway, you basically change shape for a few levels then you just stay the same from what I can see. You can't modify your creature like in SPORE (which this is clearly a ripoff of), there's no real fights or anything, you basically can just swim in misshapen circles and try to eat the tails of enemies without hitting their heads, and you just clear the food out from level to level. Yawn!\n\nSparkle 2: Evo is sometimes frustrating and always very boring, which is a real bummer because it looks so pretty.\n\n4.1/10","January 5","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very cheap. Under a buck.\n\nYou control a "creature" and move it around to eat things. You have the option to eat red, blue, or green things. Each one will help shape your creature. Red to make a carnivore, blue for an omnivore, green for an omnivore. Each type has different eating speed, movement speed, and maneuverability. There are 14 stages. You have two options for play. Solo or vs computer AI. In solo mode you need to have your creature eat all of one color of items in a level to clear it. In "competitive"/vs computer mode your creature must consume more of/all of one color object before the computer controlled creature does.\n\nControls are simple, either point and click with mouse scroll wheel to move up and down in depth, or keyboard. Simple controls, fun to play. The background music is nice ambient music. The visuals are great, lots of transparency and light.\n\nIt's short, but still very fun for the short time it takes to finish it.","June 13, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sparkle 2 Evo has you playing as a tiny, crystaline organism, that slowly evolves into different forms based on what colour(s) you eat. Red turns you into a fast attack-type, green turns you into a slow defense-type, and blue is a mixture of both. Your looks, abilities, and speed all change depending on what you choose.\n\nWhile enjoyable, this game is very casual, and more of a stress-reliever than anything actually competitive.

Firstly, it takes a special kind of person to like this sort of experience, as it is not combat related, rather it focuses on the more raw and wild aspects of life. You are a tiny sparkle trying to evolve your way into the big leagues, and while this game may appear simple, it is rather complex. The gameplay is not actually as repetitive as one may first believe, but it is in fact exciting to see how different your creature becomes with each mutation. The art style is unique and beautiful, the soundtrack is amazing and as mentioned before the creature evolutions are well thought out (and frankly a little freaky XD). That being said, this game will come off as boring to those who enjoy a more fast paced experience, but for people who want to sit back and relax to detach from the outside world, this is the perfect remedy.

Sometimes, you have to eat the pieces off of other lifeforms, by chasing them around and biting them in the butt (yes literally).

There is no explination to what or why you do stuff in the game. You just eat to get bigger, thats it.\n\nGAMEPLAY: There really is none, you just move and eat. Nothing more.\n\nCONTROLS: You move to eat. You do have some moves that you can use, but i could never figure out what they do. I used a game pad. It worked fine.\n\nSOUND: The one thing this game has going for it is the relaxing music. But it gets old fast as its the same track in each stage. (At least i think its the same track. Might just all sound the same.)\n\nGRAPHICS: It looks like the kind of game you would find on the nintendo 3ds E-shop. Thats not bad for the 3ds, but here it just feals flat out boring. I also had a problem of not being able to change the graphics settings. The menu was there, but when i would change it it would just change right back.\n\nREPLAY VALUE: Next to nothing.
