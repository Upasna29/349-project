Vaccine War is their first game but what is most impressive is that it is also the first game to use their specialized tool that saves time animating pixelart. This tool is called the Magic Pixelator. They claim that with this tool they can create animations of 20 frames in just a few minutes rather than being forced to spending significant time drawing each and every pixel. The characters within the game demonstrate that they were able to create fantastic character animations that feature particle effects such as fire and smoke as well as the game’s environments. This is a great achievement for a small studio that is made up of just four full time employees and a collaborative team of two others.\n\nTheir game, War Vaccine is set during the Spanish Civil War but is a completely fictional tale. This is a setting that doesn’t often get portrayed in video games and as such it gave me a reason to be interested in the game before I began as well as checking out their new software tool. I can tell you that although I am yet to complete the game that I am thoroughly impressed with my exposure to the game. It uses the Unity engine but it’s so much more than your standard indie throwaway game made with it. There is solid production value throughout the entirety of what I have experienced thus far and I have yet to run into any bugs. That’s not to say there aren’t weaknesses with the game because there are but rather that I appreciated the game as its whole.\n\nWhat I will pinpoint as the primary weakness in the game is the combat. The combat system has a lot of potential but it needs work. It’s simply not as precise as what it needed to be. Your attacks will have the appearance that they should be connecting but for some reason they do not. This is generally with the melee weapons but can extend through to guns and range weapons. This makes the cool abilities such as running attacks and jumping attacks very frustrating to use as you’re just never sure if or when the attacks will actually land and play as intended.\n\nI would also dearly like to see the dev team add achievements to the game. It’s a game that would do well with achievements for reaching certain points in the game and maybe arbitrary ones such as number of enemies killed, etc. Trading cards would also make for a nice addition to the game.\n\nBut it’s really the artistic flair that shines through here. It’s a perfect prototype game that demonstrates to other studios that their software tool has tremendous value moving forward. I would like to see what the team can develop next and whether or not other developers consider purchasing the right to utilize the Magic Pixelator in order to give their games a big boost in the quality of its animated pixel graphics.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","1.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The general gist of the story is that Daniel tries to escape the terrors of war by settling down in a farm in Spain to live a peaceful and harmonious life, only for it to break out where he lives. His main goal is to find and take back his daughter from whoever took her (whoops, spoiler alert) and find out why whoever invaded his farm attempted to kill him (whoops, again!)\n\nTrying my best not to spoil what I have already spoiled about the game lore, the above paragraph is about the whole backstory. You must fight the bandits and different armies within the country to get to your objectives around the map and ultimately, try to live in peace and harmony again. There is game dialogue that you can read if you want to which adds to the feel and emotion of the game. If you aren’t interested in that sort of thing, however, you can skip it easily. I recommend reading it though!\n\nThe game has its own unique play style, where you move between the ‘layers’ of the map. Daniel is such a good citizen that he literally can’t jaywalk. The reason for that is because there are preset paths that guide you around the map and you cannot move outside of them. This can sometimes be tedious and slightly annoying, but also makes the game different from other games of the genre, a new experience definitely worth trying.\n\nThe combat system Vaccine War uses is new to me and as a new experience, I enjoy it a lot. Hiding behind the cover of a crate or rock and peeking out with your loaded gun or grenade to attack your enemies with whilst utilising an angle-based aiming method is a big plus for me! You must take down riflemen, grenadiers and CQB experts with guns, grenades and knives before they take you down, or you die. Not for good, though, as long as you interact with a mailbox every time you see one you should be fine.\n\nThe bosses of Vaccine War are a good challenge as each of them have their own combat style (one throws barrels, one throws grenades and I won’t spoil the rest) but can be easily defeated if you get your timing right and find their weaknesses!\n\nThe visuals are also unique, 2D and pixel-based with a healthy amount of 3D models involved (like houses, fancy awnings, fences, bridges, etc.) The different parts of the map introduce different colour palettes and objects such as cover for you to hide behind in a combat situation (as stated above) and enemies controlling different parts of the map.\n\nThe game features some nice acoustic music which turns hardcore if you find yourself in a standoff with an enemy and sound effects that you would expect from a game with guns and grenades. The music that plays is different for the different parts of the map but also plays on a loop so it can sometimes get repetitive. If it does get on your nerves you can turn it down in the settings and turn on some music, maybe hip hop or electro, whatever floats your boat!\n\nAll in all, Vaccine War is a new experience and something I would definitely recommend to people who enjoy platformers/sidescrollers and/or wish to try something new!\n\nVaccine war has earned a score of 8/10 dingos.","May 18","true","3.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The music is awesoem. I love the way it changes when youre in combat.  The environments are really nice and just pleasant to be in.  The story didn't do much for me but it was above average for a videogame I suppose.  The graphics are really pretty.  I love the way the plants sway back and forth.  Little touches like that are great.  Unfortunately what brought the game down was the combat.  A lot of my attacks didn't connect even though my weapon was right on the guy.  Gunplay was slightly better but it seems like it was designed for a controller instead of a gamepad.  It also felt like the bad guys barely reacted to being shot which was kindof lame.  I wouldn't recommend it at this point but if theres ever a free demo I'd recommend giving it a try.","March 24","false","3.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","2"

Pixely 3d graphics are awesome and I don't think I've seen a game with this art style ever.  Could use a bit more smoothness of animation but thats a minor thing.  Too bad the guna and hand to hand combat is clunky and unfun.  The dialogue is a bit weird too like english wasnt the writer's language.","March 21","false","1.1"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","1"
