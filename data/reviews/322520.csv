They finally brought Empires to PC. I'm still in shock.\n\nThe short version: it's good. You can take over all of China, now, using a turn-based (every turn is a simulated month) system. It's a little repetitive, because you will take over a territory, rest a month, and then an enemy army will invade that territory, so you've now played the same map twice in a row, and sometimes that twice becomes three or four times before you have a chance to move on.\n\nThat aside, I don't have any serious complaints with it. It's slightly different in many ways from the regular Dynasty Warriors series, but the ability to strategize and take over regions is the largest change. There's less of a focus on pick-ups/power-ups in this game, and your generals can all be assigned a specific number of troops for each fight, but for the most part it's the same combat and characters that long-time fans of the series will recognize. There are strategems that can be selected before battles that give your officers special moves to employ. You don't seem to have direct control over these, or when they happen, you just pick what you think would be most advantageous for the map in general, and roll with it.\n\nAs a port, it doesn't have the widest range of graphics enhancements, I wouldn't call it "next-gen", but it looks better than ps3. I didn't have any problems with the porting, and my x360 controller worked fine.\n\nThe inlcusion of a character edit mode, and the DLC for costumes for older games (especially, for me, DW3) make this a must buy for fans and a great (although the strategy parts can be confusing at first) place to start the series for newcomers. Very highly recommended.\n\nEdit: After playing a while I noticed the enemies will pop in and out some, but that's something the series has been known for. There's also, inexplicably, no autosave, so save often.","February 26, 2015","true","9.5"," 339 of 414 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","339","414","14","28"

Fantastic customization, allowing you to create your own kingdom! Combat is the same as the previous Dynasty Warrios 8 game, although there is a new addition called Strategems that allow you to turn the battle in your favor! The high price tag may scare away a few people, however, you will definitly get your moneys worth if not more in playtime! DLC that is included (as of release date) is purely cosmetic, meaning you gain access to all the gameplay features!\n\nOverall Score - 9/10\n\nPros\nFantastic Customization - Create your own Officer, Soldiers, Banners.. Even the horse you ride into battle!\nSolid Combat - Take down hordes of the enemy army, easily racking up 500+ kills per battle!\nImmersive Cutscenes\nStrategy Control - Decide what your Empire will do. Will it Invade the neighbouring army? Or seek Alliances?\nNew Features - Includes all the previous features of other Dynasty Warrior Empires games, as well as introducing a new feature - Strategems - which allow you to build Ranged Towers, Taunt enemies, and various other things. Now you can truly decide the outcome of your battles!\nUnlimited replayablity - With the option to create your own Scenarios, this creates unlimited outcomes and replayability. I can see myself racking up plenty of hours playing this.\nCons\nPoor Graphics - Compared to other games released in this time frame, the graphics are no where near top standards.\nHigh Price - Unless you are a hardcore fan of the Dynasty Warriors games, this price tag may seem high for some.","February 26, 2015","true","10.8"," 196 of 245 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","196","245","5","1"

Unfortunately, this didn't happen here.)\n---FOR EXAMPLE: In one of my playthroughs with a customized character, all I did was assassination quests. On my attempt to assassinate the ruler, I was provided with two cutscenes. This is what I wanted more. You can get a few more unique cutscenes as a vagabond unit. But once you become a ruler or join a kingdom, it just doesn't become as exciting.\n\n--Limited amount of options to do (By the time you reach maybe around 20+ turns, you will realize that there's really nothing much to do when you're in "The Strategy" room. It's extremely redundant with very lacking cutscenes (like how your current economy is, or how people view you.. type of cutscenes. Rarely any of that is in here...\n----You will have one, but look... I've been extorting and levying the ♥♥♥♥ out of my people to only be granted a cutscene where they would gladly hand me a meatbun and everyone is happy... NO, just NO. You'd expect something or ANYTHING to happen after extorting or levying your people so much, but nope. There are no consequences other than making your virtue more evil, which is completely pointless. This is just lazy.\n\n--No sense of connection between characters during battle. (Remember when you married a character and you run into him or her in battle, he or she will actually say something nice to you with consideration that you guys are a MARRIED COUPLE? Nope, none of that in here. Just the same line as if you two first met.)\n---In addition to this, when you betray your ruler and rebel against his/her own kingdom, you'd think that the enemy ruler will say something to you in regards to something with "betrayal" or "deception" once you meet on battle. Nope. Again, it's as if you two first met... Completely shatters the immersion.\n\n--Did I already mention that there's not much to do in the Strategy room? I wanted something more and NEW goddammit. The most frequent options you'll be doing is Invade, Raid, Interact, and finishing your Merit Quests (Strategy Objectives).\n\n--Terrible ending. Seriously? You just recap every cutscenes that I have already seen as the ending with the cliche "watching the sunset with your officers as doves fly by" that last for only 10 seconds as the ending? Remember in DW7 Empires, the ending varies by your ambition (Good or Evil)? NO, none of that was in here!\n\nI don't mind the redundant combat/battles, but atleast make the game more immersive. This is basically a downgraded version of DW7 Empires and slapping $50 bucks on you, tricking you into buying it by showing very little parts of "new features" like getting married and having children. Lol, don't even get me started on that thing.\n\nHere's my conclusion:\n(1) If you are new to Dynasty Warriors, buy it. Because, you'll be spending countless hours on customization and checking out the many types of weapons available.\n\n(2) If you have already been playing Dynasty Warriors for awhile, don't expect something big and new here. The mechanics and combat will be the same, except for a couple of new weapons/moves from the original DW8 and XL. Don't let the whole getting married and having children concept fool you! It's just not worth it.\n\n(3) If you are a die-hard DW fan, I have nothing to say to you, but rather envy your persistence to continue playing and supporting this repetitive game.\n\nNOTE: The people who will dislike this post are most likely the die-hard fans trying their best to support this game as much as possible. If you are a normal person, and just wants to search for something new such as myself, you will read and deeply consider my review of this game, and then decide if you're willing to pay $50 for this lazy and quick money-grabbing ♥♥♥♥ by those greedy and CHEAP ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at KOEI.","March 7, 2015","false","28.2"," 229 of 323 people (71%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","71","229","323","14","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FMChao/recommended/322520/","FMChao","FMChao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FMChao/","60 products in account","I love Dynasty Warriors, espically those in the 'Empires' side-series. That's why it feels very disheartening to say that I actually  can't  recommend this title to everyone. A lot of what's been added I really do enjoy. The new strategy options and quests are a lot of fun, the 'Way of Life' title system is really cool, and the ability to create custom units, banners, and scenarios/campaigns is something I've been insanely excited for! Not to mention that no matter how repeative the combat is, I still get a kick out of the endless slaughter!\n\nThat all being said however, there is a lot about this game that does not sit right with me. There are a lot of cool things you can do during the strategy phase... when the game allows you to do them. If you're trying to progress through the ranks of a kingdom, expect to not have very much freedom to do outside of what the ruler tells you to do. As a Lieutenant/Commander, you're essentially bound to the will of the ruler until you get a promotion (which if your playstyle is more evil, will never actually happen). Even then, once you're promoted to a Prefect, Marshal, or Strategist you lose the ability to do things such as quests, where some of the more unique scenarios and interesting cutscenes are. It's almost better to just stay a Free Officer/Vagabound Unit or just become a ruler yourself.\n\nAnother issue is that the game just feels cheaply made, both in it's inital form and its translation. Enemy and ally AI and pathing is abysmal. During some of the stealth quests (which I actually find a lot of fun, espically assassination quests), I've seen the patrol units stuck running in circles or stuck in place because they accidently collided into something and it threw off thier programmed path. It makes it hard to progress when you have 5 mins. and you can't move because the patrol got stuck in a wall and will sound the alarm the moment you step too close.\n\nPresentation is also rather off-putting and a tad glitchy at rare moments. It's funny how the game doesn't even resemble a lot of what the promo screenshots from a couple of months ago looke like. One of my favorite stupid moments was when I was launched fifty feet in the air using the Sword & Hook air launch combo.\n\nThe english translation is trash. You can tell they didn't care enough to double check the sentence structure so you don't get things like 'Promoted to Liu Bei by Marshal'. Disappointingly, the English dub cast does not appear in the game, which means that all dialogue and cutscenes are in Japanese. This would not be an issue usually, but in certain cutscenes they don't even bother to put subtitles in. Some of the coolest cutscenes are ruined by the fact that I can't actually see what the characters are saying. This game was made cheap, and it clearly shows.\n\nI WANT to be able to recommend this game to everyone, but these issues are so frustrating and distaseful that even I can't take a sort of humorous pleasure in them. If you like Dynasty Warriors as a series, enjoy a good slaughter, or can get really into character customization I can recommend this game. However, if you're bothered by poor AI, a lack of free choice, and incredibly cheap translations, don't bother or at least wait until it goes on sale. If you hate Dynasty Warriors...well, No. Despite all of this I still enjoy this game for what it is.","March 16, 2015","false","200.6"," 81 of 100 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","81","100","2","1"

But, I'll go into it none the less.\n\nDynasty Warriors 8: Empires is a stand alone expansion / spin off of the latest game in the series. The game sees you create a character and aim to unify ancient China. Forge bonds with historical figures, wheel and deal with leaders, find a spouse and raise a child. As long as it helps you control the country, you better believe that you should do it.\n\nThe game is split distinctly into two halves. The first being the action game. This is your standard Warriors afair. Capture bases, commit genocide, do not pursue Lu Bu. As this game is based off of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends, you get two weapons of various abilities and affinities to swap between, air cancels, parrys and much more.\n\nThe second half is unique to the Empires series. And that's the politics mode. In between each action sequence you are placed at your home base. From here you make desicions based on how you want to complete you goals. Do you want to protect a caravan that is about to be attacked in hope of gaining some resources and good karma? Do you want to invade a region that is attempting to usurp you? Or maybe you want to coerce folk into joining your cause? It's all here.\n\nNow onto the technical aspects. This is a port of the PS3 version. It does run smoother however, my game never dipped below the 60FPS it was locked at. But in a way, it doesn't excuse the blurry texture or the muddy detail on the armours. One interesting thing of note however: some faces look better in this version then the otherwise supioer PS4 version. It's more of a personal preference of course, but this of course doesn't make up for the lackluster port.\n\nOver all, if you like the Warriors games, pick this up. It's one of the better ones. If you're new to the series however, you might want to look into picking up Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends, as that is a bit more beginner friendly.\n\nAlso, if you have a PS4 you may want to pick it up over there.","February 28, 2015","true","10.2"," 83 of 109 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","83","109","2","0"

It has been over six centuries since the life of Confucius. If, as you claim, Liu Bei truly had the benevolence of a sage, and likewise the Mandate of Heaven that comes with it... then he would be reigning in Luoyang by now."\n\nThe strategist was visibly shaken, and dropped his fan and copy of the Thirty-Six (plagiarized) Stratagems. He stormed out of the room crying those Shu crocodile tears. The same tears that they cry for the "oppressed people" of Cao Wei, who today farm in peace, on land granted by Cao Cao, using government-provided tools and oxen. There is no doubt that at this point our strategist, Zhuge Liang, wished he had served under Cao Cao and supported his efforts to restore the Han emperor. He wished so much that he had the Imperial Seal to present to the true emperor, but Heaven had delivered it to Cao Cao for that purpose!\n\nThe students applauded and all enlisted in Cao Cao's armies that day and accepted the true Han Emperor as the Son of Heaven. A phoenix named Tianming flew into the room clutching the complete poetic works of Cao Cao along with his commentaries on the Art of War in its claws, and shed a single tear at their beauty. The Classic of Poetry was recited in its entirety several times, and Confucius himself showed up and extensively annotated all of the Five Classics.\n\nThe strategist lost all his troops in an ambush set by Sima Yi. He returned to Shu in embarassment and was executed unjustly as a traitor by his unvirtuous ruler the next day.","March 4, 2015","true","28.8"," 47 of 65 people (72%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","72","47","65","54","0"

I did them in one go.\n\nThis is the video showcase of the review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAOWHBGpAYE\n\nLet's take a look at the good an the bad, as I usually do in my reviews.\n\nThe good:\n1. All DW8 characters are there, so you can always play your favorite one.\n2. You can make your own character with a very deep customization - stats, full-fledged physical appearance and armor, essentially putting yourself into the game. The game boasts a lot of armor sets, and you can pick a moveset of your own, even mix and match it from existing characters, which works amazingly.\n3. Start as a commoner or a mercenary, become a ruler. Sweet!\n4. A lot of replayability provided by a free game mode, various campaigns (4 or 5) encompassing different periods, and the good old throng of heroes to play with.\n5. You can even marry and have a child. Pick your fave woman or dude from the DW series and give her/him a good tumble! Watch your kid grow, be proud of him/her as your child becomes a lieutenant in your armies, feel bad if he/she deserts or gets captured by an enemy ruler.\n6. The AI: it might just be me, but I have seen the AI doing quite decent beelines to your main camp. If you happen to be engaged in a battle that is further away from it... GG. Good job AI.\n7. The good old flashy gameplay with lots of attack variations, musou attacks and over 3k hit chains. Sexy.\n8. Make your own story - nobody farces you to become a ruler, you know... You can be anything between a commoner and a ruler you know. Go ahead and roleplay a bit :)\n9. Japanese voice pack - to me it is a good thing. I was complaining about the lack of vapanese voice option in XL. I got it, and here I get it by default. Cool!\n\nThe Bad, I guess:\n1. The graphics - everyone whines it is a PS3 port. I never saw that as a problem, cause I enjoy the gameplay, and for me the game works at 60 fps at max settings, which is more than good for me. Still, out of solidarity with the comminuty, I put it in this section.\n2. In the campaign, heroes seem to be tied to time periods, so if you may not see your favorite one in the campaign you are currently playing.\n- Easily offset with the character creation tool though. So since neither Zhurong or Wang Yi joined me in the Rise of the Yellow Turbans campaign, I had to go ahead and marry Lianshi. Wait, wait! You think I am complaining?\n3. The UI needs a huge overhaul, but I got used to keeping a KB around to check everything as necessary. Still kind of pisses me off now and then.\n4. Alt-Tabbing to answer somebody on skype or do something (for example), plainly crashes the game, so make sure you have saved it in advance. Quicksaves between missions are crucial.\n5. Might just be me, but I havent found a way to pause the game during a mission. (As pointed out, it is F1).\n\nConclusion: there is so much that this game does well, it is hard to dismiss it. The engaging gameplay, the ability to craft your own story, the crazy replayability and the option to have your own lineage easily outweigh all the negatives that most of the gamers complain about. I will surely be dumping tons of hours in this game. I don't regret one bit for picking it up at full price.","March 2, 2015","true","38.6"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","41","55","2","7"

It makes you think of how you want to aproach the development of your kingdom on higher difficulties, versus plowing through hordes of enemys.\n*Huge cast of characters and weapons to choose from.\n*Lots of dialog based cutscenes.\n*Your character can be anything with the title system, from a noble hero ruler to a despicable tyranical despot.\n\nCons\n*Extremely repetitive and easy gameplay if your playing on normal difficulty or lower.\n*It makes the Player character to safe. It advertises that generals can die in the field but I have yet to see this happen. It also prevents the enemy from capturing your or you dieing.\n*Some maps feel really small and the limitation of generals that can be out on the field make the game incredibly boring.\n\nThe game is really fun to play casually, but it is too repetative for the hardcore completionist or players of the series. Would recomend for casual gamers 8/10.\nFor the hardcore players who would spend hundreds of hours into this game to complete everything, I would not recomend because of the sheer volume of content as well as highly repetative gameplay.\n\nEDIT: A special thing I would like to note, the game graphics are NOT that great. There are alot of titles out there that easily destroy this game in terms of graphics. Dynasty Warriors has that flavor to it that makes it a fun game to play, despite all the bad graphics.\n\nAnother thing I should note is that the game series is roughly based on a novel called 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' which was roughly based on events happening around the time the book was made. Alot of the characters are depicted as younger and prettier to appeal to the Japanese culture. This can be good or bad depending on your tastes.\n\nIf I had to give a rating on the Graphics in this game, I would rate them as bad. Aside from the special cast of characters, the custom made officers and regular foot soldiers looked EXTREMELY BLOCKY AND LOW RESOULTION. Its not as bad with the main cast of characters, but it is visible.\n\nThis game is just kind of terrible in terms of trying to compete with the graphics out there. The game soley rolys on the fun and sheer replayability rather than anything else, but it does leave the user wanting more.","April 18, 2015","true","97.2"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

I'v played both as a ruler and an officer and got no complaints, enjoyed both. If you don't like tedious fights then be careful when your empire grows large, I'd end up with 3 other empires attacking me repeatedly turn after turn forcing me to replay the same defensive battle for a few turns until they have no troops left or I've captured too many of his officers. Another warning is if you use a controller the game wont switch to PC prompts but to be honest it's not hard to figure out, especially if you've already played DW8:XL. I hope Koei continue to make PC releases, I'll definitely buy more and I do hope they make a dlc upgrade for graphics to get this on par with the PS4 version but if not no biggie.","March 2, 2015","true","72.6"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","33","47","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/animeation/recommended/322520/","animeation","Professor Quantum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/animeation/","262 products in account","OMG still in shock with the release of empires on PC. I have long heard of it, but haven't been able to play the "Empires" of a Dynasty Warriors game since it usually goes out on PS3 or XBox. And here it is, right on my doorstep, on steam. What better way than to test it out.\n\nThis review should be unbiased (Sort of), as I have been a dynasty warriors player of Dynasty Warriors 3, 4, 6 (5 skipped due to not being on PC), 7, and 8. I have experienced all the 1 vs 10000 army battles, while slaying down all that stands in my path (including gathering the courage to stand against the mighty Lu Bu, though mostly getting my blade handed back to me 10 times fold).\n\nAnd this dynasty warriors has been a blast. You get to keep your 1 vs 10000 action, slaying ten thousands of soldiers and officers on the battlefield (Though I play this as an Assassin's Creed game, always targetting the officers first). The new addition is the Empires side of it, where you get to choose to be a ruler, where you can command you kingdom, and take over the vast land of China, while slowly threatening all the kingdoms around you to just give up and hand over their land to you, or you can join as a free soldier, joining any kingdom you want (I remember the time I joined Cao Cao's kingdom as Ma Chao, then ran away when he started to lose his battles over to Sun Jian's place. Then after that, the same again to Liu Bei, and yeah. You get the idea. Betrayal is the way to live here, like Lu Bu :P).\n\nAnyway, the point is that you can always run around, making friends with officers, even becoming BFFs with them using the "Swear siblings option" (My siblings on my first playthrough were Liu Bei and Sun Shang Xiang (Yes, kind of ironic, judging by the historical site, but oh well), and they helped out a lot (kind of)), though you can only pick two siblings (Which, many people complained about, though many people reasoned with Liu Bei only having two, and if there are more, the "Sworn Siblings" wouldn't feel special anymore). You can also get a spouse in Empires which can provide you with a child to fight for the next Generation (Dynasty Warriors 9!).\n\nThe "Create new officers" option was also a blast. I spent basically half of all my Empires time creating new officers and sending them on mock battles. Each of them all had different abilities. I enjoyed ordering them around and having them do formations that made them confused. Anyway, you can also create you own scenerios.\n\nPriceless moments of kingdomship and leadership include the ordering of the final battle. What I tried was putting timid people like Xiao Qiao as the leader. Suddenly Xiao Qiao became very "Leadery" (Yes, the word doesn't exist, but oh well), and started ordering people around. The ironic part was that she was ordering around the Wei Forces (A setting that was accidently set by default, haha).\n\nAnother moment is putting Liu Bei and Sun Jian as my subordinates under Cao Cao (The three kingdoms united!). And basically, random officers started taking every kingdom's places. But basically, the empires options are a lot like Romance of the Three Kingdoms in the Ipad or Iphone, if you have played it, also by Techmo Koei. There are a lot of priceless moments I have encountered in this game, that have made me gone WTF in scenerios or have laughed until I cried due to knowing the historical reference and just watching the what-if scenes drives me crazy.\n\nOne thing I would have Techmo Koei improve is the price of the costumes. I mean, I like all those costumes, they are very creative as DLCS, but serioesly? $12.99 dollars just for buying a couple of captain falcon and power ranger suits for my characters? I mean okay, it is limited edition, but seriously. Another feature I would have Techmo Koei add is online battles, as they would really make this a very memorable game. But I don't really care anymore. The important thing is that I have experienced Empires myself and have experienced all the cries and joys and laughs of the game.\n\n8/10 is the fairest score I can give for the game, considering all the pros and cons. To sum it all up, this game was truly one of the best so far that Koei had ever released. I really like all the features that have been offered. Two thumbs up, even four with my foot thumbs, for Koei to be creating such a game that has been able to get me hooked for so long.","March 1, 2015","true","44.8"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","33","49","0","0"

Alas, I was wrong. First off, Koei needs to just stop trying to port their games to PC. They don't seem to give a crap about how they put games on the PC, and just throw horrible console pots onto Steam. Its as if they don't get a crap about PC Gamers, and only look at us as cash cows, a free source of income. Dear Koei, I don't want a crappy Mcdonald's hamburger, I want a In & Out hamburger.\n\nNow to talk about why I don't recommend buying Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires:\n\n1. Direct console port- They put as minimal effort as possible to port the game. No optimization whatsoever.\n\n2. Graphics and Resolution- You only have two options, "Texture Filter" and "V Sync." You change resolutions by cycling through them one at a time and confirming each and every change until you get to your desired resolution.\n\n3. PS3 Port- Its not even the freaking PS4 port, its the PS3 version. Don't even think about running it in 1080P unless you want a horrible unscaled experience with stretched out images and very grainy graphics. If you want to see how bad the textures are, just go to character creation and see how bad the outfits look.\n\n4. $49.99 Price Tag- Its the PS3 port which is $39.99, yet we pay $49.99 for the same damn game.\n\n5. Button UI- Even if you use a controller, the button UI layout will still show the keyboard shortcuts, making you confused at first as to what button you need to push.\n\n6. The Game is Easy- I started a quick playthrough just to see how it was. I played on hard and the enemies just stood there and waited to die. The AI is horrible.\n\n7. The Game has bugs- The little bit I played, I married my waifu and had a kid (yes you get through content really fast in this game.) The moment I tried to name his, game crashed.\n\n8. $118 dollars of DLC at launch- Its basically cosmetic stuff, but the pricetag for some of that stuff is rediculous and all the DLC is twice the price of the game.\n\nThere might be other things I haven't mentioned since I rage quitted and don't have a lot of play time. Needless to say, thanks for another crappy port Koei. I can see you think we are not deserving of your best efforts, and I can clearly see you think of PC Gamers in a bad light. Its all good, you lost a fan and never will I buy another one of your ports again.\n\nIf you really want to buy the game, wait for it to go on sale. It is not worth 50 bucks.","February 27, 2015","false","23.1"," 330 of 588 people (56%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","56","330","588","42","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/recommended/322520/","janusan89","Archangel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/","270 products in account","Short Review:\n\nA nice sidestep of the DW franchise to the tactical/strategical path plus 8: it has a lot of stuff to make you replay the game and the editor is one of the best of the series, but unfortunately it feels lacking in comparison to DW:E7.\nHowever, considering this is the first time a DW has come to the pc, meaning that more might come too, I highly recommend give it a try especially if on discount: it's fun and still has the DW charm to it.\nDon't bother if you want variation or don't like action/brawler games.\n\n\nLong Review:\n\nI've followed the Empires series for a long time now, starting out with DW:E4 (which I think it's the first of the Empires series? Please correct me if I'm wrong)) and I always loved their unique takes on the game and how it's basically up to the player to flesh out the campaign. On top of that you are able to make your own characters fight each others and with the latest installments the editor is now very well made and gives a lot of customization choices (and space).\n\nStill I can't deny that this one installment in particular seems to be the most lackluster of all and that the more I played, the more I wanted to see things happening in game, making it feel more like lazy work.\n\nA lot has been improved: the editor is definitely the best of the series (for me at least) and you can edit almost anything, even single musous that you want: ever wanted Lu Bu skill set but with Diao Chan's Musou? You can! On top of that you have far more slots to create, have a lot more of color choices (for some reason DW:E7 had less colors) and even more weapons to choose, some of which are from the DW:8's DLC.\nSure, the editor is still stuck with those pre-made assets and outfits and almost all of them are taken from previous Empires Installments, but it's very nice to see them implemented into a better editor that lets you make all sorts of characters: from giants to dwarves, from busty ladies to Lo-I mean young girls. Overall it's a nice addition and I hope they keep doing this for the next installment too.\n\nNow for the game itself...well it's still well made and I see they improved somethings, using the mechanic of vagabond-officer-ruler taken from DW:E6 (yes it started there) but amplified a little more. Still I can't say I have seen a lot of difference at all and I might forget some details, but overall it feels the samey.\n\nAs a vagabond you just wander around the land, take quests and if you want you can choose to serve under a lord and make them the most overpowered forces in the land by giving them flash victories within 5 minutes. Or just keep doing quests because why not, but as a wanderer you won't be able to "win" the game: it will send you back to the main menu without even rolling the credits, or the ending cutscene (unless something has changed?).\n\nAs an officer it's pretty much the same too: you server under a ruler that with the right rank you can give your take and ideas for the land's conquest, or make your kingdom flourish in money or else but nothing much is done here. At each council you're also able to partake to a max of 3 goals to achieve within that time spam (4 ingame months) in order to get more merit points (the experience points) and level up and to upgrade your equipment if you got the right shop in that land, as you can make them yourself by building them. As an officer you are given some choices and options but aren't as important as the ones of the ruler, which I will mention briefly.\nThe main issue as an officer however is that your ruler is a joke for the most part and unless he's a warmonger (as in, a maniac) he won't bother attacking other kingdoms or anything and simple increase your incomes for no real reason: I was often rich and had everything maximized but my ruler wouldn't attack! I had to give him that suggestion myself (after a promotion) to do that. And to get promotions you need to do a lot of sidejobs, so it becomes easily longers but not really fun. I can safely say that I didn't have much fun as an officer because I felt hindered more than anything.\n\nBut as a Ruler it's totally different: as a Ruler you're given a lot more choices - yes even invading (DUH!), and also to split the land between your officers for maximizing protection: that way whenever your land is under attack it's that officer's job to defend it, instead of yourself. Of course it doesn't always work but it helps if you don't want to do defend that zone yourself. You are also given the choice to order your people around the battlefield (you can also as an officer, but only if you got the right rank and also if you're given the command of the battle, but I wasn't able to able to command many battles as an officer), and on top of that I forgot one additional detail of the new game: the stratagems, which are essentially skills that you use for either strategical help (like turrets near a base, or flame arrows for lowering the hp of enemies around the base) or healing or even teleport to base. I think they're ok but nothing too gamebreaking but if done well they can really be gamechanging, especially if you're near losing.\n\nAlthough you get to die twice before you lose the match instead of once.\n\nOther additions were also made but don't feel well implemented: now you can have children with your spouse but it's so cheaply made that they might as well not insert it because when you get it, the game pops out a soldier telling you that you had a healthy child and then you get to name it. It's so disappointing and really feels cheap.\nOn the other hand, your child can become an officer and will share abilities between the parents (one of my child shared a blind eye...it was so funny I even made a screenshot. Talk about healthy!) and it's surprisingly better implemented because you see the family "somewhat" relating together as the parents see their child start their fighting...but that's it: as soon as you fight your child is no longer considered yours, your wife/husband is not yours, and everything is the same as there's no special lines of dialogue in battle between married couples and feels so badly done, especially since I was waiting for this feature in a long time.\n\nThe game has also the usual scenarios to choose but they're less than before, but then you get the free scenario where you essentially play with random generated kingdoms for random fun everytime: in this part however you can make also your own kingdoms and use them into premade scenarios to play for some specific ideas, as the kingdom edit is far better than the previous and allows you to put 10 officers into it and also customize the soldier, banner and color. Overall it's a nice addition but this is up to your imagination, because while the game is big it also feels lacking some features...and also polish.\n\nThe game feels very unpolished despite being a port, which is very depressing because I know the games can be better (heck I played Samurai Warriors 4 on the ps4, and that game is a joy for the eyes too). Sure this is still a good game overall and you get a lot of content, but I can't deny that the lack of "actual" new features got me bored pretty quickly.\n\nDespite the improvements and a welcome addition to the Empires series, I would recommend the game if you actually never played any of the series before, because for once I felt really "bored" at playing this entrance but that's because I played every other installments before this so it's hard to not notice the differences.\n\nBut if you haven't, you'll have a blast and even if flawed, I can't say that's a bad game.

Koei Tecmo have made horrible PC ports of their games throughout their entire time on PC. DW8E not only brings the last-generation PS3 graphics instead of PS4 quality for their port, but also does not include the online multiplayer co-op that both PS3 and PS4 have. At the same time as it offers a lesser product, it charges the same as the current-gen PS4 console version; a full $50.\n\nOn top of all of this, menus are atrocious to navigate on PC. Controls are in no way optimized for mouse and keyboard, with various features that any PC player would normally expect lacking or missing completely. Even when a controller is plugged in, navigation is clunky. While various features of the game itself are enjoyable, the entire experience is aggravating and feels like a watered-down port done on a cheap budget for the sole purpose of printing money for KT without giving it the love and effort that the consumers deserve.","July 28, 2015","false","45.5"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","40","64","2","0"

The game, howver has not strayed far from its established formula.\n\nThe character interactions are terrible. When compared to other Koei titles like DW8XCE and SW Chronicles, it pales in comparison because it lacks the relevance of character interaction. For DW8XLCE, when you play as a legendary hero, you are immersed in his story and values which are quite enjoyable to witness. For SW Chronicles, your custom character is made part of history and interacts with the prominent figures of the time. Again you see characters development as these figures develop their own morals. In DW8: E, you can play as a historical figure or as your own character but it lacks the features of the two aforementioned games. Marriage and sworn sibling vows are barely rewarding. You get a confession, get engaged, get married, have sex and bare a child (whoo that was quick) and it means little apart from getting another officer in your army.\n\nWhen compared to its predecessor, DW7: Empires. there are fewer cutscenes, events and movies which could have slighly remedied the immersion problem.\n\nWhy should this matter? "Its a dynasty empires game, the series has never been known for good immersion." That's exactly the point. Every Dynasty Empires Game so far has had the same problem and they can all be described as repetitive and boring. Picking up any other title from the series would net you more or less the same amount of satisfaction you would get here. If you hate games with these qualities, this is not for you\n\nEvent Battles aren't very exciting. If you came from DW8/XLCE and you enjoyed its scenarios but found the missions tedious or wanted to plan your own method of attack like a tru strategist? Then you'll be slightly disappointed that some event battles like Hu Lao gate have been retconned to a different map that is quite bland.\n\nGraphics bring shame to the master race. I was so excited that I purchased DW7:E to curb my excitement while waiting for its release. The graphics of its predecessor had me ogling at the games gallery for extended periods. When I saw the character models in DW8:E I wondered if I bought the correct game because of its poor quality. Granted the game was still in its early stages when I played it, but its release state wasn't exactly the best form it showed to its consumers.\n\nAllies are still useless. Yes the game wants you to be a one man army, but in a game where army movement and "cooperation" is a game component, you'd expect they'd be able to stand up for themselves every now and then instead of flooding your log with "Officer so-and-so's unit is struggling", forcing you to have to be all over the area which is ridiculous considering you are just one guy. Your allies break if it comes in contact with something harder than a feather pillow.\nPut this game on hold for now, your money would be better spent on Koei's other Titles like SW4 or Toukiden","May 8, 2015","false","99.0"," 56 of 94 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","56","94","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nedrear/recommended/322520/","nedrear","Thamalandis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nedrear/","64 products in account","As an introduction:\n\nThe last Dynasty Warriors game that I played was 6 and the last Empires I played was 5 on my actual Playstation 2. So when this was optimized for the PC and up for grabs, I didn't hesitate to test it in a sale, as one of my friends seemed to like it fair enough. Further, I did like them for the stories in 5 and the general challenge on higher difficulties. So when I compare this, I will mostly compare it to 6 or 5 Empires. Keep that in mind!\n\nReview:\n\nThe series has come a long way since DW 2 - one being a Beat 'em Up and thereby doesn't count - and had some reinterpretations. The most notable was DW 6 which revamped famous characters like Lu Bu. Let me just make one thing clear, I am glad they switched back to the old character designs for Lu Bu. They didn't do this for all of them until DW 8 Empires, but he was such a huge departure! The black armored and highly painted drag queen look didn't fit him at all. Now he looks graceful and deadly again. He still has his new weapon with his daughter owning his old hellebarde.\nThis minor point aside, how does DW 8 Empires compare to 5? As I previously mentioned I haven't played 6 or 7 Empires, so if any change was made prior, I can't judge it.\n\nThe gameplay has expanded with the Free Officer mode, so even losing your country does not end the game. You don't even have to start with one. Now you only lose upon death, which in this iteration is far harder to achieve then in 5. In 5 though you switched rulers then, here you are bound to your character. Something one might find less grand in the overall picture as the idea of the battling generations of the three empires falls flat with this feature.\nThe huge amount of events that DW 5 Empires boasted was significantly reduced in favor of clear and less events, with less forced or even complex triggers. That means some things nearly never happen. Also the amount of historic scenarios has been greatly reduced. This does streamline gameplay, but lost a lot of the story-telling focus of DW 5 Empires I enjoyed.\nWhile the own officer area has expanded too with more visual features and the ability to let Steam share them on the internet with others, most of them will be named weird as not many immerse themselves in the Chinese history or naming convention. And some just look plain weird. Thus I tended to execute them whenever I got one with a bad name. Nothing personal, but foreigners have nothing to do there. So while this feature is a nice gimmick, it didn't find support with me. One can turn it off though. Following this, one can also build their own custom scenarios for the map and share them online.\nIf you achieve certain goals in order in the game, including the new but VERY repetitive quest system, you can get new titles that change your officers special abilities. If you unlocked one, you can set it to custom rulers by default. This is a nice goal for the long term, but will be a grind for certain special titles that tend to get overwritten by higher ones before aquiring them. So expect a lot of planing here.\nThe greatest change to the game was to the campaign and developements mechanics. So if you played DW 5 Empires, depart from that, and fast. Provinces still have local resources that must be unlocked with production buildings, but those count for the whole empire and not locally and some need a huge empire to begin with as they need up to 4 or 5 or 6 of them. And each province only has 2 bulding slots! This also includes schools to learn new battle tactics. This has also changed from DW 5, as you decided upon those tactics after you acquired them prior to the month and how to use it. Your advisors were thereby extremely important in DW 5 empires. Here, while the mechanic with bribes and special abilities has become more intriguing - especially the abilities, they do little that is important. Waiting for the Moloch strategem was important in DW 5 or others on high difficulty. Here you just call ONE. They are not such great game changer and affect the whole turn. Depending on the advisors ROUGH character, they might build something or do some politics, though. Yet, you can steers those anyway and force them to comply.\nThe system is only for the player to become an advisor. As a ruler they matter not, sadly. Further the intimidate ability is so broken, I won a extreme difficulty campaign in 5 years with its help. I only had to fight 5 chaos battles - all awfully hard with low starting equipment, mind you - overall unless I abused the province damage mechanic upon attacks. Something that makes the game a lot easier too. If you have money, you don't need to defend, you get a general with mass repair and just fix the provinces back up. This makes the game once again far too easy. This includes UNLIMITED savestates on Chaos difficulty.\nThe aforementioned battle mechanics that gave boons prior after being purchased in DW 5 Empires with the help of your advisors are permanently learned here and can be used in any battle. The only positive change here is the interactive element of tactics that beat each other or the fact of preparing and faulting an enemies grand ploy. For a general mechanic the old version was more immersive, reflected the permanent costs and more challenging in a long campaign.\nThe one thing I missed the most were the many cutscenes and collectible end movies from the past... and the story. But since I had departed from the repetitive gameplay for years, it felt REALLY refreshing for the first moment in a long time.\n\nAfter all this, what is my judgement of DW 8 Empires?\n\nPro:\n- Free Officer Mode with Quests to get your own empire and equipment going before taking on the land\n- Potential to become advisor or ruler\n- Better personal battle mechanics since DW 5\n- Forgiving gameplay (Unlimited Savestates on Chaos, rare conquest through neglicience)\n- More Character Design Options\n- Character and Scenario Sharing\n- Titles and internal goals to "collect"\n\nContra:\n- As a ruler, your officers regardless of post don't matter, only their abilities.\n- Advisors have limited impact on the game, your directive does.\n- The new strategic campaign mode has been reduced in difficulty and streamlined, feeling less important\n- Abilities are always available, losing their unique and game changing touch\n- General difficulty reduced overall (westernized gameplay)\n- Less historic scenarios and events\n- Less cutscenes and beautiful music\n- Unless you know how, you have to deactivate the custom officers in general to prevent XXRoxor45 to appear\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you like the DW series, 8 Empires will change some things up from 5 and deliver a new and fresh way to play this spin-off series for once. So if you always wanted to focus on one character, are new to this spin-off franchise overall or have a less masochistic side to yourself, this game will keep you entertained for hours. My rating would be Finish it or if you enjoy such games, Complete it and see all of its facettes.\nFor the die hard DW fans who still own an old PS-System and DW 5 Empires and don't believe in a future remake, play this, enjoy it, then go back to your old friend and see the marvel that was DW5 Empires once more. The graphics will never compare, but enjoy the music, the detail to stories and events, the scenarios, the strategic map and importance of advisors, and rule China once again like a true master on Hard or Chaos. DW 5 was a game made on the pinnacle of the DW series story drive and focus. That focus hurt the gameplay of DW 5 itself with its character focus instead of the game campaing, but it was a marvelous uptake for the Empire game that only had appeared with DW 4 Empires. And I actually enjoyed the stories of DW 5, gameplay aside.","March 10","true","100.6"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","4"

In general at least for me it is way more fun and in the next days and so on I will probably easily surpass the time I did spent on Dynasty Warrior 8 Xtreme Legends.\n\nI think it's easier to point out the negatives as they were few for me:\n\n- Graphics are pretty bad, probably a PS3 port. My goodness, why not just port PS4 this time? It would be excellent. The map textures are noticeable bad ( mind you, I did play on max graphics ) and even of the cannon fodder characters.\n\n- Some may see it as a negative, if you plug your controller it doesn't change the icons to help easier management.\n\nIf you did enjoy the other DW game on Steam, this one you will have a blast. If you didn't purchased the other game, I'd recommend this one over that other  which is mostly focused on storyline while this one has lots of replayability.","February 27, 2015","true","53.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

It's Dynasty Warriors, so if you're into that, that's great. And the strategic game is fun if not shallow. It just feels like the whole thing is what those "Conquer all of china" modes in the main line of games should be if they were better fleshed out, instead of a standalone title (let alone a $50 title). That, and this port is even lazier than the lazy-but-acceptable DW8XL. No English? No controller rumble?\n\nI definitely don't think it's worth the full price. I got it on a sale so I don't feel too terrible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterDiddles/recommended/322520/","MisterDiddles","TR-8R","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterDiddles/","162 products in account","This review was initially postive but after rereading my review and thinking about what I've said and asking myself, "Do I really recommend this game?". The answer was no. After everything I typed, I thought "yeah, I had fun so I recommend it." but that was because I was fine with it. After reading what I put down, there was a lot of negatives so I thought about the people I would give it to, they wouldn't enjoy themselves. So after thinking about it, this review is negative.\n\nI can't say anything about the graphics since I play everything except for the Texture Quality on low so everything but the officers look like ♥♥♥♥ because I have a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer. The gameplay itself is pretty much what you expect, you grab a weapon and pretty much kill everything in sight. The dlc weapons have come in without having to buy it which is quite nice like the bench, boots and the flame sword. So if you're expecting anything from the gameplay, you're pretty dumb to expect that. An issue that is known is that ALT-TABBING will usually crash the game depending what menu your at. So be sure to save often since there's no autosave whatsoever or you'll have to restart.\n\nThe strategy in the game using strategems is actually quite nice. Some are more useful than others so you'll eventually have the 6 strategems you'll forever use. Large scale ones are quite good. They can either make or break a battle and it snowballs fast which I do enjoy and makes me feel like I deserve it especially when I'm losing. HOWEVER, ♥♥♥♥ any officer that has SWIFT RAID (most notably Guan Yu) If I am disadvantageous in a battle and order everyone to defend. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ officer with that strategem will constantly use it and teleport in an enemy base inside enemy lines and proceed to say he's in trouble. Specific strategems for offense and defense like Fire Attack for advancing or Unity for defense should be used when the order is given, otherwise they just kill themselves.  The turn-based part of the Empire Mode is alright. I wish you could make alliances without it being a objective or that I could threaten another province without a specific officer having the ability to. As an officer, it feels like you're the only one doing anything like raiding and inviting officers which other officers do only if you're a ruler. They should've made it where like when you're a ruler, the ruler AI would make policies instead of invading every war council because being an officer is just a chore. You literally do all the work from invading because they can't take over a region without you, you do all the defending because they won't even try and they won't even try to increase your resources other than the guy that recruits troops randomly and he isn't even an officer. The shop, academy and blacksmith is kinda useless unless the prefect or strategist builds stuff for it which they won't and It involves having multiple ones. It honestly feels useless because gameplay is  easy already because the AI themselves aren't too great. They don't attack when you have an opening and are only a problem during 3 or more officers. After playing a couple more hours, I've noticed people take note of you if you're decimating them. What Koei should have done to make it rather interesting is that if someone notices how well you're doing they need to buff that officer and make him target you. When I say buff, I'm saying like double to attack, defense and speed and even super armor. (the super armor might be a bit much) And If they do beat you, there should be penalties like morale down. It would've made you feel like you were too good and you were enemy number 1. Instead they just say "Holy crap, that guy is really good!" and just keep doing what they were doing. They need to make it seem like we are really good and needed to be taken down. They also need to make enemies more aggressive and not scared to start swinging at you. I honestly felt there wasn't enough interactions between officers on and off the field. Like I would've liked my wife Wang Yi to at least not just give me a gift but also heal me by spending time together randomly like Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires. It felt like she could see I was working real hard and needed a break. Also being, there is dialogue for someone finding you suspicous however, I never could find where it would've been said. Even when I make my own ruler exile like 15 officers and make most of the regions unhappy. None of them say anything about it or even try to make them happy. No one really notices your actions and if they do, it's just the enemy and ask you to join them. Like no one has ever requested reinforcements, requested a joint attack, and no one has appeared as a guard.\n\nAlright, now for the character customization. It's fairly good with many choices. You can make a variety of outfits, have many different looks and use all movesets, EX attacks and musou from both Dynasty Warriors 7 and 8 including the 2nd EX attacks from Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends. What I feel is like a miss was that you couldn't change what weapon type the weapon had like the Spear had whirlwind or that the Dragon Spear had dive. It would've been nice to switch some of these weapon types to make it feel more personalized. I personally love the moveset of the Double Voulge but I hate whirlwind. The customization for horses, banners and soldier are quite bland, nothing really special. I do like downloading other peoples custom characters they upload. A lot of them are pretty cool. You can see a lot of funny ones like I downloaded a custom group that were all Dwarves. The only complaints I have with the customization might just be personal reasons but I found the voices kinda unexpected. As in, I wish there was a gallery alongside the other Musou characters where it displayed their lines like the line they say when a battle starts. Also, there should've been at least 2 voices of an evil type. I wanted to make an evil character and the voice I thought sounded the most evil ended up saying "I'll be the light" or something like that so it was really disappointing.\n\nOverall, the game needs lots of work. It decided to do something different and overall, didn't do every well. It lacks things present in the other Empire titles. If you're a big fan like I am, you'll probably buy it but you'll know what you're stepping into. If you're not a fan then just steer clear of this one. If you're still curious about Dynasty Warriors, I'd say buy Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends since it has way more to offer and gives a good introduction to the Three Kingdoms.","June 26, 2015","false","112.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I originally started playing these games with Dynasty Warriors 5: Empires. I stuck with the Empires games over the normal series because I liked the open-ended game play and the ability to choose-your-own adventure. Plus, creating your own officers and building your own empire in ancient China was extremely fun! DW8E's port to PC (along with its DW8 counterpart) has been less than satisfying. I've played very little of DW8E and I can already tell that it's difficult to play. Here are the reasons why:\n\nController issues\nThis game has NO optimization for controllers... at all. First off, what game that allows you to use controllers doesn't put camera control on the right thumbstick? This one apparently. I use an Xbox 360 controller and the camera rotation controls are put on the LT and RT buttons, which is insanely difficult to control in the heat of battle. Also if you want to customize your keys to fix the LT/RT camera rotation problem, all of the buttons are labeled as JB1 or Z-Axis - (which, if you're not completely comfortable as to which button is which on the Xbox Controller, just confuses you) and any keys displayed on the UI are all keyboard keys. There is also no mapped key on the controller that matches what the Space Bar does. So any time you need to press the Space Bar to do anything in the game, you have to press it on the keyboard. Seriously Koei, you made this game for the Xbox and the PS3, can you not just port over the control schemes for each and put them in the settings? This is just getting downright lazy.\n\nVoice-overs\nThe game forces you to use the Japanese voice-overs. There isn't even an option to pick the English voice-overs either. There's not even DLC to give you the English voice-overs (although if you had to pay for that, I'm sure fans would be incredibly upset). I don't know why when Koei/Temco have released console versions of DW and DWE with English dubs only, why they would suddenly change course and give you the Japanese voice-overs without any option to use it or not. Even in the Naruto games they give you the option of using the Japanese or English voices since it's all about which version of the show you watch. I love the English voice acting in the games and I've gotten used to it. Now I have to hear the Japanese voices and that means reading subtitles during crucial points in the game. Sure, the dialogue was mostly repetitive and once you've heard it a few dozen times, you don't even need to bother reading the text any more, but when it's all new, you find yourself distracted since you can't understand the Japanese language (that is, if you're like me and can't understand Japanese). The English voices should be patched in, free-DLC'd in, or something. It should not just be a Japanese-only game.\n\nThe DLC\nDW has been notorious for giving you extras in the form of DLC. There's lots of customization items from outfits, weapons, and scenarios that are locked away in neat, little DLC packages. Each one of these runs you anywhere from $5 to $13. When the main game went on sale during the Steam summer sale, all of the DLC's pricing was left untouched. This goes to show you that the devs obviously want you to pay money for the DLC over the actual game. Hoping that when you buy the game, you'll buy all of the DLC at once with it (and it costs well over $125 at full price). I know, I honestly thought about buying it when I bought the game too. But I hesitated and I'm glad I did. The content packages are pretty light and are mostly cosmetic, not really adding anything useful to the game. There's one scenario content DLC there but it seems like the devs just took the original Japanese description, ran it through Google Translate, copy/pasted it into the English version, and it's really hard to know what you're actually getting when you buy it. I understand in this DLC-happy gaming world we're in, companies are going to do the hard-sell on DLC over the original game, but when $125-worth of DLC doesn't go on sale with the main game, it says something to me... the original product is not that great while the devs hope to get your money with the DLC instead.\n\nSome good points\nController issues aside, the gameplay is still the same DW fun. Part of the charm of the repetitive gameplay is being able to just be a super badass on the battlefield curb-stomping your way to 1000+ KOs. The new interface, although clunky, is interesting and gives you tons of options to play with as a Free Officer or as your own ruler. The graphics are pretty good, although one time I was looking at my character with some really shiny elbow guards that probably shouldn't have been so shiny... The game also lets you customize your own army, using all of the details right down to what your banner looks like, what your soldiers look like, what your horse looks like, and who your officers are (I think they can only be created officers). These get implemented into the game as well and can add some new flavor to the game. There's TONS of room for customization, so you can spend a lot of time just creating things on your own. If you know how to use the Scenario Creator, you can end up making replayability almost endless. It's just a shame that TONS of the content that can be used for created characters is locked away in DLC...\n\nIn conclusion\nAll in all, this is a bad port. I don't think Koei/Temco are even going to try to fix it, unfortunately. I think it's part of the fact that PC gaming is still 2nd fiddle to console gaming in Japan. Japanese devs don't respect PC gamers since they don't make them as much money as the console gamers do. So they churn out a lazy port to the PC and know that fans of the console games, like myself, will buy it without really understanding that their ports will be garbage. I've certainly learned my lesson on this and I'm not going to be buying any more DW ports to the PC, at least not until I can get some reliable information that they've fixed some of the major issues with their DW8 and DW8E ports.","July 19, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This would be the one. I took my PC compatible game pad and went to program it into the game settings mode and found that it only allows you to program four directions, the same as the keyboard controls. I realized that I had been taken to the cleaners. It makes the game nearly unplayable since you have to run in a constant zig zag pattern to be able to hit anything. No accuracy what-so-ever. It makes the game pad as useless as the keyboard. They didn't even try to set up game pad controls for the PC. It is simply a horrible port from console. Probably be the last time I by a dynasty warriors game. I've been playing them since their inception. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, console to PC port. It is all due to the combat controls.

If you are a returning fan of the series this review will mostly be irrelevant to you.\n\nThis game is simply not finished yet. It is a blatant console port with terrible pc controls and there is no tutorial that I can find. The game simply just dumps you into a campaign and you have to make heads or tails of the situation yourself from the beginning.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to check or change keybinds in the middle of a battle, the mechanics of items and building are not explained at all, and supposedly if I equip the item for a horse I should start with a horse but that never happens.\n\nThe camera is god awful and there doesn't seem to be any way to make it simply follow over your shoulder. Instead I had to resort to manually adjusting it all the time which is a huge pain. I could be wrong and there might be a way to easily set the camera just like with a number of things I mention in this review but the total lack of a tutorial or help or support just makes it impossible to find.\n\nThis game also happens to be extremely glitchy, just not in the usual way. In battle it performs fairly well and while the graphics leave a lot to be desired it is at least fluid and decently responsive. However, this game has a lot of random fatal issues. It has crashed or froze and needed to be terminated three times in the few hours I've played it all in different situations.\n\nFurther I cannot seem to save in this game and I have no idea why. A quick online search shows a post in these forums asking the same question with no responses indicating a lack of customer support and/or forum help. The company in general seems to not have an English language department and communication is terrible.\n\nPros:\nBattle sequences are decent if too easy.\nLots of characters.\n\nCons:\nNo tutorial/help.\nBuilt for console, terribly ported.\nCamera is inexcusably bad.\nGraphics are pretty bad.\nTons of crashes and bugs.\nEnglish language side of things seems to be deserted.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of this series you probably have more general knowledge about it and could enjoy it. However for people just now getting into this series, it is a complete disaster. I wouldn't recommend it to you even if it was free.\n","March 20","false","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It lacks any polish.\nIf you want a good game start working your way back through the series. I loved 6 Empires, and have many many hours on it on 360, but this is just not the same. After acquiring officers you can't have a second player join in all types of battles, there are many solo missions.\nTo think that KOEI has the gull to ask you to purchase DLC for this unfinished excuse for a equal in a great series is gut-wrenching at best.\nI bought this game to play with a friend locally. After spending a little time customizing characters, and going though the many options now available in edit mode, and getting the characters made, I was sorely disappointed after finding the character in the game and not being able to play co-op in the first battle I chose, and then being stuck trying to figure out why there was no way to get the second player to join the game because I had chosen raise flag as a third battle.\nMost game series I tend to leave with Japanese audio, but DW has been a game I choose to leave English on. There are times you need to focus on your battle and don't have time to look at the subtitles. If I would have read closer I would have understood that this game does not have English as an option at all.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a waste of money. If you own any previous Empires game, you're already in possession of a better, more complete game.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. DON'T DO IT.

Do they need more time to learn the ropes? Well, they already made DW8 so it's not their first time. And in a few weeks time, the publisher will release another game which again asks for PS4 price but the same level of quality. To me, they had enough time to get the training done.\n\nIt seems the publisher, Koei, likes to gimp quality on PC ports for no other reasons than to keep console versions exclusive. They intentionally downgraded the graphics from the PS4 version.\n\nBut they still want you to pay the same price as those console "exclusive versions".\n\nSuch behaviour doesn't deserve pc gamers to reward them with financial support. If you can hold out then buy it when it goes on sale so that they don't get that extra monetary benefits.\n\nSome may worry that they may stop bringing future ports if we stop supporting their subpar port. I don't think so. They chose to come here because they understand there's profit to be made. The real question is do we want them to make a profit by offering sub-standard service or service level found behind those console versions.\n\nI brought this game so I can bring this message.

Well as how I saw the released DW8XL, well it's basically the Empires version of that same game engine. To be honest, I've been itching to play a Empires version of Dynasty Warriors since long time ago, only experienced the Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires on PS2 only.\n\nThis game is what I've imagined it to be like, the newest character roster, weapons, maps, or whatever, but in Empires mode, with the goodness of a robust Edit Mode that had been ever existed since in this series(DW8 was the newest of course lol). So it's pretty much awesome enough even if without those DLCs unless you are big fans, then don't really have to bother with those cosmetic DLCs lol.\n\nI've played it in a casual mannered way and it's actually fun, I've spent longest time for now on the Edit mode to create some characters but then this game is 'EVIL' cause they even let you to build your 'OWN' ARMY which is like a whole list of CAW characters to be your Officers and even change your soldier and mount is amazing enough though it's just simple. I'll need more time to fill those Edit list filled with my ideal characters soon.\n\nThe gameplay well, it's the same Dynasty Warriors duh, and it's just awesome mowing down enemies like you're a god in Normal Mode, heck even the Affinity system disadvantage/advantage will not help much on letting them survive from you lol. I've originally started out as a Ruler but then I got overwhelmed by alot of things, so eventually I decided to go out as a Free Officer, which is I think much beginner friendly and realistic alike, So I've joined a random Nation nearby and kicking ♥♥♥♥. Eventually randomly got confessed by the Nation Ruler by accident,married and ♥♥♥♥, and even got a ♥♥♥♥♥ fugly side character asking me to be sworn brothers, lol what.\n\nGraphics are just.....well its nicer looking than PS3 maybe, but sadly it's not Next Gen lookalike,but I think it's fine since Next Gen resolution stuff might have some porting issues, like those new games released recently like Assasins Creed and stuff, so 720p or not who the hell cares, the game does work fine if I set it on medium, and 1080 resolution, No bugs encountered that will break the game at all. It's all fun ol' Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThere's a Free mode I haven't try out but I guess it's just a simple make your single match mode, pretty much, The only thing is maybe if this game is priced lower abit, more people might get into the PC version much. The game is in whole package a solid game experience.\n\n9.986567257574844635435758684563/10 would replay in Chaos mode when I mastered it.","February 27, 2015","true","59.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","9","17","3","0"

At this point Dynasty Warriors 9 should look to do away with these sub games and if they have to, sell the empires addition as DLC to the main game.

But there are still online functions available such as the ability download and upload custom created officers. The graphical quality is great, more so on the character models themselves than the environments, but could still have been improved vastly if the PC version was given some more care. (Maybe a future HD texture pack, Koei?)\n\nThere isn't much of a story to be had in this iteration of Dynasty Warriors 8, but instead you more or less craft your own in the Empire mode. You'll be making many choices that have various beneficial or disadvantageous outcomes and that will also lead your character down the path of good or evil themselves. (Think Liu Bei or Lu Bu) You don't however need to be the leader of an empire, you can instead serve under another and get promoted in rank (thus make more choices each turn) as time goes by. The choice is still there to betray or secede your current ruler though.\n\nIf you're a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series, then you can expect hours upon hours of content to get through. The maximum amount of turns allowed per new Empires session is 600 - giving you plenty of time to unite China under one rule. The addition of 'stratagems' and the marriage/children system also gives more purpose to the game than from previous titles - as everything from the past Empires iterations has been improved upon here, including the custom character creation which provides a huge amount of customisation options.\n\nMy biggest gripe was in fact the price of the game, at least in my region. £40 translates to paying more for the PC version (which has no online multiplayer) than the console versions which basically includes more content because of this. However, I decided to buy Empires regardless because I knew I could personally still get many hours of value from it. Though, being the owner of a past Dynasty Warriors 8 title on Steam, I was expecting at least some form of a discount due to the high base price for this title.\n\nHighly recommended to past Dynasty Warriors fans as DW8 itself was one of the best titles in the series yet. As for people new to the series - I would recommend you go back a step and play the original DW8 title first. Empires expands upon this version and takes it almost in an entirely new direction, as have done all the past Empires versions.\n\nIt's time to pursue Lu Bu, once more...","February 28, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When they first introduced the Empires line to the series it was a breath of fresh air in what was quickly becoming a stale room. It did not offer the depth of tactical or RPG play as Romance of the Three Kingdoms series did, but it did mix up the Dynasty Warriors series with something new.\n\nFour games and two generations later I can say that they seem to be taking more steps backwards then forwards. The game feels....empty. No where near as many cutscenes or special dialogue between characters. The concept of having characters get married and heve children mid game is interesting but that alone is not worth the entrance fee.\n\nI can only hope that Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires was an experiment in new mechanics and not a standard they hope to shoot for in the future. Ever since they ended the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, none of which ever released in english for the PC, they have had a massive gap in their line up. For a company known for their hack and slash series they actually made the best Freeform Tactical RPG ever in my opinion with ROTK X. Let us hope they look to their past to take steps forward instead of stumbling forward tossing things at the wall to see what the minimal they can make a profit on is.","March 23, 2015","false","17.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Which may get a bit boring...\n3) There is no given STORY. Beware! This game makes YOU start a story and make YOU finish it (So nothing historical)\n4) Sima Yi's voice ain't SO EVIIIIILLLLL!!!!! Now. RIP Tsuyoshi Takishita\n\nUPS:\n1) The CAW (Create-A-Warrior) system is great. If you enjoy making your own character, this feature is one of the most definitive feature that is only exclusive to Empires.\n2) The Event battles have upgraded to top-notch excitement from its previous boring ones. This actually excites me when playing these battles.\n3) Nice improvement in PERSONAL relationships. I mean this as Character-to-Character system. This includes, Sworn-Siblings, Spouses and Children in the game. It brings out a great perspective of how to be a leader as well as being a good PERSON.\n\nOVERALL, the game is good. I give it 8/10. Just the graphics and the story being a bit short just bugs me. However, It is their FIRST Updated Empires game of the series for PC since DW4E and they WILL (I hope) improve in the future. Just give them a chance and as for YOU, I recommend this game, TRY IT!","March 15, 2015","true","373.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But there are still online functions available such as the ability download and upload custom created officers. The graphical quality is great, more so on the character models themselves than the environments, but could still have been improved vastly if the PC version was given some more care. (Maybe a future HD texture pack, Koei?)\n\nThere isn't much of a story to be had in this iteration of Dynasty Warriors 8, but instead you more or less craft your own in the Empire mode. You'll be making many choices that have various beneficial or disadvantageous outcomes and that will also lead your character down the path of good or evil themselves. (Think Liu Bei or Lu Bu) You don't however need to be the leader of an empire, you can instead serve under another and get promoted in rank (thus make more choices each turn) as time goes by. The choice is still there to betray or secede your current ruler though.\n\nIf you're a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series, then you can expect hours upon hours of content to get through. The maximum amount of turns allowed per new Empires session is 600 - giving you plenty of time to unite China under one rule. The addition of 'stratagems' and the marriage/children system also gives more purpose to the game than from previous titles - as everything from the past Empires iterations has been improved upon here, including the custom character creation which provides a huge amount of customisation options.\n\nMy biggest gripe was in fact the price of the game, at least in my region. £40 translates to paying more for the PC version (which has no online multiplayer) than the console versions which basically includes more content because of this. However, I decided to buy Empires regardless because I knew I could personally still get many hours of value from it. Though, being the owner of a past Dynasty Warriors 8 title on Steam, I was expecting at least some form of a discount due to the high base price for this title.\n\nHighly recommended to past Dynasty Warriors fans as DW8 itself was one of the best titles in the series yet. As for people new to the series - I would recommend you go back a step and play the original DW8 title first. Empires expands upon this version and takes it almost in an entirely new direction, as have done all the past Empires versions.\n\nIt's time to pursue Lu Bu, once more...","February 28, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics look terrible, the "empire" campaign is very limited. I dont play these games for graphics but for a decent story. I feel no connections to any action i commit to or to any characters. For example i killed a ruler in an assassination and it did not change much in the story. I stole a national treasury, and the officer that I assisted said thanks, thats it. No alert for a thief or anything, you just get a reward. The battle system pretty much trickles down to the old PSP DW version of itself. Run in, take a base, and move on. There is rarely any objective in battle, maybe a "Rescue Liu Bei's son" style of objectives. No its mostly take enemies main camp, or kill the enemy commander. There is no English voice actors in this game, despite DW8 and DW8XL had them. Other empire games offered older series music, this one has some of DW8XL, but it almosts spits in your face when you toggle the header for the older themes and they are all blanks. No one really knows how to get older themes online. I loved DW series for a while, its simple fun with some challenges here and there. The only thing i get  is run in and win. The only jewel if find in this specfic game is the customization option, it has a large library of options to chose from. Thats is what essentially kept me giving it more tries. If rated in a scale of 1-10, i would give it a 4 due the amount of customization avaiable, its fun for a little bit until you realize how little there is to do. You are paying premium price for a low quality game, save your money for a steam sale or completely just buy the older versions of empires if that is what you seek.","November 9, 2015","false","71.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Many recommendations say that you can play many campaigns, but the truth is there's only one major campaign (you can choose the starting period of time, but in the end the map is all the same with the same task - conquer China). So for DLC it's perfect. I'm just not a fan of repeating the same story over and over again.","January 1","false","41.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will find a TL;DR at the end of this review.\n\nOverall6,4Sounds7Visuals4Gameplay (Battles)7Gameplay (Strategy)5Gameplay (Edit Mode)9Enjoyment9Porting4\nSoundtrackThe Dynasty Warriors is known for its good soundtracks. This one is on exception. Sadly, there are not many different BGM since you can only have those from DW8E and DW8.\n\nVisualsI don't have much to complay about this game's graphics. They are pretty much the same as for DW8XL. Yeah. The same. Which means that it is a PS3 port with awful pixelated textures. If you can overlook this fact, the game is visually pleasant.\n\nGameplay\nBattlesBasically, the gameplay is the same as for DW8XL. Very dynamic, you will probably have a good time with it. There are two major additions:\nThe stratagems: you can use them however and whenever you want if you have enough ressources (that will refill over time). There are different kind: buffs, turrets, recovery, etc. The map control: you will have to capture base in order to gain control over the map. These bases are connected by supply lines and you will have to connect your main camp with enemies' to capture it. The reason why I only gave a 7 to the gameplay is because of the game balancing. Forget about other difficulties than Hard and Chaos. Even hard is not really… hard. In chaos mode, if you choose to begin with the item you already unlocked, you will find the game desperately easy. And if you choose not to do this, once you get them via normal gameplay, the result will be the same. Basically, either you will like slashing through enemies mobs like butter, either you will blame the game easyness. Choose your side!\n\nStrategySadly, the strategy mode is the major point where DW8E fails. It lacks a lot of dynamism; the AI will most of the time act quite passively toward you, which means nothing really exciting will happen. Aside from that, you will be able to unlock different commands (strategies) to use during strategy phase but most  of them will be largely unused except for the sake of unlocking some titles. In other words, the strategy aspect is quite bland and can quickly become boring, solely as a transition between battles.\n\nEdit ModeThe Edit Mode! The most interesting feature of this DW8E. Thanks to this, you will be able to create your very own characters. You will get to choose their aspect, their voice, their moveset and even their musous and rages. The editor is quite complete (even if a bit more functions for the face edit would not have been too much) and you will probably spend some hours creating characters. There are a gound amount of gears, but you may find yourself quite limited after some time. Having the Famous Officers outfits to choose from would have been a good idea, but you can't, except for Guo Jia and Guan Yinping.\n\nNote that in some way, the Edit Mode has replaced the possibility to customize weapons we had in DW8XL. It may make your gameplay heavily weapon reliant so that you may avoid some weapons that have bad enhancements.\n\nEnjoymentIt's Dynasty Warriors! If you liked the previous ones, you can only enjoy this one too! However, you may find some battle-heavy playthrough boring after a while. (Those that requieres the Defensive Ace title for instance.) Hopefully, these playthrough are not so common.\n\nPortingThe porting of this game is awful. Of course, it runs smoothly at 60 FPS but that is not the point. As I said earlier, it's a PS3 port that is already more expensive than the PS3 version, but it's not all. As far as the keybinding goes, it is a bad porting. The commands appears only as keyboard input so if you are playing with a controler, you may have a hard time figuring what button correponds to what action. (And let me give you a quick advice: if you decide to buy this game, do not activate the V-sync. It seems to cause some problems too.)\n\nOh. And Alt-tabbing will freeze your game if you do it out of battle.\n\nTL;DRIt's a game on which you will most likely spend a good amount of time. There are a few cons, it's true, but overall it's a game you can enjoy. Chances are you will find that it's fifty well spent bucks.","March 18, 2015","true","287.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

I tried to get into this but it's just so shallow and basic. You just go from battle to battle doing the same thing over and over again. The stuff between the battles is there to give depth and variety but it falls so flat. All audio is Japanese which makes it hard to keep up if you are in a particularly busy part of a battle. I don't mind Japanese audio but it's a real hindrance in a fast paced game like this.\n\nOnly buy this if you still really really like Koei's warriors games. I used to but the gameplay is just too abismal for me to enjoy. Honestly I don't see how even big DW fans can like this. Trying to force myself to like and play this game is like trying to get blood from a stone. It's depressing.","January 14","false","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unless you go for all the titles and achivements you won't be playing for long.\nThe controls for DW were made for PS and Xbox controllers, and i don't have one, so i can say that the defult keyboard layout isn't very good. (They did improve it from the PC port of DW8:Extreme Legends though)\nIt's clear that they didn't care to make the PC port any good for a PC only player. The game has no mouse support, and they didn't even bother to remove the coding for the Play Station Network, they just disabled it. So its extra data you need to download.\nI personally didn't mind the below PS3 average graphics, But any decent gaming computer could have played highquality PS4 graphics better then the PS4 itself, so they need to allow that option.\n\nI've never played any other DW Empires game. (though i played this one's PS3 version) Again the game is repetitive, and it only has so many battle fields. Most of the titles revolve around being a free officer. i don't think they put anything cool into being a ruler. The campians are all really the same and free mode isn't that custimizable.\n\nI like the custom character maker, I'm sure i spent 10+ hours just building my friends characters from our D&D world. This is likely the only reason this game is replayable. I'm not one for spending hours customizing a characters face in games like Obivion or Skyrim, but this creater gives you options but not too many that your overwelmed.\nThe best part about this creater is the armors, you can mix and match differnerd armors, helmet, boots, pants, and gloves and they have a lot of options. If they made a program to add armor mods this game would be way more popular. I also think their's no reason to max Custom Units at 10 Custom characters.\n\nIt's not a bad game, they just need to optimize the game for PC rather then make it as an Xbox/PS port. Embrace the advantages of PC gaming. Better hardware, multiplayer internet battles, Mods, Etc. Maybe Dynasty warriors 9 or 10 will have good PC versions.\n\nPersonal Recommendation: If you want to play it, Get it on sale. It IS NOT worth it's full price. Other then that it's good for at least 35 hours, And you get a Character creator.","May 9","false","120.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought it anyway, because there are always those comments on DW ports- but this one is much worse than usual. So be aware that it will take a fair while to get used to the terribly rigid and awkward controls! For example, using a controller you have to move the camera to strafe or go off in any direction other than NESW. If you can get past the controls and movement, it's not so bad. The weirdly rigid controls were terrible until I got used to it, but after the first few days it hasn't had much affect on my enjoyment of the game (as you can see from my time played!)\n\nOther than that it's standard DW fare, with some extra gameplay elements added.\n\n- There's the addition of a 'strategy system'- you choose up to 6 abilities to use in battle.\n\n- There's an actual change in strategy compared to all other DW games, in that you are required to use strategy even on normal or lesser difficulty. You can no longer make a beeline to the enemy main base, you have to have control of an unbroken line of bases leading from your main camp to the enemies' main camp. The enemy is also stronger in their area of control- where you are further from your bases, troops, and supply lines. You can't go lone commando as much as you can in other DW games- not saying it's a bad change though!\n\n- You can influence your leaders policies, slander other officers to get them fired, tax areas under your control, raid an area to weaken it before invading, get married and have kids who follow in your footsteps and in general look like their parents.\n\nAs always in Empires, you can make your own character. They've gone farther this time, and you can mix and match some pretty nifty characters. You can have your custom officers (and those of others) enter the game at random. They seem to have more customization than in previous Empires, and the faces certainly look better than they have previously.\n\nAll in all, there are some really interesting changes to the gameplay in this version of DW but I would recommend it only IF you can get past the truly horrible control scheme.","December 16, 2015","true","164.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gues it's the ability to change history and conquer China. For those who are into Dynasty Warriors series this game is another must investment and for other people it's recomened. I guess Empires is trying to get closer to the Romance of The Three Kindsom game series which is purely tactical/political game and perhaps combine these two games in to one.\n\nThis is a Japanese game and you can see it in the edit character thing and in the dlc costumes but that wont' ruin your game as it's not forced upon you. Even the lack of english dub from the previous games doesn't ruin your experience since the texts are in english. And let's be honest the English dub in these games have always been crappy, crappy but hilarious.

This Empires game is the best I have played and you will have a blast playing it. You can recruit officers, command your armies to invade other provinces and even start as a mercenary or officer or ruler. And if your an officer, you can rise up and rebel against your own ruler and create your own kingdom.\n\nYou can customize your officer into hundreds of different combinations. NO DLC NEEDED. Your going to want to create a ton of different custom officers to see how far your imagination can run and see how many crazy combinations. You can also create your own custom scenarios.\n\nI can name countless number of things you could do like getting married, do quests to gain experience and level up,\n\nThe bad thing is the controls......just.....horrendous. Use a controller. Also No multiplayer. Online. Local. NONE!\n\nThis game is a completely different protypical Dynasty Warriors that you have seen before. This is a great game worth your time and Dynasty Warriors fans and fans interested in the Dynasty Warriors series are going to LOVE this game!\n\nTo see my full thoughts of the game then check out my review here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4fqIV7Jqs","March 27, 2015","true","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"save" your children and build up your huge army\n+ If you play online you can get some custom characters from other players into your game! So amount of characters can be rather sky high\n+ Neat and very enjoyable combat\n+ This may sound weird, but if you find campaign easy, repeatetive and boring - go on higher difficulty. I did that and omg game got way more colors! You will actually have to managing empire itself properly. You will be attacked from multiple nations and you need as much provinces as possible on top level for them not to fall into enemy hands in one turn.\n+ Very good performance on 50/50 PC\n+ Beautiful asian art style\n\nBad stuff\n- Can be little bit repeatetive, but try to increase difficult. That should get your entertained and challenge your reflexes and spike interest to the game.\n- Characters don't save level after campaign is over. You can however get weapons from blacksmith outside from campaign.

Was officially announced to have English voice acting, but Koei flat out lied about that.\n\nTLDR AT BOT\n\n\nPros:\n\nGood gameplay mechanics (Could be the best of the Empire series, so far)\n\nMore CAW (Character creation) options\n\nMore choice in playstyle\n\nCustom chracters have a Way of Life (AI behavior) based on how you play them (sounds cool, but is implemented half-heartedly)\n\nImproved control over battles as a leader\n\n\n\nCons:\n\nNo English voiceacting ( Even though Koei ♥♥♥♥ing officially announced that there would be, so they actually LIED about there being English voicing)\n\nInteractions between characters is poorly done, with dialogue not affecting your relation w/ them past low or high relation status. Sworn oaths and marriages only serve to keep them permanently w/ you, and offer no new dialogue that reflects that status. Interactions between characters practically do not exist, other than a couple lines of dialogue and small bonuses. (Compare DW6E for what I'm referring to in decline of depth)\n\nCutscenes are literally a copy and paste, and do not reflect anything other than which characters are present (I.e cutscenes do not reflect the area it takes place). No variability in cutscenes like in previous ones.\n\nEnemy AI can (not always, though) abuse the strategies (abilities) available to them since they have no limit as to how often they spam abilities, other than the CD w/ them.\n\nDifficulty settings aren't done too well\n\nYour affinity (morality) has no consequences, and does not punish you for being evil, and does not reward you for being good. For all purposes, you may as well play evil for an easier time, since there's no cons to it. Only apparent use for affinity is how your custom character's Way of Life will be affected\n\nAll characters lack any at all depth in this, which is incredibly hard to ♥♥♥♥ up on. For all intents, each character is simply "there", and lack any sort of input to anything you do or anything that happens at all. Unlike in previous games, your accomplishments would be talked on by the characters, which made them more rewarding, in this one, however, they say absolutely nothing, even in those incredibly few important cutscenes.\n\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10. It was well done in many areas, and can provide it's worth in money you paid for. It's something easily enjoyed if you can ignore the numerous ♥♥♥♥ups with the game, but those that have played previous Empire extensions to the series, or anyone who can't get over the poor quality here and there, may be wanting for more. That being said, it is still a good game.\n\nTL;DR\nA GOOD GAME IF YOU'RE NEW. MAY OR MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A HALF-♥♥♥♥♥ MEDIOCRE ADDITION FOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED THE EMPIRE EXTENSIONS FOR A WHILE.

Now I love the Dynasty Warriors games,  the prospect of killing thousands of soldiers is nothing but stress relief when you've had a bad day or just want to be a "God of War". This game is no exception. It has the sword, the axes, the spears, the ♥♥♥♥, the ♥♥♥, I could go on and on (like the jet black chrome).\n\nThis game uses "Strategems" they are basically your methods of messing up the enemies and buffing yourself up like crazy. My favorite has to be "Lightning Speed" you just move so fast and your attacks also speed up, making you a BLENDER OF DEATH!!! *Ahem* anyway they also introduced"Large Scale Strategems" in this entry. They are your basic strategems however they affect whole battlefields. You could have your normal fire attack, or use "Inferno" to burn every enemy base because ♥♥♥♥ it! I'm an arsonist and I want to see everyting burn.\n\nNow the great thing about "Dynasty Warriors" is that you play as a character that is full of color. They entertain, they fight, they even feel bad about everything they've done wrong. In this game, that element is very supressed. All the characters say the same thing to another, even if the person is a wife, sworn brother, or child. It's a missed oppurtunity and even the already established characters are like that. The biggest example has to be Sima Yi. This guy is a natural born villain. He laughs at everything and takes every oppurtuinity to call someone an imbecile. In this game, he may have said imbecile in one line, and laughed in a "Musou Attack" or when he stated he was drunk. Honestly, this made me a little sad but hey, you can do some funny ♥♥♥♥ with the events.\n\nUnlike most "Dynasty Warriors" games you start off with every character with his or her full moveset. Custom characters use these to full affect and you can even mix and match Musou attacks. For this game I reccomend the movesets with "Whirlwind". It sure as hell makes the "BLENDER OF DEATH" even more powerful and they tend to clear out crowds even better. Character Creation is really in depth. You could change your characters hair style, facial features, and clothes (which this game is filled to the brink with, even moreso with the DLC.) Now you're asking "What's the purpose of level ups?" Well your level dictates all of your stats (like strength, defense, and leadership). Your "Way of Life" dictates your starting level. Now how you find out which "Way of Life" will benefit you the most is beyond me but you could use bonus points to just cheat yourself to Level 50. I won't judge...\n\nNow I swear this game will crash like nothing else and this is not a problem I'm just having. A lot of the reviews have mentioned crashes and I don't know if it's just because a majority of us have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptops, or it's because the game can't help but crash. People have mentioned it being a PS3 to PC port, so that may be a problem but I don't know but if you plan to play this game be wary of that.\n\nOverall a great game. Although events and character interactions could use work, the combat (as usual for Dynasty Warriors) is fun and fast, and Character Creation is really in depth and a big time waster (Hey don't judge me if most of your time was on edit mode). This game may crash more than my Android Phone but that is no excuse to not by this game.","June 2, 2015","true","280.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"save" your children and build up your huge army\n+ If you play online you can get some custom characters from other players into your game! So amount of characters can be rather sky high\n+ Neat and very enjoyable combat\n+ This may sound weird, but if you find campaign easy, repeatetive and boring - go on higher difficulty.

You will be attacked from multiple nations and you need as much provinces as possible on top level for them not to fall into enemy hands in one turn.\n+ Very good performance on 50/50 PC\n+ Beautiful asian art style\n\nBad stuff\n- Can be little bit repeatetive, but try to increase difficult.

(its really hard to explain but you cant unbind things and you HAVE to make them a button. but all of the other buttons on the controller are taken. hard to explain. if someone found out a way ill edit this :P)\n\nI just feel the console version would be more comfortable to play.

(Its like they new it was a problem because they threw a quick save option in on the main menu.)\n\nAnother thing, take the game for what it is on PC knowing that it isnt going to change much.

It has all the "basics" of the Dynasty Warriors features, combined with all the character/kingdom customization options that come with the Empires series. You can either participate as a classic three kingdoms era warrior, or you can make your own, and take him/her out for a spin.\n\nThe character customization considering the nature of a "hack & slash" game like this one, is quite deep and detailed, and you have a lot of options to actually choose from in order to make your perfect hero. Heck, you can even make something really weird like a midget fat "cat" with a greatsword..... *coughs*..\n\nThis is a game i give an 8/10, as it loses points from lack of online play. Local split-screen is nice, but this game would've been a gem if you were to start a game with a friend online, make your own heroes and simply fight together or against each other from the comfort of your home...\n\nPros :\n- Character Customization\n- Every game you start is unique\n- Vast Character Roster\n- Classic Dynasty Warrriors Feel\n- Fast Paced Combat\n- No Crashes or Graphic Lag\n\nCons :\n- Somewhat blurry textures in some areas\n- Lack of online co-op/versus\n- Lack of 16:10 resolution support (yes, if you have a 16:10 monitor, you're forced to either weird stretch, or windowed mode)","June 30, 2015","true","487.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it didn't kill my fun I had with it I wanted something a bit more to all the fighting. This is what I wanted! Some context to all the fighting and ability grow a kingdom. While it may not have the depth of a total war it adds just enough to where you find yourself managing resources, keeping people happy (or in fear), defending Terriorty while playing your own custom created character or play the likes of legends like Cao Cao or Guan Yu. The game plays like how you would expect and you do find yourself doing a wee bit more planning in Hard and much more Chaos mode. The controls feel tight though some buttons are swapped and not all buttons can be mapped to controller but I didn't realize until I was 90% done with my 1st playthrough of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Mind you this is my 1st empires game and it's been a blast but I can understand how certain aspects of the game can get tiresome after 7 installments. All the same whenever I pick up a Dynasty Warriors it'll be an Empires version from now on.

I can live without the english dub (though I'd prefer it), but I'd like to see the levels I gained in the campaigns carry over. You can spend "bonus points" to carry over some weapons, items, etc, but it only gives you options to increase your level at start. I'd like to be able to build up characters over multiple playthroughs like I did in 5.\n\nAnother issue I have is with the AI. When I tell one of my units to defend a specific base, I want them to defend that base, not go and attack someone on the other side of the map.\n\nI'd also like the ability to bench my ruler and go ahead with other officers like you could in 5, but that isn't there as well. You can play as other characters, but when I tried that I lost the ability to direct the other officers on where to go and what to do.\n\nIf you're considering buying this I can't recommend it. You're getting a PS3 port (you can get it for $10 cheaper on console), and there's just not a lot of incentive to replay the game unless you want to try and collect various weapons. If you still insist, wait until it drops in price. $50 is way too expensive for this.","March 9, 2015","false","43.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It must be said, however, that this game is a lot more functional at Launch than Xtreme Legends was at it's launch. Indeed it would seem that this is the most functional version of the game on day one in the EU & States, as the console versions are apparently choked with bugs, one of the most common being character voices being switched in immersion breaking but amusing ways (Ma Chao speaking with Diaochan's voice for example). This is absent in the PC version, along with a series of other bugs.\n\nIt seems that the PC version comes with much of the pre-order DLC avalible for other versions of the game free in the base game, another plus. Another rather large plus, though not one that has been openly talked about by Koei itself or even by the community at large, is that the costume DLCs (the most expensive DLCs for both Empires and XLCE) are transfereable from one game to the other so as long as you own the costumes in XL already, there is no need to buy them again for Empires, and if you buy costume DLC you didn't have later in Empires, they'll unlock in XL. This is a small but nice touch and one that I am pleased to have found in the game. One last major positive is that this game (I'm uncertain of if this is true for the other versions of the game) has every armor, hair, and accesory peice of CAW from Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires avaliable at the start, including the DLC ones. Once the inevtiable DLC packs for CAW begin to come out, I think I may lose contact with everyone and everything I know and love due to sheer obsessive focus on creating new custom officers!\n\nA big problem I have, however, is that (at least in the UK) the PC version, despite having the graphics of the PS3 version and a lack of online co-op, is the most expensive version of the game avaliable that I've seen. Amazon sells the boxed copy of Empires 8 for 29.99, I beleive the PS3 digital version is slightly cheaper, and yet here we have less content than both of those versions are are paying a full £40 upon release. This was also the case with XLCE (though with a higher price-point there) and is something I honestly don't understand. Why are we to be made to pay more when we are granted LESS features? How is that fair?\n\nRegardless of the issues that I have raised, I will still be playing this game to death. I adore the Dynasty Warriors series, the Empires spin-offs especially, and this one seems to be the most well featured of all of them as of yet.  Despite this, it is over priced, not as well featured as the other versions of the game, and despite being on certainly the most potentially powerful platform, we recive the less graphically impressive version of the game. Having said this, Koei does seem to be slowly learning that it actually HAS an audience on steam, as more and more of their games are slated for release on steam in future (if I have the cash I will CERTIANLY be buying Bladestorm Nightmare when it comes out next month) and it seems that with each release they are slowly improving their PC releases over-all. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation for us to be in, having bad ports now and having to wait for them to get better, but for fans of Koei games (such as myself) surely it's better than what we had before.

The ultimate goal is to unify China within 5 years (600 turns).  Battles, alliances, negotiations, relationships, lineage... it's all in Empire mode.

It's all in your control with Free Mode.  There is no map to conquer, just a battlefield with rules you set up.\n\nAnd lastly, Edit Mode is exactly as it sounds- edit your own warriors, armies, kingdom flags, warhorses and soldiers.  This is where I've sunk most of my time as of right now, just creating armies to implement into a Custom Scenario.  Yup, you can even make your own Scenario to play out, either using pre-existing DW characters, or your very own creations.  This scenario can be played in Empire Mode!  I've made most of the humanoid Gods in their likeness from SMITE, and it has been a blast seeing Gods on the battlefields.\n\nAll in all, my time with the Musou franchise has been touch-and-go.  I got addicted to DW8CXL for a weekend, but didn't return.  I played the mess out of Warriors Orochi 3 on Wii U.  I even got into Hyrule Warriors.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/groyer/recommended/322520/","groyer","Groyer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/groyer/","121 products in account","Let me level with you for a second.\nEveryone's either going to love this game by being a blind sheeple saying that this game is the best projection of interactive media in the world and that the game has the storytelling depth of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the gameplay depth of Vagrant Story saying "if you don't like it you're a dumbass and are wrong, Wei/Wu/Shu/Lu Bu/Other for life!!! xD", or hate this game by being a part of the overly-entitled PC gamer clique because it's not 1080p 60+FPS 32x FXAA/MSAA anti-aliasing with 10 varieties of post production effects along with bloom, wavy 4098x4098 resolution grass and visible swear pores on the characters when zooming in with 128x magnification.\n\nLook. Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires is just like a summer action movie. It's brainless, stupid fun. There's no deep plot. There's no complex and stat-crunching, paradigm building gameplay architecture. It's just a simple hack-n-slash. Don't expect a gameplay and story masterpiece. Don't expect a technical wonder. Expect brainless, pick-up-and-play fun.\n\nI personally think it's a fantastic game to waste time with and just.. have fun. But it obviously has flaws. I'm just gonna break it down into a list for the "tl:dr" people, since I am also one of them.\n\nya done did good kid:\n+ Brainless fun, doesn't require overly complex mechanics to learn and master to get right into the game\n+ You might hate the word (cause it's a ♥♥♥♥in buzzword admittedly) but it's very friendly to casual audiences\n+ It also can get the fix for the hardcore audience since you can spend hours in the character customization and then shaping their playstyle on how you created that character\n+ While I'm on the topic, the character creation is ♥♥♥♥in' great\n+ If you played the game before, your favorites are still here\n+ If not, you probably at least know the Lu Bu meme and yeah he is here\n+ If still not, the waifu and bishonen-fest will cater to your needs anyway\n+ It's got the simplicity of a hack-and-slash, but gives some p. decent turn based strategy/management stuff in it as well\n+ Creating custom campaigns/scenarios is just as addicting and detail-oriented as character customization\n+ Seeing what other people have made for CAWs and custom campaigns will guarantee to entertain you\n+ Seeing what in the seven hells you made in the CAW will make other people go "wow, you need help" or at least laugh\n+ Replayability is skyrocket high, play any campaign the way you want with what stipulations you set, assassinating some people, injecting some of your own guys to make a kingdom just from your creations, etc.\n+ The music is still absolutely fantastic\n+ For those who kept up with the series, all available weapon types and movesets are here, even some that were replaced in DW8E (i.e. Wang Yi's needles or trishula, Liu Shan's dragon column or rapier)\n+ DLC you bought for Extreme Legends Complete Edition carries over here, no need to re-buy (thank christ)\n\noh no jimmy, that's not good:\n- It's the PS3 port so the graphics will be very muddy n'♥♥♥♥\n- Performance will hiccup every now and then, honestly it's not that optimized but it's not a disaster (like ♥♥♥♥in' toukiden kiwami)\n- Gameplay is insultingly simple, it might just lose any fun value for some after a while and I can respect that\n- The whole "turn based strategy" thing is also insultingly simple, this isn't the ROTK game or a 4X\n- If you become a leader the game goes from "take your time" to "you can literally unite China in 10 ♥♥♥♥in minutes if you just sack the capitals"\n- Translations and syntax in the game are still spotty, they were UTTER ♥♥♥♥ when the game first came out but some recent patches mostly fixed that\n- You need a controller. Trust me, you need one don't use M&K here just use an xbone 360 controller ok good\n- OH MY GOD there is a LOT of ♥♥♥♥in' DLC and it's NEARLY 200 DOLLARS USD????\n- Alright look, I won't lie here. Even if you go into a playthrough thinking "oh man i'm just gonna assassin everyone and that's it" you are going to eventually ♥♥♥♥in' wind up in an army and unifying China. That's the point of the Empires game but ♥♥♥♥ man that's really railroady come on\n- If you came here for dank memes involving Lu Bu, he's a ♥♥♥♥ in this game so sorry for that\n- Unless you buy the DLC or find a custom player-made campaign that isn't cookie cutter ♥♥♥♥, you are going to get burnt out and bored real quick unless you get the DLC campaigns, and even then\n- Online co-op doesn't exist here because koei-tecmo hates your guts and your stupid ♥♥♥ face you sack of s h i t\n\nSo bottom line, yeah it's got flaws. Probably more than I listed but I think the good breaks even, and at least outdoes the bad here. If I had to slap an obligatory number on this like most everyone thinks is required now, I'd give it a 7/10. Well above average, but nowhere near greatness. It is symbolic of the summer movie of video games. Lacks the masterpiece, subtle substance that we might expect from everyone because the modern market has unrealistic expectations as a mob mentality, but when you just need something to burn some time and have some dumb fun with, Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is here. If you're new to the series, I highly suggest you get this first. Older games haven't aged well at all, but if you like this one, go give the older ones a try! If you're a series veteran, you damn well didn't need me to give you an opinion you probably already know what you think of this game. But you're probably going to buy it anyway.\n\n\nBuy it when it's on sale. Don't ♥♥♥♥in' pay $50 for this though. It ain't worth it, kid.","August 3, 2015","true","136.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Since I couldn't get this game for my current console, I thought I would go ahead and get the Steam version. The game itself looks really awesome, but the controls are an abomination. Why they had to make the control scheme so far different from console default I don't know, and they make it a roayl pain in the bottom to try and change it to something you may be more familiar with. I'd try using just keyboard, but again changing the configuration is a pain.\n\nTo make matters worse, this game crashes wose than usual when using a controller, even with graphic settings at their minimum so my laptop can handle it. It glitches so bad I have to log out just to get out of the game, and if you haven't saved every 90 seconds expect to replay missions alot.\n\nNow, I'm no tech expert, so disclaimer there, and it is possible I just need better hardware than I have. That doesn't really excuse control option issues, and I've played plenty of comparable games that seem to work just fine. Overall, I really want love this game and if decided I wanted to splurge on better hardware I may still give this a second chance.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minholyss/recommended/322520/","Minholyss","MIN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Minholyss/","928 products in account","Hi, so this is my review about DW8:E and why I don't recommend this game.\nSo, where do I start? Ah right, after buying this game and played through multiple walkthroughs, let me tell you about this game first.\n\nThis game has an expanded edit mode which gives the player total freedom in creating not only your officer, but your horse, units, banners, and soldiers. It is kinda fun at first, but gets boring after half-an hour creating your superhero-character. Sure you can bring your custom officers from edit mode to live the life of an officer in Romance of Three Kingdoms (rotk) period, mingle with them, make friends/enemies, getting married, serving a ruler or create your own army, and have child that would fight alongside with you.\n\nThere is also the quest system that would allow you to take another officers' personal request and the content is quite variative from escorting a generic officer to assasinating a ruler (I killed Xun Yu once). The quest itself is evolving meaning the more you undertake the same type of quest (ex: assasination) then the harder it can get. If you assasinate a simple official then -> assasinate an officer -> regional lord -> ruler. It gives more fun replayability to the player.\n\nBut with all of the content above, why am I still disasstified?\n\nThe answer is simple :\nThe world in DW8:E is a dead world\nFrom my playthroughs in this game, one thing is clear, this is not romance of three kingdoms, this is just a world filled with rotk characters that do not know each other and even worse, they do not even know why they are in the game. I played as Cao Cao and I could swear brotherhood with Cao Pi?? I played as Sima Shi and I could marry Zhang Chunhua?? How the hell does this happen?? ofc I know that 'ties' is severed in the empires version (so you could marry/swear an oath with EVERY OTHER characters available) but that is exactly why I don't recommend this game. After your marriage and brother hood oath, the game just feels 'empty'. The cutscenes really is lacking and don't mean anything. Furthermore, the ENDING is really a bad joke. You literally had 3 simple flashbacks from the cutscenes you have watched earlier (which wasn't even meaningful) and then you watch sunsets together with your officers with some white birds flying above your head. Then, you have the honor of saving your basically meaningless timeline to your game and Ta-Da!!! end of the game, please start another game so you can watch the bad joke ending again. :))\n\nI have played the Dynasty Warriors 4 and 5 empires spin-off although I skipped dynasty warriors 6 and 7. From my experience, I enjoyed playing those 2 games much more compared to DW8:E. I still remember playing DW4:E and there was really a lot of events from the characters. I remember playing as Cao Cao army and there was a special conversation that happened between Cao Cao and Xiahou Dun. I got the ending that showed life after unification of the land with my officers that I recruited personally. In DW5:E, it was even better and you could even get the original movies if you followed the story which kinds like reward the players. The ending was satisfactory also and you need to replay it multiple times in order to get different kind of endings. I was motivated to replay the game just to get and watch the different endings and movies that I hadn't gotten yet.\n\nIn this game however, I feel so 'empty' after beating the game. The urge to replay the game again is non-existant. I feel like whenever I want to play again, I am confused because I knew there would be no satisfying reward for my efforts to beat the game. The officers I recruited is just standing there and bowed his/her head like a mindless robot. The events/cutscenes are pretty much meaningless after 2 or more replays, and that's it! That is all about DW8:E. I feel quite disappointed as this game really promised much, but lacks the necessary thing to make the world of three-kingdoms really interesting compared to the earlier empire spin-off in DW4 and DW5.\n\nSummaryAlthough the edit mode and the contents from DW8:E is promising, the game failed to generate interest for me to replay the game after 2 or more playthrough. You basically could understand EVERYTHING the game has to offer just by replaying twice in any scenario. The lack of meaning behind the cutscenes and the endings doesn't contribute either.\n","March 6, 2015","false","18.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It's on PC, so it runs smooth.\n\nIcons can be misleading if you don't know which buttons do what. The game does not feature gamepad icons, though it is gamepad compatible. Xbox 360 controller fans rejoice. Instead, you get pictures of the space bar, or a rectangle with a sword icon in it, which evidently means something?\n\nThere are some odd little changes (or non-changes, really) between this and the versions available for consoles. For example, controls are almost identical to the PS3 version that I also have, except with the extremely Japanese tradition of making what would be the circle button the "accept" option, and what would be the x button the "go back" option, which is completely the opposite of what our Western brains expect it to be. That's really confusing at first, as it always is.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be arbitrary resolution support. I can't make the game render in anything higher than 1080p. Not a huge deal, but given the lack of any anti-aliasing option, the ability to downscale would have been nice, since forcing anti-aliasing through the Nvidia control panel will render you unable to see character previews.\n\nGameplay is exactly what you'd expect if you're familiar with the series (and/or past Empires iterations), but in case you're not, Dynasty Warriors is a hack-and-slash staple. You're a legendary Chinese historical figure (the Dynasty Warriors series is based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which is itself based roughly on Chinese history), and it's your job to sway battles by dropping rival soldiers by the thousands.\n\nYou do this through the square fast attacks (or x), and the triangle power attacks (or Y), along with the circle (or B) button for musou (see: special) attacks. Through a combination of moves (six regular attacks, and one special power attack, ex: x - y, x - x - y, x - x - x - y, and so forth, you will decimate your enemies. The gameplay will certainly be repetitive, but if you're like me and the simple, brainless gameplay appeals to you, then fantastic.\n\nOn easier difficulties, up to normal, feel free to charge ahead and kill everyone. On higher difficulties, use of strategems (from healing to rains of arrows), along with being sure to maintain a position on the frontline but not trapped alone in a base for instance, will be necessary to not die.\n\nOf course, my favorite part of Dynasty Warriors is the characters and story. The  story may only change slightly with each new installment, offering more characters and slightly retooled narratives, but the characters themselves are fantastic. They're all unique and entertaining, each with their own personalities, though their relationships with each other aren't really a big part of this game. If you want that, you'll need to play the regular Dynasty Warriors 8: Complete Edition.\n\nSee, this game is all about building your own empire, either as a canon officer, a generic officer, or as your own created avatar, which let's be honest, is the best part. Now I can tear through China as my own self-insert character. The feature I was most looking forward to was having babies with mai DW waifus. What's not to love about that? Zhang Chuhua + Lianshi best girls total waifu tier\n\nIf you like Dynasty Warriors for the gameplay or want to create your own officers, then you'll like this. If you like it for the stories, you're better off sticking with the Complete Edition release.","March 1, 2015","true","53.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

A lot of minor glitches that take away from the game, pricey to obtain with pricey DLC. If you own a PS3, the DLC's are almost ALL free. Since I do not own an Xbox One nor a PS4 I do not if this is the case. But they should all still be considerably cheaper. Also, PS3 and PS4 the DLC's are interchangeable. Once you buy the DLC for one system, you don't need to buy for the other. So if you downgrade, or upgrade you never have to rebuy the DLC. Unless you go from PS to Xbox.\n\nThere is also the issue of the interface in the main menu. It is awful. You can barely use your mouse or controller until in battle, and even then it is very choppy and seems disconnected if using a controller. I do not recommend buying this game on the PC, even if you only have a PC. Save your money for a PS3 (you can find them for less than 100$, then buy the game for 40$, then get all DLC free. Instead of over 200$ for the game and DLC on this PC port, you can get a System, the DLC and Game for less than 150$. Koei and Konami did an awful job, like always (Konami) it is pitiful how bad of a port this game is, and it doesn't speak for the game itself. It is a failure of the Creators and Developers and Publishers that this port ended up being so bad.
