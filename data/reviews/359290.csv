I'll give it a try." Then I can only tell you to run away, run as fast as you can.\nYou dont want to spend any money or time on this game.\nThats all you need to know but for you curious people out there - have some facts about why nobody who designed this game has ever played a racing or PC game before.\n\nThe first "interesting" thing to check out are the controls, and you know you are gonna be in trouble if the keyboard controls alone look like they were set up by someone who has no idea what a keyboard looks like.\n\nObviously you'd want to use a controller, with the partial controller support it has that should work out, right?\nNo it doesnt, because someone thought that acceleration should be controlled with the joystick. Pure genius.\nBut dont worry even if you can past that you'll soon find out that the problems of this game are way beyond any of your control.\n\nLets just jump into a race and see how it feels.\nIts clunky but you can actually drive the car, thats positive. Too bad the enemy AI seems to be so much better at it.\nThe reason behind that is simple: they are cheating.\nLike the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that got your money when you paid for this game they feel no need to obey the laws of nature and physics.\n\nWhile you fly up into the air on every hill you pass, they will stick to the ground like they are driving on magnetic rails and I'm fairly certain thats actually what they are doing.\nWhile you fly through the air like an airplane you'll get slower and they will just pass underneath you, having a laugh.\n\nI tried ramming them and shoving them around to maybe get an advantage. Just dont, you'll either bounce off of them like they are made of rubber or you'll push them sideways. "Push them sideways? Isnt that good?"You might think but they'll either just drive on sideways until they straighten up or just make you crash into a wall.\n\n"How can you win against such odds?" Get good, get lucky and get money to unlock "better" cars and "upgrades".\nYou earn cash while racing and doing certain things like dodging other traffic. Just dont take dodging too literal, bumping into cars = dodging them.\n\nUnlock "upgrades" to make your car "better". The only upgrades you can get are for Acceleration, Handling and Boost. Your top speed will only ever so slightly change when you buy a new car.\nDont worry about the upgrades too much since you'll barely be able to unlock any of them to begin with.\nEven the AI has trouble accomplishing the time challenges they expect you to beat to unlock upgrades.\n\nHalfway through the game I just gave up because I'm not nearly as masochistic as you have to be to try and complete this game and thats saying a lot coming from me.","September 20, 2015","false","4.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

As a racer it wasn't great but wow. This game is actually cheaper than the original, but is Crazy Cars only in name.\nThis takes the original and flips it completely. Plain, at best average graphics but reasonable gameplay. It was a fun little blast around the track.\nCareer mode and a quick play and the rekindling of fond memories, I will recomend it due to the price point as you will easily get a couple of quids worth of entertainment out of it.

Sequel?  Remake?  - With no reviews on Metacritic- and a release on the IOS platform (with a description citing the 1988 classic), did we just find a "diamond in the rough" ?\n\nUpon loading the game from Steam, we are introduced to a quick "set up" option with incredibly basic graphics options (Resolution... And "Fantastic" as an option, come on!)- controls...\n\nThen we get to an "intro" and a menu.\nHere we see...  this won't be a pretty game, considering there's a girl that looks like she's had her face smashed with a shovel.  The Menu is navigated by the Mouse (no keys), with a clunky interface.  We have 3 different game modes, "career", "single race" and "multiplayer", and a "garage" where you can use your ingame currency to purchase upgrades- which are unlocked on the track.\n\nLet's jump into career mode!\n... For a 2012 game, and on "Fantastic" graphics,  this game just screams "UNIVERSITY STUDENT TECH DEMO".  If this was the case, then well done, kid!  That's a nice "demo", but seriously, this game steals so much from the Burnout series on the PS2, that I fail to see any ounce of the original series anywhere in this title.\n- A 4 car race where you drive dangerously in order to gain "boost" and ingame currency.  The first car you drive seems to be as light as paper, as you continuosly fly up into the sky (whereas the AI cars can stick to the road), twitchy steering and odd "drifting"...\n\nOh, the graphics look like bum.  Textures are repeated endlessly, and the draw distance ...Facepalm facepalm facepalm\n\nFACEPALM\n\nTHIS IS A BUM GAME\n- Don't waste your HD's space and/or your internet bandwidth.","June 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

It looks like it was built in Unity3D. No licensed cars, merely cars that somewhat resembles real cars. There are cars coming the other way down the highway, and if you do something really naughty you may see police roadblocks but you can cut between the cars and go through. There are other cars on your side of the road, and some roadside obstructions like logs (!?) and stopped cars.\n\nYou do have handbrake (for drifting) and nitro. Nitro requires jumps and drifts and other moves to fill up.\n\nThere really isn't much handling. Cars don't feel much different, and you are encouraged to buy upgrades from your winnings, which aren't much. You are also requested to fulfill certain addition conditions for additional 'stars' per stage and some of those can't be done with the starting car, but only cars with lots of upgrades or better cars.\n\nThe only "good" part about this game is you aren't limited to a "circuit" and traffic's a bit random. And it's cheap. But it's just not very good. There are some customization options but those cost $$$ in the game that should have gone to upgrades.\n\nAll in all, there are much better good racing games out there, even at this low price.","April 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

But you have to race a lot in order to buy a better car. The upgrades are locked by stars which you have to achieve by getting a certain position or by driving to the finish within a certain time. Since your first car is so crappy you might get stuck with getting one to two stars in the first race, maybe even drive within the time-limit in the first race. 3 stars...but upgrades are unlocked with 4 stars. Thus rather drive the first race over and over again until you can afford a better car. The gameplay itself is ok. They should´ve given a slightly better car from the start.","June 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The GFX are poor, poor for a mobile, never mind a PC, the physics are non exsistant, you can literally hold down the drift button and drift left to right for the whole race, only impacting your speed slightly and racking up lots of money.... It does feel like an pre alpha version of burnout for a Megadrive (if there was such a thing) It, bad on so many many levels, if you want to waste £1, £2 what ever it was then great and i thought the same but this really does nothing for me, very poor all round, no playability from my POV, GFX poor, Physics poor, no damage on the car even when you plough into the impossbily hard to see cars that are the same colour as the road.
