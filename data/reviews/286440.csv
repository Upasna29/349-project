The graphics, controls and interface are ok, but I wouldn't recommend the game itself: all you have to do is drag an endless number of lines and loops to guide the rovers. And the "soundtrack" (if one could name it as such) is repetitive, even annoying.\n\nSo, unless you miss playing on your tablet, find something else.","May 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 101 of 117 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","101","117","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tolcso/recommended/286440/","tolcso","[DoReMa] tolcso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tolcso/","248 products in account","First, the facts. The game is an airport traffic control simulation adapted to a sci-fi theme where rovers and other land vehicles approach your ship and you have to give them paths to board. There are a few twists I haven't seen in this genre: upgradable power-ups, enemy vehicles and meteors you must shoot, meteors drop gems you can collect to get cash for power-ups.\n\nSecond, impressions. Although the concept is interesting, the quality is below acceptable. The 3D terrain looks good but the rovers can't follow their paths precisely so collecting the gems becomes a nightmare sometimes. Also, there is a glitch when objects intersect with the surface and only the tip of a gem or part of a rover (or nothing) is visible. The flashing effects, explosions and the repetitive music makes it a rather frustrating experience, not a good casual neither an interesting action game.","September 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","59","68","0","2"

It is not desaterous by any means. It works but misses the polish. The model of the ship and everything else is poorly made, explosions look bad and anything else is just working, nothing more and really boring. Don't ever buy it, because it isn't even wort a few pennys. Must not have, thank god I got it for free.","January 28","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It does not deserve all they negative comments' yes there are many clones to this game style but isnt that the case with almost every game. The game menu and game are gorgous and flow clean that is more than i can say for some of even the largest titles . I give this game a personal 2 thumbs up I would be proud if i made an awesome game like this.","February 23","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
