"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Giccy/recommended/394230/","Giccy","Mangaka Dudebro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Giccy/","476 products in account","Battleborn makes me sad\nNot because it is a very sad game. There isn't a single sad moment really. What makes me sad is how good it is, and what a poor way it has shown that off. How the writing is a huge step in the right direction, but how that isn't displayed anywhere in the marketing (Or at least nowhere I have seen). It is a game I have fallen in love with, but finding a way to share the love is something I have found very difficult. I guess writing a review is a good first step.\n\nThe main positives and the negatives, imo, are:\n\n+Both PvP and PvE\n+The co-op campaign in general\n+Interesting characters\n\n-Very busy design\n-Gameplay might be hard to get into\n-One lane moba\n\nThe positives\n\nA problem I have with a lot of shootbang games is when there isn't any good co-op alongside the pvp, because I'm pretty garbage at PvP. Usually when there is it tends to be lackluster, just simple wave based combat or bot matches. In Battleborn though they took it further than I would have hoped!\n\nWhat you have is multiple story missions that vary between attacking, defending, and escorting with plenty of character dialog to go with. Fortunately, this time it's not as memes as Borderlands became over time, and the characters that DO talk you through things are pretty funny. I never had a real guffaw, but it was enough to keep me entertained.\n\nAnother good thing they do with the dialogue is that it varies on different runs of the same stage. On multiple parts they have different lines that randomly play, or depending on who is in your party. This can help when you have to play through the same stage more than once, which you might want to do if you like getting good ranks, or if you find one particularly difficult to beat.\n\nThe PvP isn't bad either. You have three modes to choose from: Incursion, which is the standard push-minions mode, Capture, which is like King of the Hill but with three hills, and Meltdown, which is a lot like Incursion, but instead of pushing down sentries you push them into robot recycling machines, and the more you escort the more points you get.\n\nSave for Incursion I have had a blast with the other two, and we will get to Incursion later. If your team is somewhat organized Capture can be real hectic, and it has plenty of room for comebacks if you can manage to get a good doublekill or an entire teamwipe! Meltdown is similar, but I have found it harder to really play that with just randos. It's about pushing minions in two lanes, and if you are alone against two others who keep pushing one of them you might have a pretty bad time. But there is a lot of strategy to it, or at least enough for it to not just be a boring slog of a gamemode.\n\nThe characters are also interesting, both in how they are set up with skills and the lore challenges. Every character has two standard skills and one ultimate that unlocks later on, and you have one weapon and a melee move. What you also have in Battleborn is a skill tree, where every level you have the opportunity to pick between 2 to 3 options that either just buff one part of your character or changes a part entirely. You can have Oscar Mike's rocket barrage become a space laser, for example.\n\nThe lore challenges are just that, challenges that unlock lore about the character as you complete them. Every character has five of them, and they range from killing minions with a certain skill to playing in the same team as another character. These challenges also unlock stuff like taunts and skins, which you also get from loot packs and just leveling up the characters. As someone who gets hard over lore, this made me very happy. It's a very interesting way of learning about the characters, and it can be a good incentive to try something new!\n\nThe characters have a very big problem though.\n\nThe negatives\n\nThe characters are very busy in their design. Actually, every part of the game is very busy in its design. When I played in the open beta I had a hard time really seeing what was going on! They but in a bit TOO much effort into making everything look good or different, and that's one of the major flaws of Battleborn I think, and a major reason a lot of people might not like this game.\n\nHave you seen Montana, that overly buff minigun guy with a tiny head? I hated that design before I got this game. A lot of people do, and I still kinda think it's super dumb, but in-game that is something everyone makes fun off! "Mutant Lumberjack ahead!" announces Oscar Mike as he observes the large hunk of a man coming over the horizon, and even his own theme song makes fun of this "smallish head" and "tiny legs." A lot of the designs suffer from this: Something that makes sense in the games universe, but looks real bad on advertisement.\n\nThe cast is also a bit too different. Again, the designs all make sense within the five factions, but it looks like a visual mess to anyone else, probably. This makes me sad, because the LLC faction has some of my favorite character designs in this type of game that I've ever played. Kleese especially. It's rare to see an old man character outside of fighting games, and he is a very fun one to boot!\n\nSomething else that might be a failure of the advertisement is that this game is not a twitch shooter. It takes a while to get one dude to die, and it's almost always better to run in a group rather than be a lone wolf. Teamwork is more important in this game than most others, and its pretty difficult to carry a team unless you are really, REALLY good at teamwiping on your own. Or if you are playing one of the two snipers.\n\nThe slower shootbangs and the emphasis on pushing minions might put a lot of people off. Think of this game not as a TF2 clone, but as a SMNC clone. This game seems to be taking a lot more lessons from that game than anything else, but that is also something not everyone wants. It's something, if you're not expecting it, that you have to get used too. I was confused myself why I always seemed to do so poorly or never managed to get any kills, and the real answer to that question is that the game expects you to shoot together, not alone.\n\nAnd then the last complaint is 100% just my opinion (like the rest of the review really). Incursion is not a fun gamemode.  I hate one lane stages in mobas, since it often doesn't leave you up for comebacks, or it creates thirty minute long stalemates. It's a tug of war, essentially. Then again, the only map I have had the chance to play is Overgrowth, which is a poorly designed map with plenty of exploits, but its the map everyone else wants to play, maybe because of the exploits.\n\nThis is why Battleborn makes me sad\n\nIt makes me sad because it's a clear step forward for Gearbox. Partly why I say that is bias, because this type of game is something I always want more off, but what it shows off doesn't interest people, or they straight up just hate the designs. It is also an unfortunate time to release it, what with the hype of Overwatch. I love both, and I'm probably going to play both for a real long time if they get the support for it, but Battleborn is going to be the lesser of the two because of the style Gearbox went with. Once I got into it, I saw the love that was put into it, but the fact that I had to get into it to see it is a problem.\n\nI recommend this game, partly because I love it, but also because I would be sad to see it die.","May 22","true","81.9"," 544 of 667 people (82%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","82","544","667","27","17"

The game has the most in common with Smite or Heroes of the Storm. The basic gameplay modes are traditional Moba modes usually revolving around escorting minions to the enemy base to destroy it. It includes complex elements such as pre game item loadouts much like runes in League of Legends. The trade off being each carries positive and negative stat traits and can only be activated in game by spending gold you aquire through kills and objectives.\n\nAt the same time it is also important to spend gold on building turrets and super minions to help your team, forcing you to decide between helping the team or yourself.\n\nIt's obvious lots of effort went into crafting the characters but sadly none are as memorable as those in Overwatch as Blizzard is just too good at world building to be beaten here. However every character is both simple to play and difficult to master.\n\nThe game also includes a coop campaign for those that enjoy that.\n\nIn short this game went under the radar because everyone assumed it was an Overwatch clone. It has nothing to do with Overwatch and is quite a fun game.","May 3","true","18.0"," 340 of 442 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","340","442","14","15"

Each one has 3 skills and a personal fighting style.\n• Cannot be the same character as another player in public matches, but can in private ones.\n• In-match levels start from 1  and go up to 10 when you kill enemy players and minions.\n--- Each level allows you to select a boost ("Helix") for your character.\n• Can also unlock more Helix options for a specific character the more you play with them.\n• 8 PvE Story Missions which can be done from 1-5 players.\n• 3 PvP&E Gamemodes, all of which are 5v5. Each mode has it's own two maps.\n• AI Minions (the main "& E" of PvP&E) help you take the fight to the enemy team.\n• Online connection required\n--- Can play all missions and gamemodes solo while connected.\n• Various gear also provides boosts to your character, but requires shards to use.\n• Shards are obtained on each map.\n--- Shards are used to spawn defenses and tough minions as well as using gear.\n• Randomly-generated gear packs are purchased using in-game currency.\n--- In-game currency itself is gained from playing any mode.\n• Tons of unlockable titles, skins and taunts.\n--- Some seem to be solely obtained from the previously mentioned gear packs.\n• More characters, PvP maps and PvP gamemodes promised in future via free updates.\n• Future Paid DLC will be additional PvE Story missions as well as skins/taunts.\n\nOn the technical side of things, AMD users have been reporting some framerate issues at the moment, while far fewer Nvidia users also experience similar issues. Nvidia has released a driver update for Battleborn which hopefully fixes these issues, but AMD have yet to do so.\n\nOverall, it's a very solid game that's a whole lot of fun, but perhaps lacking in mode/map variety at the moment. Personally, I don't mind playing on the same maps, as I get enjoyment out of the character roster instead. It's blatantly obvious that Gearbox have put a lot of effort into making each character stand out from the crowd, even among the gun-wielding ones, and it ends up making my character choice difficult every game.\n\n8.5/10.\nThis needs to be in your library at some point if you're a Borderlands, FPS or MOBA fan.","May 4","true","237.3"," 169 of 222 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","169","222","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saninsince/recommended/394230/","saninsince","Saninsince","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saninsince/","437 products in account","A game with a lot of potential that is trying hard to sabotage itself at every step.\n\nThe good:\n-Colorful graphics that are appealing to the eye\n-25 unique characters with a lot of variation in their playstyle\n-Great voice acting across the board\n-A lot of humor, with some jokes hitting harder than others, but generally similar to what you would expect from a Borderlands game\n-The story co-op mode and versus modes both share the same progress and gear and benefit each other\n-When it's working like it should and the teams are balanced, the versus mode can be a lot of fun.\n\nThe bad:\n-Lack of focus in general. The versus mode with only 3 game modes and 2 maps for each is very lackluster in content-size. The story mode is with 8 missions that can all be completed in under 4 hours doesn't fare better.\n-For some reason the characters are all locked behind progression, most of which is easy enough to be done, but few of which take more effort than should be required to unlock them.\n-Uninteresting loot. Where in a game like Borderlands you would get new fun and interesting guns and equipment that you could see and actually influenced your character, here you only get uninteresting stat bonuses.\n-Story mode is supposed to be replayed with multiple characters, but the game offers barely anything new the second time around, even when you play a different character the best you might get is 1 new line of dialogue, and even that doesn't have to be. Grinding for relatively uninteresting loot isn't a great initiative either.\n-Story mode feels very rushed. The story starts and ends in a second, without any real motivation or even the villain's plans explained in the end. The missions are also very uncreative, with almost all missions being either wave defense or escort missions. The final boss basically just recycles older bosses before a non-climactic final fight.\n-It is also very noticeable in the story mode that the game wasn't made to focus on it. The balance of characters is absurd, in which some characters run through the whole story without a scratch, others barely manage to get through some missions, if they manage at all. It gets even worse when you get timed challenges during these missions to complete for rewards, which depending on the current circumstances and character you play might just be impossible by default.\n-Versus mode feels very unbalanced and unfair. It might be too early to say as of writing this, but where in other similar games, be it first person shooters or similar games in objective such as League of Legends or Dota 2, there is more of a feeling of your individual commitment mattering, here a team will based on composition destroy their opposition without any real chance to fight back. You have not yet experienced what it means to have a match devoid of fun until you have lost a match in Battleborn while not being able to do anything but slowly wait for the opponents to win. In the same way there are some very questionably exploitative things you can do in some of these maps, most notably a character who can snipe an enemy turret from across the map.\n-The servers are always online and connected to Steam. If Steam decides to go down for 1 second for a routine maintenance, you are thrown out completely. There is also no saving in story missions, which might be a problem for people who do not feel like sitting 20 to 30 minutes to finish one every time they turn on the game.\n-The lore challenges are absurd. The game wants you to finish 5 lore challenges for every character and even rewards you with gear and an achievement for doing so for each individual character, but some of them are completely insane. Some challenges want you to act and play in a way that is basically sabotaging yourself, forcing you to kill your opponents in a specific way, which just brings up annoyance. Other challenges will want you to play a number of matches with a specific other character, or kill a specific other character, which can be quite nerve-wrenching. Having to play 5 matches with a character that basically nobody plays while you also have to be able to pick one of the most commonly picked character is just a slap in the face. These challenges do nothing but hinder the enjoyment of people who want to finish them and unlock their rewards.\n\nIn conclusion, this feels like a game that has so much potential, but the developers have taken so many steps to try to botch it as hard as they can. The gameplay feels really good, the character selection is impressive and fun, the game looks good, it sounds good. However, as good as the core mechanics and features of the game are, everything around it seems extremely lackluster. From the barebones content in both versus and story mode, to the awful balance in both of those. It is rare to get a fluid and fun matchup in the game where both sides feel like they are having the same chances. The story mode also feels like it was just thrown together at the last minute, and together with some insanely bad decisions about how the characters and gear is being unlocked, and how bad the challenges the game presents you to do are, the game feels like it is deliberately trying to stop you from having fun. The game could be a gem, instead it has so many bad decisions made to how it was handled by the developer that it is currently just a butchered version of what it could be. Here is hoping that this could change in the future.","May 6","false","28.1"," 1,026 of 1,489 people (69%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","69","026","1","36","95"

I just ask that you don't blow up over it because I'm trying to be fair about it.)\n\n\nLet me start off by saying I like this game and have sunk many hours into it and will still do more in the future. So, if you are looking in the reviews to give you an idea of weather or not to buy give this a look over and judge for yourself.\n\nPros.\n1. Extremely Pretty. One of the more stylized games I've seen in a long time and the smoke effect alone makes me smile.\n2. Good voice acting in my opinion. Some pretty funny lines at that.\n3. Great Game for friends. Multi player is a must, but you can solo.\n4. Made me laugh a few times. The Story line is great, just short.\n5. Good time killer. You will lose track of time.\n6. Hardly any learning curve.\n7. Story mode is fantist. Pvp is not to bad.\n8. People have been nice.\n\nCons:\n1. It feels like its a demo. Gameplay wise, content wise, and over all length of gameplay.\n2. They way over used false dificulty. Example: Making very small platforms to stand on and moves that knock you about 75 feet away that is hard to dodge and impossible when you have 10 mobs on you. And everyones favorite lazy devs false difficulty go to, JUGGLING! This isn't game breaking, just a personal peev. I feel like its lazy.\n3. It feels so much like a boarderlands playermade mod.\n4. Everyone only really wants to play one way. (I understand this, but I get bored with no adventure and skill testing)\n5. It feels like only 5 people are played on PVP. (I think its just a balancing issue)\n6. PVP seems a bit broken at the moment and its very hard to comeback once they get fed.\n7. People refuse to team work in both pvp and pve unless they are friends with you.\n8. Same few basic mob types. Other than races no model changes. (Even halo changed colors up)\n9. To many damage dealers not enough support classes off start.\n10. The grinding is just not worth it.\n11. Price is beyond unacceptable for what this game is. DO NOT BUY AT FULL PRICE. Don't even get at 50%. Wait till a flash sale or game stats drop so low they are forced to drop the price.\n(This right here is the one you need to look at if you are wanting to buy, because as it is right now is simply isn't worth the price they are asking. I don't feel its ok to slap out rushed and unfinished content at blockbuster prices and infact I feel its fairly disrespectful that as gamers themselves they want to kill the market with this kind of greedy ♥♥♥♥.)\n\nI'm going to keep playing the game, but as it stands right now I'd hold off if you down already own it. If you are looking at reviews to get a good idea IF you want to buy the game or not, I would personally say avoid it. Though the game is fun and I really do think its worth it at an extremely reduced price. Like 30 dollar range at the high end. Like I said at the top, It just feels completely unfinished or massively rushed and it suffers for it. This could all be fixed with a trail of FREE DLC but we all know that isn't going to happen and they won't reduce the price and that is why they get a thumbs down.","May 8","false","121.3"," 617 of 985 people (63%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","63","617","985","21","43"

This is a description of Battleborn's fatal flaws. This game is a lot of fun, but this information is IMPORTANT if you wish to make an informed purchase decision. VOTE THIS REVIEW UP to spread the word!\n\nFirstly, the 5v5 PvP will matchmake your team with people who are all normally around your level. I'm level 12 at the moment. This means that my team will all be around levels 1-20ish. However, the awful matchmaking will put you against an opposing team of players who all could be Lvl40 and higher! There is a 30 minute penalty for exiting an unbalanced game, so you're forced to waste your time being completely obliterated by people who have played for 200+ hours, and are far more experience than your team is. I've played 6 matches in a row which are like this, this problem is very recurring.\n\nSecondly Matchmaking is the worst of any game I have ever played. If you live in Australia, you can only exclusively play on AU servers; so before 12pm, and after 2AM, you will not find ANY matches as everyone playing is asleep. IF there are people playing, it can take sometimes a minimum of 15 minutes to find a game, as people exiting matchmaking will repeatedly reset an already lengthy matchmaking. There shouldn't be so few people playing this so close to launch, so if Gearbox doesn't patch their matchmaking, this game will most likely be dead within a month.\n\nOn a side note, the game only has two maps per PvP mode, so that may be worth considering, as Incursion, the game's most popular mode, only has one map people ever vote to play on. This is probably where you will be wanting to spend most of your time, however Gearbox desperately needs to release some more maps before players get burnt out with the lack of selection.\n\nBattleborn is otherwise a really solid and entertaining game. It hurts me to not recommend it in its currents state. Do some research to check whether these issues have been patched before purchase. I would have waited a few weeks had the reviews I read and watched mentioned what I described, however the matchmaking is probably much better in America where the majority of the reviewers probably played the game.\n\nAnyway, I love this game otherwise. Thanks for taking the time to read.

It's like the best of both worlds, without the bad.\n\nPersonally, I don't enjoy pure MOBAs like League of Legends, because I don't find the top-down gameplay style to be very engaging in a competitive setting. However, I love the concept of having a role to fill in a team (healer, tank, DPS, support, etc).\n\nAnd while I appreciate the fast-paced gameplay of twitch shooters, I've never quite been a huge fan of the genre, due to how quickly you die in those games (instantly dying to a random explosive or sniper has never been fun).\n\nWell, this is where Battleborn comes in to save the day.\nHere, you get the satisfying and engaging gameplay of a FPS, but you also have an important role to fill in your team, which varies greatly depending on your character.\n\nThe time it takes to kill another player is very reasonable, so you always have time to counterattack or retreat if you feel outnumbered.\n\nPositioning truly matters in this game, and you have actual things to do while the enemy players are dead, such as killing minions, destroying buildings, collecting shards to build turrets, etc.\n\nSlap some Borderlands-style humor, a balanced loot system and a co-op campaign in there, and you get a very addicting and fun video game indeed.Now hear me out, I'm not saying that the execution is flawless, but this is easily the best we got right now. So I'll be playing this game until a better FPS/MOBA hybrid comes out. Or until it dies. Hopefully it won't die.

This game is not Overwatch (which is a bit more like TF2 w/ a large roster), it's an FBS/MOBA hybrid w/ a co-op story mode that plays kinda like a horde mode game, w/ escort, defense & raid style missions (on Advanced difficulty the story missions can get quite difficult, and yeah, sometimes annoyingly so).  There are a ton of characters for whatever kind of playstyle you're interested in, whether you're used to RPG characters, typical shooter archetypes, any kind of crazy melee heroes (dwarves, knights, samurai, fencers, luchador), or homicidal mechanical monsters - It's like a mishmash of sci-fi, fantasy, & pop culture. The charming humor you may remember from Borderlands is there all throughout, from character callouts & taunts to sometimes absurd story dialogue that can change up depending on the characters present. You will find a way to have fun w/ this game - just experiment w/ mechanics and abilities until you find the character/playstyle & game mode that works for you.\n\nThere are some QoL & balance issues that aren't ideal, but there have been consistent updates/fixes, and Gearbox seems to be listening & responding to the community for the most part.  There are a few recurring imbalances: the notorious Galilea, good at pretty much everything, she's the most overpowered character since beta; ISIC, the hilarious death-obsessed AI whose Ultimate turns him into an absurd DPS powerhouse, trivializing most of story mode; & Marquis, the robot butler/sniper you'll see in every PvP match b/c of his insane critical hit damage & easy headglitching (also making him a magnet for aimbot users). Some people have reported issues w/ matchmaking, but I haven't experienced many problems. If I want a public PvP match, I find one w/o issue. Public story mode matchmaking works most of the time, but who you get matched up with can vary greatly.\n\nOverall, Battleborn scratches a lot of gaming itches - from competitive shooters to MMORPG raids, horde modes games, & MOBAs, & there's plenty of ways to have fun w/ it.","May 22","true","375.9"," 102 of 153 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","102","153","2","0"

There are some things you should know before you buy:\n\n\n-This game is not borderlands (Let's just get this out of the way).\n-This game is 100% not Overwatch (It isn't even close). The two are both hero shooter, the simularities start and end there.\n-This game is not a simple FPS game in which an opponent will die in three shots.\n-THIS GAME IS NOT MEANT TO BE A SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENC IT IS HEAVILY FOCUSED ON PVP.\n\nThese are facts that have been ignored by many negative reviewers who, in my honest opinion, simply have not done reseach on what this game is really about. This game is built around team composition and communication and these two factors will utlimately decide whether or not a team will do well in every game mode this game has to offer.\n\nGame Modes:\n----------------------------\n\nThere are three PVP game modes (Where a large majority of your playtime will take place):\n\n-Capture: A simple mode in which teams try to capture objects (A,B and C) to try and earn points in a king of the hill sort of match.\n\n-Incursion: What is best decribed as a single laned MOBA where each team tries to destroy their opponent's sentries (Towers) in order to ultimately crush their base.\n\n-Meltdown: Another MOBA like mode in which players must escort minions to an objective in order to obtain points. The first to 500 point wins.\n\nAs stated above, team composition and communication will be two of your most important allies so it is wise to jump in and start making friends as soon as possible.\n------------------------------\n\nAs you can probably tell, this game contains a lot of MOBA elements, one of which is how the developers handle progression. To start, new players will not have a full arsenal of characters but will be limited to just a handful to start out with. Personally, I love this model. I absolutely love having objectives to work towards and it makes reaching those objectives (Unlockable characters) much more rewarding than simply starting out with them. One of my favorite things about Gearbox's model is the fact that there are two different ways to unlock a character, either by leveling up you profile or by completing a different side objective (Such as completing a certain story mission or destroying 500 minions).\n\n------------------------------\n\nI could go on and on about how much I love to ride this game's ♥♥♥♥ but I'd rather tell you why I'm such a big supporter of this game. Gearbox has never steered me wrong. I've supported every title they've slammed in front of me and they've responded time and time again with very appealing additions. Take my review as god's word or take it as a sack of ♥♥♥♥, your choice, but I strongly believe that this game will go somewhere regardless of it's shakey start and negative reviews. (They've already implemented many changes that have been suggested by the community, the most recent update is riddled with them: https://gearboxsoftware.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210007213-PC-Update-Hot-fix-Information). Community cooperation is exactly why I am ready to throw my cash to Gearbox.\n\nThanks for reading!","May 29","true","65.7"," 57 of 82 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","57","82","0","5"

A must buy if it's on sale at any discount. If you like Dota or Heroes of the Storm you'll enjoy this game. The best way to describe this game is a mix of Heroes of the Storm and Borderlands.\n\n\nEach of the 8 story missions last about 30-45 minutes each and are pretty challenging on Advanced difficulty. The 3 game modes, King of the Hill, "Heroes of the Storm", and escort two lanes of creeps into a furnace mode, only have 2 maps each. That's about my only complaint. Probaby more story missions and PVP maps in DLC.\n\n\nCharacters start at level 1 in the story missions/PVP matches and level to 10, choosing 1 of up to 3 specializations for your skills at each level. Each hero has a passive ability, two active abilities, and an ultimate ability at level 5. After each match, PVE or PVP, you also gain XP for your overall Command Rank and the hero you completed the match as. Leveling up your Command Rank gives items/packs/skins. Leveling up the individual characters will unlock skins and titles.\n\n\nThere currently 25 heroes consisting of a mix of melee heroes, ranged heroes, healing heroes that can also dish out some damage, and bulky tank heroes. There are stuns, blinds, knockbacks and other disables that last 1-3 seconds, however they don't last long enough to get burst down by a lone player. All the heroes are very unique in their abilities and weapons.\n\n\nI feel like there is a large emphasis on killing heroes, but you definitely can't ignore capturing objectives, killing neutral creeps, building turrets, and other PVE oriented things that are equally as rewarding in terms of XP/gold. Without these objectives, you will probably lose every match. You gain currency and XP by doing pretty much anything in the game. You spend the currency to activate 3 items you put into your loadout before the game. They add % attack damage, lower cooldowns, reduce % damage taken, increase % healing received, etc. If you perform well enough, you'll have enough gold to activate all 3 by the end of the mission/match.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty solid $60 game. There's also a season pass available for $20 that will include 5 DLCs in the future. I've been spoiled by free to play games and rarely buy games at full price, but I definitely think this is worth the money.","May 18","true","46.7"," 66 of 100 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","66","100","4","1"

With the storm of "hero shooters" flooding the game market (which this was the first one to be announced, just sayin') Battleborn has gotten the short end of the stick.\n\nJust what is Battleborn though? As mentioned before, Battleborn is of the new genre of games coming out recently, a hero shooter. Battleborn has 25 playable heroes (5 more DLC characters to come post launch, completely free) that you can play in three different competitive multiplayer gamemodes (two maps per mode) or in a full length co-op story campaign (up to 5 players).\n\nStory- In Battleborn, you're in a war against Rendain with his Jennerit Empire and Varelsi allies to save the last star in the universe: Solus. There are eight story missions that can be played on Normal or Advanced difficulty with the added option of enabling hardcode mode (only one life per player). Each mission will take you about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on what difficulty you are on and how many people are playing. Additional lore about the game can be unlocked by completing character lore challenges- specific tasks you have to perform with various different characters.\n\nMultiplayer- If the story mode doesn't tickle your fancy, there's also the competitive multiplayer. In Incursion, the mode that makes everyone think Battleborn is a MOBA (it's not), you are fighting to destroy the two enemy spider sentry bots. You'll have to escort your own minions to their sentry to disable the shields- but that's far easier said than done. Or you could play in Meltdown, where you need to feed your own minions into a robotic grinder that thinks it commands the universe. Lastly, if you just want to get some quick action you can play in Capture, which is pretty much just domination from COD.\n\nProgression- Don't think that's all, though. In each multiplayer match and story mission, you will level up your character and select different augments that power up your abilities. By playing matches you will also level up your  character rank  which will unlock skins and more augments for your character. In addition by simply playing the game you will level up your  command rank  which unlocks loot packs, loadouts, gear, and more.\n\nGear-What's that? Gear? There's still more?! That's right- you can also take gear into battle that powers up your character. However, your gear will be unactivated at the beginning of each match. To activate it you must collect "shards", the currency of the universe. But there's a catch-- those shards are also used to build tactical battle structures on the map, so choose what you buy wisely. Gear comes in various rarities and can be gained by buying loot packs (with in-game credits only, no microtransactions), by getting loot drops in the story mode, by completing challenges, or by leveling up any of your various ranks.\n\nConclusion- If you couldn't tell already, this game has incredible depth. This is the factor that distinguishes Battleborn from every other game on the block. Battleborn is a COMPLETE package, worth the $60 in full. Battleborn has NO microtransactions or DLC that will affect the competitive scene (the only DLC will be story missions and cosmetics). If you wish to see how different the game is gameplay-wise from every other MOBA or hero-shooter out there, you should perhaps look at TotalBiscuit's overview of the game. That's about all for my review though. Battleborn? 10/10.","May 2","true","195.6"," 183 of 304 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","183","304","8","20"

Changed up some reasons, because there are plenty.\n\nBad Design Decisions: The Game.\n\nI feel like I could write a college/university level thesis in length on how so many things are just poorly thought out, badly designed, or just flat out terribly implemented. They should legitimately just replace the little picture in the top right of the Steam store page with the confused fan from the Jacksonville Jaguars[imgur.com] game. At the end of every single thing, all you can really ask is "Why?" Let me just name a few so people on the outside looking in have an idea:\n\n1). Characters/Heroes are locked upon starting the game.\n\nIs it not enough I paid $60 USD for this game? No, it locks characters behind a wall with pointless requirements. Get level X or do Y in story. One of the characters, who I really wanted to try named Ghalt, I cannot. The requirement is either hitting level 40(which is a ton of hours to pour into the game) or beating ALL story missions on a harder difficulty AND getting silver on them. What a ♥♥♥♥ing big waste of time.\n\nWhy?\n\n2). Items\n\nNormally in a MOBA type game this isn't even an issue. Except the "best" items can only be obtained through singleplayer, on hardest difficulty, on hardcore. The items also cause huge variance from game to game, sometimes on the line of balance. But okay, say you don't want to bother with singleplayer to get items anyway, overlooking how much they can absolutely tip a fight in your favor. Thankfully the game has loot packs you can buy with in game currency(you gain a bit every match). Whoops, sorry. The loot packs are also locked behind levels.\n\nWhy?\n\nRegardless the item aspect is going to be such a limiting factor in Battleborn EVER being a competitive game in any respect. Look at the wiki for this game, or even the various reddit threads on loot to see how ridiculous some of the items you can get are. I have no idea why Gearbox or the community for this game would even advocate ranked or support for competitive play. It's a joke with the numerous exploits or balance issues anyway.\n\nAs an aside, since this goes with my first point, new heroes[battleborn.com] are 47,500 credits of in game currency. Get on that grind treadmill, for a paid game no less, to unlock characters that were supposedly promised as free updates into the game. Can't buy those loot packs if you want a new hero, can't buy a new hero if you want items without grinding singleplayer. Having fun yet?\n\n3). Non-existant Matchmaking\n\nSo I've established things are locked behind levels, including loot boxes to get ITEMS. But to top this off, there doesn't seem to be any sort of matchmaking whatsoever. On my first couple games with my friends, I was thrown into a game with 2 level 80s. Sweet Jesus, who thought this was a good combination? They had access to everything and then some, I had the initial prologue heroes and little else.\n\nWhy?\n\n4). Collision\n\nAllies can block you. Allies can block shots. Allied creeps can block you. Your allied Sentry can block you. Have ♥♥♥♥ing fun when you have a Montana[downloads.2kgames.com] on your team. For enemies I can understand this being a thing, but why allies? It just makes an already clunky game feel worse, especially with how wide the detection is for the collision boxes of the characters.\n\nWhy?\n\n5). First Person View Models\n\nSpeaking of Montana...the first person view models in this game are horrendous. Look at a comparison of Montana[i.imgur.com] vs. TF2 Heavy[www.gamingcfg.com] as an example. The screen clutter for that matter in this game is a joke, and makes playing melee characters far more difficult than it needs to be. I see details I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing care less about. When I play a character like Kelvin[vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net], I can see his teeth at the top and bottom of my screen.\n\nWhy?\n\n6). Lore\n\nTo find out more information about your character, this type of information is locked behind arbitrary challenges that sometimes require very specific conditions. Some require simple things like doing damage with X ability Y times, but the one that made me legit laugh out loud was playing with a certain character on your team a certain number of times. Regardless of how dumb the challenges are, it begs the question as to why the ♥♥♥♥ing LORE of a character is locked to begin with. This is typically how you can grow attached to certain heroes, immerse yourself in said world, and grow to like an IP/universe. In Battleborn? Nope. I couldn't tell you who Oscar Mike is, and being brutally honest I couldn't care less with the aesthetic of so many characters being so damn off putting or goofy.\n\nAgain, why?\n\n7). The "Helix" System & Mutations\n\nEverytime you level your hero in a game, you're usually given 2 choices of what ability you want to upgrade via something called the Helix(picture the stereotypical DNA Helix with either side having an upgrade). However, in all their wisdom, Gearbox implemented something called Mutations which add an ADDITIONAL way to upgrade your character per level. But guess what? This goes back to earlier ♥♥♥♥ing points. This is ALSO locked behind levels outside of the game. Some of these Mutation upgrades are clearly and objectively the superior choice, but you don't have access to all of them unless you play your character an incredible extended amount of matches to get your "hero level" on your account up. Locking additional hero ability upgrades through this manner only further alienates new players, and causes huge issues with the previous mentioned ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking. It's like a double whammy.\n\nOnce again, why?\n\nI really could go on for days here, but Steam reviews have a character limit. This entire game is so sloppy and unfun to play because of various issues. My favorite, that has to be mentioned, is that when I respawn I come back looking at a wall; Not the exit to spawn. At that point it's just funny and sad how amateur'ish it is, as small of a detail it is. Don't forget map clipping, z-fighting, invisible walls, seeing through certain parts of the map, the sluggish netcode and gunplay(where all weapons and interactions feel like you're playing on 200+ ping), and TONS of other things. What the hell happened here?\n\nI didn't even mention how trash the singleplayer is either. Bulletsponge enemies, meme spouting typical of Gearbox, yelling, and bleeping out of curse words. Ho boy.

You can change hero throughout the game, very quick games and the gameplay itself focuses very much around the gunplay and teamwork. Similarly, teamwork transfers into Battleborn also, but there are many other things to micromanage, such as buildables and minion waves. Having played League prior to this I see many similarities and reccomend anyone who enjoys MOBAs/FPS to try Battleborn out! Also try Overwatch, I find it fun, but believe it doesn't provide just as much to actually 'do' when in game.\n\nPros to Battleborn:\n+ Very A E S T H E T I C A L L Y Pleasing\n+ Many different characters each with their own lines and lore\n+ Every character feels unique and refreshing\n+ Co-op is very fun imho, didn't expect it to be so good\n+ I think the game modes available are also new and map design is pretty good\n+ I like having to manage the buildables, make a team comp, farm shards etc\n\nCons:\n- Some frame rate issues for people\n- I haven't experienced it yet but there is the possibility of someone leaving a game and not returning which isn't fun\n- I can't find myself playing it like I would other MOBAs, I generally stop after 2 or 3 hours at a time\n- Don't buy this game for the story\n\nFinal Score: 9/10, with enough players this game would easily be worth the $60 and I hope to see the community flourish as the game advances.","May 5","true","7.6"," 115 of 189 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","115","189","7","4"

It really is an extremely addicting game and a crazy amount of fun, and it's a shame that it is getting overlooked.\n\nYet, the game is far from perfect. Having some strange/bad design choices (mostly in terms of UI) and is still missing some much needed things (post game lobbies, better character selector menu, abuse reporting, tutorials for game modes/characters) that a MOBA should have. The lack of polish on certain things such as El Dragon's body slam, or the UI make the game look and feel like it is in beta.\n\nThe screen clutter problem and balance issues are extremely overstated, visual effects can be a little overwhelming at first but it grows on you.  Contrary to what people say, the game has plenty of content, and the character design ranges from good to utterly fantastic.\n\nI never thought the humor in the Borderlands series was very good, and as BB is a Gearbox game the humor ranges from pretty funny to cringe city. I do find the humor to overall be much better than the Borderlands games.\n\nIf you liked Monday Night Combat, you'll love it. If you like MOBAS and FPSs, you'll probably like it.\n\nObligatory Overwatch comparison: They are not really comparable and both are fantastic. But I will mention that Overwatch IS a more polished game in terms of design and shooting mechanics. Battleborn offers a deeper gameplay experience with progression and single player. Battleborns games are much longer and more methodical, everything (including minions) takes much longer to kill. If you like instant gratification shooters with the kill/die/respawn formula, Battleborn is probably not your cup of tea.","May 27","true","51.8"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","34","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibejustin/recommended/394230/","ibejustin","ibejustin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibejustin/","54 products in account","I don't usually write reviews but after playing this game for a while I felt the need to share why I believe it is a broken and rushed pile of garbage. I was so psyched when I saw that Gearbox was making a MOBA-esque FPS. As a huge fan of Borderlands, I trusted Battleborn would exceed expectations. I fanboyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of Battleborn and never once doubted Gearbox and 2K's ability to produce it. Boy was I wrong.\n\n1. My biggest beef. The campaign is the most boring, poorly-written, repetitive garbage for eight levels. The story is nowhere near as compelling or engaging as the Borderlands series. The missions and objectives within the campaign feel like they were copy and pasted over and over again. Every single mission is essentially reaching a target point, then defending it from waves of enemies (there are about 4-5 unique enemies). Every once and a while you'll reach a boss fight but even then it just feels like you're shooting at a meat sponge for ten minutes. Some missions are actually incredibly difficult to complete without using specific characters, which would be an interesting and enjoyable game mechanic if you didn't have to RESTART each level from the beginning each time you fail an objective. What's the point of checkpoints if you're just going to make us start all over every time we get overrun by huge waves of enemies with way too much HP?\n\n2. The multiplayer is BROKEN AND UNBALANCED. Battleborn is one of the only games I've ever played where I felt like there was an inherent disadvantage for certain players in competitive multiplayer. They had time to balance the characters in the Beta, but they didn't. So now every time I see a Rath on the enemy team I prepare myself to get stunned and killed in seconds over and over again (google Rath OP - I promise I'm not the only one who feels this way). Getting kited all game is a blast. Not to mention that teamfights are an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. Fighting enemies can get so disorienting and nauseating. Often times I find myself just staring at the minimap in teamfights looking for enemies because there's no way in hell I'm able to pick out specific players within a giant mess of colorful explosions and flares. The addition of minions to multiplayer was a great idea and I love that games are starting implement MOBA elements like that, but sometimes it's ridiculously hard to differentiate between a character and a minion because their size, shape and colors are very similar. And if you thought getting creep blocked in League was frustrating, just wait until you get stuck inside larger minions in Battleborn.\n\n3. The look and design of the game is not reflective of a AAA studio. I would argue the most recent Borderlands looks better than Battleborn. The models feel outdated, the menus are uninspired and the textures are cheesy as hell. I feel like I'm playing a game from the early 2000's. The oversaturated colors and flashes are really annoying and could have been toned down. Sound design is meh.\n\nI'm sorry Gearbox but this is a BAD game and I feel incredibly let down. And this is coming from one of the biggest Gearbox fans. It's so obvious you guys rushed to release this game in time to compete with Overwatch. And now that the game is out, instead of fixing its long list of problems you announce that production of Borderlands 3 has started. NICE.\n\nThis is NOT a $60 game. It should be a free-to-play like League of Legends with options to purchase points and unlock characters. I wish I hadn't purchased my game code from Amazon so that I could refund this and try Overwatch instead. Sure it's a much different game, but at least it looks up to date and much more professional than Battleborn. I will not recommend this title to anyone and will remain skeptical of Borderlands 3. SHAME.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've played both Battleborn and Overwatch, I can comfortably say that Overwatch has the slight edge. As much as people will try to argue that they're vastly different, they have many similar qualities and features (both FPS games with similar art styles, heroes with unique abilities and ultimates, competitive multiplayer, etc) and due to the close proximity of their release dates it is very fair to compare them in terms of which game deserves the money. Based SOLELY on which game felt better, I would say neither deserve the $60 price tag but Overwatch was more enjoyable as it felt cleaner, more professional and balanced in terms of multiplayer.\n\nEDIT 2: Holy ♥♥♥♥ people are seriously upset by this review. You realize everyone is entitled to an opinion, right? I'm not the only one who disliked this game. Instead of getting upset over reviews that express different views than yours maybe just go play the game and don't worry about what other people think?

These are 2 complete different games and the way the newest Gearbox masterpiece handles in gameplay and replayability is outstanding! Yes there are still a few bugs but these are surely going to be fixed.\n\nThe gamemodes are great. You got your Borderlands-esque story, where you have to save the last star in the known universe from being destroyed, and your PVP modes. The story is both aviable for single and multiplayer(up to 5). In the PvP section there are 3 modes, the traditional Capture and 2 new ones. The first is Incursion. A mixture of tower defense with minions where it's your goal to destroy the two guardians od the enemy team. The last mode is meltdown. This is completely new to me. Here you have to escort your minions to a shredder like machine where they are going to be destroyed and at the half of your aim the position of the machine changes.\nThus there is a huge variety in PvP. Sadly there are only 2 maps per gamemode at the moment but there are going to be more implemented into the game within the next months. For free.\n\nFor free, that's a good point, because there are going to be 5 more Battleborn characters going to be released.

The story is not as in depth as Borderlands, this is not a singleplayer game. I don't know why people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this. The missions are super funny, it has all the great humor of a borderlands game, but very different gameplay. Do not buy this for a singleplayer experience.\n\nNow for the real stuff, PvP. Currently the balance is attrocious. Gearbox is supposedly working on patches for this, but well see... You will be killed by the same characters over and over, and in order to counter these you will have to play the same charactres over and over... I have been working on the forums in an effort to make people aware of this and so far it seems that the majority of the community believes balances are needed.\n\nBeyond balance there are plenty of other problems, mainly team balance. I find that I am constantly matched with either amazing or terrible players and it's the same story for the other team. Most matches are either a domination or a complete destruction of my own team. In rare cases you get locked into a stalemate of push and pull, which can be quite fun and intense. There's some weird physics issues with the minions and collision detection with players. It's not game breaking by any means but it is annoying.\n\nThe other big issue is people just leaving matches or being AFK. I blame this on the balance of the game in general, if you're fighting the seriously overpowered characters and your teammates aren't that great, there's nothing you can do. This isn't the kind of PvP where you can solo stuff. You win as a team or you all die when you're cornered by 2 or 3 enemies.\n\nIn terms of content, this game is fine. There are 25 playable characters and each has a very rich lore/backstory which is unlocked by completeting associated challenges. These are usually fun and can range from very easy to extremely difficult. 25 is a lot. They're all very unique, and there are many relationships between the characters which you can learn more about by learning the lore on characters involved. I really enjoy this part of the game. People who are whining about a lack of content expected this to be a singleplayer borderlands game. This is Battleborn, not borderlands-get over it.\n\nIf you're willing to deal with balance issues and some frustration, this game is a ton of fun. In fact it's so fun you'll probably overlook those issues for the first 50 or so hours of gameplay. I certainly did. I think Gearbox will address all of these issues in time, but the game in its current state is not something I'd recommend buying. I will change this review if it improves.\n\n\nEdit:\nAfter some more thought, I have one more thing to add. If you don't have 4 other people to play this game with, don't buy it. Playing PvP solo is terrible. Teamwork just doesn't exist and no one will play support.\n\n\nFurthed Edit:\nI've played 160 hours of this game. Do not buy this game unless you're ready to deal with extreme frustation. Gearbox's game design is absolute garbage and the balance is unbelievably bad. At first, I had a superficial view of the inbalance in this game. Now that I've played a lot and am quite good, I can now see that the problems I was originally talking about run far, far deeper than I initially thought. The dev's little baby patches will not help nearly as much as prescribed and their hotfixes have done nothing. This game is broken if anyone uses any of the hundres of exploits. There are literally hundreds. You'll get cancer team compositions and incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t character combos. Right now, for instance, the shotgunner character, Ghalt, can three hit kill anyone in the game once he hits level 7. From anywhere on the map. His weapon has no drop off and does over 1000 damage on crit and it's hitscan. That's just one broken character. Very few people in the community are acknowleding this. The devs don't seem to be acknowledging it. Do not buy this game unless you're ready for extreme frustration.","May 8","false","180.6"," 198 of 346 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","198","346","6","12"

There are some legitimate criticisms about this game and it does have some infrequent bugs here and there. They are still working on PVP Matchmaking, although it has gotten a lot better, and the marketing department infuriatingly tried to sell this as direct competition to a certain Blizzard game even though the two are not even remotely similar and that certain other game has generated almost as much hype as Star Wars VII. There are also people who will play this and dislike it because it's not their thing.\n\nNothing I can do about that. But I can share my personal expeience, and in my opinion... this game is a hell of a lot of fun. It's also very, very addictive.\nNo, the game doesn't have a deep story. It doesn't need to, though. It is a fun, cartooney, FPS with MOBA elements and it never loses it's lighthearted feel.\nThe characters are likeable, awesome, and ridiculous.\nYou can play the same match 20 times and have a different experience every time. The diversity in items and characters keeps the experience fresh, and the humor and silliness reminds you not to take it too seriously. I absolutely cannot stand Multiplayer FPS that takes itself too seriously because that invites the player to take it way too seriously and consequently, annoy casual players. While you occasionally have a hardcore jerk on the mic (that's every game) for the most part everyone's just in there to enjoy themselves. Like Team Fortress 2, this game invites you to embrace the ridiculous and just have a good time. And that's not to say there isn't challenge for those who want to explore it further, because there is. The lore challenges and the advanced modes will keep you very busy if you want something a bit harder.\n\nBEGINNER'S ADVICE... TAKE SOME TIME AND GET USED TO IT -  If you are just starting out, I highly recommend you do a couple solo missions first (or missions on normal difficulty). Maybe do a single player practice round or two on PVP just to get your footing. The experience is quite a bit different from a lot of other FPS games and it can take a bit of time to get into it. If you jump into PVP at command rank 2 or 3, you're just gonna get slaughtered and you're gonna have a bad time. If you try an advanced story mission and you're not comfortable with the game, you'll lose in 3 minutes. True story. Wound up on a team of mostly rank 1-6. Slaughtered in 3 minutes on advanced.\n\nUPDATES - The Gearbox team is listening to complaints. They are making changes. (Nerfing OP characters, fixing bugs, and releasing patches) If you run into a problem, mention it on their board as constructive criticism.\n\nTHE FUTURE - This game is a lot of fun as it is. That said... it has the potential to grow and become really amazing. There are legitimate criticisms and issues, but they are working on them. I can't disagree with legitimate concerns about the game like bugs, or people trying it and finding that it's just not for them, but some reviews are just people being salty that they bought it before it went on sale, or making comparisons to a certain Blizzard game and how much better it is with it's 60 mile long hype train. I'd hate to see the game die before it reaches its full potential. It's not a bad game at all. But with a little love it could be amazing.\n\nAs it is now, it's a silly, cartoon fun action adventure and if you go into it with that mindset, and take a few hours to get into the groove, you'll probably have fun. 8/10","May 29","true","83.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Sadly though, back then i had a very negative impression of the game. It played bad, it felt sloppy and it looked like a quick cash in on the overwatch hype.\n\nThe thumbs up should give you an indication on how i feel about it now.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBbhARagofo\n\nTextual summary:\n\nBattleborn has out to be an amazing co-Op and PvP Experience with a just right mix of bad comedy, flashy animation, corny one-lines and extremely tight controls, animations and combat interaction. Both vs AI as well as versus players.\n\nThe game has a ton of stuff for you do, unlock and experiment with, going from heroes, titles, objectives, skins, taunts and so on and so forth. A ton of replay ability in the various Co-Op missions and while still requiring balance between champions / heroes for PvP, has a amazing variety to pick from and mix and match.\n\nWhile initially being against the always online part, due to the marketing of a single player experience, I have come to re-evaluate that, as the game is less "single player" and more "co-op but alone". Its design if all about playing with friends (steam integration) or strangers (matchmaking) and not about solitary play, even if it allows that.\nAn issue that this does bring is that the server, if they crash during a match, will make you lose your progression, hopefully this is something that will be resolved ASAP, as it is a big gripe.\n\nThe built in voice over IP works great and while there are Major issues with AMD Cards, I've had the game running at 60 FPS perfect all the time. No drops, no issues. The technical things of the game are pretty extensive, allowing quite a bit of customization and even having team color changes that -COULD- help colorblind people somewhat. A FOV Slider also makes me a happy camper.\n\nNow, if you do not enjoy wave based / character-shooter-esque combat or MOBA like battle arena's. This might not be the game for you - but if you enjoy Co-Op PvE Play, and PvP Team combat with a varied cast of interesting characters and mechanics as well as a good number of maps with a few varied modes - this is a title to look for.\n\nThe fact that it doesn't have Micro transactions and you get the whole experience is also nice for a change.","May 5","true","21.4"," 96 of 166 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","96","166","5","9"

Seriously, all communities have that cancerous part and this seems to draw out the worst of what i thought was actually a nice community here.\n\nGearbox has been a favorite developer of mine for some time, but I never heard of this game until a friend told me about the first trailer which should have been a bad sign. For some reason this game was under-marketed with a failure to advertise the game properly and that is somewhat factoring into the low number of players. However, it is a decent game but in my opinion I don't enjoy playing this game. Some of these cons and pros may be opinionated and others will be plain fact.\n\nOne thing I like overall is the progression which allows you to unlock more characters and just have a goal. Characters are great and have humorous moments and dialogue like Oscar Mike who is my personal favorite\n\nOne major issue is that this game has a horrible memory leak which causes major stuttering and frame drops from long sessions of playing without resets to the game (Easy fix, so it is not put as a con to anything really). The game is somewhat taxing at higher visual settings.\n\nAnd I know this game is not Overwatch and I will not compare it to eachother, but it is somewhat obvious that this will end up being a competitor of Overwatch. Overwatch is also a leading factor in the reason why the player count is so low as the game was released very close to an Open Beta of Overwatch which saw drastic differences in the player count, which is rather sad when people won't give Battleborn a try in any method such as Steam Share, borrowing a copy, etc.\n\n(Going to the community hub will tell you how many players are currently playing the game: HIghest I have seen is 6000 players at once)\n\nCAMPAIGN  Pros -\nHumorous at times with the Gearbox style we see in Borderlands\nFun with friends\nFast-paced in exception to certain parts\nSome actual good bosses\nGreat Voice-Acting and dialogue\nDifferent Dialogue when playing different characters through the story (PRO AND CON) Cons\nShort - 4 to 6 hours give or take\nDry moments with no humor that you would expect\nEmpty walking simulator feeling in multiple parts and repetitive combat\nSome really bad bosses - Sentinel and the Ice Guardian (Whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is) in particular\nRanged characters are the only viable choice in the hardest difficulties: especially in solo\nYou must be online. You cannot even play the campaign on solo offline. A constant Internet connection is required.\nIt has been said countless times that playing another character increases the replay value of the campaign and in some ways it is worth while to hear the different dialogue, but in the end it just isn't worth it in my opinion to go through parts you have played countless times. (PRO AND CON)\nNow for the main piece:\nTHE MULTIPLAYER  Pros -\n2 Maps for each gamemode (For a moba is rather nice)\n3 Gamemodes (Basically boils down to: Domination, push, and another form of push with minions)\n25 Different Characters with unique abilities\nSlight amounts of humor\nSomewhat Competetive\nVery hectic when action is happening\nGear system which makes you decide between building defenses for XP or activating gear to give you permanent buffs.\nPlays like a moba AKA: Long Matches and strategy (PRO AND CON) Cons\nLack of players which results in long queues OR playing with the same players over and over again. Apparently this is not the case with everybody, but I myself even with an Open NAT type have waited upwards to 20 minutes for a match once or twice.\nThere is always a favorite map for every gamemode, so you may never see that 2nd map of the gamemode\nBalancing Issues with characters (Galilea being one of the worst cases reportedly)\nCharacters need to be unlocked which some take no time at all, while others take multiple hours of doing their challenge or reaching the required level\nThe gear system is unbalanced when against new players because there is no level matchmaking so you can get matched against players with a legendary gear that fits perfectly for their character's build while you are still rolling with white gear with tank stats for a dps character.\nThe matchmaking - You may be new to the game and still get pitted against veterans who have played far longer and have a better understanding of the game\nHits don't feel like they have impact, weight, or a feel like you're doing damage. This is an issue with guns and Melee Attackers (In My Opinion - You can write this one off if you want)\nDespite being a seasoned Moba player with Smite and League even I feel like nothing is really happening in most matches\nDry spells with literally nothing happening in the match which is somewhat expected in a moba, but it happens way too often in this game\nTOO MANY EFFECTS - Seriously it is blinding sometimes and disorients for no reason\nIt playes like a Moba AKA: Long Matches and strategy (PRO AND CON)\nCONCLUSION It is an okay game, but honestly it begins to feel like a generic fps with rpg elements like Destiny. When viewed as an FPS with RPG and MOBA aspects it is unique. I just happen to dislike this combination of game styles I guess and don't see the MOBA aspects unless playing Incursion.\n\nThe moba aspects make it competetive and the several different characters allow for different tactics and uses. However, because it is a moba there is no drop-out and drop-in gamemodes and the matches will range from 30 minutes to an hour. With that comes perks as the game requires communication and strategy to excel, so this is both a pro and con it its own way.\n\nThe gear system is refreshing, but really is a dumbed down item shop that you have to customize before games. As a result of being unable to customize on the fly, it hinders the customization as you cannot change gear depending on the situation like in Dota or League of Legends.\n\nThe game is funny sometimes with obvious points of humor, but in some cases takes itself too seriously and you see a drastic drop in jokes throughout the campaign with stale moments. The multiplayer has some occasionally funny dialogue as well and I wouldn't expect much humor from that aspect of the game.\nThe multiplayer is actually fun when you know what is happening while action is occuring. It is not fun to watch members of your team begin to leave when you begin to lose the match though.\n\nOverall, the game gets a 5/10 for me as it attempted to expand on the Moba genre with FPS aspects as well, but it fell over in multiple spots.  Especially with the low amount of players currently which admittedly has a really nice community. I almost enjoy the fact that there is no META yet and it allows you to experiment and mess around without getting yelled at and berated by insults questioning your mental capacity.\nCOMMUNITY Never have I seen a worse community when you give the game a negative review\nI will give it a  8/10  6/10 because of the recent "♥♥♥♥ you and your negative review" and "Quit comparing to Overwatch" comments. (Overall score remains a 5/10 for me despite the amazing community in game)\n\n5/10 does not mean it is bad. I would recommend picking the game up on a sale for possibly 40 or 30 dollars.\nSEASON PASS INFO: JUST AS A WARNING Maps and characters will be free and the season pass which is basically it gives you new characters without the need to unlock them.\n\nThe thing that is different is that it adds story mission to the campaign I believe as tthey create them and release them.","May 12","false","27.0"," 151 of 269 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","151","269","5","3"

However, I implore you to find at least two other reliably good people to play with, as due to persistent issues with matchmaking, trying to play this game with pubs is an exercise in rage-inducing futility.\n\nIf you weren't aware, Battleborn is a five player coop, or five versus five competive team first-person shooter with many elements taken from MOBAs. If that's not your cup of tea, and believe me, I understand, then this review will probably not change your mind.\n\nIn the distant future, thanks to a race of horrible dark energy-oozing montrostities called the Varelsi, there is only one star left in the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ universe: Solus. To make matters worse, a madman by the name of Lothar Rendain, former general of the brutal Jennerit Empire, has decided to team up with the Varelsi, assassinating the Empress Lenore and transforming his nation into the even more brutal Jennerit Imperium. But all is not lost! Enter the Battleborn, a rag-tag group of electic resistance fighters from each of the five remaining factions, including former members of the Empire, who are poised to stop Rendain and save the last star. As one of the 26 playable members of the Jennerit, the United Peacekeeping Republics, the Last Light Consortium, the Eldrid or the Rogues, you will battle through hordes of Rendain's Thrall troops, minion robots, and Varelsi monsters and massive bosses in nine story missions, or fight against player-controlled battleborn in six multiplayer maps across three game modes.\n\nBattleborn is first and foremost an FPS. if you can't aim, you can't win. That being said, each of of the playable characters conforms to a different niche of play,and surprisingly, about half the cast are melee-focused fighters, most lacking a ranged weapon entirely. This can prove a disadvantage, and I would personally prefer that they have some kind of weak ranged attack just as a means of staying involved in a fight, but most of them instead have means of closing the distance, blocking or avoiding incoming fire, or diverting attenton from themselves. Conversely, ranged characters often have means of preventing enemies from drawing close or otherwise escaping a melee, and every character's quick melee attack knocks enemies away a short distance. The key difference between Battleborn and an ordinary team shooter is really in the active abilities, and using them both often and skillfully, as well as selecting the right augments, will give you an edge in individual engagements. In story, this is enough to carry you through the level, but in versus... well. Just, bring a good team. You'll thank me later.\n\nIn the style of MOBAs, you begin each round, story or versus, at level 1. You begin with both of your basic abilities, with a third, "ulitmate" ability unlocking at level 5. At each level you have a choice of two "augments", which add additional passive effects to your active abilities, basic attacks, movement options, etc. Far from the incremental stat boosts you get from leveling in other MOBAs, these augments are major game changers. In general, the left choices are more defensive while the right ones are geared towards offense.\n\nYou acquire money "shards" in-game that allow you to build things on the map likes turrets or spawn more powerful minions, and can also be used to purchase one of three "gear" items that you select prior to starting a match. You can only have three items in each loadout, but you may save several loadouts. This is this game's answer to the in-game item shops of DOTA-style games. These items come in several rarities, with orange-rank items confering the most dramatic and in some cases unique effects. This system is thankfully less complex then in other MOBAs, but is still probably the most in-depth mechanic in this game and will probably require you to experiment with different loadouts and to tailor them to your preferred characters.\n\nOutside of individual matches the game tracks your progress with individual character and overall "command" rank, and leveling these tracks rewards you with, in the case of characters, new skins, titles and taunts, and five new augments that give you a third choice at certain in-game levels, while leveling your command rank unlocks new battleborn, titles, and the occasional reward item pack containing faction-specific items, including at least one skin. New battleborn can also be unlocked via specific challenges, and some of these are much more difficult then others: ISIC can be unlocked simply by completing the first story level, while on the other extreme Ghalt is unlocked by completing every story level on the harder difficulty with at least a silver rating. There are many, many other challenges as well, with each character also having specific challenges to them, unlocking which confers bits of lore about that character, as well as a character-specific legendary gear item if you unlock them all. However, some of these are the most obnoxious challenges in the game, like ones for Galilea and Alani tha requires you to kill opposing Ambra players 25 times.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the story mode, which makes good use of Gearbox's now-signature off-beat writing and humor (with considerably less memes, if that bugged you in Borderlands) The music, the voice acting, the color palette the hand-drawn prologue cutscene and accompanying rap, the character design- it all works, its all stylish. Batleborn is one of the most asthetically pleasing games I've ever played. But it is regrettably very short, especially compared to Borderlands, meaning that in spite of a large cast of characters to try and challenges to complete, the lasting time investment of the game will probably have to come from versus, and that carries with it a set of problems.\n\nThe major problem with Battleborn: It's dependance on other players for the quality of your experience, which is my beef with MOBAs in general and why I quit LOL and never touched DOTA 2. You will lose a considerable percentage of matches if you queue for them solo, or even with one other player. Battleborn is extremely team-synergy focused and if you don't have that synergy, you will lose over and over. It's actually more important then individual player skill, and coupled with an actually reasonable damage model, sets Battleborn apart from its Call-of-Duty-influenced contemporaries. At present the game's matchmaking system is deeply flawed (You know, like matchmaking in general), regularly pitting premade 5-player teams against random pubs, resulting in most matches being depressingly one-sided. About half of my matches have ended in a surrender, including the victories, because the losing team is losing so hard that they don't feel like wasting their time playing the match out to completion. This is not the experience I had in in the Beta, oddly, though I am not precisely sure what changed that caused this. There is also a persistent issue with players behaving not only as if they are inexperienced in Battleborn, but inexperienced playing shooters period. I reguarly see absolutely boneheaded behavior and it's driving me up a wall.\n\nSince my enjoyment of a versus game is directly related to not only my personal success but my win percentage, which may be the wrong way of looking at it, I admit, It would be nice to take a break once and a while and play the private versus modes against bots: Except that while you can still earn XP from doing so, you get it at a severely nerfed rate and worse, you don't get challenge or achievement progress from doing so.\n\nI love Battleborn in spite of its many glaring issues, and while I expected better in the first place, I also expect more from it in the future, especially considering the ongoing fixes, like the sniping exploit on Overgrowth. If you have some competent friends I think you will enjoy it as well.","May 2","true","165.5"," 87 of 153 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","87","153","3","2"

Which is enough to say this game will appeal to some. I enjoy it myself, it reminds me strongly of Super Monday Night Combat. The game is sufficient, there are no glaring gameplay issues, it provides an experience that can foster a healthy player base.\n\nA healthy player base, therein lies the problem. This game is set to fail for a number of reasons.\n\n\nThe Price\n$60 is a lot for a multiplayer only game. We have seen what happens with this business model with two excellent examples of the perfect storm for failure.\n\nTitanfall was a commercial success, but as a product/service it failed. It was a great turnover for Respawn but the turnover of players was dramatic. Players left en masse very quickly on both PC and Xbox One. The game featured limited game modes, shallow progression and little room for mastery or diversity in ways to experience it due to these issues. The game loop itself was also repetitive as a result. Respawn might see the game as a success based on dollars earned, but to me should I have worked on the game, I would feel dissatisfied I provided an experience so forgettable that sold on misguided hype alone.\n\nEvolve was a complete mess. A game that should have been Free2Play because of its reliance on having a monster and team of people. By charging $60 you severely limit potential growth and maintenance of the community. An issue where a group of players who queue together vs someone alone as a monster creates two types of players without rewarding either in measurable means. You may find enjoyment in playing one role or the other but there was always a chance you would not get that role. Meaning to queue alone was unideal for experiencing the game the way you wanted to play. This was an inherent flaw of design, one of many, that was expounded by the price tag and the delays the game faced.\n\nA SMITE business model would have been the best fit for Evolve, allowing for players to pay $30-40 to unlock all current and future monsters/hunters. People unwilling to pay that could still play for free using a free currency to unlock characters.\n\nThere is plenty more wrong with Evolve but the issue as it pertains here is the business model. How it negatively affected the game due to not creating an environment in which as many players as possible could try the game. This was an issue due to the game's design and reliance on high player population to support the core game mode.\n\n\nOverwatch\nPeople are getting confused over this game and comparing it to Overwatch. The games are different yet share esthetic similarities. Because of the latent ignorance of most gaming hobbyists they will refuse to educate themselves based on bias and potentially the $60 price tag.\n\nPeople like this will never know or be able to identify what Battleborn is. They will pass it over because they cannot be bothered to research the game.\n\nThe best way to fix this is to let them see the difference for themselves. The only way to do that is to let them play it. However the likelihood they will drop $60 just to try something is slim to none. So a problem born of circumstance due to Overwatch and another problem born of a poor business model combine to create an issue big enough and powerful enough to kill the game.\n\nGearbox has done a poor job marketing the game, explaining what it is. You can’t understand Battleborn if you cannot try it. You cannot differentiate it from other games if you cannot try it. You will likely not pay $60 just to try something, especially something you are so unsure about. As is the case with Battleborn.\n\nThere is a number of ways Battleborn could have gone about structuring its release/service.\n\nFirst would be Free2Play akin to that of League of Legends. Buy skins, packs, characters with real money or in-game currency.\n\nNext would be Free2Play with a SMITE model. Pay “x” amount of dollars to get all the characters present and future. Something in the $30-40 range. Offer a $60 package with extras like exclusive skins and boosters.\n\nIn both cases you can still make packs/gear only purchasable with in-game currency. The only way to get these faster would be to pay for boosts of in currency gain. This is not Pay2Win because in order to get the most out of a boost be it number of wins or a set amount of time (10 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 month, etc) you have to actually perform well. Gear itself has been balanced and can continue to be balanced to work in tandem with such a system. You could also just not offer boosts.\n\nLast you can allow for players to only use a set number of characters and making any purchase above “x” amount of dollars gives them access to the whole game. It does not give them all future character content, but allows for unrestricted access to the full experience.\n\nIssues would arise from the lore missions and unlocks associated with them but you could work this out, this is merely an analysis.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs I see it now the game will either drop in price as community numbers tank or it will go Free2Play by the end of the year.\n\nGearbox is either ignorant and has failed to learn from past failures or they have simply the hubris to ignore the issues that will crop up due to the business model they have chosen.\n\nA Season Pass is just icing on the cake. If maps are sold to players it splits the community. If maps are sold to players in a low populated game, it kills the community. This is exactly something Evolve failed with.\n\nBattleborn has performance and network issues. The humor might be cringey, poorly written/executed and cliche. The gameplay itself suffers from sensory overload. Particle effects fill the screen constantly and the choice to not desaturate the maps to make important entities standout can literally give you a headache. The perspective of first person also feeds into this issue.\n\nHowever the experience is fun and reminiscent of Super Monday Night Combat. A game that was abandoned to make a Kickstarter for a crappy RTS no one bought. A game they charged $90 for and slowly lowered the price for up until launch and beyond to maximize earnings with a mediocre and forgettable experience.\n\nBattleborn and Super Monday Night Combat are not mediocre, they are very competent games and have the potential to sustain themselves on an audience who like the game for what it is. People fail to understand what Battleborn is because they cannot try it. They cannot try it because of a ridiculous price tag vs content/service offerings. 2 maps per game mode is a hard sell, most people don’t know about this. The possibility that future maps might be sold because of the horrible and morally bankrupt concept of Season Passes, it would and should keep more people away.\n\nI do not recommend Battleborn unless you are prepared for a number of possibilities that need to be identified when making this purchase.\n\nThe game will die due to poor choices on Gearbox’s end. Season Pass and price point.\nThe game will go Free2Play making you feel you wasted $60 dollars.\nYou might not like the game at all. If this is the case keep track of your time played and return it.\nIf you can get over these hurdles and can accept it might be a short ride but one you want to take none the less - you should buy the game. If you can accept these hurdles and like Super Monday Night Combat - you should buy the game.\n\nAlways remember you can return it worst case scenario. Keep it under 2 hours\n\nAddendum\nIf the words Free 2 Play trigger you: http://pastebin.com/TEEjgpCd","May 4","false","76.4"," 101 of 179 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","101","179","4","6"

I've never played LoL, DOTA or SMITE and apart from a basic understanding of "lanes" my knowledge of the genre is pretty limited. So when I heard that Battleborn, a MOBA/FPS game with some raid/dungeon elements, was open for testing I had to see what it was all about. My usual genres of choice are FPS / MMORPGS and Battleborn seems to take the most fun elements of both and combines them together with the fundamental nature of the MOBA.\n\nAnd here we are, and what a glorious place we find ourselves in. The artistic direction of this game is brilliantly conceived. It's almost as though an Anime cartoonist and a LSD enthusiast had a brainstorming session resulting in this gloriously fun and vibrant parallel dimension. The environments, characters, planets, gameplay, AI and overall universe Gearbox have created is both genius and painstakingly consistent. The whole game feels like an epic labour of love with absolutely no room for compromise.\n\nThe story campaign, which can be played either solo or co-operatively, is most reminiscent of your typical WoW dungeon and - in some scenarios - raid! The encounters take all the best game mechanics of a top notch instanced experience and combine it with some of the most fast, furious and colourful FPS action you've ever experienced. The result is... Magical...\n\nThen we have the true heart of Battleborn, the versus mode, where players have the choice of three different game modes: Incursion (defend base, attack enemy case) Capture (hold objectives) and Meltdown (escort friendly minions to enemy base). Each gametype is offers a different player experience, but the true magic here is in the variety of characters to choose from, and the way in which you develop them as they level up and eventually rank up.\n\nI could go on and on about the rewarding item system, the in-game level up choices, the individuality of each character and how the game constantly screams quality, reminding me of the best aspects of all the games I love... But I won't.\n\nAll I will say is this: Don't expect an Overwatch clone - this is completely different and in the best way possible. Don't expect a typical dungeon/raid experience - Battleborn takes the best mechanical aspects of both and runs with them. Don't expect a MOBA replacement - treat this more as a compliment to the MOBA genre. Above all: Expect a beautifully crafted game, with a stunning landscape, solid characters, compelling gameplay, genius AI enounters and some of the best art direction you've ever experienced.","May 3","true","36.2"," 39 of 65 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","39","65","2","0"

It isn't a bad game at all, and it isn't a clone or a copy of any other new and popular game. ( I'm looking at you, Overwatch ) I bought the game out of a chance, it's been awhile since I've purchased any $60 game at all. So with all of this in mind let me go ahead and point out why this is a maybe.\n\nThere is no offline play, at all\n\nWhy yes, you read that correctly. Battleborn has no offline mode or setting at all. Now this isn't an issue, most games I play are online based and there are few that I actually play offline with at all. The only issue that I find with this, is that if you are playing with others or even by yourself it requires a internet connection. That means if you are playing the campaign solo, and you disconnect or lose connection to Steam.. then all of your progress will be washed away, and you'll be taken back to the main screen. It isn't a fun feeling to lose around 40 minutes of progress because of random Steam outages or random issues dealing with reality.\n\nThis game strictly relies on playbase to keep going\n\nBattleborn requires people to play it, in order to keep up and actually be worth playing. Think of it as Brink, which was boring as sin without people to play with. And that includes a problem.. which I'll be touching on right below.\n\nYou need to have better than a potato to run this game\n\nNow I have more than a potato, I have a pretty built up PC. I'm not going to list off my specs, if you want to know just ask. However I've found that many people are having problems with their frames dropping, or just random mishaps in general. Some people don't, and I'm glad they are able to play at a constant 60fps with max settings. However this game relies on playbase as I mentioned above, and most people aren't willing to dish out $60 for a game that requires a stable and bulked up PC to look nice and refreshing.\n\nThis is a MOBA\n\nNow it is a FPS, but it leans more towards the MOBA tag. Each character relies on abilities, which have cooldowns, levels that are gained by killing mobs or other players to increase abilities or add different status effects. MOBA's are a huge thing currently, and you can take your pick and choose. ( Dota 2, LoL, Smite.. and now Battleborn? )\n\nUnlocks, and gear\n\nMany people see the Gearbox and 2k logo's, read the "From the creators of borderlands!".. and instantly think:\n\nPeople: Well gosh this game must be like Borderlands, with alot of loot and items!\nBattleborn: Sure, we've got plenty of loot and unlocks!\nPeople: Well that's fantastic, so is it like millions of items and skins? What kind've items? How do we get them?\nBattleborn: Well.. like.. you can unlock skins by leveling your Battleborn up.. and items are dropped by bosses and large enemies.. did you say millions? I mean that's a large number man..\nPeople: So this isn't like borderlands?\nBattleborn: Well, no.\n\nPeople need to stop looking at prior games, this isn't Borderlands. It has humor, and it has that feel to it - but it isn't Borderlands.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBattleborn is a new step towards FPS's and MOBA's alike. It takes a step in the right direction in creativity, however falls short of the general playerbase by being a game that isn't acceptable by many. It wants to draw people in with humor, and the MOBA aspect.. but keep in mind that anyone can download another FREE MOBA and play that with a potato, instead of spending $60 for basically the same experience in a different skin and dimension.\n\nI hope that the game flourishes and that the playerbase grows and people stay playing. I don't want this to just die off after awhile, it would be a shame.\n\nThis is my first time writing a review, I'm sorry if I didn't touch base on everything. I'm not rating the graphics since that to me is a silly thing to do. Everyone looks at things differently, so what looks good to me might not look good to you.\n\n7/10 - It isn't for everyone, quite literally.","May 5","true","23.0"," 68 of 119 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","68","119","0","0"

Probably not your game. If your good you won't find much challenge. Matchmaking is a bit of an issue. I was repeatedly placed on teams of what seemed to be absolute pros and because of my obvious non-pro status, I kept getting grief because I was the reason the team was flubbing. Character balance also seems to be an issue. Once I unlocked a couple of choice characters I was able to somewhat keep up with the pros who I had been somewhat flubbed against earlier. All in al even though I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and constantly get hounded by people yelling GIT GUD and learn to play, it's decent despite some balance issues. Just prepare to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you early in the game until you unlock the uber characters: Galetea, Benedict, Ambra, Phoebe, Deandre. Stay away from anyone playing these characters till you get used to the game.\nOverall PVP 6/10 Not the best, but better than average. Also no one has claimed to have slept with my mother yet, so I figure that's a good thing.\n\nFor those who enjoy PVE: Don't pick up this game unless it goes on sale. PVE is the reason I got this game, big fan of Borderlands, love co-op games, etc. But after about four to five hours of play, I had completed all the PVE content of this game. It's decent, it's fun and if you know what your doing you can feel like the badass this game so advertises. With about five hours of PVE content, and limited replayability (There are advanced difficulties, but as of yet there is no matchmaking system to play those with PUGs.)\nPVE: 7/10 Pretty good, good story, but lacking in overall content for people who enjoy that sort of play.\n\nFor Hardcore Players: This game is for you. Hardcore PVP? Wanna show you know your FPS stuff? Wanna feel like an absolute boss? This game is great. The powers, the characters, you can sit there and juggle an entire battlefield both PVE and PVP if you know what you're doing. Of course knowing what you're doing takes a couple matches or missions. Level up your character, unlock different power mutations, get the gear to make your favorite characters nearly unbeatable. It takes some patience and love, but you can do it if you have the time.\nHardcore Player Rating: 9/10\n\nFor Casual Players: Stay away. I'm not dissing casual players, I myself love a casual pick up, drop in, drop out game on occassion. I actually bought this game on a more casual basis. This game requires you to invest a bit in order to play. You need to know what you are doing and if you don't have time to learn you are not going to have a good time.\nCasual Player Rating 1/10\n\nOverall this is a game for PVP fanatics and Hardcore FPS enthusiasts. It has some melee elements that harken to combat from the Elder Scrolls games. Don't take that to mean melee combat is the exact same or you will be disappointed. Each character has a unique playstyle that requires a bit of testing to figure out fully. PVE lacks a bit, but is fun at it's very core. This game is not for those who wish for PVE, however the campaign is definitely worth a playthrough. It's mandatory to unlock certain characters if you don't wanna go through a lengthy grind to get them.\nOverall Ratings 8/10 Good game, very specialized in it's audience, has some balance issues that I'm sure will be fixed in the future.\n\nTl;dr If you are hardcore into PVP, you'll like it. If you are not you'll probably be dissappointed. Also no one in this game has slept with your mother....

I still think it is worth the 60 dollar price tag for multiplayer alone.","May 4","true","147.1"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","27","43","0","0"

I have to say do not buy this til Gear Box does a few things.\n\n- Addons and Aimbots are in the game already they where in the Beta and Alpha. You can look up videos and they was there and they was reported then and no one did anything about it.\n\n- There appears to be no way to report individuals that you suspect are using hacks and cheats, as well as there appears to be no client or server side protections being ran.\n\n- With the release of the new Water character. She was released super powerful and a good player can pretty much solo a whole team. This some would say is normal, and I agree to some extent but other games of this type also put a pay wall on new heros so they can make some money and I dont blame them for that.\n\n- People that bought into the original game as founders and so on, are already getting the shaft with sales and how they are handleing new guys coming into the game.\n\n- Matchmaking is horrid, there seems to be no ryme or reason for how its done. One match you will be with a group of guys that are suited to your play level, the next fight you are with new guys vs guys that are your play level with no hope to win.\n\n- The incursion map is broken, they have made some fixes already but a good sniper or a good charge up type of champion can dodge in and out shooting the shields and eventually the objective himself. Even though the opening game type states that the shields need to be taken down by pushing your wave into them. Most everyone that has a sense of pride will yell at their own team. Most guys will take the easy win tho for the cheese.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a good laugh the game is worth picking up. Sadly because of the lack of advertising, as well as the horrid release around the same time as Overwatch. This game to me, and some other people in the gaming community I run at this time. This game is unplayable.","May 29","false","191.8"," 61 of 107 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","61","107","0","2"

All the detail and vigour of when you fight minions is just gone when you face heroes - times to kill are overly long for most heroes, your skills have low impact (and build up *very* gradually), hit flinches and other secondary animations seem to be missing (replaced with status icons or colouration), there is little verticality and so on. I just can't see or feel the impact of the attacks and movement and I feel constricted in what I do. The gameplay feels balanced but curiously flat, considering the hero variety (and the massive amount of FX constantly flying across your screen). If you like the PvP/PvE-mix game modes and slower-paced shooter combat, this may be for you.\n\nPvP may also suit groups better, as there is potentially a lot of combo building to be done.\n\nI would also gripe about the obstructed HUD, in addition to the "VFX storm": the elements are overly large and cover up the action. Not a problem if you are facing an AI minion death march at your own pace, or if the boss is running after another party member, but literally a BIG problem if you're in the middle of PvP. Everything from the viewmodels to skill level-ups is flashy and an opaque obstacle while someone is trying to murder you - not good!\n\nThe game also doesn't perform well for me on a GTX 960, i5-3570K, 8 GB RAM and an MX100 256 GB SSD. Steam's overlay reports FPS over 70 or 80, but there is a dragging feel to mouse control - no mouse smoothing or acceleration, no AA, no Vsync to explain it. New drivers with a clean install didn't help, so I hope this is something the devs can patch out. They can and should certainly improve the menu animations and transition speeds.\n\nRight now the game is a 7/10 for me, no regrets about the money spent. It has been fun and will stay so, but all the action and entertainment has so far been in the co-op.\n\nFor PvP, I would rather play Overwatch - it is a lot more engaging, highly visceral and arguably provides a greater variety of viable combat styles with a slightly smaller hero roster. The maps are also a lot better, resembling good Unreal Tournament maps condensed for faster gameplay and team compositions. It also runs incredibly smoothly, all the way down from menus to gameplay.","May 7","true","39.1"," 47 of 81 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","47","81","0","1"

Can't really tell you one over the other but I will say battleborn feels more like an fps moba Of League, whereas over watch feels like team fortress 2 mixed with inspiration from the battlefront card system. Battleborn is great, fairly bug free for me (specs on profile). Like most others I bought it at $60 2 1/2 weeks ago so the $36 price is a little rough but I understand that have to compete with over watch (which since it had an open beta got massive amounts of pre release popularity)\n\nMy verdict is a 9/10 for both, research and figure out which is better for you but again battleborn is a great FPS adaptation to a moba formula while making it unique compared to others with a loot system which rewards you outside of combat and leveling that allows for customization of champions With unlockable mutations. The items you receive in matches can be equipped and brought into a match, where you buy it with currency you obtain while battling. Very different from overwatch, anyone that says they're identical or one rips another, I strongly disagree.","May 26","true","20.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I didn't model my review after this video, but I found it after the fact and he touches on many of the same things. If you'd rather listen than read, maybe your eyes are too tired to give my review a read, then just check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAMGrDUSGJU\n\nAt first I didn't believe what people said about this game being nothing like Overwatch, but it really isn't all that much like Overwatch aside from the vague "hero shooter" category, which doesn't tell you a whole lot about the game. Yes, you pick 1 of 20-odd heroes with a few abilities, and play different game types, but that's about where the similarities end. Overwatch is more or less a team deathmatch twitch shooter, whichever game type you play really. It's a great game and I intend to get it, but I see myself playing Battleborn more because it feels like it has more depth.\n\nBattleborn is a MOBA, so things like chasing kills across the map is generally not viable. You can also do more than just kill, kill assist, or heal your team, you can also farm creeps, collect currency to buy turrets or activate your gear, or gank people trying to do those things. You also gain experience and level up, choosing different skill mutations which are quite interesting and genuinely changes the way heroes are played. Your gear loadouts can do this too, once activated in a match. You can change your playstyle on the fly and respond to your opponents compositions and builds, which can't be done in Overwatch aside from respawning as a totally different character. I'm sure you can already see how these two seemingly similar games give an entirely different feel in-game.\n\nThere's more to this game than shooting each other, you can really serve different functions for your team, such as pusher, support, assassin, tank, healer, etc. Matches are about 3x longer than in Overwatch, we're talking about 30mins vs 10mins for your average match. Engagements also last a bit longer, which for me is to my preference. It plays great, I guarantee that you'll find heroes who excite you.\n\nThe game has 3 multiplayer game modes at launch, with more and more maps to come. It also has a "story mode," but it's not a campaign, it's actually co-op, which is great fun, but don't expect it to be a campaign. I quite like the co-op, and I'm sure that others will too. There are 3 right now and more missions in development.\n\nThere is a better feeling of progression and choice in terms of gear loadouts and skill builds, with a 3rd branch of skills unlocking one at a time as you progress with a character, and loot packs rewarded and bought (for in-game currency that cannot be purchased with microtransactions / real money).\n\nThe art style of the game is also quite distinct. Personally I find both styles quite appealing in their own way, and though typically I don't like more cartoonish art styles and prefer "cleaner, more mature" styles, I quite like Battleborn's style. It's not childish or immature, it's done very well and they utilize it ingenuously at times. Just like with Overwatch, there are a ton of skins and cosmetics to unlock as you play. There are even different taunts to unlock that offer customization and individuality to your game.\n\nThe heroes are quite interesting, boasting far more melee options than Overwatch, with several hybrids which are tons of fun to play. The heroes all have great personalities and feel good to play. They not only have different weapons and skills, they have different passive abilities, different health and shield numbers, different movement speeds (some movement-heavy heroes even have strafing), different sizes and hitboxes, etc. This gives a lot of balancing options for Gearbox that feel good.\n\nSpecific questions of balance can't be held against the game at launch like this, it's a bit ridiculous. I care about balance a great deal but I understand that it takes time, and trial and error. Gearbox takes it seriously too, they've made balance changes already and have big plans to support this game into the future. A lot of the issues people are complaining about in these reviews have already been fixed.\n\nPeople have been complaining a lot about optimization and connectivity issues. I had problems with graphical hiccups until I went and updated my driver and restarted my rig, after which it worked perfectly and ran smooth as butter. I've also never had a problem finding a match, usually within seconds and certainly within a couple minutes. Gearbox also takes dropping games seriously and is looking into reasonable ways of disincentivizing this sort of behavior. I believe they have already implemented a tentative solution.\n\nThis game isn't going to be for everyone, but even if you don't like MOBAs, I suggest you give this a shot if you like what you've read in my review. I like MOBAs in principle but all of that clicking just isn't for me. This isn't that kind of game, but it is still quite intense. Like I said, I will get both hero shooters, but I see myself favoring this one for the reasons stated above. I prefer the RPG elements of Battleborn, it's more of a MOBA than a team shooter and I prefer its format and gameplay. Give it a chance if this appeals to you.","May 7","true","6.3"," 69 of 124 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","69","124","2","4"

(PC(STEAM)/XBONE/PS4)\nCreated by Gearbox Software, the ones who brought you Half-Life expansions ( e.g. Opposing Force, Blue Shift,... ), Borderlands series and Duke Nukem series.\n\nBattleborn is a game, a mix between "moba" gameplay and a bit of Borderlands. This game is an exciting FPS, whereas like a moba game, has 25 playable "heroes" to choose from. Characters ranging from melee to long-range weaponary. (with different skills/traits) Ofcourse most of these "heroes" are locked and you can unlock them by doing challenges or by rank/level. You can level up your player rank, but also your "heroes" can be leveled.\n\nMy first impressions are that this game is not a MOBA at all. It's just "based" on. Meaning, if you are not so into moba's (like me), you can still enjoy this game to the fullest. With a humour in style of Borderlands, this game is pretty fun. There are enough characters to explore and after checking them all, i'm sure you'll find the character you want to play with.\n\nThis game has a story-mode game. Although in my opinion, the story isn't really interesting. It does give some sort of clue, in what kind of universe you are playing in. The cinematics are a mix of animated american manga/cartoons.\n\nThe game has a very fast matchmaking, so if you do not want to play alone, you can easily join up with up to 4 other players. Storymode can be played in co-op with friends or other random players. There are 3 other PVP modes: Meltdown (arena mode), Incursion (destroy enemy base) and Devastion (capture the flag).\n\nAlso a part of the game are lootboxes. You can find them after defeating bosses in storymode, leveling up and ofcourse by buying them. These lootboxes includes Items that enrich your character's skills. You can only choose 3 active "powers" that you can activate while playing. These are not character-bound.\n\nThis game offers a decent gameplay, loads to explore and a lot of choice in playable characters. Music & voices are great. Although I missed a good story here, the gameplay is as great as playing Borderlands (loads of shooting). And the good/fast matchmaking is really something.\n\nI give this game a 8/10","May 5","true","12.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","6"

I heard it was from Gear Box which peaked my interest, but it looked like just another MOBA.\nDuring open beta I got bored and decided to give it a try. It's amazing! I use to love Monday Night Combat and I still love Borderlands, so what I got was a perfect combination of the two.\n\nThe story mode is very good. It's Borderlands-funny, has a decent story, has multiple difficulty levels, and gives you loot (which you can use to mod your hero).\n\nIt's a first person shooter with hero abilities. There's (currently) 3 game modes.\n\nIncursion is like a single laned MOBA. There are jungles (mercenaries) that you can win over to fight on your side and you can build/upgrade towers. You push through two strong sentry tanks to win.\n\nMeltdown is a weird "Minion escort" mode where you have to protect your minions all the way up to the sacrifice point. You get points for each minion that is sacrificed and the first team to meet the goal wins.\n\nCapture point is your basic 3 point capture mode where holding a point gives your team points.\n\nThere's no pay to win. You can't pay for anything besides when it comes out.\n\nSome people may not like that the game has a high TTK. Sniper is 3-4 headshots on a squishy to kill. It's more about doing the objectives than killing players.\n\nNegatives: Ranked mode isn't implemented yet (It's coming). New players may find the effects too blinding. Lots of colors everywhere! You have to unlock 18 of the 25 heroes (which I like, but many don't).","May 5","true","109.2"," 45 of 80 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","45","80","0","0"

First off, I love this game. I think that it's a good blend of the first person shooter style and a MOBA. The heroes are all unique, interesting, and effective. The quality of the environments, the casting, and the gameplay are top notch. However, the game has flaws that need to be addressed.\n\nFirst of all, the lack of maps is an issue. There are I believe 6 maps in the game currently. 2 for each game mode. That's not very good. Although these maps are all good and allow a variety of playstyles in each, the lack of content is an issue. Whether or not Gearbox desides to make more maps for free or include them in map packs is up to them. But I feel as though they should be making more maps due to the lack of variety.\n\nSecondly, the story is short. The game only has 8 missions. Now, they do have some replayablilty due the fact that some heroes require good rankings on missions to be unlocked and you can get gear to use in and out of multiplayer in these missions. Although these missions last ~30 minutes, there are simply too few of them. You also cannot choose which mission you want to play unless you go solo or with a private group, which is just a puzzling system.\n\nSo what your getting is a great experience that lacks in some important areas. If you are even somewhat interested in the game, buy it, you won't be dissapointed. However, if you find yourself on the fence, reading these reviews to make a decision, wait a bit, watch some videos online of gameplay. This game will only satisfy you if you are looking for a new multiplayer game to play, with some occasional distractions in the story mode.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: this game is a blast with friends","May 6","true","99.5"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

That being said, it's probably one of the most entertaining multiplayer games I've ever played. There's a lot of rock paper scissors style matchups among the characters and different strategies you can utilize as far as loadouts for each character go. The single player missions are a nice way to kill time but honestly not what I bought the game for. I got the Digital Deluxe version with no hesitation because I knew I would get my money's worth in SPITE of already having played the game for 80 hours already, which surprised me to be honest. This is a really fun but also really deep game.\n\nThere are three multiplayer modes (all objective based) with no "straight up" PvP. At first I groaned a little bit because it would have been nice but having played the game further I found out I really don't notice it's omission because what the game does provide is pretty damn entertaining. The characters all play really uniquely and you could play one character for weeks (go Team Phoebe!) without getting bored or switch it up and play a traditional FPS oriented character like Oscar Mike. There's a some overlap between characters in terms of their roles on each team (healer, melee, burst damage, support, crowd control, etc.) but the skills and intricacies of each character make each of them stand out in some way. The multiplayer is balanced pretty decently with a few exceptions that are definitely being watched and tuned as during each of the tests I played in Gearbox was very responsive in monitoring the data they received based on matches played, which teams had which characters, etc. and if any characters have been too high powered, they adjusted really quickly to bring things back in line so I have a lot of confidence moving forward that this is something they will address on an ongoing basis.\n\nSo in spite of the fact that initially what I was really hoping for was something more in the vein of Borderlands, I'm really happy with how this game ended up, and I can see myself playing it for a while. 9/10","May 3","true","557.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

It is in its own right an enjoyable game to play I enjoy the fact that noone has screamed at me so far at the top of thier lungs like other Mobas.  It is also in no way or form like Overwatch except that it is a shooter and Sci Fi. Although the price of the game might deter some player due to the fact that it is 60 and there are games of this genre out there free. Wait for a price drop if you must. Might not be your type of game so look into it before you commit.\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2swyQZkF6M\n\nPros+ Includes a campaign that can be played with others.\n+ The character roosters are all interesting and different, 25 in all.\n+ Strategic gear loadouts add depth to the system and leveling up to 10 called Helix which unlocks as you battle in game and unlocks the more you play adding more to the characters playstyle.\n+ Plenty of lore, items, gears, taunts and skins to unlock.\n+ The graphics, introductions, sounds, radio chatter, particles are fun and has influence and similarities  from Borderlands.\n+ Community has been great so far haven't been screamed at for trying to work together.\n+ Includes voice chat communication that not many use for some odd reason\n+ Three game modes that are great to play to switch up gameplay. Capture, Incursion and Meltdown\n+ More Future Plans for games new character modes etc that are free.\n\n\nCons- The matchmaking system needs a bit more work.\n- Performance with AMD and some other machines out there aren't done so well\n- The single player can be a bit underwhelming as it just requires you to go from point A to point B and defend, rinse repeat then boss fight. Although they are done really well.\n-  pvp reward is lacking compared to campaign.\n- Locked characters that needs to be unlocked even though you bought the game, though not difficult it is still ANNOYING.\n- People surrendering too fast sometimes is discouraging.\n- Need to be connected at all to do any gameplay at all any interruption and your game will close down.","May 10","true","17.7"," 62 of 113 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","62","113","3","0"

I've been playing heavily post launch as well.  Overall, I really enjoy Battleborn.  It provides a unique experience that blends several of my favorite genres.  You have FPS, MOBA, Tower Defence elements.  25 characters.  There's three 5v5 PvP modes, 2 maps per mode.  8 Story missions you can play solo or with up to 4 friends (5 player co-op!).  They have tons of free post release content planned (characters, PvP content) as well as some paid story mission DLC.  They've avoided the whole microtransaction deal.  So from a content / value perspective I feel that the price is reasonable.\n\nHow does it play?  Well, that depends on the mode.  The story missions play out like a highly arcadified Borderlands, but with a faster pacing and a focus on abilities.  Story missions are typically revolve around escort and defend, with a few playing like a Raid as you'd expect to see in an MMO.  Some are more fun than others, but all of them are enjoyable.  More so if you bring friends along.  The PvP modes are all rather different.  PvP is where this game shines.  Incursion is like a one lane MOBA and full of 5v5 team battles.  Meltdown has heavier tower defense elements, filled with tons of smaller skirmishes.  Capture is your standard deathmatch + hold certain points mode.  There's a lot of variety in both the modes and the characters, I can't help but feel that there's something there for everyone.\n\nThey took a lot of risks making this and I feel that it paid off.  There's been some hiccups, but the devs (Gearbox) have been attentive and are working to address the more pressing concerns as quick as they can.\n\nI'd recommend Battleborn.  It's very different and a breath of fresh air.  The pricing model is fair and there's a wealth of content there currently.  There's tons of unlocks, abilities and customizable gear loadouts to keep min/maxers and theorycrafters busy for ages.  It has great depth and strategy.  Plus, it has that awesome humor you'd expect from Gearbox.  I see myself playing for quite a while and am excited to see the competitive scene starting to grow as well.  If you're looking for a fun, unique game to play with friends, I think Battleborn is a good call.","May 22","true","85.3"," 60 of 110 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","60","110","2","2"

The game itself is very diverse, sporting Gearbox's classic taste in humor through a whole PvE campaign they've made replayable through loot incentives that affect the PvP in a (mostly) healthy way, and bringing the most original PvP gameplay of any other "Hero Shooter" to release this year.\n\nOne huge highlight about the PvP is the unique skill cap. Unlike the masterful ability required in competitive CSGO, or the extremely large knowledge pool that is LoL or Dota 2, Battleborn rewards communication and teamwork in ways I've never felt before. Teamplay being so inherently important has its ups and downs though: queuing up solo can be very frustrating, and I very adamantly try to avoid it.\nThe matchmaking, along with some optimization issues gamewide, need some tune ups, which I fully believe Gearbox will continue to work on. DLC is advertised as free, including new characters and maps, but the first DLC character has a huge in game currency cost for those who didn't purchase the season pass (which is only $20), leaving somewhat of a bad marketing taste (other ways to unlock her not confirmed, I'll be editing this).\n\nOverall, Battleborn is something I'll be playing for a lon time, so long as there is a community.

The general style of the game is so intriguing, and the personalities of the characters are quite the step up from the cardboard I've seen in overwatch. If you're like me and can generally stay entertained by interesting visuals, witty dialogue, and a boatload of achievements that unlock CHARACTER LORE, get Battleborn.\n\nI'd ESPECIALLY reccomend it if they end up adding more content later on. I know they've got 5 more characters planned for a DLC, but some more maps would be swanky (then again so far all I play is overgrowth).\n\nALSO especially if it goes on sale.

It's a fun, team-coordinated multiplayer (and co-op) experience, with an aesthetically pleasing design and varied roster of characters to choose from. One could complain that it has a lack of map diversity, but that's to be /expected/ from this genre--most of its critics stemming from people that don't understand what a MOBA is anyhow. While there may be a lack in content, Gearbox Software has big plans to expand its size for those who want something more.\n\nThis is not an Overwatch killer, nor was it ever supposed to be a competetor. It's something that it lives in harmonious balance with, and Battleborn is and always will be something different; a hybrid-like blend of two very loved types of games currently out on the market. I had a blast with this game, and I will continue to have a blast with it because it's a damn good time.\n\nIf you're going to riff on Battleborn, you need to understand that you simply do not like it and that others very much so do. There's nothing wrong with wanting some dumb, action-filled fun in your life, and Battleborn fulfills that want quite well.\n\nGive it a chance.\n9/10","May 7","true","107.6"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","24","42","0","0"

Now for the review!\n\nI have played both and I personally prefer Battleborn. I love the quirky characters and the way they interact with one another. The characters are easy to fall in love with as far as personality and gameplay and offer much in the way of lore, comedy and story.\n\nGameplay is much liek a FPS MOBA, minus the intense stress of FPSs like CS:GO, and the boring, grueling nature of DOTA. This game somewhat resembles Smite, with a heaping dash of it's own uniqueness that you can only tuly experience with purchase.\n\nAs I said, the characters are easy to fall in love with. Each has their own quirky nature and humor and interactions with other characters and enviromental creatures and characters via PVE or PVP. The lore is fun to achieve, even though it can be tasking and difficult at times to accomplish, but you get to learn about each character, sometimes weapons and you get have a sound dialogue unlocked for each which can either be humorous or, developmental in-depth character insights. The lore also often fills in those gaps in the story that are understandable due to the way the story modes are played.\n\nStory mode and the story in general, while fun, lacks adequate substance. But as I said, the lore provides some much needed cement for gap filling. The story chapters as they stand, are meant ot be played at random and only partially in order, which makes it easy to just ready up with randoms, and not really misso ut on any of the story.\n\nListen, watch the video if you're in debate about Overwatch VS Battleborn. It will help you to purchase one, or the other or both. I plan on both eventually but for now, Battleborn is my first love and has been since Pax Prime. I've been a loyal fan since and have ventured through their closed technicals and betas. I highly reccomend this game! It's deffinately worth it! But it's my opinion...

It's not Gearbox's fault for lowering the price to "compete" with Overwatch or whatever reason they decided to have a sale 2 weeks after release.\n\nOn another note, this game is pretty fantastic. If you're a fan of Borderlands, this is basically that in a multiplayer arena setting. The story is a bit cheesy I will admit and a bit long to complete, but the voice acting and humor is nothing less than what you would expect from a Gearbox game. That being said, some of the bosses in the story mission are really repetitive, tedious, and just plain annoying to fight. SPOILER ALERT: It gets boring having Isic rotate his impossible to hit legs, then hitting his core 4 to lower his life, and having to do that 4 times. It's very unfortunate that you have to stick with the same character you chose at the beginning, because if you choose a support like the new character Alani, you're screwed in the story as you do barely to no damage.\n\nOnline is very intricate. The augments and display of abilities are more complex than that of Overwatch and can be intimidating for someone looking for a basic "Hero FPS" genre game. I am a fan of both Battleborn and Overwatch. If you like a more detailed MOBA-esque RPG Borderlands multiplayer type shooter, then Battleborn is for you. If you like Hero FPS, class based shooter with a simpler easy to grasp concept, then Overwatch is for you. Either way I play both and both are very good.","May 29","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So many characters to choose from and so many different tactics to take when tackling a boss that its a little overwhelming.  That's not a bad thing though since I really like to sink a lot of hours in a game when I like it.\n\nI feel there is a lot of gamers out there that might be hesitant to buy  a AAA game for $60 so if you are not sure about spending so much then wait for a sale.  To those that are not afraid to spend the dosh on a AAA game this is honestly a very fun experience.  The dialogue is great, the action is chaotic, and the coop is fun but not tedious.  I am only a few hours in but I can already see myself enjoying this game with friends for a while.  How long I enjoy it depends on the games life cycle.  I sank 100 hours in on The Division and the updates literally killed my interest in that game so I ask myself this:  Do I like what I see right now?  Yes.  Will there be more expansions to keep me interested?  Yes.  What kind of end game does this game have? ???  The end game is usually the problem with games of this caliber where they are great but the end game sucks (See Divison).\n\nI am not sure how the end game will play out but for now I will continue to enjoy and explore everything this game has to offer.  I hope that this is the type of game that is prepared for folks like me that conquer games in a week or so because I really enjoy what I have seen so far.\n\nGraphics- 8.5\nBorderlands style of Art but with a little more animation and crispness\n\nControls- 9.5\nEasy to pick up and play, but hard to master all characters.

Looking at you, CoD... Just kidding, I still love you. ANYWAYS.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, this game is worth every penny, because the amount of content and replayability to this game is ASTONISHING. I haven't played a game this complete since I was a kid, flicking on my N64 and wrecking house. This is a game pushing paid DLC into the minor, making paid DLC a complementory aspect of the game. But, they're also expanding onto the game with free DLC! It's a mixture of the past and the present, and the best parts of the gaming community as a whole, and people still continue to talk ♥♥♥♥ on this beautiful work of art!\n\nPlay this game. These developers deserve a round of applause for the game they've created. Maybe if we all take in techniques like this, and support these kinds of games, we can get full complete games back. The only way they'll know that we want things back to the way they were, before DLC simulators... Is to support the games that are fully complete.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one that misses the time when you didn't have to buy the DLC out of a game in order to get the full 60 dollar experience. Maybe I am, we'll find out if Battleborn is still standing months after its release.","May 3","true","43.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

I first went in warily in the closed technical test and honestly my first impressions were not great. I returned to the game in its open beta and man did it just hit all the right buttons. I just played and played and played. At its core battleborn is closest to either Monday Night Combat or Smite. It is not as Moba as smite nor as shooter as MNC but some nice balance in the middle. The characters are diverse and the game modes are fun. Though I havent had a chance to play the capture point mode at this time. The story mode has some legs with its variable banter between characters and the NPCs of the missions changing depending on who is involved. Their are also challenges and different difficulty settings that make them replayable. I see at least 15-20 hours in the campaign before new stories get added with DLC. On the subject of DLC and what WILL be DLC from what I gathered it is the followoing. We will be getting 5 more characters added to the game for free some time after launch. The season pass adds instant access to those characters while those without will have to unlock them their normal way (either from reaching certain rank checkpoints, playing against certain characters in PvP/PvE, or just winning so many games, usually their is 2 ways to unlock each character). The upcoming paid DLC seems to be more story missions.\n\nSome negatives since their are a couple. I think optimizations needs to be worked on a bit. Their is some delay that I think I fixed by messing around with the settings. The game is quite challenging in multiplayer and it is easy to feel like you arent doing much untill you come to understand exactly what is going on.","May 3","true","10.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Plus, even the "epic" loot only has a small increase in overall stats compared to the most common gear.\n\nThe multiplayer seems like it could be fun, but because it is separated into 3 different match types for the queue and you need 10 players, getting in can be a chore. Plus, I am definitely not a skilled player compared to others (and/or I haven't found the right character yet, so even though I do better than most on my team, I have not yet had a single victory. The guns all seem to be quite flighting and it can be really hard to line up shots. I'm even more useless from melee range and almost every character has skill-shots for it's special attacks which can be difficult to line up. As a result, I think I'm going to be playing PvE for a long time, but maybe I'll find a character that "just works" eventually. I'd like to see all the Battleborn get damage boosts as most mobs need multiple full mags unloaded on them - sometimes even when you are scoring crits and that frustrates me. Also, considering we have a ton of characters to level up, the leveling up process seems to take forever. Matches or PvE stories are long, so I'd like to see a full level for the early levels and maybe half a level as I get higher in a character's tree from each one.\n\nBut despite these faults, I find myself still having fun while the story lasts.","May 4","true","9.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

OW doesn't have helix upgrade each level, but they can swap to different characters on the fly when they die to counter a specific match up, and they do not have PVE. I can go on and rant a huge list but nah, I'll just leave the main point here :)\n\nWhile Battleborn can be played solo/single player (Including a complimentary Prologue, Chapter 1-8), I strongly suggest to go co-op for PVE too. It's fun to play PVE with other players!\n\nThere is alot more to be done too, such as completing the lore challenges for each unique character is quite challenging too! Well I guess if it's too easy then there's no point in it right? xD\n\nOn the other side, the PVP features 3 modes with 2 maps each:\n\nCapture mode (OUTBACK, TEMPLE): This is just like King of the hill, there are 3 points and objectives to be captured, then defend it from the enemy who will try to claim it back. The team reaches 1000 point wins! It's quite strategic and fast paced too due to switching from offense to defense, and from defense to offense.\n\nIncursion mode (ECHELON, OVERGROWTH <-- most voted map): Have you ever played DotA2 or League of Legends or even Heroes of the Storm? If you played any one of them, Incursion's gameplay is exactly the same in the form of FPS. 5v5, guide your minions to enemy territoy and destroy enemy's sentries to win! To me, Incursion is the most fun game because I play alot of League of Legends.\n\nMeltdown mode (PARADISE, COLDSNAP): In this mode you need to sacrifice your minions to win ): I'm serious! Guide your minions to the minions grinder, to get points. The bigger the minion, the more points you gain. But it ain't gonna be that easy, enemies will try to destroy your minions before it reachers the grinder, so you need to do the same too! First to reach 500 wins. Legitimate a WINnion mode xD\n\nWhile Gearbox can still give a little bit tweak here and there especially with match-making, other than that this game is pretty fun and worth it. I'd say it improved alot more from the closed and open beta phase.\n\nI'll rate it 7.5/10\n\nPeace out guys and have a #badass day!","June 4","true","82.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Tried the beta and got hooked. I wasted a whole weekend on just the beta.\n\nThis game is the perfect blend of Shooters and Mobas. The characters feel fun and creative, the maps are colorful and the whole style just makes me think of Saturday Morning Cartoons. Though there may be some more balancing needed (which will always be needed for these kinds of games) it's not as bad as other games that's been out for years.\n\nThe game also brings PvE which has a feel to dungeons in MMOs. You select the chapter, fight mobs, fight boss, fight mobs, fight boss, then fight final boss. It's a good way to get gear to take back to PvP.\n\nThe game isn't without issues, I feel that sometimes the screen can feel a little cluttered and it does take a little bit to get use to it, but after that 5th match you no longer care, it's just chaotic fun. Hell I've had so much fun playing Benedict that I didn't even care that my team was losing.\n\nBattleborn is probably the most unique game to come out this year so far and with it's fun cartoony style and it's Borderland's humor, it's a good pick.\n\n\nEdit: Please nerf that Zelda Warrior","May 3","true","86.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Must have for those who like first-person shooters.\n\nThe gameplay is standard first-person shooter, but you also have 3 abilities that you can cast.  Every character has their own skillset.  Every character also has their own unique "skill tree", as you level up you get points to upgrade your character; these are not persistent and will reset every match.\n\nEach player can equip 3 different items.  These items contain various stats that you can bring into each match to help boost your power.  Items come in selected rarities, all the way up to legendary, and the stats are random in the amounts they give, so not one is the same.\n\nThe bread and butter of this game is the diverse amount of characters that you can unlock and play as, each and every one of them are unique; not one plays the same.  Second thing is the amount of customization you can have, various skins, taunts, and titles that you can equip.\n\n\nOne gripe I have with this game, there is no offline (no internet) play, always have to be connected to the internet.  Which is ok with me, i'm "meh" about it although I would prefer having the option to play offline.\n\n\nFrom a hours to price ratio, you will get your money's worth and more.

I know time spent isn't very long but I played the beta loads.\nTo start off, It's interesting abilites and different characters gives a nice spice up to games to the point where I haven't seen one character picked more frequnetly. They are all unique and easily distigiushable among each other creating a scenario where all characters fill a well made niche of play style. This isn't really a MOBA though it shares similar attributes like minions and the.. I suppose you could call them Minion camps that you can kill to gain an advantage but by no means is it a MOBA in the traditional sense. That said. It's also [/b] nothing like Overwatch  because it actually has depth and fun gameplay. Overwatch  has no upgrading, leveling, all the characters play about the same, no customization, no building of characters and no progression whereas Battleborn has every single element I just listed along with an engaging party campaign. I don't care how much money Blizzard has injected Overwatch with, it doesn't mean they can dominate the market with a game that, lets face it, barely innovates on a tired formula. If you had to pick one, I would go with Battleborn on an account of it having actual depth and replayability other than Overwatch's "I hope it's a different guy playing Reaper this time!".

Another downside is that you cannot choose the missions you want to play but have to vote with the other players in the group (instead of choosing the mission and then putting people in a group together, the people are put together in a group and then vote for the mission)\n\nI don't know much about MOBAs or Hero Shooters but the Multiplayer also is a lot of fun. Mainly because of the diverse character roster which IMO is also the strongest point of this game. There is just a character for every type of player and I am having a blast to try them all out :D\n\nOn the technical side, I am having no problems running this at all (it used to crash every "first" switch from windowed mode>full screen but that no longer happens..I think?) but of course that is only my experience\n\nPS: It seems like they now support ultrawide screens (since the screen is no longer cut at the top and bottom to fit the entire display like in the beta) except in the main menu and cut scenes, there you have black bars on the left and right.","May 5","true","92.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theofficialconstraint/recommended/394230/","theofficialconstraint","「✩」 constraint™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theofficialconstraint/","431 products in account","This is not going to be a review praising Battleborn for doing something it hasn't. I'm not going to suck Gearbox's ♥♥♥♥ because they did such a great job at Borderlands 1 and 2 and give them a free pass on Battleborn. There were expectations to be met, a certain level of polish and depth to this game that seemed like it was promised but never truly delivered.\n\nIf you want to get a TL;DR, here's my YouTube version containing a very condensed version of why I gave it the rating I did.\n\nVideo Link\n\nLet's start off with the marketing. Nonexistent from what I've seen. While I'm being bombarded by Overwatch ads on YouTube, on billboards, on the buses and subways of New York, Gearbox has decided that their Borderlands fanbase alone would be enough to keep players chugging along with the so-called "story" missions to grind up to get items that are supposed to help you in PvP. Take it from a Borderlands veteran, I myself am extremely sick and tired of the grind, but I'll explain that in a later section. So, while Overwatch has been garnering old and new players alike to their roster of fans, Battleborn has gained only a portion of their Borderlands playerbase. And even then, that playerbase has declined so much since release, it's as sad as it is unsurprising. Gearbox could have gained a lot more attention to the game if they even bothered to explain what the PvP game modes are like. Did anyone even know PvP was going to have a MOBA mode before the open beta? No? Well the few thousand people that saw the obscure YouTube video they made about it did.\n\nNow the bread and butter, glitches and bugs since release. What the hell Gearbox? It was nice of you to offer an open beta to everyone.. FOR TWO DAYS.. and then release the game as broken as it was. It clearly had more of a marketing incentive than a bug-fixing one. If you played the game on release, you'd be hit with horrible hitboxes that wouldn't allow you to move and get killed, enemies getting stuck in one place and having to wait 2 to 3 minutes for the game to realize it and continue to the next wave, friendly body collisions making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces, especially if you have a bigger character like ISIC or Ghalt. Simple things like this quite literally made the game unplayable. If it happened once or twice in maybe 20 to 30 hours of gameplay, it'd be acceptable. This happened at LEAST once a match. Keep in mind this was my experience. Kudos to you if you were able to avoid all these problems. But I know I'm not the only one who has faced them.\n\nPvP is also a mess. OP ♥♥♥ characters like ISIC, Galilea, Deande and Phoebe absolutely bodying other characters and being able to push objects much faster than others. And don't even bother stating otherwise. Gearbox has acknowledged these problems and have been putting out fixes weekly. You know what would have fixed these problems better before release? MAYBE A PROLONGED BETA... That isn't even the worst of it. Sniper classes like Marquis and Thorn were able to gain position on their spawn point where they were able to see the enemy sentry and snipe them out within the first couple of minutes of the match. You let some game breaking crap like that get past you? You know what would have fixed it? PROLONGED. BETA. Realize that Overwatch has had a crazy long closed beta and then an open beta where they took every single concern, bug, glitch and OP character and fixed them along the way. Also realize that their beta contained THE ENTIRE GAME. Gearbox only opened up 2 story missions and I believe 1 or 2 PvP modes for play. You can imagine the beta versions of the story missions played near flawlessly. The other 6? Bug ridden mess. Story missions like Saboteur and The Experiment were quite literally impossible even with a formed group on advanced mode. Know why? Gearbox didn't normalize the HP stat values of the defend points even when the enemies were dishing out insane amounts of damage. 4-6 hits and the point was down, wasting about 20 minutes of my time as well as the teams.\n\nBut, Gearbox promised FREE, NEW characters to EVERYONE that play Battleborn, with or without the Season Pass (why are Season Passes still a thing...). So, I thought I'd hang around to see what kinds of characters they'd release. What garbage. They release Alani, which is some broken ♥♥♥ character to play in PvP. AOE that slows? Healing abilities? Insane DPS? Who the hell needs any other character? Set up a tank next to her and you can 2-man ANY PvP game and body the enemy team. Of course, these were level 100 Alanis because again, no one plays this game anymore other than veterans. But, it's cool. It's a new character and they needed to give the players an incentive to get excited so they created this broken mess. But they put her behind a time-wall of a week. Only those with the Season Pass or the definitive edition were able to play her. Again, have to make it seem like a worthwhile deal to the idiots that buy into garbage Season Passes like these. Again, whatever. I'll wait a week. But then I started seeing rumors flying around saying it'd cost 47,500 in game credits to unlock her. No real challenges to do like Ghalt where you have to beat every story mission on Advanced difficulty (insanely hard before the buff on the defend points), simply save up credits to get her. In an average 30-40 minute PvE mission, you'd be lucky to get past 1,000 credits. That's about 45 games (rounding down for Gearbox's benefit). That's 22.5 hours. For one character unlock. Seriously? You couldn't have told us this before hand so those that give a crap about your game could save up? Oh wait, you did this so idiots would buy into your Season Pass. You did it Gearbox. You became Activision, EA and Ubisoft overnight. Well done.\n\nBuy this game if you don't give a crap about money and if you want to fund bad practices. I wouldn't even bother buying it if it was for 5 dollars because the amount of "fun" you'll have playing it isn't worth it.","June 4","false","84.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Since in the queue you can find high level players, with their chars already maxed out with all the mutations and they can just demolish you and your team with a press of a button.\nYes, every 4 levels or so, you get a mutation, which is a different type of a certain skill you can use in combat with different bonuses, and if used right can be deadly.\n\nMy overall vote ? Looks way too high for some of you, but since it's my first MOBA i'll give it a solid 10, enjoyable, with 25 chars at the moment, lots of different types of combination for the teams, and just overall fun to play.\n\nI recommend it, of course, but until some of its flaws will get fixed, the players will have alot of complaints.\n\n\nWe're still waitin on Borderlands 3 Gearbox.

Lots of running gags, as well as quick witty one-liners that will either hit you straight away, or have you laughing 20 seconds after you heard 'em. The writing would be one of my favourite things about this game, if the gameplay and voice work/characterisation wasn't so damn good too.\n\nSeriously, the amount of effort put into the characters is crazy. They have SO many lines for so many situations, often calling other Battleborn by name, either friend or foe. I don't think I've run into one character who isn't likable, but I have run in a good number who are downright lovable.\n\nBut I think my absolute favourite thing has to be the gameplay overall. I love progression systems, and although I know they're not everyone's cup of tea, I love it when you can progress the same character(s) over different game modes, Rainbow Six Vegas coming to mind for this. The multiplayer is very fun, and I didn't even buy the game for the multiplayer, in fact I wasn't going to bother with it at all, but I hopped in a game after (failing) the first proper story mission and I've been hooked all damn day, it doesn't seem to get boring like other shooters, or even other mobas. The Co-Op is difficult. Like, sometimes it can be very difficult, I guess it just depends who you are playing with but the game does a great job at keeping you on your toes.\n\nI just hope more people will get to play this game and have as much fun as I'm having, especially when living in the shadow of the giant Overwatch, which had its beta while this game launched.\n\nDo note this game is not without flaws, performance is a bit weak as usual for Gearbox PC ports, the servers have been iffy all day, especially matchmaking, and I hear AMD GPUs are having massive problems with the game at the moment, hopefully drivers and/or Gearbox fix this.\n\nAs other reviews have mentioned, Matchmaking is very poor.

I don't generally play FPS games, but the art style, MOBA components, and interest from my friend group sold me on this game.  This game has a similar blend of charm and humor that made the Borderlands titles so strong.  It has some quirks, but the Gearbox team has been vigilant on listening to community feedback and addressing concerns thus far.  For example, major geometry and design changes have been made to the MOBA-style Incursion map "Overgrowth" that fixed cheesy sniper strats.  GB has been quick on balance changes as well, and we've seen a few god tier characters brought into line without being ruined and sent into garbage tier (Ambra, Galilea, Miko).\n\nCharacter design is good, sound design (especially dialog) is enjoyable, and the game plays quite well.  Playing in a 2-5 player group is highly recommended.  The game is not free, which means you won't be nickled and dimed for skins, taunts, or new characters; everything is unlockable just by playing.  Characters that are still in development will also be available for free, which is nice.  This could have easily been a F2P title, but I'm glad that they didn't go this route.\n\nThe game could definitely use improvements to matchmaking.  People complain about facing against high level players, but my rag-tag group of scrubs has beaten higher level groups before, it's not always a stomp.  A high level just means you've played more, and has almost nothing to do with matchmaking.  The game has some sort of MMR system, but it is hidden, which is probably for the best.  Apparently, ranked play is in development, but a couple months off.\n\nThis is a bold game, and I'm happy to see titles like this get made and released despite the extreme competition available in the FPS and MOBA spaces.  This game is both, so it inevitably is compared to juggernauts like League of Legends and TF2/Overwatch.  I think that BB and Overwatch can peacefully co-exist, and TF2/Overwatch players that also like MOBAs will probably also like this game.","May 24","true","89.9"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

What is this game, though? Well, it takes the MOBA genre and turns it on it's head; for once, finally, we get a MOBA where we have full control of our characters and it's no longer mouse-clicking spam garbage.\n\nIt's an actual MOBA that plays a bit like a first person shooter. Funnily enough, it streamlines a few things, while delivering some unique new aspects to this style of game that I haven't really seen anywhere else.\n\nInstead of towers being pre-placed, you can build turrets, traps, and things to help your team and hinder the enemy team. Also, instead of random creeps, there are several mercenary camps (At least in Incursion) where you can hire more, bigger, powerful creeps to assault the enemy.\n\nCharacters have true skilltrees in the form of a Helix. Each Helix has 2 sides, and every time you level, you can select one or the other to truly customize how your character will play, and how their kit works. Plus, as you gain character levels (outside of each match) you get mutations for your Helix, which give you a third choice for several of the existing helix choices.\n\nItems in a MOBA are simplified now - you make a loadout with three pieces of gear, and when you select your character, you pick a loadout. Those 3 pieces go with you and you craft them with shards as the battle progresses. Simple. ♥♥♥♥ League's system, anyway.\n\nIt's a solid game with a lot of stuff going for it, so if you're into playing a game that involves a bit of strategy and teamwork, this should be a definite buy for people, especially if you enjoy playing it with friends.\n\nNOTE: This game is NOT comparable to Overwatch. OW is Blizzard's attempt at making a TF2 clone that is incredibly light on content. They give you 20-ish heroes that don't have a ton of depth. You can't customize the playstyle of your chosen hero, and your rank-up system is purely cosmetic. Plus, you only have two game modes (which are copied directly from TF2, I might add) and there is NO PvE element. So, if you like co-op more than PvP, good luck with that. (I mean, even TF2 has PvE now.. and has had it forever now. Come on, Blizzard.)\n\nGet this game. You won't regret it.\n","May 6","true","88.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Most games can do it's individual components better.\n\nIt's a great gap filler so far since beta, the prologue cutscenes are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing trippy. Pick it up if you just can't wait for other titles, otherwise this title remains to be seen on what it's going to provide. I'm not expecting anything much out of it, as I know Overwatch is something I'll play more.\n\nUpdate: After playing- I can say my suspicions were not quite as expected. Whilst the game has a lot of flaws (and balance issues!) it appears to be relatively firm and stable- and the only major issue people seem to be running into is frames-per-second/preformance issues.\n\nAs it so stands, it turns out so far I have played this more than Overwatch. Maybe that's just me getting sidetracked again, though.\n\nUnfortunately, I can see slight echos of Evolve- especially with ThisAint being a moderator on this game's forum. That was gasoline on the steam community fire for that game. Only time can tell how they will manage this, and hopefully ThisAint knows that moderation requires moderation. Don't go ban-happy like you did with the last forum you moderated, former EA employee.\n\nIf they pull a "season pass 2" I will ♥♥♥♥ rage.

Here is just a quick Pros and Cons\nPros:\n-25 heroes\n-interesting multiplayer\n\nCons:\n-Short story\n-the short story has absolutely no plot\n-characters are all way too silly\n-Boss battle is lame and recycles old bosses\n-point a to point B linear crap\n-heroes are so diverse that you will not be able t play/ don't enjoy 60% of them(At least with me)\n-3 modes, 2 maps\n-1 mode is for MLG Noscoperz (Capture)\n-Balance is not amazing\n-gear system is stupid\n-has a supply drop system just asking for microtransactions\n-Gear has very little impact on the match\n-Takes forever to geth some characters (Ghalt and Kleese)\n-Game feels like it should be free to play\n-should be in Alpha\n\nMay sound like I was a hater, but exact opposite up until launch. There is not enough content in the game, and a good chunk of the present content is not good. If they would have spent resources they put into the story and comic series into multiplayer maps and making heroes slightly more similar (I know I am talking about skill gap compression, but too many are just unplayable), this would be a great game. I would advise that you pass, even with this promotion. My advice is that you buy the Witcher 3 for 25 bucks instead.","May 26","false","25.2"," 56 of 106 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","56","106","3","0"

I just wanted to make a series of points that you should consider when reading reviews for this game.\n\nBattleborn is best classified as an FPS MOBA. This means it would function in a very different way to Overwatch, a Class-Based FPS. Whoever decided to come up with the buzzword "Hero Shooter" and classify them both together should probably be shot.\n\nBalancing issues exist. This is simply a fact about any competitive game. As with just about any competitive game, patches and tweaks will come, buffs and nerfs will OP and UP characters effectively infinitely. I currently play a severely underappreciated character and can manage against most of the heroes that are considered "OP." Once you familiarize with what you are up against, there are ways to compensate for a steamroller in front of you.\n\nIf you are looking for a good story mode, you will not find it here. That is not to say that PvE is short-lived and boring. I have played the eight missions at least a hundred times at this point and I still find it enjoyable, especially as a platform for testing out various helix combinations. The story is just short, and more intended as an arcade PvE mode than anything else. That said, there is a great deal of lore behind the game. Unlocking various character lore challenges, though difficult for certain characters, can reveal a great deal about the universe in which this game is set.\n\nSo far, everyone attacking Gearbox for "failing" upon releasing this game has been proven baseless. Within the first week, the devs have announced planned patches and tweaks for, and try to understand me when I say this, because I mean literally, every. single. issue. I have found with PvP.\n\nI won't tell you whether or not to buy this game. I will tell you that I will be playing this game for months to come.\n\nEDIT: I want to assure anyone who is bothering to actually read multiple reviews that matchmaking systems take time to evaluate your performance as a player before it can match you with the right people. You're gonna get steamrolled for a while, either against your favor or in it. You just muscle through it until the game basically says "well, this is about their general skill level."\n\nAll the negativity towards this game is making me sick. I feel like most of the people bashing it are doing it either because they won't give it an actual chance or because they don't like a game that you have to take time playing before you're good at it.","May 11","true","201.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I honestly most play the standard meltdown push minions through which is a pretty typical moba gamemode. I guess others dislike that despite knowing exactly what this game was going into it. The devs never overhyped this game or tried to sell it any other way than what it is. It's the players and people with preconceived ideas which brought disappointment to everyone. The leveling is fine. I find it hilarious all these people speak of "grinds" and oh darn "gear" or how the skins are all the same. I'm almost level 30, unlocked a lot of amazing gear, and enjoy the skins. What mobas starting off really released skins that rechanged the character completely? They're reskins, big whoop, voice your opinion maybe they'll change something.\n\nPros:\nVery nice cartoon graphics\nCheap humor that can be quite entertaining\nActually takes skill to get gud\nNot any bugs experienced so far\nFresh new twist on the MOBA scene with a FPS genre\nWhat other MOBAs have a campaign?!\n\nCons:\nI guess lack of gamemodes or content is what everyone says, I'll add it despite the fact I didn't mind it too much considering its a moba which should honestly not even have a campaign\nGraphics perhaps too strong? I know a lot of people experience lag and frame drops while playing certain maps like coldsnap.\nPrice, this is a big one, I love this game, not really worth $60 though IMHO, by no means should be a F2P but, that's a lot of script for this type of game and what it delivers.\nDifficulty acheiving characters/ rank. I have had no problems, but I'm not everyone, and when the majority of people believe this to be true, then I guess It just might be. Or they're just not good at these types of games.\n\n\nOver all, this isn't borderlands, it's a moba, that happens to have a campaign, and they took a stab at refining an old genre, which I applaud them for.

I thought it was pretty dank but wasn't too sure if it justified spending £40. Two days after release and the dankness has shifted into maximum overdrive. It hit me like a gust of fresh air from the engine of an A380 about to take off. Offering a single-player/ co-op storymode campaign and multi-player with a levelling and loot system, there's tons of replayabilty. It's like that first time you and your mates got so high but everytime you play this you get that same, great high, making you want to play it again and again. Characters are interesting, many of which unique and very fun to play. Have noticed some take lots of inspiration from Dota or TF2 characters such as Benedict-Soldier from TF2 and Ghalt-Pudge from Dota with great similarities to Roadhog from Overwatch. Currency system allows you to purchase loot packs to unlock cool gear to better you in-game such as extra reload speed, shield capacity, etc with a rarity system. The characters themselves have a lot of pop-culture references to which I find pretty cool such as Rath's "mic drop" taunt reminiscent of Obama at his final correspondent's dinner and other occurences such as when Neil deGrasse Tyson demolished B.o.B's flat earth theory on Comedy Central.\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone, no matter what sort of games you love, whether it is MOBA games or fps' as this is a great mix of both.\n\nP.S. yes i am selling this sofa at £499.

But the multiplayer is fun though and you'll be wasting your time on that. It has the Borderlands type of humor that we expect to see, and it does work. Gameplay is fun. It does not reach the same fun factor as the Borderlands games but it's still good.  AI is completely brain dead in the campaign though. Some enemies don't even move until they're like half a life left, and adding in more enemies does not make the game difficult, it just makes it annoying.\n\nThis isn't as heavily praised as I gave to the Borderlands series, but it does not make it a bad game.

For starters ANY review that is comparing this to Overwatch is completely pointless. Do your research and see that they are both two different games that people are trying to lump in the same category. Anyway....\n\nA key point about battleborn:\n\n-If you don't like Mobas such as league of legends, smite, heroes of the storm, or Dota 2, then you're going to want to reconsider buying this game. Everything about this game is in the moba styling even in Story Missions (which i've played mobas for almost 5-6 years now so i have no problems with this) but it's incredibly important to know what you're getting yourself into. Competitive players that curse you out when they are also failing, balancing issues at times, lack of teamwork, lack of direction towards objectives, and meta picking champs are all going to be part of the multiplayer in this game. As much as i hate what i just mentioned, it's sadly part of the community. So if you dont like minion killing along lanes, cant deal with toxic players, or don't like repetitive matches on the same maps, then stray away from battleborn. Last thing we need is the reviews plummeting because some kid didn't do his research, thought about gearbox and borderlands, then writes a review saying it sucks.\n\nBattleborn~\nPros:\n-Wonderful and creative character roster. Very unique with lots of different play styles. Want to be a gentleman robot sniper who calls people hobos? Marquis is right there for you! Want to cut people down with swords and have a skill calling "Totally not a vampire"? Rath is for you. Want some stealth with holo decoys? Deande is perfect for you!\n-Fun art style. Somethign about the art in this game is delightful. From the character design, to level design, and of course how could anyone hate that beautiful hand drawn intro!\n-High replay value in missions. Every time you go into a new mission, depending on the characters in your team, the dialogue will change accordingly. here's an example:\n\nWolf MK1 sentry: so guys what are we gonna do after this whole portal thing that i am totally not going to die to?\nMarquis: MOURN YOUR LOSS YOU BEAUTIFUL SENTRY!! *sobbing*\n\nWolf Mk1 sentry: *same line as before*\nShayne: Uh...ugh....look dude....we're gonna blow you up. I'm sorry.....\nWolf MK1: sounds fun!\n-Meltdown is incredibly addicting\n-The loadout system gives you ways of altering your play style. Make sure to choose much in the same way you'd choose runes on League. Putting a tanky loadout build on Orendi or Thorn...and well you're gonna have low damage. High health, but lower damage compared to more damage based builds\n-Gearbox humor. The first time you hear isic, you're going to be laughing pretty hard. It only gets better from there.\n\n-Cons\n-Sabotuer is probably the hardest mission in the game. Your team could be stellar the whole way, but once you get to that last defense point, the target you have to defend (no spoilers of course) seems to just melt. There's talk that they're making it easier, but time will tell. The challenge is welcoming to me, just alot of people have been complaining about it so fair warning.\n-Community. As with every moba, the community is a wonderful utopia of teamwork and motivation (can you sense the sarcasm?). Majority of your teammates would rather suck ♥♥♥♥ through a straw then attempt to work with you. Though this is a problem plaguing almost every moba.\n-Connection issues. Sometimes you're gonna wanna bash your head against the wall when steam maintenance pops up. Almost beat the saboteur and then steam lost connection. Turns out scheduled maintenance came and went. If you have a crappy connection to steam, reconsider this game. It's better than not connecting. Also some computers for what ever reason have port issues where they cant connect to the game at the login screen. It was a common problem in beta, though i havent heard anything about it recently. just passing on info.\n-Repetitive gameplay. As i specified before, even though the dialogue changes in hilarious ways, some people just hate doing the same thing over and over (resident raccoon city was a good example. Great game, halfway decent story, but people hated the multiplayer heavy gun toting re feel and doing the same thign over and over). If you dislike doing the same story missions or multiplayer heavy games, stray away from this one.

I would have been more content with a $40-$45 price tag. Though perhaps this is just my cheap nature that is the result of my inability to stay with one game for an extended period of time. I believe I'll get 30 hours out of this game, but I doubt any more than that.\n\nThe game play is fun and addictive. I've never played any MOBA before, but I have still found myself enjoying this game. The story mode is alright and the multiplayer is pretty intense. I also absolutely adore the visuals. My 290x can run this game at beautiful settings, however my laptop that sports a 970M, seems to struggle to max out settings. Nvidias recommended resolution is at 900p.

It's fast paced, the characters are actually interesting and the game looks nice.\n\nThere are a few balancing issues in the game, but it was just released; that's to be expected (not nearly as bad as some of the balancing problems in Overwatch right now; looking at you, Zenyatta. You're so weak you're almost unplayable...). Mostly just 1 character in all honesty, you see her every game. Galilea for those who haven't played yet.\n\nNot enough supports in my opinion right now, but the ones we do have are actually nice. Though Miko is the best one in general, sadly. Would be nice to get more, which we probably will.\n\nCharacter personalities are very well done, I personally find myself playing Shayne and Aurox constantly. Great fun to be had there.\n\nStory missions can be very long and grindy, but that's after you've beaten them and simply wish to get silver or gold. First time going through? Very fun, long, fleshed out, and it tends to be funny. You can see allot of Borderlands style in the game.\n\nWhile there are downsides in the game, they are very forgivable when you look at the big picture. The game is worth it in my opinion, I don't regret buying it at full price. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer game to play, this one's a great one to look into.","May 8","true","36.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","10"

But Battleborn is where Gearbox's heart lies now, and honestly...\n\n... I'm really into it.  I loved the beta.  And I love the release even more.  In Battleborn they seem to have successfully uncoupled the zany humor from the bad, bad, bad and maudlin 'drama' of Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel (though BL2 was the worst offender by far).  Battleborn does what Gearbox does best and nothing else - RPG shooter action with great world design and writing that's hilarious and over-the-top and sometimes you feel like an immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ laughing at the humor, but you laugh anyways.\n\nThe old-school anime cinematics and hip hop theme were a huge surprise and transported me back into my youth.  Anime of the early 90's and late 80's, upbeat hip hop... it sets the tone for the game, which is honestly like playing a Gorillaz music video, which I dig.\n\nIn so many ways, this is not 'just another something' even though I was ready to barf when I heard about MOBA elements.  Yet, there is nothing MOBA about this, in terms of the community it fosters and the attitudes it encourages.  I played several versus matches and had a great time.  Who knew?\n\nSure, the game is wackadoo.  But it knows what it is, and like any well-composed work of art, it sticks close to its themes and always exercises continuity, in especially subtle ways.  It never loses its way.\n\nOn top of that, it plays like a dream and if you have friends, forget about it - you'll have a blast.\n\nAnd on top of THAT, the system in place for progression and unlocking characters, gear, etc. is incredibly fair, intuitive, and requires ZERO real-world cash purchasing.  This is not a convoluded microtransaction skinner box, this is a game that rewards you for loving it, rather than exploits you for loving it, as so many cynical online games do these days.\n\nI cannot recommend Battleborn enough.","May 3","true","162.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maikueikan/recommended/394230/","Maikueikan","Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maikueikan/","134 products in account","Honestly this game is great, and I have a lot of respect for GB as a game developer. However, I feel like this game has come out at a VERY inopportune time, a time when Blizzard (known for some rather... aggressive business tactics) is releasing a game that is somewhere near the same genre. This will likely cause the game to collapse before it even has a chance of flourishing.\n\nAlthough I don't think the games are nearly as comprable as Blizzard would have people believe, I feel that Battleborn is actually the better overall game when compared to Overwatch. I feel this way for a number of reasons, foremost of which is the fact that GB as a developer is more trustworthy to me. This might at first glance appear blasphemous: how could any developer be more trustworthy than Blizzard, the "pinoneer in gaming?" Well the short answer is that Blizzard went entirely off the deep end years ago, at least from my perspective. I could spend several paragraphs explaining this perspective, but a Blizzard tyrade isn't really the purpose of this review. So, Pros and Cons for Battleborn instead!\n\nPros:\n-Made by the developers of Borderlands. This means great support, entertaining characters, fluid and easily understood mechanics, and above all HUMOR.\n\n-Story mode! For people that want to enjoy the game, but maybe don't have friends on to queue up for versus with or maybe just don't feel like dealing with community members this feature is very welcomed.\n\n-MOBA-style of versus games. This means the games are pretty quick and can be played even when you don't have much time to devote. These kinds of games have become favorite for the busy working class and students!\n\n-Balanced PvP (as much as can be expected from a new competitive game). I feel this point will find some contention, but I stand by it. There are VERY few underpowered characters, I've managed to do well with all of them with the exception of a few that don't fit my playstyle (looking at you Reyna and Ambra...). And there aren't really any blatantly overpowered characters, I've managed to deal with them all without ever being frustrated at the characters themselves. A lot of the "unbalanced" feeling likely stems from people not being familiar with the strengths and weakness of different characters more than anything else. This is VERY common in these types of games: the community needs time (sometimes lots of it) to learn how to deal with things properly before tierlists can be established.\n\n-Funny spiders.\n\nCons:\n-A small and dwindling community. This will make queue times nightmarish and will likely cause the collapse of the game. It doesn't bode well that right after a 30% off sale I needed to wait in queues for up to 30 minutes... less than a month after the official release of the game.\n\n-Matchmaking. This is an issue in EVERY game it seems. I frequently get placed with or against people that clearly have no business being there. I don't necessarily blame the game for this issue, I imagine this stems mostly from the previous con.\n\n-The story mode, while refreshing to see, is a bit... lame. It's fun to play through once, but isn't exactly something I want to play over and over again. It would have been nice to see these be a little bit more entertaining and varied, but I don't think it was the main focus of the game.\n\n-The loot system is pretty bad. It can be very difficult to find usable loadout gear, especially if you're only PvPing. This has frustrated many people...\n\n-Locked characters. I'm putting this as a con, though I personally didn't have an issue with it. Many of the characters are locked and you need to unlock them as you level up and progress in challenges. I thought this was refreshing compared to the money-grabbing methods of unlocking all of the characters used by most MOBAs. However, it can take a long time to unlock some characters this way. If you really wanted to play those characters (Ghalt...), you're pretty much out of luck unless you grind the challange away or level up.\n\n-Leveling up, both command and character. This can take a pretty long time unless you're PvEing exclusively. This is probably why so many level 100s (max levels) are quite terrible at the game when you see them in PvP: most of them haven't PvPed at all. This is really only a minor compaint, as after command 40 the command levels are fairly pointless for the time being, and character levels only matter if theirs a helix mutation you really need.\n\n-My most minor of complaints: The skins are pretty unimaginative. Their all free, yes, but it would have been nice to see some aesthetic changes that ranged beyond simple re-coloring of the character. I release this isn't and shouldn't be a priority in a new (and struggling) game though.\n\nAnd that's everything! For those that don't want to read all that: basically this game is great and made by a trustworthy developer. However, the timing of this game will likely see it hit the graveyard before it can get the playerbase it deserves.","May 29","true","75.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Completely different game and a lot of fun in it's own right. Has the goofy writing of the Borderland's series, well done hand-drawn special effects, and a number of interesting characters.\n\nThe main drawback is the low population of the game at the moment, which is a real pity. As a multiplayer based game this can be a drawback to people, however as someone who lives in Japan I have had very little problem finding matches. The matchmaker suffers further from the low population, having a limited pool of players to draw from and thereby games of uneven skill level being present. There are some complaints on timegated content, however everything in the base game is unlocked through acheivements or play time similar to Super Smash Brothers.","May 29","true","19.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even the shortest of PVP games can take near 20 min. I Think this turns away a lot of players used to speedy rounds in other games- Killing another player in PVP requires downing their shield (A bit like Halo, if you will) and their health; as opposed to just their health. PVE enemies work the same way.\n\nOther reviews I've read complain about long matchmaking queues, I honestly don't find them overly abhorrent. At the most, I've waited 3 minutes. This also fluctuates on the time of day you're playing the game and your wifi connectivity.\n\nAnother thing I've seen complained about is the lag- while the style of the game appears pretty simple, There are a lot of effects and "other visual stuff"- It takes a pretty beefy computer to run. Mine's a fairly tankish machine and I still had to turn the graphics down. (My tip there is to keep the Textures at a high setting and turn the View distance down; it still looks pretty good.) Wifi also takes a role here.\n\n\n-CHARACTERS-\n\nYou start with 5 of 25 base characters, discluding the extra 5 that are coming out as DLC.\nThe rest of the characters are unlockable through either raking up, or specific challenges (Like killing 800 of X enemy, or killing 50 players in PVP.) The fun thing is that the 5 characters you start with are no less engaging to play as the ones you can unlock later; and each character has unique, if not familiar, abilities.\n\nBeing that there are 3 'classes'; Damage, Tank, and Support, two subclasses; Melee and Ranged, and 25 characters total, there is most likely at least one character for everyone- the trouble is simply spending the time to find (and unlock) the one you want! This can take a lot of time though- the challenges are not to be taken lightly.\n\nI've found it's better to test characters in a PVE solo match before attempting a public PVP/PVE after you unlock them to see if you really actually like that character's abilities, as you CANNOT swap mid-mission.\n\n\n-PVE-\n\nYou can play the game's PVE missions by yourself or with a random matchmaking team, or in a private friend group. Missions are, again, pretty long, divided into stages of Wave Fights, Boss Fights, Mini-Boss Fights, Defense Points, etc. There are currently 8 missions in the game, with more said to be coming with the DLC.\nCharacters in missions will constantly chatter; occasionally the player's character will chip in to the conversation. Each one is charming in their own "Gearbox Way'; most of the humor is massively overblown, making it almost laughably bad in spots, but still fun to listen to.\n\n\n\n-PVP-\n\nThere are 3 PVP modes: Meltdown, Incursion, and Capture.\n\nMeltdown is a mode where rather than directly going for players, you have to chase down the other team’s minions before they reach a location while guarding yours. Out of the 3, this is probably the most lighthearted game mode, given that it’s more PVE based than the other two.\n\nIncursion is a larger-scaled game where you must break through enemy lines to destroy stuff on the other side. These matches often take the longest, and are to me the most difficult. They’re most likely fit for more experienced PVPers.\n\nCapture is well.. Capture. There are three zones and two teams; the team holding the highest number  of zones for the longest amount of time wins. These matches tend to go quickly.\n\n\n---\n\nInevitably, this game gets compared to Overwatch a LOT. While both (technically) fall into the same genre, they are incredibly different games, in much the way that perhaps World of Warcraft and Guild Wars 2 are.\n\nIf you think the game might be worth a shot but aren’t sure, I would recommend waiting until a sale pops up (and to be fair, this game kind of goes on sale a lot). The Battleborn community is always in need of more players!\n","June 2","true","8.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I am NOT referring to the lack of maps/characters.  The in game "plan" has stated that more are in the works.  I'm referring to the fact that the above flaws are in other games.  Just about every MOBA-esque game has some form of proper weighted matchmaking, not allowing full 5 man premades to go up against a full squad of randoms just because a couple of people grouped up.  Same could be applied to the reporting system, as it regulates the level of salt and vitriol in the community.  The ability to add players mid match was done by this game's predecessor, Monday Night Combat.  The joining players would simply get a credit/xp boost accordingly to the time into the match.\n\nGiven these downsides, If the most egregous error of matchmaking was fixed, potentially with the adding of people. I would whole heartedly recommend this game.  If fixed while I am active in it's community, I will edit the review to reflect.\n\nThe Positives include:\n- A phenomenal campaign, fully voice acted, quirky sense of humor, and decently written.\n- Rock solid net code, making a smooth experience.\n- Good in game voice comms, along with text chat, making it easy to communicate with your group.\n- Good lore for each character that you unlock while playing each character\n\n\nWhile the PvP is horrendous with the community/matchmaking, the single player shines out, like the last star! It's funny challenging, and provides significant rewards with the credits and unboxing.  I consider this game decently bought if it was slightly cheaper ($40-$50) for the singleplayer/co-op alone.  For those who like a good cheesy story and great characters, pick it up, maybe on sale, if only for the chuckles and laughs you will get from characters responses in the story to their lore and voice clips.  I will continue to jump on for the single player, just to learn the lore of all these characters.  Sadly a fair portion of these challenges are linked to the multiplayer. I suppose I could try to use bots for that, but those games feel almost grindy.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nMultiplayer matchmaking = Crap, Single player and lore = Awesome","May 21","false","12.6"," 41 of 77 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","41","77","0","0"

I found myself bewildered at first because there are so many options and characters but you quickly get used to it. The game has that wonderful Humor (and several voice actors from Borderlands you will recognize as characters in Battleborn), colorfull look, and first person combat feel of Borderlands, but it's overall a very different game. It's not about weapons as much as it is leveling your characters, recieving loot items at the end of missions that increase your stats or abilities, and finding characters that work for your play style. There are a ton of things to discover and learn about each character, it will definately keep you busy doing so. I admit I haven't played as much of the competitive multiplayer as I did the campaign since release and during both Betas, but looking forward to that. The game is going to be a life snatcher for awhile, as you will want to try each character and find your niche. On a Nvidia GTX970 with everything maxed and running at 1440p, my Framerates hover at 60fps 90 perfent of the time only dipping when the action is at heaviest points, and even then not much. Very polished and well worth a try if you enjoyed Borderlands and like MOBA games like SMITE.","May 3","true","12.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

With that, the fact that I actually greatly enjoy this game should speak a lot on how well it pulls it off. FPS with MOBA aspects works well and just feels much more responsive.

From that point on every other game seemed dull by comparison.  It combines the best parts of the Borderlands series with a team based FPS/MOBA.  The character design is fantastic and not just a rehash of the heavy/sniper/scout meta that you see in so many other games.\n\nOn top of being a fantastic PVP game it actually comes with a really decent single-player/co-op PvE campaign.  So even if the PvP modes don't hold a lot of sway for you there is still a full game here with quite a bit of replayability.\n\n","May 5","true","63.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's one of those games that doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time you must be serious when playing if you want to actually beat the levels (Referring to the story missions). Wih that being said, this game is heavily focused on playing as a team. With my time playing on pc (again, very new to playing pc) I don't see it being as easy to play effectively together as it is on consoles. And what i mean by this is not many people seem to use mics. Maybe i'm wrong and they are quiet or i have some setting not active, but not many people use mics when playing. Of course there is the option to type out stuff but unless you are super quick and can get it in here and there, you wont be able to type out to your teammates in the heat of things.\n\nNow again, none of this is negative against the game, it is just what i've noticed thus far. This game is ridiculously fun and by all means do not play this game if you are prone to seizures lol. (But seriously, lots of flashes and colors galore). Can't wait to unlock all the characters and give them a try. From what i see, all the characters are pretty unique in their own sense, but they are all similar as well. While they all have different powers, lots tend to have this one melee or special attack power while the other is a "Damage in this specific area" type power. The 10 step upgrade tree though is what makes them extremely unique and also fun to constantly go back with the same character multiple times to see if a different set up works for you. You can basically level up 10 times per match and with each level up you choose power up A or B which both do their own unique ability.\n\nWhile i agree with ign that the enemies just seem to be more so just enemies that charge and shoot and no real AI to them, idk if i would want them to be that smart lol. With as many enemies as they throw at you at once and their difficulty ranging from 2 hits to kill to 10-20+, i dont want them to try and dodge and flank me. Maybe its different on hardcore, i've yet to try it, but i assume it just means they will simply do more damage.\n\nSo in summary, just buy the game if you enjoy super fast paced shooter games. I would recommend coming into this with a set group of friend that are also wanting to buy and play it, because you need a very focused team to get through some of these levels, but you might get lucky in matchmaking (As long as im not on your team xD). Easy controls to learn, great graphics, very fluid, and servers seem to not lag or cause any problems (Though i havent played at peak times such as at night and on weekends yet). Hope this gives you some sort of insight to the game. I highly recommend this game for a fun game with friends and just a good time, just dont come looking for something easy or some great story. You'll be a bit disappointed.","May 3","true","12.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I never played Borderlands so I am more or less new to GearBox's brand and style.\n\nFirst I will get in the bad: Game doesnt run as well as I would like it, though a driver update has improved the quality significantly. The sfx can sometimes be a wee bit clippy but it is mostly negligeble.\n\nNow onto the good, The game very much feels like Unreal Tournament and [INSERT YOUR FAVORITE MOBA HERE] had a twisted bizzaro baby. This baby was subsequently thrown into a cellshaded vat made out of jelly beans and Monster Energy drinks. I am still walking through the story mode and havent done any competative but I can definitely see myself spending more time here, especially if some more optimazation is done. I love the writing and humor as well cuz it has me chuckling a few times per mission. The characters are each very unique and feel like they add to the action in their own way.\n\nNow would I buy this game? Honestly, I am very much a bargain hunter and indy guy, where I will wait even years to try out games I find interesting, so 59.99 is too rich for my blood anbd if it wasnt for my friend buying it, I would probably be grinding my Path of Exile build instead.

I spent this week testing all the upcoming games, Overwatch, Paladins, and Paragon. Every single one of them was an OK game, but each was missing something. Battleborn hit the mark perfectly. It's a fast paced FPS-MOBA with individual character progression, skins, achievements and titles, and an interesting PvE gameplay.\n\nThe combat and playstyle is very smooth and organic, and each character (currently 25 available) has a unique play style that makes each play-through refreshing and interesting, combined with a levelling system that lets you customize each ability every time you play.\n\nThe majority of downvotes are either complaints about 'repetitive' story (this is primarily a MOBA, and the missions are still fun even after multiple play throughs) and the fact that people somehow missed the fact that this is a MOBA and not Borderlands 3.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, it consists of three gamemodes a capture point, Meltdown (minion push), and a standard MOBA type, but with a twist. I will not cover the capture point gamemode here as that is as you can imagine. Meltdown consists of two teams attempting to push waves of minions into the opposing team's portals in order to sacrifice them to appease a god. Their standard MOBA match consists of two giant siege-spider-tank things that must be destroyed in order to win, throughout the course of the match you can hire stronger minions by defeating them around the map, and purchase various towers such as a speed-boost and a health regen.\n\nThe overall playstyle is very unique and cannot easily be compared to any game that is currently out. On the whole it is leagues above the other games I mentioned, although that is of course somewhat subjective.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy it, Try it, Refund it if you don't like it.","May 7","true","73.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And what do you have? Battleborn!\n\nBattleborn is an FPS/MOBA hybrid (read: not a class-based shooter!) that pits two teams of five players against each-other in a variety of game modes. Some of which are what you'd expect from a MOBA, and others of which hold deeper roots in more traditional FPS objective-based gameplay (i.e., KoTH). There's currently three modes now, but I have a feeling there may be more if the playerbase proves to hold steady. Thanks to being an FPS, everything is a "skillshot", meaning your aim (both your vertical and horizontal, unlike say Smite where there is no Y axis) and your positioning are both important as the game will not land your attacks for you.\nOne thing to remember is that while it's an FPS first. It's a MOBA slightly-less first. Having good aim and positioning is all well and good, but there will be times where you're faced with engagements that you have no hope of winning at ALL, so you must understand when and when is not a good time to retreat.\n\nFor those of you who prefer to take it a bit easier and mow down legions of AI, there's also a campaign mode consiting of eight missions at the moment. These missions are structured like raids from MMOs, wherein you proceed through a level, beat a miniboss or two, then beat the big baddie at the end. I do NOT reccomend buying this game solely for the co-op mode. Because every match in this game is instanced, there is very little in the way of over-arching progression to keep you engaged over longer periods with regards to leveling; you won't get stronger every time you beat a mission.\n\nGameplay is similar to that of Borderlands, but with a key difference. The character selection is actually incredibly diverse gameplay-wise, with characters all feeling different to one-another thanks to a variety of attributes. There are some characters that are absurdly huge and tower over others (and yes, the viewmodels will be situated higher up, so you'll be looking down on others, but take care to not get in their way!), there are some characters with additional jumps. There are characters who can put up shields to absordb damage. There are characters whom can teleport. Characters without shields, but have natural heatlh regen to compensate. Characters that can grant shield or health to others. There are simply many many different ways to play in this regard.\nThe high TTK also means that matches are slightly deeper on the strategic level, because there is no one character that can take another from 100 to 0 before they can react.\n\nBattleborn also makes use of a "gear" system. Players can earn crates (called loot packs) by leveling up their player level, character level, or by buying specific crates from the store using the money earned from PvP and Co-Op. You may also earn individual pieces of loot randomly from enemies during the latter.\nCrates will contain anywhere from two to five randomly generated pieces of gear depending on the pack you buy. Players can take up to three pieces of gear into matches to bolster their attributes in some way or form. Such as slightly increasing their health, reducing their recoil, shorterning their shield recharge delay, and so on and so forth. Players earn these pieces of gear in the match through collecting shards which are obtained from killing lesser-enemies and respawning nodes on the map. Gear is purchased using these shards, and more "potent" gear requires more shards to obtain.\nThis will create situations where older players have an advantage over newer players down the line. While the increases per-gear are insiginficant (i.e., 5% damage reduction, an extra 160 health when characters have anywhere from 900 to 2600 at base, 5% shorter cooldowns), all it will take is for somebody to get lucky and put together a min-maxing set (i.e, you have gear that increases HP as it's primary effect, but your other two pieces of gear also increase HP as their secondary effect, so instead of just having an extra 160 HP, you end up with an extra 500 HP altogether.","May 3","true","108.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Gearbox dida good job yet again. The game is filled with different characters, each with a different backstory, and skill set, and its just a overall fun game.\n\n- Before I start talking about the game itself, I want to clear some things up. I am NOT comparing Battleborn to Overwatch, simply because they are nothing alike. Besides the graphics, and the fact that they're both FPS's, they are two TOTALLY different games. So, keep that in mind as you are reading this review, that I will NOT be comparing the two games. I'm also not saying that Overwatch is bad, either, so dont start thinking that.\n\nIn Battleborn, you are, well, the Battleborn, and your job is to stop Rendain and the Jennerits from rebuilding the Heliophage, and destroying the last star, Solus. In some ways, this game is very similar to the Borderlands games, which I absolutly LOVED. The campaign can be difficult at times, and may require you to go and do the campaign online. Now, the campaign isn't that long: only 8 missions. However, each mission can take up to about 30 mins, so your time and money isn't being wasted. Each mission has the chance to unlock a new character. Characters can be obtained 1 of 3 ways: by completing a challenge, by reaching a certain rank, or beating a mission that unlocks said character.\n\nNow, let's move on to the PvP aspect of the game. There are 3 different modes of PvP: Capture, witch is your standard capture area and hold it for a certain amount of time, Incursion, which is just destroy the enemies base, and Meltdown, but it's basically, you have to sacrifice your minions to a god, which is actually unique.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. i recommend it to everyone. It truely won't disapoint you. May our battle, never end.","May 27","true","36.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044033482/recommended/394230/","76561198044033482","Sunken Submariner","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044033482/","83 products in account","For a quick version of this review:\nBattleborn is a very deep and strategic game including PvP with in-match character growth via their helix, long times to kill, mechanics that punish death, and a focus on PvE and tower defense amide the PvP.\n\nThe PvE includes 8 missions that contain a mix of escort, protect the objective, and 'raid' (as in enemies to mini-boss to enemies to boss) mechanics.\n\nIn public match making for PvE people vote on a random selection of four missions.\n\nThere is progression system that includes unlocking characters and extra options on their helix tree.\n\nThe five characters being added in the future and all future PvP related material can be accessed for free (but if you own the season pass you just skip the step of unlocking the characters).\n\nThe major issues with this game are that it has optimization issues and when you first start out and the system doesn't have any data on you, you may end up in some one-sided matches.\n\nPersonally I really like the game and feel like I got my full 60 dollars worth.\n\nNow for some extra details for those still reading:\nI definitely recommend this game, but at the same time I do not recommend it to everyone. In the PvP, this is not a typical team based FPS, and whatever you have learned in other FPS likely will not carry over into this game. It definitely has a learning curve, even for somebody like me who had a taste of it before buying during the open beta. As a team based FPS with MOBA inspired elements (the game is not a full MOBA itself) Battleborn is all about choosing your battles, staying with team mates, avoiding death at all costs (death is punished in this game with increasingly longer respawn timers), and always remaining aware of the AI controlled minions (ignore these little guys and you will lose every game even if have been steam rolling the enemy team in kills).\n\nThe game comes with both a PvP mode and a PvE campaign. For me personally this is very nice because if I get tired of competitive PvP matches, I just switch over to the PvE and have fun blowing ♥♥♥♥ up for a while (while making sure to keep an eye on the objectives of course, these missions to have some challenge to them).\nThe missions of the PvP are not made to be played in a specific order besides doing the first 7 before the final mission against Rendain (In normal difficulty this is a seperate mission, but in advanced it gets mixed into the usual voting selection mentioned above) and as a result they do not have an over arching story but rather just the story of the mission itself.\nAlso I should mention that the PvE missions are VERY full of Gearbox style humor, so just be prepared for that. They basically went full on silly and ridiculous for the writing on this one.\n\nWhile some people are turned off by progression systems, I personally find them a fun little bit of extra challenge, but I will say that for any worrying, unlocking the characters is not hard at all. And in case you do somehow have trouble, every character has two methods they can be unlocked by, the second being profile level. So even the characters who can be unlock by completely the advanced story mode and such can alternatively just be unlocked by inceasing your command rank which happens no matter what you play.\n\nThe progression system, aside from unlocking characters, is also involved in unlocking "mutations" for each character's helix tree. All this means is that as you play a character, you unlock extra options to pick from as you level your character up each game (at the start of every PvE or PvP match you are at level 1). These mutations are often very useful, but they often won't redefine how you play a character but instead just give you another very useful option when playing. Also there will still likely be plenty of situations where you will choose one of the original two choices rather than the new mutation.\n\nAnother important topic to touch on is the gear system. As you play you will eventually begin to collect gear which can be activated in matches with the in-match currency of shards. This gear will provide stat bonuses to your character, and later legendary quality gear can even give special unique effects. However the power of a gear piece is always balanced by the number of shards you must gather and then spend in order to activate it. In fact, walking into PvP with a loadout full of three legendary pieces of gear is often a very bad idea because you likely won't be able to collect enough shards before the match ends to even activate all of them (additionally you will likely also avoid using the buildables situated throughout each map which tend to be very important to victory). Additionally, it is impossible to activate pricier gear right off the bat in PvP because giant shards don't spawn until a few minutes in (and even then you have the enemy team to compete with when it comes to breaking and gathering them).\n\nI do feel like I should touch on some issues you have likely seen in other reviews and let you know which ones are no longer an issue as of the time of this review. First of all, the incursion mode exploit involving snipers on the map Overgrowth is no more. Second, the 5 minute prologue cutscene can be skipped if you do not wish to watch it. Third, after her third wave of nerfs, Galilea is no longer overpowered and can no longer 1v1 everyone and win (and in case you did not hear Ambra ceased being a problem quite some ago).\nI will admit that the game can certainly still use more optimization, though they are gradually working on and improving that. And finally the match making is not completely unbalanced, though when you are first starting out and the system does not have any data on you, yes it can tend to put you in somewhat onesided matches. But I can personally say that this definitely changes once you have a collection of matches completed, as I very rarely find myself in matches that feel one-sided in terms of player skill.","May 28","true","100.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It still needs some polishing, but it is already a good game.\n\nMany reviews complain about the long queue times. I cannot agree with that. I play in EU and never had any problems. My queue times are mostly from 1-5 minutes in every game mode. Every story mode (normal and advanced) goes up quick and every PvP mode as well.\n\nThe only annoying thing to me is those people just leaving the game. This is a minor complaint I have and I think Gearbox should adress this. There is no penalty so as soon as people do not get the Battleborn they want or not the map they want, some of them leave. This is somewhat a homemade problem, because I do not think the implementation of a random map selection of only three which are then voted works well, because ... people tend to be selfish in PUGs. But so far this is my only real complaint about the game. But then again I also notices some really friendly and helpful people. When you ask about people helping you with your lore unlocks most people are going to help you.\n\nAt first I thought the explosion of visual effects on the screen would be distracting when watching Let's Plays on YouTube. But I was wrong. Yes, I do not always see everything, but it is much less difficult when you play it yourself. All in all I was able to deal with all the visual effects on the screen and it even adds to the badass action you are diving into.\n\nSome complaints are about the matchmaking which I cannot agree upon. The command level rank does not equal skill. There are level 100 player who still do not play objectives in the game or cannot play with specific battleborns. The only problems with this is that people already give up when they see a high rank level in the enemy team. This is the problem. Not the matchmaking. Gearbox should make the command ranks invisible. It does not matter for the matchmaking or the matches. Even with a command level of 100 it may be my first time playing a battleborn or even with command level 5 this might be a battleborn I feel familiar with, because it uses game mechanics I prefer in other games as well.\n\nThat being said, what draws me to Battleborn mostly? I am a huge Dawngate fan. Yes, that is the MOBA that was killed by EA, because it did not make enough money in the Beta (sic!). Battleborn feels a little like it to me. Some of it’s modes got MOBA elements, but first and foremost: Battleborn has got awesome and unique character background and lore.\n\nBattleborn got me immersed into the universe and it does it all within the game. I do not have to rely on out of game ressources. Battleborn has single player campagin which narrates the story and the setting. All characters got lore challenges to unlock tidbits of background on them. This feels more natural and more satisfying to me than in other games. Yet they also have a comic on their website which made me squeal, because Dawngate had an extra comic series as well. So it reminds me a lot of it.\n\nWhile playing Battleborn everything in the game feels like I get to play the lore as well. For Battleborn the setting fits with all the things you are playing in game. All those characters from different factions are even supposed to fight sometimes on the own team. So all the bickering and remarks in game feel natural. This is why the immersion in Battleborn works so well. Battleborn hit me on the spot of immersion way better because of all this.\n\nI like how the game merges the lore and the game modes. This is done pretty well and I love this postmodern apocalypse. It is rich with self-conscious irony and there are so many things which make me chuckle and after about 40 hours of gameplay I still discover some minor things which make me smile. This game feels like there was put a lot of heart and soul into it and I appreciate it for exactly this. This is a game which wants to be fun and does not take itself to serious in some moments, but in other immerses you into a pretty fun apocalypse with interesting characters.\n\nAnd what about the combat? It is fun. I like FPS and this game does it pretty well. Each character feels so different to the point that I still do not know how to play some of them. This is one of the challenges of the game and I like that it takes this risk. You have to invest some time to learn those characters and some of them are not easy. Although you can pick some easier characters as well. But I have to admit that those are the least interesting to me. There is so much depth hidden in all the helix options, in the gear system and all those buildables.\n\nIt is not an easy game to get into, but once you give it a chance and invest that first few hours it is so rewarding and fun - at least to me.\n\nMay our battle never end ...","May 29","true","57.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asdumatrix/recommended/394230/","asdumatrix","Sixna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asdumatrix/","127 products in account","Having reached the 250 hour mark, I've decided it is high time for a review after having experienced a solid sum of this game.\n\n-----\n\nTo start, Battleborn is a mix of content that is rewarding for you to mix PvE and PvP content. While one can purely participate in PvP content, you'll be missing out on some nice pieces of gear which gets used in both forms of content.\n\nPvE:\nCurrently, we have access to 8 story mode missions and an additional solo Prologue to introduce you to the game.\nEach one centers in on the progression of the story against the star-stealing Varelsi and Rendain's Jennerit army.\n\nThese missions take place in a variety of different environments, map layouts, and hosts a number of different enemy types.\nMost objectives will involve escorting large sentires, who are more than capable of defending themselves at times, or the defense of a stationary objective.\n\nThe game's difficulty scales with how many players are on your team, so going in alone will be easier than going in with a 5-man group.\nDifficulty can go higher by utilizing Advanced difficulty, which handles enemy damage/health/spawn patterns differently.\nThere is also Hardcore mode, which removes Extra Lives and making you play cautiously.\n\n5 additional story mode missions will be added overtime through the season pass too.\n\n----------\nPvP: Currently we have 3 PvP modes and 2 maps per mode.\nCapture: Three points exist on the map to be controlled by the teams, there is limited currency available on these maps and many people will use lower-ranked gear to compensate for this.\n\nIncursion: Each team has two sentries that guard a part of their base. Teams are to push through enemy defenses and destroy the enemy sentry. Getting mercenaries to aid in your push is vital, along with appropriate timing and a good balance of offense/defense. There is often an abundance of currency available and you can use your best gear loadouts.\n\nMeltdown: You must escort your minions to specific areas to sacrifice them, gaining favor with Minrec. This is a balance of protecting your own minions, while destroying the enemy minions before they reach their destination. Two lanes will exist, leading to teams needing to divide their forces appropriately to ensure both lanes are protected. Currency is also abundant here, allowing you to bring good loadouts.\n\nGearbox has already stated they will be releasing more maps and game modes in the future. They've revealed some concept art for map designs.\n\n5 new heroes are being added over time, these heroes will be available to everyone, but must be unlocked.\n\nWe already have one added, Alani.\n\n-------\n\nBalancing:\n\nGearbox has handled balancing characters with a steady hand. They are careful not to fall into the hole like many other PvP games do, where they overnerf a character and destroy their viability. Instead, Gearbox makes adjustments over time and sees the community reaction, then adjusts further if they feel it is needed. This progressive balancing has made me greatly appreciate their methods, as one of my favorite characters was subject to this balance. Ambra is still as viable as ever and still remains very strong.\n\nSo if you're afraid a favorite character of yours will be subject to overzealous nerfs, do not fear. Gearbox has taken the right approach in how to balance.\n\n--------\n\nMatchmaking:\nI'm seeing a lot of negativity over this, and I feel like it was unwarranted, because it is something that can and HAS been improved on.\nMatchmaking utilizes an invisible ELO rating for players, but did not originally account for Command Rank(which only reflects how -LONG- you have played the game).\nThis led to people who are command rank 10, who have a somewhat unimpressive ELO getting paired with people of command rank 70 with similar ELO.\n\nWhile this still sometimes occurs, it is rare that they are not equally skilled.\nMatchmaking has seen quite a few improvements so far and it has done well for improving the quality of each match.\nPremades now have a priority to be paired with other premades; preventing "pubstomps" from being common place and instead putting you up against a team with equally reliable communication.\n\nMatchmaking itself has improved as well, leading to more equally skilled teams in public matches. This has been great for me, as I commonly queue alone or with a single friend.\n\n------\n\nCharacters:\nGearbox did a superb job here, creating a wide array of characters with countless personality, background lore, and playstyles. We have disruptors, support, tanks, brawlers, assassins, rescuers, snipers, and territorials. And with some of these roles being mixed into single characters, this leads to even more unique plays by these Battleborn.\n\nLore:\nEvery character has specific lore challenges attached to their character. By finishing off a challenge for their lore, you gain access to tidbits of lore about the character. Each character has a unique audio log to unlock too. By unlocking all lore challenges for a character, you gain access to a piece of gear tailored specifically for that character. They're often quite strong or they change how you play.\n\nHelix:\nThe helix system is what allows you to further define your build every time you level up. It gives you 2 choices each level, or 3 if you unlock a mutation(done by playing a character often). These choices augment abilities that affect how they can function, ultimately allowing you to fine-tune your role.\n\nCustomization:\nCurrently there are 5+ taunts for every character in the game, some are unlocked through playing the character often, one is always from lore, and the others come from Loot Packs which you can earn or buy for ingame currency.\n\nThere are also skins which change up the colors for each character, some are from Loot Packs, most are from playing a character often. While these are just recolors, players have found new skins that are called "Tier 2" by Gearbox. These skins are more unique as they do more than just a simple recolor. Gearbox has also mentioned creating Tier 3 skins, which may change the character appearance greatly.\n\n------\n\nFinal thoughts:\nCurrently, I'm deeply enjoying this game and am happy with my purchase. I paid full price for the Digital Deluxe and would do it again in a heart beat.\n\nMy only gripes currently would be quite minimal.\nSome players sometimes treat PvP matches like Team Deathmatch, which causes the actual objectives to be ignored. While they may get a fancy K/D ratio, the team will ultimately lose. But this is simply how some people operate, you'll find this behavior in -every- game.\n\nA bit more communication about upcoming changes would be great, especially if they're posted for people to clearly see.\nMost people didn't know about the matchmaking improvements, as they weren't posted everywhere for people to see. This could quell some of the doomsayers who assume nothing has changed. As well as let the community know what Gearbox's next step(s) are for everything they're doing.\n\nOverall, I believe this is a great game and recommend anyone who loves Gearbox's humor, wild character design, and gameplay to give this game a shot. It's a solid title that has been overshadowed by competitor marketing and has a great community behind it.\n\nThanks for reading my review and I hope it helps you make your purchasing decision.","June 2","true","260.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Is it worth yuor 60 bucks? It's complicated. I got 25% off through greenman gaming website. I also like Moba style games, and borderlands. Will this game feel like borderlands....yes, but the story and replay value will be nothing like borderlands because they focus on the pvp gameplay. Story is charming, but not at the level of even the worst story missions in all borderland's games. Issues: no advance difficulty matchmacking...So you have to grind normal difficulty, or you have to have friends and create your own 5 man party, or go solo...upsetting to me. PVP is not my thing. I like it but I have to learn the maps and characters = time not playing, or playing and losing. I dont like to lose lol. So is it worth getting because it is still in the (sort of) universe of borderland... yes, but get it on sale. Do not pay full price. Is it fun? yes, for a time. Then you fall into a loop that smells like teen spirit for pve, and pvp is maybe not everyones cut of cake.","May 7","true","50.7"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","24","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004818404/recommended/394230/","76561198004818404","{GScaleG} Braxia","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004818404/","75 products in account","Bare with me please. This is my first review of a game:\n\nBattleborn, first and foremost, is a MOBA that attempts to be a shooter at the same time but fails at both. While it has it's fair share of strengths (most notably its signature Gearbox charm of a vibrant world and setting coupled with Borderlands brand humor) It's weaknesses far outweigh those strengths.\n\nThe best way for me to review this would be to cover each of its key points seperately. It's competetive multiplayer, Overview of game mechanics, and It's singleplayer/Co-op story mode.\n\n1: The Game as a whole:\nBattleborn's core controls and mechanics are pretty solid, easily feeling like they were built off of that of Borderlands meaning for an easy to adjust to playstyle for fans of Gearbox. However Gearbox delved into melee based combat for a first person shooter. A difficult act to manage and they fell short. (Borderlands allowed players to focus on melee, but at least those characters could resort to range when needed)\n\nNow they did try, and had a good idea, They failed to see why that good intended idea fell short.  Too much happens on the screen, and if you want to play Melee (which is a large number of the 2 dozen character choices) You're going to have a bad time trying to follow what's happening. You can see everything your characters see, but that mean that often too much takes up the screen for you to reliably follow the action in front of you.  And while melee has a high damage output, this is only in a short burst against a single Target. This means that for the increased HP of enemies and the scaled up difficulty, you can't play melee unless you have a whole team to back you up.\n\n2: Competetive Multiplayer:\nMatchmaking is horrid. I am just going to state that first. But 20 minute wait times only to recieve an unbalanced team match up isn't truely a concern when compared to the rest.  The Competetive Multiplayer mode is where most the game's short comings come to light.\n\nBattleborn has three Multiplayer games modes, with mediocre map selection.  As a MOBA, in order to play Battleborn well you need to think and strategize as you would LOL, Heros of the Storm, or Dota. However, Battleborn looks and feels like a shooter instead. As a result you get the worst of both worlds instead of one.  On the MOBA side.  Too much is going on during combat, and this makes it even harder to plan and strategize because given a first person perspective of their character, the Player looses sight of important things they may see in any other Top down MOBA. Plus in a MOBA, players  often have to focus on how much damage one combo or maneuver will do. but Given the FPS aspects, that damage is no longer guaranteed. as it is very easy to miss a shot, rendering your MOBA stratgies nearly worthless.\n\nIf you move to the shooter side though, The MOBA aspects ruin it just as shooter concepts  ruined the MOBA side.  A large portion of shooters are fast paced action, and Your attacks, since they have a chance to miss given your skill level, should hold weight when you land them. But instead in the typical MOBA Fashion, there are no true rapid kills. MY own experience would serve as a great example.\n\nI am an avid sniper, I have great aim and in Battleborn I am proud to say I rarely miss critical hit points. and the whole satisfaction of a sniper, is to stay back, and get one kill per shot fired. but thanks to Battleborn's MOBA side, my Rifle can't take anyone down in one shot, let alone several in most occassions. This means that all my sniper skills go to waste, and hold no weight in the tide of battle. This fact held true for several of the other characters I played as. It may play like a shooter, but your skills mean almost nothing.\n\n3: Single Player/Co-op story mode\nThe story mode is disappointing.  While it is the most fun aspect of the game, and I enjoy playing it with friends, it is still weak thanks to the rest of the game's shortcomings. The environments and maps are nice to look at, and I found myself enjoying mowing down the... less than varied enemy types. in the first 7 missions, each boss was different to enough of a degree that they felt fresh each time.  None of the missions felt too long  but some did feel they would get tedious seeing as they kept recycling many of the same elements over and over again.  However, the 8th mission was disappointing.  they give you a rather unforgiving time limit that is tough to make. and then the final boss is a cop out.\n\nRather than give an interesting fight,  The battle just recycles the other 7 bosses from the game, and it becomes long and  annoying rather than fun. because what made each boss interesting becomes a painstakingly annoying  task when its paired with another boss with a similar concern. and the bosses were made tougher than their previous versions, making it even more frustrating.\n\nBack to the story, The characters all have their quirks, and the game has it's fair share of good humor. the plot falls short because Gearbox didn't really put much effort past the setting.  Each mission tries to pass as part of a bigger story, but it doesn't feel that way.  There is no timeline so missions can be done out of order, as you beat each one, you don't feel as if you have made "progress" in the story. leaving that aspect of the game unfullfilling.\n\n\nNow... I think I covered everything I wanted to say, and I hope people find this useful. forgive my poor structure and the like, as I said this is my first review for a game I had really expected more out of.\n\n(Addition from MeridianWarlord)\nDon't forget the part about the game being 90% locked behind a progression wall. The absolutely Horrendous matching system along with the fact you get matched against people that are anywhere from 70-100 lvls higher than you which means they have access to elite loot boxes when you dont for your item loadouts. The fact that you only get 6 characters at the beginning of the game and it literally takes HOURS to get the rest. Not bad for a full priced AAA game if you ask me. But don't you think it sounds a great deal like a free to play platform? But thats right, we all picked up this lovely gem for $60 bucks. Hey isnt Overwatch only 40 and you get all the characters right away? wow maybe this game doesnt look so great when its put that way.","May 20","false","19.8"," 43 of 81 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","43","81","0","1"

So pretty! The combat is fast and fun and even a horrible horrible casual noob type like me can have a great time with this game. I've put in about 5 or 6 hours so far and am only just beginning to unlock the many characters and different gear types and figuring out the skill tree, and character playstyles. So far everything seems very solid, and I'm having a blast. AMD users have been warned about the frame rate issues, but as an AMD user myself, I haven't had much of an issue with this honestly..and I'm not running any more than your typical entry level gaming rig with an r7 card and a quad core processor.\n\nI've played a fair amount of other FPS games and most of them really do not click with me, this includes Gearbox's other franchise with Borderlands. That game I found to be just too difficult from the start, and maybe thats because I never played more than solo games, or with players who made me seem like a competant gamer in comparison, but this has a far better balance for me...which may be a negative for some of the more hardcore gamers...however there are higher difficulty ranks and vs modes for those who seek a real challenge.\n\nYou can't play offline and solo really does seem pointless, even to a weirdo like me who barely ever touches multiplayer games. I highly reccommend everyone with at least casual interest in this game to buy it and try it, and to remember that steam does allow you to return the game if you don't like it.","May 3","true","9.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has it's fans who that it really appeals to.  There is some depth here, but there are other issues atm that make me say it's average.  To many effects on screen sometimes it's confusing to tell where or what is killing you.  I know how to play MOBA's so that part is easy for me to grasp, but right now the best multiplayer mode is Meltdown imo.  The traditional MOBA map has some issues where certain characters can kill your tower (sentries) very easily which just really ruins the fun of picking different hero's, because you are forced to counter pick or attempt to anyway these 3 or 4 heros often with heros very similar or exact copies.","May 10","true","109.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Well, that's where people are wrong. Battleborn has the OPTION for you to play it as a MOBA, but you don't have to. You can do story missions in public lobbies, with friends, or just by yourself. So there is PvE and PvP content. The PvP isn't just "MOBA-styled" either; there are different PvP games that you can play that make it less of a MOBA (like capture maps where you capture points instead of taking out enemy resources/defenses).","May 5","true","201.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is not an arena shooter, though, and since many people aren't used to anything else, that may come as a surprise.","May 9","true","41.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

All of the online versus modes are unique twists on the MOBA formula that breathe life into the essentially unchanged Warcraft 3 map, Meltdown being my particular favorite.\n\nThe ticket price is high, at $60, but I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth, and with enough support from Gearbox, Battleborn will be a comfortable well played favorite for years to come.","May 5","true","66.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Battleborn is an FBS/MOBA hybrid--it takes twitch shooting SKILLS and mechanics from the world of competitive FPS games, and takes battle TACTICS and long-term planning from the MOBA genre. I'll explain why I like these especially and why they come together to make a great competitive game.\n\nBut first, let's talk about what you get. Unlike other multiplayer games, you don't even have to play multiplayer to get a "full game" experience. Battleborn has 8 story missions, with 5 more planned as DLC, which last about 30-40 minutes. This means the game is completed in about 4 to 6 hours if you're quick. It doesn't sound like too much, but there are 25 characters to play as (with 5 more coming as free DLC over the next few months), which gives HUGE replay value, in my opinion. Several of these characters have to be unlocked as you progres through the game, but I never found this to be a huge problem. I really enjoy the Story mode, and have put a ton of time into it. $60 is a bit steep for JUST the story experience, but for me it's worth it. To others it might not be.\n\nHowever, you ALSO get the entire multiplayer experience as well, which is why I think Battleborn is such a great value. And it's a very unique multiplayer experience at that.\n\nCOD/other "arena" shooters focus on kills. There can be other objectives, but generally the team with more kills is going to win no matter what. Class-based shooters like TF2 help remedy this by provide roles for characters to fill, such as healing and logistics in the Medic and Engineer classes. This lets players contribute without having the best deathmatch skills.\n\nIn battleborn, it's never about kills. The primary objective is minions; if you're not taking out minions, then you're not contributing to your team. Killing minions sounds dull at first for an FPS, but the fact that the enemy team is also there adds a huge amount of strategy. You can rush into the opponent's base and kill two of their teammates, and in the process be killed yourself. But by overextending you might have allowed the enemy minions the cross over your lines; now your team is at a disadvantage. Minions are the central game mechanic, but PvP combat is still important. Once a player fight has begun then your FPS skills come into play, which is something I dislike about other MOBAs--they don't seem skill-based, to me.\n\nBut there's other factors about the combat to consider too. You need to manage resources, and build turrets to keep your defenses up. This lets players without FPS skills contribute to the team as well. You might have a 1-12 KDR, but you can still be the most important player on your team. Both of these genres have been blended together to create something really original. Your knowledge of battlefield strategy will tell you WHEN to push, and your FPS skills will help you win the push when it happens.\n\nI haven't personally had experience with it, but there have been reports of graphical problems on AMD cards. Matchmaking can also be a bit of a problem, though, depending on time of day and how many players there are. In my opinion, it's worth it for the matches, and gearbox has been very open about continued support for improving matchmaking and performance as the game goes on.","June 2","true","73.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Artificial_Intel/recommended/394230/","Artificial_Intel","Ragnasal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Artificial_Intel/","178 products in account","I'm not going to lie. This game has a very Borderlands/Anthony Burch-tier humor style in its writing, and at some points it can be grating. And yet at other points, it can be fun and fitting. I consider it its lowest point in terms of story, which is sad considering the amount of effort Gearbox goes to force its humor in your face.\n\nThere, now that my one major quirk with the game is taken care of; lets get on with the good parts.\n\nHero Selection:\nPretty damned amazing. You start off with a sizeable roster that is pretty varied in roles. Almost feels moba-ish, in which there's support, tanks, and DPS. Many of the characters in the game need to be unlocked, not from a paywall but from an achievement/challenge perspective. Usually it's pretty simple: Level your account to hit the rank needed to play the character, or do various secondary challenges (Kill 50 players, get Silver medals on all story missions, play five times as one faction) in order to unlock them.\n\nPVE:\nStory writing aside, I have quite a few complaints with how the mission roulette is set. You either have to play with a band of four people you know in order to select a mission you need to complete (Saboteur or Heliophage come to mind), or you need to solo queue and hope one of the three randomized missions that pops up is one of the few you need.\nThankfully Gearbox countered this by letting you play a private session where you're able to select which story mission to progress from, where you're gated to the highest level mission you've completed. As of this review, I have still yet to complete Saboteur and Heliophage because I have no friends (kill me fam).\n\nPVP:\nWhat an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. This is where class balance is shown to not have been a major consideration in Gearbox's head. Many heros perform underwhelmingly in PVP, while others can pretty much solo every class without a challenge.\nAnd what PVP modes they do have, they don't have a really intrinsic guide on what the bloody Hell you're supposed to be doing. Sure they give that mini-tutorial at the start of the match, but all the intricacies of the map are just left to the players best guess.\nOf all the PVP matches I've played, it's usually been either an hour long standoff in the middle of the map because their healers are just blatantly keeping everyone topped up forever, or its an absolute stomp because one team is missing a healer or tank.\nSolution: Buff everyone.\n\nTL;DR: The game has a wide selection of heroes to play, a decent loot system, a subpar PVE storyline, and absolutely craptastic PVP. Still a lot of persistent bugs and glitches that need to be ironed out as well as a major rebalancing of PVP. It is indeed still one of Gearbox's better releases if compared to Borderlands or (god's sake) Aliens: Colonial Marines.\nA good note is that it's less 'meme-y' than Borderlands, if that kind of humor makes you cringe.","May 8","true","27.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I have not completed the story, so I can not give a full review on it. However, the story definately deserves a 10/10 specifically for originality.\n\nMultiplayer Rating: 8.5/10\n\nPros\n\nExcellent character design\nExclusive maps to each game mode\nGood combat mechanics (See recommendations and cons)\nNice visuals for the genre (See recommendations)\nUnique and fun building mechanic\nMinions are spot-on\nCons\n\nThe game still feels like it's in the Beta stage (See summary)\nGood communication requires a headset (See recommendations)\nOften times, combat will feel like a controller is necessary (See recommendations)\nRegardless of accessories being being personally recommended, the game still feels more comfortable on PC rather than console\nRecommendations\n\nThis is specifically aimed at the dev team for Battleborn and included for players' imaginations.\n\nInclude a tactical map for objective planning and ping focused communication\nSkills/Spells are often much too flashy to a point where damage-only abilities double as a blinding CC\nThe chatbox feels forced into the game as a third-party UI; find a way for it to blend better and be more accessible\nAs the combat is focused on FPS mechanics, it is hard to react as quickly as a controller user; and with the visuals of blinding abilities, this can simply be fixed by adding a Third-Person camera option to better optimize combat\nOverall, the multiplayer still feels like it's in the beta stage. There are so many things that can be done to improve the player's experience other than the balancing of heroes; which quite frankly, will probably need updates pretty frequently if Gearbox decides to take the 'Unbalanced Balance' approach. I definately do not ever want to see that idea incorporated, but with the MOBA genre, it is an extremely popular trend. Just don't get your hopes up.\n\nI have also taken into consideration that this game is still new and will probably be in for an aging developmental process that MOBA gamers are familiar with; hence, the positive recommendation.\n\nDo not be afraid to get your hands on Battleborn so soon. It will take time, but I'm confident in Gearbox's ability to deliver an outstanding multiplayer game. If you are afraid to spend the $60 - $75, just give this game some time to grow. Come back in a couple months to catch up with its improvements so you can make your decision then.","May 9","true","32.4"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","26","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charlett/recommended/394230/","Charlett","Charlett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charlett/","44 products in account","Battleborn was almost a sort of impulse buy for me.  I enjoyed the lore that the Borderlands games set up, despite not playing them, and while I wanted to save money by buying the cheaper Borderlands games, it was at that very moment that Battleborn was released.  I found some people who were enjoying the game, and the promise of PVE was what sold it for me, hands down.  Other games such as Team Fortress 2 tend to require you to have many, many people to play with, with either queues or servers that have random, ever changing rules.  Even the PVE in those games tend to require upwards of 5-7 people to complete, especially for those who were just playing to have fun.\n\nAs such, Battleborn quickly became a favorite for me.  I play PVP when I'm in a team of three or four friends, and when I'm playing alone, I queue up for PVE.  On normal difficulty in PVE, I can group up with only one or two random people, and even without communication, I've learned how each map works enough to get through without too much trouble.  It's become incredibly fun for me, despite me only having an hour or two a day to play on weekdays.  The PVE stories might not be the most amazing novels in the world, but Gearbox has dialed back the memes and brought us a slightly darker story that seems lighter from the fact that every character is a little crazy fun in their own way.  Every one of the 25 characters has two or three dimensions to them, usually displayed through their "lore" that is unlocked mostly through just playing the game.  Some are harder to get than others, but it is really much fun to do them as a goal to work towards as you play, rather than focusing solely on collecting them as quickly as possible.\n\nThere are three different PVP modes to play, and while the "Incursion", that is, the MOBA style mode, is the most popular, there are two others that can be played as well.  There's the "Capture" mode that is similar to more WoW/FF14 style PVP, that is, holding land and defending it from attackers.  Then there's Meltdown, which I've found to be fairly unique among Multiplayer PVP.  It's all about destroying your enemy's LoL-style minion waves while protecting your own.  The more robot minions you save (and then subsequently sacrifice to robot junkyard god Minrec) the faster you win.  It's really fast paced and tons of fun, if not a little crazy and hard to do without proper communication.\n\nWhile there's lots of fun things to do and the replayability is high (with both PVP and PVE to keep you occupied), there's always bad things to every game.  Despite the game touting 25 characters that don't cost anything, only about 7 are available straight out the gate, and the characters you play in the prologue aren't even part of this initial team.  The game claims that there's a character for every type of player, but if you prefer to be a tanky melee character, you're stuck playing a tanky ranged or squishy melee until the character you need opens up to you.  Technically this isn't so bad; just playing through the entire PVE storyline should net you enough characters to find your niche pretty well, if not completely so.  It only took me about a week to unlock all but six characters, and my two mains are already among them.\n\nOverall, I find that Battleborn is money well spent, even with the retail price tag.  If you're a little stingy compared to me (Who is probably not going to buy another game at all this year), then just wait until a sale!  Please try this game out; saving stars have never been more tense or more hysterical!","May 29","true","66.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This is an actual MOBA like game (at least in it's gameplay and feel). When you play this, you must keep in mind that this is not just a FPS game, it is like a MOBA and needs to be treated as such. If you like the humor from Borderlands, you will LOVE this game since there is a huge amount of that here too. It has a prologue mission and eight story missions to complete on normal or advanced. And if you think advanced is just a little tougher, I will let you know from just beating the final level on advanced that it is super tough and brutal. It took a full party of five of us an hour to beat the last level on advanced. It's rough and punishing. Overall, a fantastic game with fun multiplayer as well with creative modes that will only get better as time goes with more updates and patches. Also, they said that all the other modes and maps and the remaining five extra add-on characters will be free to all players. I love it and I think more people need to know about this amazing gem that due to Overwatch's publicity and advertising has gotten swept under the rug a bit.

Key binds are confusing, but once you find what is what it's simple enough. Unlocking the characters, thier lore, skins and taunts makes doing things a certain way feel fun and gives you a challenge. Voices are unique compared to other characters being played and your surroundings. The characters interact with each other in unique ways which makes the game funny. The sense of humour in the game is the same as Borderlands, so expect sarcastic wit. Voices are also recognizable from the Borderlands series (Orendi - Tiny Tina, Benedict - Scooter, etc. etc.). Art style is clean and unique also (I'm using unique a lot haha!). Each character feels different and bring something to the table, but each also has thier own limitations.\n\nStoryline is easily repeatable, but you will need a group for the harder missions or at least a group that can communicate. This game is definitely better with friends, unless you're just PVPing. Story mode, you will want to find people to try and finish them all.\n\nPVP is fun and challenging. Very limited on maps and modes, 3 modes - each with having 2 maps, but that doesn't bother me much. Each mode is vastly different though which gives you your own choice of what you want to do. MOBA style, escort style and capture points. Each feels different and requires different strategies which is nice.\n\nOverall a good game. Needs a bit more maps and overall content, but the amount of characters out is nice. Also, the company keeps updates churning out as players request certain things. They listen to their consumers, which is a big plus (such as with the prologue not being replayable).","May 10","true","30.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I got a lot of fun out of Smite and this looked like a great FPS version of that with the added bonus of Borderlands-style art and humor.\n\nBut this game is a waste of money. The PvE can be enjoyable the first or second time through but after that, it is a complete snorefest. And it's pretty much required for PvP because it's the best way to get gear. Just buy gear packs with the in-game currency, you say? Well in one of the most inane decisions of game development history, the better packs (with a higher chance for good gear) are LOCKED BEHIND A LEVEL REQUIREMENT. That makes no sense at all. I've got like 20k credits that I just won't spend because I don't have the gear packs unlocked that have high chances of epic/legendary gear.\n\nThe PvP is a complete joke. It's not the mechanics of it that suck, but the realization of the game. The playerbase on PC is abysmal, which results in terrible matchmaking experiences. You'll be a fresh player with little going on for you going against people with 150+ hours logged. These people have better gear than you do. These people have all of their helix mutations unlocked. And they have experience playing the game. It isn't fun. In the 10 hours or so of PvP I've played, I have had exactly ONE fair match. Otherwise it is just one team stomping the other and then an 8-10 minute surrender.\n\nBalance is ♥♥♥♥. Some heroes are just completely faceroll and those are often the heroes being picked by those people with 150+ hours. They just ♥♥♥♥ all over the new players and the match is completely ruined. You can't even just pick those heroes and be on an equal field because again, you won't have the good gear for them and you won't have the helix choices unlocked. So you'll just be a lesser version and you'll still get beat out.\n\nThis game will die. It's a shame but there's too much bad to save it because the playerbase is going to quickly atrophy to the point where good match making will be impossible. Save your money and pass on this one.","May 15","false","22.3"," 147 of 284 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","147","284","5","5"

I’ve played most 3 or 4 times and there is no clever mechanics or random encounters or enemy group configurations in there to shake things up. The humor is well done… but how often can you hear the same cheesy lines?\n\nPVP is no fun to me. Due to resigning people on my or the enemy team as soon as they feel they are going to lose. Also bugs / mistakes like; giving certain characters unfair advantages / options on some maps, take to long to be fixed. That is if you can find a game, which takes FAR to long.\n\nThe roster of heroes looks impressive, but only a few will fit your playstyle, cutting down on that number. Also unlocking some of them is quite a bit of work, that is what it feels like to me now at least. The additional "free" heroes are also locked behind an ingame-credit paywall, which makes it feel like a F2P title, but nice twist: You got to pay a fair amount for it.\n\nI’ve about 17 hours played, but about 3 to 5 hours of that of that was waiting and investing in failed missions (like people being an ♥♥♥ and failing a PvE mission on purpose near the end).\n\nI’ve had some fun, but don’t feel I got my monies worth and that’s weird.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmarksman/recommended/394230/","jmarksman","Pietro Maximoff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmarksman/","456 products in account","Battleborn is a fun mix of MOBA and Borderlands. It's great for people who don't really enjoy the more traditional MOBA titles available. The singleplayer is fun and interesting, combining the MOBA style of starting fresh of abilities every match or mission with the fun shooting style of Borderlands and Borderlands 2. I highly recommend this game to anyone whom enjoys MOBAs, or enjoyed the Borderlands series but is looking for something somewhat similar with new mechanics.\n\nThe campaign is fun both solo and co-op. It has enough interesting characters to hold your interest. It's story is told very much like Borderlands 2, with someone talking in your ear most of the time. It has Borderlands-esque boss intros with a freeze-frame and title card. The loot in the game has been changed significantly from any BL title, now coming in "Packs." You open these to create a loadout of three gear pieces which you can then purchase using "shards" once in a mission or multiplayer match. This fits the multiplayer focus of the game, and makes it fun to plan your purchases to be more effective throughout the mission.\n\nThe multiplayer is the real gem of the game. It's phenomenal. It does everything right. With a whopping 25 "Heroes" to choose from, it won't be hard to find something new to try if you tire of one hero. Three gamemodes, each with two maps makes for a variety of fun to be had. Incursion, which is the most MOBA-like of the game modes is super fun and satisfying when played with a good team. You must push with your minion waves to destroy the two Sentry-Bots in the enemy's base before they do the same to you. In Meltdown you must send your minions to be sacrificed, earning points for each one that walks to their death. This gamemode features a more open map with a wider span of space to maneuver. The third is Capture. It's the only gamemode I have yet to play. You must defend your points while capturing the enemy's. Fairly self explainatory.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game so far and highly recommend it to anyone thinking about picking up a good multiplayer game that you can get competitive with or just chill out and play some campaign missions.","May 3","true","41.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

I now see that overall this is a mixed review game now which is a shame. Have they somewhat messed up matchmaking where your team is lower levels than the opposing? Ya, however I like the challenge I am a level 20 now and have seen where lower level teams still form well and defeat higher ranked people, they arent Gods they have weaknesses also. I still enjoy the hell out of it I go through every once and a while and do some of the campaign solo with different charecters, I enjoy doing versus bots even honestly, and versus against other people is fun if people stop being negative as you rank up it gets easier to play agasinst the higher skilled players. Also some people dont understand go play bots get decent and rank up then go play pvp and it will be more fun and it will be more fair.\n\n\n\nWOW!!!! First off I want to review both the campaign and the multiplayer. The campaign is really amazing. I am not going to give anything away let’s just say if you like borderlands humor, art style then you will enjoy the campaign. The way you level up your character and can play multiple characters adds the replay value of some of the levels, all the characters that I have played so far have very different play styles which adds to that replay value. They claimed that no character plays the same which I would have to say so far that is absolutely right. Graphics are amazing, mechanics are very smooth like a game should be. And the story is intriguing. I don’t want to give anything else away about the campaign. Now for the multiplayer let me say FINALLY this is a moba game that I can actually really enjoy. They did such an amazing job mixing moba and fps games. The multiplayer is really fun. People that don’t enjoy the moba style I still recommend this game; I think that you would be able to enjoy this style of multiplayer. Plus, even if you don’t absolutely love the multiplayer the campaign missions are coop so you can still play the missions with friends which I would say the game is still worth picking up. The people that created borderlands made this. If you like their games, you will enjoy this. Now back to the multiplayer for people that love moba, or think moba isn’t bad you will love this game I believe. I preordered this and overwatch, and I have a feeling that these games are going to hurt the Heroes of the Storm, and the League of legends, and Dota 2 crowds if those gamers have always wished that they could take their character into first person. Playing in first person makes this fps moba game so much more immersive. I feel like this game will be one I spend a lot of time playing.

I ENJOYED PLAYING THIS GAME! IT IS A FUN EXPERIENCE\n\nThe MOBA - FPS gameplay is fun! The character designs are awesome. The humor in the game is what you'd expect from Borderlands, not that its a bad thing. Playing with friends is, of course, a far better experience, but regardless, its still fun to play with strangers.\n\nUnfortunately, the way things are going for Battleborn, I can't recommend it. On the first few weeks of playing, there were already issues with connectivity. Oceania players have been having troubles with connecting to a game, with wait times lasting as long as 15 - 20 minutes, and when they do get put into a game, the match ends up being very unbalanced with players being teamed up with others that are either complete beginners or long playing veterans.\n\nThere have also been issues regarding performance. Certain levels in the game can even strain the highest performing gaming rigs. This results in players choosing certain levels in PVP. If this isn't an issue for you then fine, but playing on the same levels time and time again for the sake of keeping a solid frame rate can get a bit tedious. Can't enjoy a nice juicy steak if that's all you're ever gonna eat. Sometimes you want a cheeseburger... or something. Whatever, bad example.\n\nI'm sure that theese issues will be solved in future patches.\n\nWith the game going for 40% off after only being out for 3 WEEKS, I'd say buy it, but at full price, it just isn't worth it.\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, buy it during a sale. Otherwise, set aside Battleborn and buy O-...ther games that are well worth their full price.","May 28","false","81.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","11","19","6","0"

It's beyond me how you can fail this hard when you use Unreal already. The framerate fluctuates between 120/30 on a Titan X, no matter the settings, same goes for a 750. Its simply a joke.\n\n- The art style might be a matter of taste the complete over saturation of effects and colors is not. It's hard to see anything but a jumbled mess of color vomit for what feels like  50%+ of the game.\n\n- Collision detection is also a joke, you get stuck on the tiniest pebble or the most common corner on any map. Some hero models are obnoxiously large and friendly players block you just as often as not.\n\n- Hero balance is another matter. Its not as broken as the rest of the game but it's not in a ready to release state.\n\n- Maps are exploitable by certain champions. And the moba like game mode feels like no one ever played it pre release. Pushing is close to impossible (unless you have really bad opponents) and games usually end after the timer runs out.\n\n- Matchmacking is a joke. I have seen streams where 5 streamers with account levels ranging from 3 to 25 get matched against teams of professional players THREE TIMES IN A ROW.\nFor me I haven’t played an enjoyable game yet it's always a complete stomp and games almost always end in an early FF. The only question is whether you stomp or get stomped.\n\nTo top it off with a cherry, should you (and every friend you played with) be "unlucky" enough to play during a server restart/shutdown you will get a useless "inventory timeout" message and won't be able to start a new game or sign into your account again until you account times out.\n\nThey have 5 DLCs planned already on top of a full AAA price. While things like OW go for 40 bucks FLAT and Paladins will be simply free by HiRez.\nThis game is not worth full price, hardly so in a working state which this game is not in at the time of this review.","May 15","false","35.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Seriously, its super bland, every single character is just a bland character archetype like "Soldier Man" or "Healing Monk". The "Single player", if I can even call it that, is INCREDIBLY inflated, each mission taking upwards of 30 minutes of either escorting, capturing a point and defending it, or other boring gametype.\n\nHere is the main issue of the single player: It depends on the story and characters to make the levels exciting and bearable, but when the story is about as boring as a piece of white bread, and the character are about as exciting as toilet water? Its just 30 minutes of killing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over and over until you cant stand to see game again. I actually felt my brain melting out of my ears because it is just SO BLAND. Its just Borderlands with NONE of the character charm or "loot", meaning you are marching through single player just to get an incredibly small amount of EXP for the character you are playing as and your "rank", which unlocks more characters for single and multiplayer.\n\nOh, its also a moba where you can get matched up against level 98s within the first 5 minutes of play if you are level 1, and its basically down to luck if you get a match around your skill.\n\nIm done with Gearbox. ♥♥♥♥ you, Pins.","May 23","false","5.0"," 34 of 64 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","34","64","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/recommended/394230/","Illius19616","Illius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/","88 products in account","Look, full disclosure. I'm "Not Recommending" the game NOT because it's not fun. I enjoy it. It's fun, especially when you play with friends. I'm "Not Recommending" it because there are way too many glaring issues that make the price simply ridiculous. Alright? On with the review.\n\nBattleborn is a Hero Shooter where you pick one of many characters, each with their own role to the team. There are various forms to play (which I'll go over each indivdually soon):\nPvP:\n-Meltdown; where you escort minions to the enemy base, trying to score more points before your opponent to reach a goal or have more points at time out.\n-Incursion: you push into enemy territory to destroy their Sentry Robots.\n-Capture Zones: Multiple capture areas appear, and you must control them to gain points, and first team to reach enough points wins.\nIn total at time of writing there are 2 maps for each mode.\n\nAnd then there's PvE Campaign, with multiple chapters going across the story.\n\n\nIn terms of raw gameplay, it plays decently well. Each character has their role, and they do it well. I personally wouldn't mind at least 1 more healer support (out of the supports in the game, only 1 is reliable at healing, others seem to be simply outshined by this 1), but other than some clunky kits character kits generally just make sense.\n\nHowever that's raw gameplay. Actual interactions with the game is different.\n\nFirst I'll go over the PvP:\n-For me, Meltdown is the only game-mode that plays well (and even then, one map feels as though it has a weird layout, but that may be just me). You have an advantage on your end of the map and need to take the risk to shove in, while maintaining general map control. It plays well and has a nice objective form, allowing every hero to shine at some point in the map.\n-Incursion feels like it promotes snowballing way too much. You get 2 Sentry Robots, but I find that unless you kill the opponents within a short time frame of your own dying, if you lose your outer robot, you lose all map control. This is due to a few reasons: First you lose the easy access to money and buildings. Two, you can buy out opponent buildings in their base (a non-existant issue in Meltdown), meaning that you get even more map control. Three: You get a massive height advantage which anybody who's played hero shooters before will tell you is crippling. Four: Destroying a Sentry Unit spawns stronger minions, making your push even harder, despite having to go farther. Despite the fact you are at your own base you have almost every disadvantage possible if you lose your Sentry, including you can't even take your own personal objectives (Such as mercenary camps) simply because they destroyed your first unit. Overall it feels like while it had promise there are too many issues that it makes one push a game decider even though you don't have to push far.\n-Capture Zones just doesn't seem to fit well into the game for me. Given that most characters are offense or hold oriented (even if they are supporting, they support the above two), it feels weird having to DEFEND and objective instead of counter pushing, in a game like this.\n\nNow for campaign. To me it's simply a mess. The first chapter is interesting, but after that it starts getting repetitive. Out of the 8 chapters, 2 are escort missions (Because those are fun, right?) and 3 are Defense Missions (you gotta hold an area). Bosses tend to drag out a LOT, and you get a scoring system (which is needed to unlock characters, unless you wanna grind levels out to get a full roster...) that doesn't seem reliable. I could do it flawlessly and get a worse score than screwing up multiple ways for "reasons".\nIn terms of a story, it's simply boring to me. The basic story is "Rendain has drug many stars into a void, and is going for the last one that everybody is at", which is interesting, but after that you have "We have built a machine, defend it" "We gotta save a prisoner" "Get this robot to the portal"... it's bland. Which is sad because they proved they had a potential for great story through the lore (which is a delight to read, let me say). The dialogue is pretty golden in the campaign, but while I get a good laugh, I find that I just... am not interested in the story which is bad for a story driven mode.\n\nIn terms of music... I can't remember even the title theme. It's suiting, not memorable music through the game.\n\nThe Gear System needs a special mention. You get gear by playing, and you can use the in-round currency to buy it to buff yourself for the rest of the round. The only problem is... you get no guarantees on what gear you can get. This means for optimal loadouts you are relying not on skill, or knowledge but rather luck. You should never have to rely on luck in a competitive game to be able to do as well as you can.\n\nIn terms of graphics, don't let the minimum requirements fool you. So many maps can and WILL cause visual lag on even pretty high end computers. It is poorly optimized, and it doesn't help when there is a large amount of visual noise making it hard to see what you are attempting to shoot at. Even a simple grenade can cause a massive fire-ball followed by a plume of smoke, and that can lose enemies more often than should.\nThat all said, the game itself has a very nice art style overall and it's a pleasure too look at outside of fire-fights.\n\nMatchmaking is also weird. You don't exactly "Choose" what maps you want to play. Rather you choose a game-mode (Including Campaign), and join with people who then vote to decide which map they want to play. While not inherently a bad thing, it does NOT work in Campaign, since excluding the final chapter you are both relying on luck to show a campaign you wish to do, and then that everybody wants to do that same campaign as well.\n\nIn terms of humor this game has quirky humor, but it almost always gets a chuckle out of me. They even thought of stuff such as attempting to access certain things before you are supposed to, which is pretty clever.\n\n\nSummaryA very fun game with a thouroughly enjoyable roster of characters who each have their own charm, It has some pretty quirky and entertaining humor as well. However Battleborn has a lot of issues to cause the price to be a major detriment. Most game-modes are poorly designed overall, and the campaign feels more like a chore to play. There is poor visual optimization, and the music is forgetable at best. I'd recommend it at anything but full price. There are too many problems that this game is not worth it at current price.","May 14","false","43.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

There are way better coop games out there that cost a lot less money.  Any of the Borderlands games (also made by gearbox) will provide a better coop experience than this game.  There are a total of eight story missions, and each one takes 20-30 minutes to play through.  So that's about 8 hours worth of gameplay before it get's boring.\n\nIn a full priced game I would expect to be able to play all of the characters from the beginning, but that's not the case here.  You have to reach a certain level for your account, or achieve certain milestones, to unlock most of the characters.  I would expect that kind of grind from a free to play title.\n\nOn top of that the characters are not very satisfying to play.  Their skills feel...meh, but hey at least the cool down timers are short so you can spam them relentlessly.\n\nThe PVP portion of the game....well just....no.  There are plenty of reviews and discussion threads that point out the many flaws (and there are MANY) in that game mode so I'll spare you.  There are too many other MOBAs out there that are well done and satisfying to play.\n\nIn short, don't waste your time or money on this game.\n","May 17","false","50.2"," 35 of 66 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","35","66","2","3"

I almost overlooked and didn’t buy it because I was influenced by those "rumors". As many others said in the reviews it’s a completely different deal of a game. It's first person + has "fun" themed characters, that's as far as the similarities go.\n\nAs much as the environment goes, I dig the cartoonish intro and the game theme (although I kinda feel it was to save money but the alternative came out pretty good).\n\nStill haven’t tried out every character but from what I understand they are pretty variable among them with fun choices.  The game itself kept me pretty busy with versus mode and although I rarely play single player I might give a few missions a try just to unlock some stuff faster (that’s a smart incentive to give to pvp people in order to play single player plus always having the choice to grind the same stuff through versus matches).\n\n\nAlso, to those saying that the game was "rushed", I will counter that a few things like detailed menu backgrounds, lack of character skins, a bit more polished interface etch. Are missing but I find the essential stuff are here, keeping a back-door on character balance since I haven’t tried out everyone yet. This is also reflected on the price since I find it a bit cheaper than most other titles (having 65euro for both game + season pass + some other stuff).\n\nOn a final note I find the game is a strict 8/10 with the potential to become a 9/10 with some good decisions on where its developmental resources go from now and on. Biggest disadvantage right now in my opinion is 2K being behind it. I really despise their corporate greed and after the Evolve fiasco I swore never to buy another game that they are involved in (but we all know I broke that promise ;)\n\nI will recommend it as of now.","May 11","true","37.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

The mechanics are interesting and they have combined a lot of awesome aspects from the genre to give it a good structure, collectable items, free skins, etc. Given time I'm sure it will become more polished and expand but as it stands, wait. I am terrible at this game to be fair, but match making is flat out terrible. level 20+ teams should not be fighting against people who are sub level 10. I want to like this game, I am trying. The storymode, which consists of 8-9 different 30min missions, is fun enough when you are in a full group.. But then again, you can drop with no penalty and start up a different game.\n\nOverall gameplay is pretty much chaos though. If you're great at knocking off crits and kiting, you'll be heavily rewarded. If not, you're terrible and deserve to go 0-10 because you screwed up early in the match and died trying to finish off the ranged with 10 hp and you're a stoopid melee and now you're level 3 while the other team has 2 level 7s who run a train on your whole team. Don't know how the XP works, but it's not my friend.\n\n(Also, the dialogue is funny-ish. If you were expecting borderlands-esque humor, it's there... everyone is Jack and each line attempts to be a one liner.)","May 8","false","36.0"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

Felt like more people where playing during open beta then now as a released game. Don't think its very successful and enjoyable as another game people like to compare it too. Plus I have alot more faith in that company to actually keep things balance and current than gearbox, which still hasn't fixed the horrendous matchmaking.

Pre-ordered during Open Beta.\n\nClaimer: Take some Borderlands, sprinkle more colour on top of everything, simmer on a slow flame slowly stirring in things from the MOBA cookbook. Let cool over a breeze of badassitude.\n\nEvil Aliens Are Eating Suns! More news at eight.\n\nThe leader of an arguably evil empire has struck a deal with otherworldly monster aliens to serve them rather than die at their hands and now the rest of his empire along with four other factions are forced to work together on a last stand at the last surviving star in the universe before it too goes out against their former ruler. Who wasn't even a real ruler, he just usurped the throne from a beloved Empress, the dastard.\n\nLike Borderlands, Battleborn takes every thinkable (and several unthinkable) reference and trope in sci-fi and fantasy and throws them into the blender to create its world - so you have more lunky awkward robots to laugh at and pound away, walking shout-outs and awesome walk-away-from-explosion scenes to enjoy. The visual side is seriously informed by saturday morning cartoons as evidenced by the badassful animated introduction that replaced the pre-rendered 3D animations of the Beta.\n\nUnlike Borderlands, Battleborn is built to focus on multiplayer. You can still do stuff solo - but it won't be "real" solo, as you'd be essentially playing co-op mode alone. Yes, it's always-online, but the retail version is yet to fail me even once on connection issues, whether in solo, co-op or competitive play.\n\nSo...\n\nMid, Lane, Carry, What Do These Words Mean? Coming to you live from the battlefield.\n\nCompetitive modes are variations on MOBA themes: there's a traditional "help minions (creeps, whatevs) traverse the landscape, reach objective, hurt objective", a variational "escort minions through the landscape so they can sacrifice themselves at an altar" and a "hmm, how about we actually CAPTURE some objectives?" mode, each with their own maps  (initial release comes with two maps for each mode).\n\nStory mode is eight-and-a-prologue huge Borderlands-ish levels offering 20 to 40 minutes of play (on average, depends on difficulty mode and the skill level of everyone involved) with lots of quippy dialogue some of which actively varies depending on party composition which should help a bit with replay value as you unlock more heroes.\n\nMOBA-style, there's gear that's sort of persistent between characters, which you obtain through an in-game store (only in-game currency, no MTs here!) or random drops in story missions, which you arrange into sets of three items and activate mid-game when you have enough energy shards (normally used to pay for in-mission things such as buildables, summonable allies and so on) -- providing balancing in the fact that awesomer gear is exponentially more expensive to activate.\n\nAnother balancing thing, you start each level - story or battle - at Lv1, and can progress up to Lv10, unlocking dual either-or upgrades at each level. As you play more as a single character, you may unlock extra either/or/or options for some levels, adding new build possibilities which may drastically change the way a character plays.\n\nSkipping all them long paragrahs in favor of long words, tho:It's an entertaining after-work time-burner that has enough capacity and variety to survive binge play, but its overall longevity will be highly dependant on whether the DLC packs will bring enough new content (aside from new characters, the plans are only to add five more) to make the game last long enough until Borderlands 3.\n\nMandatory disclaimer for people who cannot differentiate between Battleborn and Overwatch: Overwatch is the one with the worse hype-to-game-content ratio. Battleborn is the one that isn't a reskin of Team Fortress 2. Overwatch is the one that advertises inclusivity but doesn't bother confirming it. Battleborn is the one that demonstrates it. Overwatch is the one with the Pixar-style animated scenes. Battleborn is the one with the 2D-animated ones. Overwatch isn't on Steam. Battleborn is. Overwatch is from the guys that failed to bring you Warcraft Lord of the Clans. Battleborn is from the guys that brought you Duke Nukem Forev-- okay, I probably should've skipped that one.","May 8","true","21.3"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineCondor/recommended/394230/","DivineCondor","DivineCondor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineCondor/","68 products in account","Battleborn, a FPS-MOBA by Gearbox, the makers of the Borderlands Series. Thereby it presents you with the same fun humor we came to love from Borderlands.\nThe Game has so far been an amazing experience. I've bought the €64.99 Digital Deluxe (Game+Season Pass) edition\nand it was definitely worth my money.\n\nThe game is set in a universe that slowly gets swallowed by "The Void", an unknown force which is not really explained. With only one star remaining 5 faction gather around this star to fight of the Void.\nBut, one of these factions, The Jennerit, sides with the Void to secure their own survival. This faction will be our main enemy troughout the campaign.\n\nThat said, the game comes with a story mode and multiplayer.\n\nLet's begin with the story mode. Of course we should not expect some Telltale story telling, neither should you expect a linear story. The missions are all separate, independent missions accompagnied by some back story.\nYou could better describe it as a dungeon raid from MMO's, where you enter as a party of five (or less), complete some objectives and fight a final boss.\nIn my opinion this was the best way to go, as it makes it much more fun to replay the missions and try them on another difficulty level. And I suggest you replay them, because just like in dungeons in MMO's they drop loot, which can be used in the multiplayer. They also give you credits, an ingame currency (don't worry, there is no cash shop), and you can  complete challenges to unlock more Battleborn.\n\nMy overall score for Story Mode: 7.5/10\n\nThat brings us to multiplayer, the real selling point of the game.\nCurrently (08-05-2016, DD-MM-YYYY) there a 3 game modes in the game (not including multiplayer story mode): Incursion, Capture and Meltdown (you can read what they are in the game's description).\nEach mode has currently 2 different maps to chose from. I wish there where more maps, but I expect some to come out as dlc and included in the season pass.\nThere are also 25 characters to chose from (and 5 more announced). Most of them are locked via challenges, unlock them with relative ease.\nAs for the gameplay, I greatly enjoy it. The Characters are very well done, all very unique with really satisfying skills. When you start a match, your character starts at level 1. Throughout the match you level him to level 10 and each level you can choose an extra passive skill. When you play a character you also level it outside of the match, you go can up to level 15 and it unlocks skins, taunts and up to 5 extra passive skills you can choose from during a match. (It may seem it will give other players a benefit, but in the end you can only have up to 10 passive active skills and they don't have that much of an impact.)\nThe game also has a loadout system. It allows creating a loadout with 3 pieces of gear (collected through missions, or bought by credits), these gear pieces give little bonuses like movement speed, crit, healing etc. in story missions and multiplayer matches. Again it may seem like it will give people with better gear a benefit, but again, they don't have much impact. On top of that, during a match you need to buy your gear pieces with shards (something like gold in Dota) and of course the best pieces of gear cost the most.\nSo overall the multiplayer is amazing. There is only one problem, some battleborn (only 2) are a little unbalanced\nand are significant stronger than other, I expect it will be fixed in the upcoming patch, but it still is a error that\nshould not have been made.\n\nMy overall score for Multiplayer: 8.5/10\n\nI really recommend this game, and suggest if you pick it up, to get the season pass as well in order the benefit from all the dlc's.","May 8","true","20.9"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","24","45","0","0"

Simple. The games match making system is soooo horribly broken right now, you dont get to experience the "good" and "fun" part of the game very often.\n\nIn co-op mode, you will find yourself only being matched with 1 or 2 other players a lot of the time, rather than a full group.\n\nAnd in competitive play, well... take a look at this screenshot to see how broken match making is.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685572212\n\nAnd before you reply with "Level doesnt mean anything"... WRONG. Here is how level means something.\n\n1. High rank typically means more experience playing the game modes. Knowing what you are supposed to be doing on a map is 50% of playing the game (the other 50% is skill). A team of all sub level 15s is very unlikely to know what the hell they are doing.\n\n2. Higher level players have most likely ranked up their preferred characters, unlocking the few extra helix upgrades for them. This isnt very likely for a lower level player.\n\n3. Higher level players have more time/experience put into playing their character, and experience playing against OTHER characters, and this makes a HUGE difference.\n\n4. Higher level also means you have opened more loot packs, which means you have had a much higher chance at getting optimal items for the match. Some level 10 players might not even HAVE some of the item bonuses yet.\n\nAll of these things, ESPECIALLY #1 and 3, makes a competitive match like that set up in my screenshot, an AWFUL game. Typically, the lower level team will surrender 5 minutes in because they just get rolled due to lack of experience. If you do on rare chance end up on the higher level team, your game still gets cut short (ie: not fun) becuase the other team surrenders. Ether way, short games where the other team gives up IS NOT FUN.\n\nSo until they fix the broken match making system, I cannot recommend this game.","May 16","false","23.5"," 49 of 94 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","49","94","2","2"

It gets compared to a moba style of game, but in this topic, it feels somewhat incomplete... Incursion mode being only one lane... making it a big push foward and backwards.. brute force, not much strategy involved... if it had 3 lanes would be awesome. There a mode with 2 lanes, but somehow so confusing it doesnt feel like it but as a big lane somewhat together.\n\n- Story mode is cool, great humor, but as a solo player very challenging , already in normal mode, where strugegling a lot you end up with a bronze medal. You can play with other people, but you can´t choose the Chapter you want to play, you get 3 choices and this ones get voted...ifg you are looking for completing that one chapter, you have to wait for the luck of getting that particular chapter opted for vote, and get voted for.\n\nFinal words: This game it´s fun, but it could so much more fun if the described flaws would get ironed out...","May 19","false","36.2"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","4"

Rather than focusing on PVP or a solid PVE-Campaign, Battleborn attempts to be good at both, but fails to do so with either.\n\nThe PVP is grossly unbalanced, as many of the other reviews have pointed out. Some classes are wildly more powerful than others. As of the latest patch, a "tank" class (Isic) is capable of doing more damage than most of the actual damage classes. Other characters can run up to you and kill you before you're even capable of responding in an effective manner.\n\nI've found the PVE campaign to be a boring grindfest of the same types of mobs over and over. There are maybe 5 or 6 actual enemy NPC's you will fight throughout the entire game. Really pathetic.\n\nThis game is certainly not worth the $60.00 price tag. It feels like an Early Access game. The patch roll-outs seem really slow, and I'm not really sure as to whether or not Gearbox cares about what players are saying or not. Although some attempts to balance classes seem to have been made, the pace with which these updates are being applied is dismal.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Battleborn in its current state. If you're looking for a solid class-based multiplayer shooter, go with Overwatch or Team Fortress 2. If you're looking for a third / first person MOBA, go with Smite. Battleborn attempts to blend both genres but fails to do it. Spend your money elsewhere.","May 20","false","20.7"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","26","49","0","0"

Surprisingly the most fun I've had so far is in these group dungeons, they are quite well done. It doesn't hurt that the game is so vibrant and that the characters are all unique and have lots of personality. That's not to say that the multiplayer isn't fun, it's a blast as well. I'm still learning the MOBA part of things and trying not to play like a straight up shooter but so far I've had some nail biting matches that were literally down to the last second.\n\nOverall it's definitely worth the price of admission and it's a shame that so many people will overlook this game becuase of Overwatch, which shares very little in common with this game and is basically TF2 made by Blizzard.","May 3","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Over all the game is amazing and a great buy for anyone who enjoys what 2k makes. The charcter and gear system once mastered can be fun and creative, allowing for a wide variety of personalization and specilization. This game is not without its fults however since changing the friendly and enemy colors affects the enemy appearence and helth bar in game, however when it comes to a cut scene or image that goes with the mission audio their colors represent what they would appear like if the team colors were left at defult within the game options, breaking what would be perfect, customizable immersion. Also when playing online campaign for the first time there is a choice of either episode one or two. If there is a vote for the second mission and you beat the boss it will not unlock that miswsion to replay in private campaign since you have to win the vote for and beat the missions in order to unlock them publicly. A simple fix would be to give players the choice to either play the missions in order or random vote. That way people who want to play through the campaign publicly can play while those who want instant action and a random set of maps can go off to another server. I believe that these pronblems are a result of  a rushed open beta, developer inexperience, mislabeling and deadlines that had to be met. Battleborn has the potential and backing to become a great game.

There are elements that have been added which I think make the game a lot more enjoyable, such as loot and the singleplayer story which is broken into sections that are basically MMO Dungeons done in first person.  Surprisingly the most fun I've had so far is in these group dungeons, they are quite well done. It doesn't hurt that the game is so vibrant and that the characters are all unique and have lots of personality. That's not to say that the multiplayer isn't fun, it's a blast as well. I'm still learning the MOBA part of things and trying not to play like a straight up shooter but so far I've had some nail biting matches that were literally down to the last second.\n\nOverall it's definitely worth the price of admission and it's a shame that so many people will overlook this game becuase of Overwatch, which shares very little in common with this game and is basically TF2 made by Blizzard.","May 3","true","41.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Over all the game is amazing and a great buy for anyone who enjoys what 2k makes. The charcter and gear system once mastered can be fun and creative, allowing for a wide variety of personalization and specilization. This game is not without its fults however since changing the friendly and enemy colors affects the enemy appearence and helth bar in game, however when it comes to a cut scene or image that goes with the mission audio their colors represent what they would appear like if the team colors were left at defult within the game options, breaking what would be perfect, customizable immersion. Also when playing online campaign for the first time there is a choice of either episode one or two. If there is a vote for the second mission and you beat the boss it will not unlock that miswsion to replay in private campaign since you have to win the vote for and beat the missions in order to unlock them publicly. A simple fix would be to give players the choice to either play the missions in order or random vote. That way people who want to play through the campaign publicly can play while those who want instant action and a random set of maps can go off to another server. I believe that these pronblems are a result of  a rushed open beta, developer inexperience, mislabeling and deadlines that had to be met. Battleborn has the potential and backing to become a great game. Personaly I feel as if the game is an FPS with a few MOBA elements that allow it to be more than a remake or parody of a formern game.","May 9","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Infact, I waited until it went on sale, even at that I was a little worried.\n\nWell, my verdict? This is an absolute blast, I regret nothing! I wish I dove into it sooner.\n\nYou will LOVE this game, if:\n\n1) You like the gameplay of Borderlands.\n2) A MOBA fan.\n3) Oh you like Smite? Well... Guess what?! This is less clunky feeling!\n\nAs for the nay sayers in previous comments.\nThis game isn't DEAD, sure it's not BOOMING. But, I've yet to play the same opponents twice.\n\nI blame the negative reviews on perspective:\n\nPeople are saying OverWatch is better. Y'know what? OverWatch is a strictly FPS shooter, their competition is of another breed. Meanwhile, Battleborn is an FPS MOBA. It's really not hard to get into at all. The playerbase isn't so toxic to hate on you during a match.\n\nTheir cries for OverPowered characters? Look how much time they've put in the game.\nI find most of these critiques a joke. I dont only mean on Battleborn, but for the rest of Steam.\n\nSure, balancing isn't perfect ♥♥♥♥♥. It's not nearly as awful as the woeful make it out to be.\nPerhaps it wasn't their cup of tea? Maybe they had a rough day? Bugs are really not game-breaking.\n\nUnbalanced matchmaking? That's also a joke. I don't know who thought it was funny, but it's not true. We were a groupd of lowbies (1-18) and we still rocked a game where their accounts were 70-100. It's means nothing. It's not a measure of "True Player Skill".\nPerhaps they've got more account experience due to the previous "Double XP weekend" (Which I wasnt apart of, regretfully). You know what? That equates to nothing. It doesn't significantly or even marginally give you an advantage. Sure, they might have an extra "Helix" unlocked. Truly though, what you start with most of the time is better, it just serves to fit your character into a niche role.\n\nYou need to decide for yourself, and not be too relient on other individuals judging on what YOU may like.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nGive this game a chance. It's had low publicity, perhaps bad marketing. I truly think you'll enjoy yourself in their world of Battleborn.\n\n-There's unlocks to the Helix System = Optimizing attributes to your character.\n-There's enough characters in here to make your own, to suit your playstyle. Shooters, Casters, Melee, Skirmishers, Snipers.\n-You've got frikken loot! You accumulate said loot, from the story, obtaining in-game currency to purchase packets, etc.\n-It's 2K Games, If you've never experienced Borderlands, there isn't a moment I havent laughed. The characters feel emersive, yet hilarious enough to keep individuals entertained.\n-The Campaign mode is really not as bad as what I was expecting, due to reviews. They're fun, and always with a chance at different narrative from played characters; Yours, or your allies.\n\nIf you're hesitant as I was; Don't be. This game is safe, and has an update every week about their roadmap, features and what-have-you.","June 6","true","36.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Single player is a little boring for sure.\n- Player numbers. *THIS IS AN ISSUE IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE US OR EU* As of right now (May 29th), there are thousands of people playing. I live in the US, and I've never had an issue finding a match or teammates for the campaign. Match queues have been very quick.\n- No good tutorial for multiplayer in the game. If you want to be competent in multiplayer, you'll have to do a little research. Luckily, the game does allow you to practice against teams of bots. I highly recommend practice before jumping into online matches.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- It's a complex game. Make no mistake, this is a MOBA (most multiplayer modes at least). If you go into it playing team deathmatch, you are going to have a bad time. That being said, it's deep and rewarding once you know the rules. It also manages to be fast paced and very fun. I personally love this aspect of the game.\n- Grindy. If you want lots of gear, expect to play the campaign a lot. You also have to level up to unlock many of the various characters in the game. Some may love it, others hate it.\n- It's new. There are some balance issues and bugs. Some characters are strong and a few are weak. This is to be expected, and gearbox releases new patches (hotfixes) weekly. Right now, I feel that the balance is actually pretty decent.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fun. Battleborn is a game that doesn't take itself that seriously. You won't find a long-winded ultra-tense MOBA here. While the game is deep, it still manages to be hectic and super fun. It's a rare combination.\n- Character design. The characters in this game are awesome. I've played most of them, and they all have unique and interesting skill sets. Whatever playstyle you enjoy, you'll find a character that suits you.\n- New content and frequent updates. Gearbox devs are active in the community and listen to feedback. At this time, there are at least four new characters coming in future updates. One has already arrived (Alani).\n- Unique. Battleborn's charm and gameplay are refreshing. I am not a fan of MOBAs in general. However, I feel that Battleborn hits the right mix of FPS and MOBA elements. I loved Monday Night Combat. This game scratches that itch.\n- Graphics. The environments in the game look great.\n- Multiplayer. So far, I've had a lot of fun in multiplayer. You get occassional quitters (early surrender) and toxic players, but that is any multiplayer game.\n\nOverall:\n\nI highly recommend it. Check out some Youtube videos or streamers on Twitch. If it looks like fun, buy it! Just make sure you have a good enough machine to run it on.","May 29","true","68.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But my friend talked me into playing it with them, and I'm glad they did.\n\nA lot of reviews have already talked about the MOBA/PvP modes, but I'm really loving the co-op.  The mechanics are great, and each of the 8 stages plays out like a mini-dungeon run featuring either point defense/horde, escort, or just great boss fights.  The MOBA-style in-mission leveling and variety of characters keeps each run feeling fresh, and the advanced difficulty runs are just challenging enough to keep things interesting.\n\nAdd that to the pretty fun PvP modes, and it's a great package for the price.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the humor is, in my opinion, a little forced.  But it has its moments.  The character unlocks might not be popular, but I think they're a solid carrot that keeps that "just one more run" high going.\n\n\nOverall a great game and a steal on sale.","May 27","true","89.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4444560/recommended/394230/","4444560","Hellstorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4444560/","46 products in account","I started off not wanting to get this game, but the open beta changed my opinion to give it a try. I logged at least 50+ hours into the open beta and this satisfied me so I purchased the game.\n\nIf you are not a fan of MOBAs, Gearbox, Borderlands, FPSs or anything of that nature, do not get this game, otherwise you will end up writing a negative review because you did not look into the game.\n\nMoving on now:\n\nPros:\n-Uniqueness of characters\nEach character has a unique playing style that can be easily seen throughout the battlefield and in-game. You can also have a different "feel" for each character since the first person view of each character is different with what weapon they hold, what stance they have and what they see (just look at Toby's view). Also, the characters have unique personalities which sometimes can be rather difficult with a large cast of playable characters.\n-Aesthetic of the game is good\nThe game holds the tried and true typical Gearbox aesthetic, explosions, cool guns, cartoonish art style, etc. which really does not create a sense of reality, which goes hand in hand with the humor and silliness that Gearbox has shown us thus far with games such as Borderlands.\n-Gameplay\nGameplay feels smooth and nice. Even though there are a multitude of playable characters, I have not found one character I do not have fun with. Movement is good for a FPS, the shooting feels nice, and getting around all missions and maps feels smooth, not complaints here.\n\nCons:\nHorribly unbalanced matchmaking:\nWith all the games I have played, I have found certain characters to be too weak and too strong which makes the matchmaking not pleasant at times. Also, with the imbalanced teams, meaning 5 level 100s pitted against newer people to the game, it is hardly fair. I remember in the open beta there was a ranked queue for matchmaking, I really wish Gearbox would bring that back.\n\n-Short campaign:\nThe campaign is a little short (which they are adding more missions with DLC) but it is replayable in my eyes since there is a lot of special dialogue with characters plus 25+ characters to play the game with. So it's perfectly fine with me.\n\nHeated topics and debates I have seen in the reviews:\n-Locked Characters at start:\nI know some people are ticked they just paid money for this game and there are locked characters, however I do not see an issue with this since that is the way to progress and become better at the game. Personally, I do like how characters are locked so I have a sense of accomplishment earning said characters and I can try them out as I go. Of course I do see that I could do that anyway by just going down the list of characters.\n\n-Comparing it to Overwatch:\nPeople, stop doing this. The games are two different games entirely, one is a MOBAFPS, and the other is an FPS like Team Fortress 2. They cannot be considered better than the other since they cannot be compared based upon different genres. Personally, I do like both games, both are really good.\n\n-Price drop after this past weekend:\nPeople who complain about this should note that they did have access to the game 3 weeks earlier than people who bought it on sale now. Also, this trend is increasing because it is a good marketing move in order to get people to purchase the game. Since this trend is apparent, people should wait to buy games rather than complaining about the price drop itself.\n\n-Free content: Gearbox clearly labeled that the free content would be multiplayer maps and characters (since the characters can be purchased with in-game money),"46,000 credits is such a huge price though" what are you buying with those credits anyway? Loot packs that you can get with leveling up or playing the story? Just play the game, save up your credits and not complain, otherwise buy the DLC and get even more skins and taunts along with another story mission and a hero key good for ANY Battleborn.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is nowhere near perfect, but I do recommend it to everyone who enjoys MOBAFPSs, Monday Night Combat, or Borderlands. It has some really cool characters, great asthetics, and fun gameplay. Although the matchmaking is a little frustrating at times I'm sure Gearbox is working to make it all the better with patches to come.\n\n8.5/10","May 28","true","89.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I did not really do any research before I bought or play any betas, I just saw it was released and bought it. I understood it was basically a first person MOBA made by the same company as borderlands.\n\nEssentially what I have found is an extremely addicting and fun game. I have played LoL for a long time and was always looking for a new MOBA. I tried Smite but I found the characters boring and the game not very unique.\n\nThis fixes all of that. Every hero is unique and has a role. There has only been one character I have found to be borderline "OP", everything else is relatively balanced. The game has several game modes with Incursion being my favorite.\n\nIncursion is tradtional MOBA gameplay. Creeps follow paths. Instead of towers you have sentries which can move and shoot in their arena. There is no "jungle" but you can kill Thrall NPC's which then turn to your side and push for you. You can purchase and build turrets, extra minions, and speed boosters. You can find these yellow crystals which are the equivalent of your gold. These build things and allow you to activate your 3 preset items you equiped before the game.\n\nAs you level you also have what is called the Helix progression. This is what helps make you unique. For example there is a hero that can overcharge and give allies shields. You can focus on her support role and increase her shield giving abilities with the Helix or you can go the damage route and increase her ability to deal damage to enemy and enable her to tear through enemy shields extremely quickly. Just because you play a certain character doesn't mean you have to play them a specific way.\n\nThe best part. It requires actual skill. You can have the best strategy ever in games like DoTA and LoL and it does't require much raw skill. This game you will get destroyed if you cannot hit your enemy with your shots. There are no auto attacks, you have to manually aim every attack.\n\nI really think it is worth the money. If you are looking for a team based game with a lot of character give it a try. I have thousands of hours on TF2 and this is the closest thing I have played that has given me that amount of enjoyment again.","May 4","true","34.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It hits many of the right notes for me with its multiplayer Shooter/MOBA hybrid. The co-op missions, while showing potential, feel more like a tease of what's possible rather than a fully realized vision. I think the game is worth it due to what it offers now (fun maps, objective based PvP) AND the promise of what it can be. It has the spirit of Borderlands (graphics style, writing style), combined with gameplay reminiscent of Monday Night Combat with MOBA tropes.\n\nOh, and the comparisons to Overwatch are a little misguided, IMO.

I the three-hit punch of Duke Nukem, Colonial Marines, and Randy Pitchford's bizarre behavior have dug a large hole for Gearbox to climb out of.\n\nIt's hard to describe the gameplay. The game comes with a large number of "heroes" to play as, and they all have some kind of thing that makes them unique, and each one is viable in some way. They are diverse in design and feel and I've rarely felt bored by the game, as I can launch up a hero I haven't tried yet, and learn new things.\n\nThe PvP is surprisingly fun. Surprising in that I DESPISE moba games, but really enjoy what the game does. I'm not a big fan of its capture point mode, but there's a lot of meat in its minion-escort modes. These modes require you to move little AI bots forward while keeping the enemy from doing the same with theirs. What this means is that you have to find that right strategy of defense and attack, and coordinating with teams in these modes is a ton of fun.\n\nI'm kind of torn on the PvE. It's a nice way of grinding equipment (you take three stat-enhancing trinkets to any PvP or PvE mission, and you get multiple loadouts), and the missions and dialogue are fun to start. The problem is that the enemy AI is stupid, and players can be even worse and screw up perfectly-winnable scenarios. The dialogue can also get grating after hearing it several times.\n\nThose who didn't enjoy the Burch way of writing things like constant yelling, over-selling punchlines, constant fourth wall breaking, and neck-breaking tonal shifts should at least check what they've done here. The banter feels much less forced, but it would be nice if they got the voice actors to tone it down a little bit more. There's some good humor here, especially coming from Sentinel turrets. Even with any complaints, the writing is charming and they had enough fun with it that it found its way into my heart.\n\nOverall, I feel like the pricing may have been a big problem. $60 seems steep especially, but you do get a lot of game with it, and people with the base product get access to any content that DLC owners get. I just wish that there weren't so many heroes locked out at the start, and some of the character lore pieces weren't so ridiculously hard to get. I could definitely recommend this game to people looking for something just a little bit different, and some strategic multiplayer action gaming.","May 26","true","31.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've been thinking a lot why this game can engage me for hours and I have solidified some good reasons.\n\n-Battleborn is light hearted and funny. The characters will taunt each other in multiplayer (without you pressing anything). The story is hilarious and has enourmous replay value, and I chalk it up to how frickin funny it its. The game is super competitive and skill based, but the silliness keeps the mood positive always.\n\n-It's fun even if you're losing. Badly. The characters have fat healthbars. Every fight is interesting, and if someone is beating you, you can see how they are doing it, instead of watching a killcam of you getting quickscoped from across the map for the 10th time. The matches are also multidimensional, and can be about escorting creeps, or holding a position, or putting pressure on an objective, instead of just racking up kills. You can always focus on many aspects.\n\n-The characters are so different. Seriously, you would think that there can only be tanks, assassins, healers, and snipers in games like this. These characters often stradle many of these categories and can be played in weird ways. very interesting.\n\nThis game is insanely fun. Drawbacks: poorly optimized (low fps is common), few map choices. More are coming out, but I wish they released more maps. Not too big of an issue though. I can see how people would be dissatisfied with $60 for this (not that much content), but the replayability is huge, and it is INSANELY fun.

Even though there are a multitude of playable characters, I have not found one character I do not have fun with.

Also, with the imbalanced teams, meaning 5 level 100s pitted against newer people to the game, it is hardly fair.

The games are two different games entirely, one is a MOBAFPS, and the other is an FPS like Team Fortress 2. They cannot be considered better than the other since they cannot be compared based upon different genres. Personally, I do like both games, both are really good.\n\n-Price drop after this past weekend:\nPeople who complain about this should note that they did have access to the game 3 weeks earlier than people who bought it on sale now. Also, this trend is increasing because it is a good marketing move in order to get people to purchase the game.

However, it's not nearly as bad once you get used to it. Gearbox has stated that they are working on this.\n- Lack of variety in campaign.

I live in the US, and I've never had an issue finding a match or teammates for the campaign. Match queues have been very quick.\n- No good tutorial for multiplayer in the game. If you want to be competent in multiplayer, you'll have to do a little research. Luckily, the game does allow you to practice against teams of bots. I highly recommend practice before jumping into online matches.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- It's a complex game. Make no mistake, this is a MOBA (most multiplayer modes at least). If you go into it playing team deathmatch, you are going to have a bad time. That being said, it's deep and rewarding once you know the rules. It also manages to be fast paced and very fun. I personally love this aspect of the game.\n- Grindy. If you want lots of gear, expect to play the campaign a lot. You also have to level up to unlock many of the various characters in the game. Some may love it, others hate it.\n- It's new. There are some balance issues and bugs. Some characters are strong and a few are weak. This is to be expected, and gearbox releases new patches (hotfixes) weekly. Right now, I feel that the balance is actually pretty decent.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fun. Battleborn is a game that doesn't take itself that seriously. You won't find a long-winded ultra-tense MOBA here. While the game is deep, it still manages to be hectic and super fun. It's a rare combination.\n- Character design. The characters in this game are awesome. I've played most of them, and they all have unique and interesting skill sets. Whatever playstyle you enjoy, you'll find a character that suits you.\n- New content and frequent updates. Gearbox devs are active in the community and listen to feedback. At this time, there are at least four new characters coming in future updates. One has already arrived (Alani).\n- Unique. Battleborn's charm and gameplay are refreshing. I am not a fan of MOBAs in general. However, I feel that Battleborn hits the right mix of FPS and MOBA elements. I loved Monday Night Combat. This game scratches that itch.\n- Graphics. The environments in the game look great.\n- Multiplayer. So far, I've had a lot of fun in multiplayer. You get occassional quitters (early surrender) and toxic players, but that is any multiplayer game.\n\nOverall:\n\nI highly recommend it. Check out some Youtube videos or streamers on Twitch. If it looks like fun, buy it! Just make sure you have a good enough machine to run it on.","May 29","true","68.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It lags a whole lot, even with lowered settins (I've got them on the bare minimum.) Even messing with some of the game files doesn't help too much, although it did help nonetheless. What I want to see is an optimization update that would allow the game to run very smoothly. Just add that, and it'll be perfect in my opinion.

Most of the time I'm playing PVE and it's very suitable for Casual-Gaming.

It's very fun to test new characters and discover differnt playstyles by varying skills in the helix. Most of the time I'm playing public and mostly I met very nice gents out there (big plus for the community :)). In PVE I have also never experienced the often mentioned long waiting times in the lobby so far (max. 2 minutes). Quite possible it's different in PVP.

It's got great strategic customisation and each game could have a ton of variations. At its best you have deep tactics, sweat-inducing shooting and surprising turnovers, but I'll admit there are a few games where teams just get steamrolled.\n\nMatchmaking seems to be improving.

If you like Borderlands, the humor is there, if you enjoy a fast paced kill-fest, this is for you, if you get off on the MOBA equipment meta-game, you might want to stick with LOL, HON, or Smite. Overall, a fantastic effort by Gearbox. 8/10.\n\nI had had my eye on Battleborn for a number of months before the open beta. As a veteran of numerous FPS's and MOBA's, the combination of the two had me salivating to say the least. In all fairness, I pre-ordered before the open beta; what can I say? I like to roll the dice every once in a while. I'm happy to report that they came up 7s this time! While I'm not too terribly big on co-op multiplayer, the missions offer something to play with my friends that are, and further, it entices them to come into the online arena to use the loot the gather in the co-op missions.\nThe PvP is fast paced and fun. Though there may be some balance issues to be worked out, and perhaps the overall player "score" should maybe be relabled "threat" (apparently your score has really no value outside of increasing your spawn time when killed, as read on reddit, not confirmed) overall the matches are frentic with an air of strategery that you scarcely can find in any other modern FPS. Match this with the inherent Gearbox style and you have yourself a winner that is bound to eat up at least a hundred hours of my time. If you're on the fence, jump off. This game will grab you and keep you coming back for more.","May 3","true","98.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

They are only similar skin deep. Do NOT think this is the same kind of game. This has a campaign, longer TTK and different playstyle. It's a team oriented game first and foremost.\n\nWith that out of the way I'll go into more depth. The game has a fun story mode (with dialogue that changes each time you replay the mission for a couple of times.) Lots of fun characters, 25 at the moment if I am not mistaken. So you can certainly find someone to fit your playstyle. On the topic of the characters, their humor is great. Some are rather bland but most are highly entertaining in both playstyle, artstyle and commentary.\n\nOnto the multiplayer (that doesn't have to be!) You can have bots, play co-op against bots, or play true PvP. There's 3 different modes with 2 maps per mode (NOT ENOUGH MAPS but they are all colorful and fun, save for one)\n\nYou have Capture which is essentially hold points. Incursion which is closer to a traditional MOBA, get into the enemy base and destroy their sentries while farming and recruiting mercs by beating them at their camps and finally Meltdown which is hilarious and fun. In Meltdown you essentially escort your minions into giant grinders to appease a hilarious God and try to prevent the enemy from doing the same. Destroy, destroy, destroy.\n\nOnto the negatives of the game, every game has them...\n\nThe matchmaking is basic as it can be, it does not take into account skill or level and you will often have imbalanced matches. If you can get over this and just play to have fun that's great but a lot of people could be turned off by this lack of any kind of ranking or skill based matchmaking.\n\nThe maps do not offer enough variety, as I said it's 2 per mode. What if you dislike a mode? Now you're down 2 maps out of 6.\n\nFinally the game does have some FPS issues. Friends have confirmed it with me.\n\nAll in all the game DOES have lots of replayability and lots and lots of fun to be had in the MP if you can simply get over the imbalance and enjoy the humor and crazy action. It has something for everyone with the heroes. Hop in and just have a blast.","May 8","true","48.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I hated MOBA'S as very dull and annoying games but Battleborn is the pentultimate exception!\n\nThe PVE mode (Story Campaign) is really really cool. 5 heroes (or yourself in offline play) will complete objectives across beautiful (if you, like me, enjoy this art style) sprawling maps. Now the maps are linear in nature, moving from point a to but the battles carry that defining Borderlands quality of terrain variety and fast paced gunplay that enables players to dodge and weave between enemies while dishing out their own attacks or retreating for a second to catch your breath. The missions are the same, but having played through them multiple times I have not yet grown bored because it's always a challenge, always a way to show how much of a badass you are.\n\nPVP Includes three gamemodes that are MOBA modes, a lane movement where you try to destroy the enemies sentry, a escort mode where you deliver your robots to be sacrificed to a god, and an area capture mode. These carry the hall marks of moba's with merc recruitment, tower building, and coordinated plays but with, again, that penchant for chaotically wonderful Borderlands gunplay.\n\nNow the game is an investment at 60 bucks and requires mission completions to unlock characters so that can very much be a turn off. Look for it on sale if you can because it is a great shooter and a great competitive game!","May 9","true","37.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is full of comedy, action, and fun. It is a great game for people who enjoy the Borderlands franchise or just wants to something to do until Borderlands 3 is released. This game has singleplayer mode where you complete a campaign similar to Borderlands where you fight bosses and other things. The Multiplayer game modes are capture: where you capture points and guard them, Incursion: where you take down the 2 enemy sentries, and Meltdown: which is similar to a moba but you will not be attacking the enemy's base. There are 25 playable character in the game currently everything from a talking penguin in a mec suit to a Fan wielding master assassin and more! Most of them require you to complete a certain challenge or reach a commander rank to unlock.\n\nSome things that bother me is that the matchmaking system takes way to long and is pretty unbalanced. Even with those 2 things I am really happy with the game. I've been waiting for Battleborn to come out ever since it got first announced and when I first played the open beta is this game just exceeded my standards and the actual release of the game exceeds even more. This game deserves a chance instead of getting put down by people who want Borderlands 3 or the Overwatch Fans. Over all Battleborn is a fantastic game and people who enjoy Borderlands or MOBAs, or FPS should definitely check this game out and try it because it might become your new favorite game who knows.","May 10","true","121.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While logic kicks in and says to wait for a sale, temptation feels good! Needless to say, this game delivers.\n\nThis would be considered my first MOBA. While I was never really interested in mobas, this game looked different due to it being an FPS with a dash of humor. What initially convinced me to purchase this game was the character, content, gameplay and simplicity. Needless to say, they all deliver.\n\n- Characters are top notch. They all have their own unique personality that make them entertaining to play as. I always look forward to seeing their personality shine on the battlefield. Even if you dont like playing as the character, trying them out only to hear their commentary is enough.\n\n- The amount of content you get is good. As of release, there are only a few maps to choose from for each multiplayer mode. While more are coming, the ones available are well designed to allow for alot of variation within the games. While I havent delved into campaign, its their for lore and more loot. From playing a little, its the type of gameplay you would normally get from borderlands in the form of smaller "campaigns."\n\n- The gameplay is where this game really shines. The devs spent alot of time making sure everything is balanced and it shows. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses which provides for some unique variation of matches. When is comes to balance, the only issue is that some of the character's egos are bigger than the amount of damage they are willing to take.\n\n- This game is incredibly simple to master, which is a good thing. I imagine its because its an fps, so the controls are almost trivial. Even the abilities are easy to understand. Thus, players can still make an impact even if they havent played alot. If a team chooses to use strategy, more power to them.\n\n\nOverall, good game.\n\n\n","May 11","true","118.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While Overwatch's core gameplay is pure team-based shooter and the MOBA-inspiration comes only from it having a large cast of heroes with abilities with cooldowns and ultimates, Battelborn combines MOBAs and shooters at many different levels.\n\nBattleborn has both competitive and coop modes.  Neither of these feel like an afterthought, to me.  This coop campaign isn't a glorified tutorial like some competitive-focused games, and the competitive mode isn't tacked on like in some campaign-focused shooters.  Both feel, at least to me, like fully-featured, well-developed modes.\n\nLike most MOBAs, Battleborn has a large cast of characters (characters need to be unlocked, but none require spending money - the 25 release characters are unlocked through challenges or leveling up your account, and DLC characters can be ulocked with in-game currency if you don't want to buy the season pass).  Characters have varied playstyles, including both ranged and melee characters, and level up over the course of a match like in MOBAs.  As you level up, you customize your character by picking between two or three helix upgrades each level.  These are fairly similar to the talent system in Heroes of th Storm.  Characters also unlock an ultimate ability at level 5.\n\nPersonally, I've really enjoyed Battleborn's characters.  The playstyles very a ton, and most of them have been very fun to play.  The helix system doesn't seem to have a ton of depth, but it's still fun to have some customization.  While some helix choices seem like no-brainers, I have seen debates or varies opinions about diferent helix builds for some characters, so there definitely are some meaningful choices or opportunities to customize a character according to your own playstyle.\n\nNow, more detail about the modes:\n\nCoop\n\nBattleborn's coop mode features 8 missions (with 5 more planned as DLC, for $5 each or $20 total if you buy the season pass).  They take around half an hour to an hour to beat, so there isn't a huge amount of raw content, but the replayability is good.  The missions are designed to be played for high score, there are two difficulties, and, of course, the large number of playable characters.\n\nSome missions simply require you to get to the end and kill a boss, while others require you to defend points or escort a robot.  The defense and escort missions can be fun, but it can also be frustrating if you lose towards the end of the mission because the robot you were escorting decided to move on while you were killing enemies.  If the point or robot you are defending is destroyed, you instantly fail the mission and have to restart, no matter how many extra lives you have left, which is rather frustrating.\n\nThe writing in the coop missions is also fun.  There is a story here.  It's not an incredibly compelling story, but it's fun to at least have a story in the game, as opposed to most multiplayer games where you basically have to read about the plot online.  The writing is quite funny, though, and has the same sense of humor as the Borderlands series.  If the Borderlands games made you lauch, chances are Battleborn will too.\n\nOverall, the coop can be frustrating, but I've enjoyed it so far.  I haven't played enough of it to say how long it will last, or whether it's worth the price on its own if you have no interest in competitive, but I can say that I've found it fun.\n\nCompetitive\n\nBattleborn has three competitive modes.  The three modes play very differently - there's a lot more variety here than in Overwatch, in my opinion, where you're always trying to attack or defend some objective and the main difference is whether it's moving or not.  In Battleborn, the three competitive modes are all completely different from a strategic standpoint.\n\nIncursion and Meltdown are the more MOBA-like modes.  Incursion plays kind of like a one-lane MOBA, requiring your to push a single lane of minions to destroy the enemy sentry robots.  Meltdown has two lanes, but no senties - instead, you get points whenever your minions reach a grinder at the other ened of the lane.  Both modes emphasize focusing on objectives and minions, similar to a MOBA - kills aren't the goal, just a means to an end, allowing you to get a level advantage and buying time to push wit your minions while the enemy respawns.  On the other hand, the maps are much smaller than traditional MOBA maps, and unlike in MOBAs, there isn't really a laneing phase - you're skirmishing and pushing for objetives right from level 1.\n\nOverall, these two modes successfully combine a lot of what I like about shooters and MOBAs.  They have the more complex, strategic objectives of a MOBA, as opposed to the simpler goals of getting kills or capturing points that most FPSs have, but they still have the constant, fast-paced action that most shooters provide.\n\nThe third mode is Capture, which plays more like a traditional shooter.  There are three capture points, and each one generate points for your team as long as you hold it.  No minions, and the only side objectives are some "jungle" camps that can be cleared for experience.  Capture mode doesn't seem as deep as  deep as the other two, but it's nice when I want to play a mode that's a bit faster and simpler.\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nI've really been enjoying Battleborn.  I don't know if it'll have the staying power of other online games I've gotten into in the past, but I'm glad I bought it and I plan to keep playing it.  It has some frustrations, but I've found both the coop and competitive modes very fun.\n\nPros and Cons\n\n+ Lots of content.  Lots of chaacters, both competitive and coop modes, and the three competitive modes feel very different, not just variations of the same basic gameplay\n\n+ Competitive modes combine MOBAs and team-based shooters very successfully, creating a very unique game\n\n+ Diverse and fun cast of characters\n\n+ Lots of challenges (including 5 "lore challenges" for eac character) give plenty of objectives to strive for\n\n+ Coop missions have good replay value, between the large cast of characters, ability to go for high score, and multiple difficulties\n\n+ Funny writing\n\n+ Actively supported by Gearbox so far, with regular balance updates and new content planned (including free characters and competitive maps and modes)\n\n- Performance issues.  I get some major framerate drops, and other people have had similar experiences.  It's not unplayable, but it's enough to be a problem.\n\n- Defense or escort coop missions can be frustrating\n\n- Coop mission difficulty varies a lot with how many players.  Tends to be harder to win with more players, but easier to get a good score if you do win\n\n- Competitive modes can be frustrating if your team ignores the minions and just focuses on getting kills\n\n- Sometimes competitive games can get really chaotic and it can be hard to tell what's going on, especially when wading into the middle of the fight as a melee character\n\n- No ranked mode yet (but they're working on it)","May 24","true","47.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On a aesthetic point, the art style really works for me.  The characters are unique and have distinct personalities.  Playing your favorite character unlocks you interesting and often humorous lore. For a hero shooter it's clear gearbox cares about the characters they made which definitely Drew me in.\nFrom a gameplay standpoint it has a lot more layers than many give it credit for. A successful match is about playing your role and working with your team.  Helix bonuses and gear help you flesh out your playstyle, or react to the atmosphere.  Icould gush about specific characters and strategies.  But, regardless, there is a lot of depth to each character and team composition.\nAll that said balance often feels off. Getting stomped is regrettable and usually a result of imbalanced characters and matchmaking.  Fortunately, patches roll out at lightning speed.

I would recommend looking up videos of Benedict. I think he is one of the best designed and most fun characters in any game ever made. Look up Caldarius, El Dragon, Kleese, Shayne and Aurox, and Toby. Look up the cool relationship between Oscar Mike and Whiskey Foxtrot. This game has a bunch of well-designed and fun characters, which I think is the heart of any MOBA. (and teamwork, can't forget the teamwork)\n\nI love this game. I've been waiting for a MOBA/FPS for a while, and I think Gearbox delivered. As of now, the first week, there are some balancing issues, but really this is a PvP game. Thinking there aren't going to balancing issues the first week is illogical, as Spock would say.\n\nDon't listen to some of the marketing/reviewers. This is a MOBA. It's a modified MOBA and it is an FPS Hybrid, but it is still a MOBA. There is minion farming, gear, levels, the game is character based, characters reset every game, and there is a lot of teamwork. One of the game modes plays like a modified all middle map from LoL and the other(my favorite) plays like a heavily modified standard MOBA map. Some will disagree, but I think this game is very much a MOBA/FPS hybrid.\n\nI think the PvE is good, but that’s about as far as I’m willing to go. The missions that are there are super fun. They are the prettiest MMO-style dungeons I’ve ever seen in a video game, and they might be some of the most fun. If there were more of them I would say the PvE is awesome, but there are only 8 of them at the moment. I’m not really one for doing dungeons over and over again just to grind loot and RACK UP POINTS BRA!!!\n\nI've been waiting a while for a game of this genre, and I am in love with Battleborn.

It's NOT a MOBA, but it's *very* close to being one. Two of the three PvP modes, Incursion and Meltdown, are basically ARAM/2-lane versions of classic MOBA maps.\n\nThat said, I like MOBAs, and I love this game--because it brings original game design, humor, and creative character abilities along with the aforementioned never-before-seen FPS almost-MOBA game style.\n\nThis game is not at all similar to Overwatch, except that they are both "hero shooter" games (as the genre has begun to be called). I PLAY Overwatch, and it is 100% different in the type of gameplay it offers. Please do not buy this expecting it to be much at all like Overwatch, and do not be scared away from buying it because it "seems" like it might be similar to Overwatch.\n\nBattleborn, simply put, offers a LOT more content; from character lore to in-battle DNA augments, there is simply more depth and scope to Battleborn's gameplay.\n\nThere ARE a few negative aspects of Battleborn that should be mentioned, though.\n\nFirst off, it has needlessly high system requirements. Overwatch has better graphics and runs on my computer at a perfect 60 FPS, yet somehow Battleborn can only run at 30 fps on my computer even at minimum settings? Bad programming.\n\nAdditionally, expect some framerate lag during the really big battles, with lots of action on screen.\n\nAlso, this game can be very strobe-y. Lots of flashing lights, jerky/sudden movement, and tons of objects on screen can make hard-difficulty co-op gameplay (or even PvP) a literal headache sometimes--as in, I sometimes get an actual IRL headache from playing this game too long because the flashing lights and jerky movement aren't exactly easy on the eyes.

Or maybe I just really suck at it. Versus is a lot of fun! I think the higher command rank the better you are. You level up in game but you start from level 1 in every new versus or story match and have to start from scratch with the Helix. But I think the Command rank is more important to get higher in.

I played them quite a lot and enjoyed the game. I didn't preorder it but bought it at launch.\n\nPositive:\n- Gearbox vibe. If you're familiar with Borderlands, you'll feel right at home\n- A lot of cool different characters with some really cool abilities.\n- Game seems balanced (if both teams pick balanced combo's that is: tank - support - (ranged) assassin - DPS)\n- graphics are cool (if you like the style. I do). It might get clusterfukkie, but that's just something you need to get used to\n\nNegative:\n- matchmaking (or total lack thereof). The game will without issue let you start a match 4v5. It will match level 72 players with level 2 noobs. Great fun garanteed! You either roflstomp the enemy team or get steamrolled yourself. I can count the really close games I had with one, perhaps two fingers (admittedly, I only played around 10-15 matches or so)\n- Ridiculous lack of content: 2 (two) meltdown maps. This must be a joke. Plus, nobody wants to play that second map anyway, so you end up with that same map you've been playing since beta.\n- Characters are locked behind progress walls. I don't like this idea. I want to try out the support characters. Now I need to grind boring other characters I don't want to play in the first place to unlock these.\n- Story mode: so-so. Lot's of shooting, yeah. But why, what is the story? Jokes are 'meh' at best (not on the same level as Borderlands). You can clearly tell this has been added in a rush.\n- Gear loadout: why is it so damn difficult to build an intuitive way of managing your gear? I'm clicking, double-clicking left and right, but it's always a chore to move gear in and out of your loadouts. Also, when I select a character and his loadout, am I really supposed to learn by heart what every item does? You can only see it's icon in the character select screen.\n- Please order the battleborn by their role. At this point, the game is new and a lot of people (including me) don't fully know all battleborn's role. It might help if you'd put all tanks together, all DPS characters together, and so on...\n- the need to grind for better loot. Ugh.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis game could have been a real hit, but I fear Gearbox just wanted to cram too much into one game and they ended up with a game that's only average at best. The story mode is mediocre. The multiplayer lacks content (basically just one mode and map that everybody plays). They just shot themselves in the foot with this game I fear. But hey, sales figures will probably be good, so we can expect a Battleborn 2 in a couple of years. I do hope they focus on the one thing this game really needs: good content.\n","May 13","false","15.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you are going to buy this buy it off of greenmangaming with the voucher code BATTLEBORN25 because you can get the digital deluxe edition at an even lower price than the normal edition on steam. This is only a suggestion, if you dont want to and want to be able to refund if you get sub 2 hours of enjoyment out of it go right ahead.\n\nTo be honest, the best time to buy is now if you want to ever get anything out of this game since the player count is low and decreasing. If that changes in the future feel free to buy it because it is a fantastic game and has enough characters to present different dynamics of battle that can be very enjoyable.","May 26","true","5.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

A lot of the story mode stages involve defending "towers" from waves of monsters and PvP is somewhat the same thing, except you're defending from players on the opposite side. I'm into the whole 1st person tower defense gig, but if you aren't, I don't suggest buying it since that's how you unlock almost all the other heroes.\n\nPros:\n+It got cheap really fast. The price here went back up but Gamestop is still probably selling it for $40.\n+Co-oP Story Mode\n+2d Animations look nice and colorfull.\n+Each character adds replay value to unlock lore of each character.\n\nCons:\n-Default video settings set everything to the minimum.\n-A lot of Hero Skills are the same for each class type.\n-Not many appealing heroes (IMO). Silly, cool, but not lovable.\n-You have to queue to play by yourself (private game that allows you to play with friends or by yourself only).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PiquantPangolin/recommended/394230/","PiquantPangolin","Piquant Pangolin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PiquantPangolin/","210 products in account","An incredibly fun game that will only improve as more people play it.  Personally, I think the $60 asking price is entirely justified given the amount of content, but it is important to realize what the game is before you purchase it, and this easily done by looking at some youtube videos (I highly recommend TotalBiscuit's review).  The PvE aspect offers 8 replayable solo/co-op missions that each take 25 - 45 minutes to complete.  Through these missions, you earn gear that you can use in both PvP and PvE aspects of the game.  They also act as a way to try out characters before using them in PvP.  The PvP has three game modes with two maps each (with more to come for free), all of which focus on teamwork and strategy to win.\n\nThere are a lot of people complaining about matchmaking (which will improve as more people played the game), but I have not noticed any issues myself.  It is all regional, as far as I can tell, and can be temprarily remedied by switching your Steam download region to NYC or LA.  Gearbox is aware of this and is working on a fix.\n\nAlso keep in mind that 8/26+ heroes are unlocked from the start, with the others being unlocked when you reach a certain command rank or complete and objective specific to that character.  A lot of people are upset with this, but I personally love it.  It acted as a "First Chapter" for me, giving me objectives that I could focus on while learning the basics of the game.

Personally, I think the $60 asking price is entirely justified given the amount of content, but it is important to realize what the game is before you purchase it, and this easily done by looking at some youtube videos (I highly recommend TotalBiscuit's review).  The PvE aspect offers 8 replayable solo/co-op missions that each take 25 - 45 minutes to complete.  Through these missions, you earn gear that you can use in both PvP and PvE aspects of the game.  They also act as a way to try out characters before using them in PvP.  The PvP has three game modes with two maps each (with more to come for free), all of which focus on teamwork and strategy to win.\n\nThere are a lot of people complaining about matchmaking (which will improve as more people played the game), but I have not noticed any issues myself.  It is all regional, as far as I can tell, and can be temprarily remedied by switching your Steam download region to NYC or LA.  Gearbox is aware of this and is working on a fix.\n\nAlso keep in mind that 8/26+ heroes are unlocked from the start, with the others being unlocked when you reach a certain command rank or complete and objective specific to that character.  A lot of people are upset with this, but I personally love it.  It acted as a "First Chapter" for me, giving me objectives that I could focus on while learning the basics of the game.  Once I had them all unlocked, I felt like I had acheived something and that I was ready to move on to "Chapter Two: Git Gud".\n\nIn general, I love the amount of content and depth that Battleborn gives me.

GPU stands for Graphic Processing Unit and CPU stands for Central Processing Unit.\neither it does not run well with your CPU as some have listed or GPU not to say it cant be both but do not give out crappy information. fact is i have seen troubles from both camps AMD and INTL. that is because the game itself is again not optimized very well. if you have an older video card expect this floaty feeling to be a little worse.\nnow with all this said remember this is a 2k game that playes like borderlands and that includes the ADULT humor.\nit has 25 characters right now but not all are playable from the start. you need to gain experience and do things to unlock the others. this contrary to the belief is easy. of course some will be harder then others but that is to be expected.\n\npros. 25 characters, three diffrent game modes (solo, co op, vs), visually beautiful. loot based shooter.\n\ncons. not optimized (i expect this to be fixed), matching system does not work well in the fact that. i have played few games but the games i did play were way unbalanced. 5 vs 5 was 5 lvl players 4 through 9 the other side 12 through 28.\nyes we got our butts handed to us. so no not fair at all.\n\nthats is it and all there is.  would i buy this again? oh yeah quickly i love 2k games and been a borderlands fan since the beginning. all they need to do is optimize this game and it will be fine.\n\nnow how does it stack up agaisnt overwatch?\ntwo diffrent games all together. yes both have 25 characters. both are shooters and have character stats. you can switch characters when you die and thats where it ends.\nlet Bicuit tell you... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAMGrDUSGJU\nover watch is beautiful as well and will run on a taoster.","May 8","true","66.8"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","34","65","3","0"

Thats. Literally. It. You don't have to choose between the two. In fact, you can have both. If you haven't heard about this game I strongly urge you to consider giving it a chance.\n\nYou can tell that Gearbox has put so much time and effort into every bit of this game. The dialogue, the map/character detail, even the menus. The abilties of the characters and how you can spec them too. Theres just so much detail here! The multiplayer is addicting, it was in beta and it still is on actual release. Time just flies when you play this game with friends.\n\nOn the developer side, every single post on the Battleborn subreddit has a reply from a Gearbox employee. The amount that they care is just awesome and the community seems to be pretty close and tight-knit. I wish this game success and hope this review helps convince even just a couple of people to try this game.","May 3","true","20.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Usually I don't prepurchase but I was feeling confident in that decision.\n\nThe game starts with a prologue-mission, kind of like a "forced" tutorial. However, the opening cinematic as well as the content of the first mission are very well made and pretty cool, I was hooked right from the start.\nThen I jumped into the single player missions, which smote me with the typical GBX humor. I didn't experiences any problems finding a game and neither am I having any performance issues even though I'm using an AMD GPU (which some other reviewers seem to have problems with).\n\nThe multiplayer part has 3 different modes and every game is very unique since you have a nice and diverse character roster where everyone feels like his own character. I'm enjoying this game very much and can see me adding many more hours to my record in the future!\n\nIf I had to find any negative aspects, maybe the high amount of effects on the screen can be overwhelming for some but I haven't had any problems with it so far. YMMV.\n\n\nAll in all, it's a very fun and entertaining game and well worth the money. Especially since everything ingame can only be unlocked by playing (NOT including the new story missions which will come with the DLC. And I think every DLC-pack will have a/some(?) taunts and skins which are exclusive to this DLC although I'm not 100% sure about this).\n\nSo there you have it, I can really recommend the game, for the singleplayer as well as the multiplayer!","May 4","true","18.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

And damn that candy was nice.\n\nThe mix between MOBA and FPS is great and has great potential, but as of now i can not recommend this game.\nBattleborn has some very fun elements, but bugs, server issues and poor performance really hurt the experience.\n\n\nI know they are working very hard fixing all the problems and maybe someday i will update my review on this, but please Gearbox don't charge 50 bucks for an 80 % finished game with known bugs.\n\nAllright here are some pros and cons\nPros:\n\n- It is fun playing missions with friends\n\nPlaying on advanced is great and challenging.\n\n- Cool concept / MOBA FPS\n\nFresh idea. I like it. Very competitive.\n\n- Nice heroes\n\nNot as good as Borderlands or Overwatch but it's okay.\n\n- Loot\n\nI think they added this just for the Borderlands fans out there ;)\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of Cutscenes and flustered Artstyle\n\nNot much effort in making the cutscenes. All of the still pictures between missions looked very amateurish.\nThe intro and outro were okay, but the artstyle looks so flustered. No clear art direction. Another indication that this game was rushed to get it out as soon as possible, beacause of Uncharted 4, Doom and especially Overwatch.\n\n- Server issues + Always Online = Bad choice\n\nPlaying a mission for 40 min. on advanced and realising that you didn't get anything because you lost the connection to the server  "Inventory Timeout" is very frustrating.\nSometimes you can't even get into the game. Very fragile.\n\n- Bad Performance and Bugs\n\nLast two missions and sometimes pvp maps have very bad fps drops.\nEnemies are getting stuck in the map and you can't progress.\nI had a bug where i was constantly losing health.\nSubpar performance unfortunately.\n\n- PVP and Matchmaking\n\nIn PVP players are leaving the match and are not getting replaced by someone else. Leaving you 3 vs 5.\nMatchmaking takes too long sometimes.\nMarquise exploit in Overgrowth. He can snipe your sentry from a safe place.\nSome balancing issues.","May 13","false","35.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Thought the character designs were ugly, the graphics were too busy, and the humour sounded really forced. But now...I can't stop playing it! There are currently 26 characters to choose from. Each time I try a new one, I think "This character looks dumb, I'm not going to like it" -- and then blammo, it becomes my new favourite. The story missions are alright (there isn't much story to speak of). The competitive game modes are fantastic. More strategy and depth than the typical "team death match" and "capture the flag" modes from other games.

This game is fantastic.  The art, writing, gameplay, EVERYTHING is great.  There are some grossly overpowered characters, and a nonexistant matchmaking system, but the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about long queues are just wrong.  I, personally, have never spent more than 2 minutes in queue, and even then it's quick to initiate.  I understand different people will have different experiences, but the wait times do NOT apply to everyone.  This is a fantastic game by a fantastic company that DESERVES to be played more!\n\nP.S.

(8 Episodes, around 30 minutes each.) With good replayability for challenges and obtaining specific legendary gear from bosses.\n-Great character dialogue if you are a fan of the Borderlands series.\n-Good leveling system that rewards you with titles for yourself as well as gear packs.\n-No microtransactions.\n\nCons:\nPVP: Teams will often be uneven when it comes to levels, as it stands single digit players are prone to being stomped by level 50's and above. I know that levels don't completely determine how a player does, but from personal experience a level 6 usually doesn't do as well as a level 50.\n-Some pieces of gear need to be balanced, specifically the legendary ones. While their high cost to activate is a nice balance to their powers, there are some that are in need of changes.\n-Character balance is also a problem. Some characters go untouched in PVP due to the fact that there are characters that do their job better. It is because of this that you will usually see the same set of characters on a team in a PVP match. There are also those that are considered overpowered. We have received a few balancing changes on some characters but others are still in need of it.\n-Performance is an issue to many users, even to those with setups that rocket past the recommended system requirements. A lot of the lag comes from the story missions. As an example, on the second mission, I get 100+ frames through most of the level, however there are spots on the map, where if I walk into them, while staring at the exact part of the map where I was just standing, my frame rate will drop down to a locked 30. I have also had several others with rigs better than mine walk in the same spot as to replicate the anomaly, and even they had large frame rate dips. Which begs the question: "Why?". As far as PVP goes I have had little to no frame rate drops. At most dipping to the 50's in the heat of battle.\n\nI wish i could mark this game as a mixed, but I will mark this game as not recommended until some of the problems are addressed in later updates.","May 15","false","126.2"," 120 of 234 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","120","234","2","3"

There are a lot of really negative reviews about this game on here, but keep in mind this is around the first week of release. This game is a AAA title, many of which have had horribly rocky starts but have still been very successful (I'm looking at you Battlefield 4). Too many people expect a 100% polished game on release, but this is 2016, that kind of thing doesn't happen anymore - just accept it. I admit there are some serious problems in the online multiplayer: few OP characters, bad matchmaking, etc.; however, the Devs at Gearbox have been on top of things. There has already been a few hotfixes and a patch coming sometime next week-ish that hopefully fixes a lot of these problems. My friend and I have actually played with a Dev solo queuing in game; Gearbox is really working on making this game even better than it already is. This kind of dedication from the developers isn't seen too often. The whole point of this little rant is that the game has its issues, but give it some time and I am sure this game will be just as everyone hoped it would be.","May 12","true","202.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Evidently, the gameplay-mechanics have had some serious work done on them, the helix-skill-system works as marketed, and the gun-play has a nice, somewhat organic, feel to it. Additionally, both the in-game, animated 3D, and 'especially' the hand-drawn anime-styled chinematics, are among the most well-made I've ever seen, and are very immersive.\n\nAs a point of reference as to the general feel of the gameplay; the online game-modes and overall experience is quite reminiscent of games like Team Fortress 2, Super Monday Night Combat, and the upcomming game, Overwatch, by Blizzard. The campaign, on the other hand, is more reminiscent of games in the Borderlands IP, which should not come to anyone's big suprise, given that Battleborn is made by the same developer. The feel of coop-story-mode is quite a break from the norm too; there is a wide variety of experiences provided, linear story missions, boss-battles, and the tower-defence experiences, which especially, make for a real blast.\n\nIf you like Borderlands, SMNC, or Overwatch, I would definately recommend that you take a shot at Battleborn. It is a really solid game.","May 3","true","3.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

I don't know if I would pay the full price tag for the game, but, here is my review:\n\nI enjoy this game a lot at the moment.  One of the first things I noticed about this game were the crisp clean graphics and how reactive the skills/characters feel.  I cannot tell you how much satisfaction I have received when trying a new character and using their insane abilities to tear through the enemy.  Every skill and animation has been carefully thought out and feels as though I am controlling my "battleborn" in every aspect.\n\nAnother thing I was impressed with was the single-player.  I thought it would be a half-done game mode that is used as a filler to slap a $59.99 price tag on something worth blatantly less.  I was wrong, the single-player is detailed and enjoyable.  Not only does it provide benefit in your multiplayer games in the form of items and unlocked characters, it is good for practicing new characters without wrecking your teammates online experience.\n\nBetween the single-player and the awesome gameplay, another aspect that is unique and should be brought up is the items.  These items can help you create custom loadouts depending on your character and playstyle.  This system gives you stuff to work towards and customization that other games *cough* overwatch *cough* do not have.  These items can not only be obtained with the games "currency" but also by playing the single player by yourself or with friends.\n\nFinally, one of my favorite aspects of this game:\n\nI do not see a trace of microtransactions after paying a hefty penny for the base game.  The only thing I am not looking forward to is having to potentially buy the DLC to fully enjoy this game.  However, this is a good alternative since there are no microtransactions (for skins, items, loadout pages, etc).\n\nCons:\nVery small number of maps per game mode - I can't stand when games do this, what happened to releasing a huge group of "core" maps and adding a few later?  Instead, it seems as though they have included the bare minimum and are expecting to release more - probably in the form of DLC which is already in the works.\n\nAnother "con" I could see the gameplay becoming stale.  I love the flashy art/graphics and animations but this could start to lose its luster.  This might not effect people like it does me, this genre has a hard time grabbing me for long periods of time.\n\nTL:DR\nBest "moba-esque" game that has come out in a while.  I hate smite, love this game.  Art and animations/responsive gameplay are the games strong points","May 3","true","141.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

I can only play 1-2h per day and usually I play 1-2 maps. I do not need a big story and the solo gameplay is fine for me. Always something that keeps me engaged to replay the maps...go for silver/gold, unlock heroes, grind some loot and experience, etc.. Some may find that shallow, I find it satisfying and engaging enough.\n\nMultiplayer PvE is great, no problems so far with random groups. Playing with friends is a blast of course!\n\nI only have a medicore system and game runs smooth on high settings.\n\nPros:\n- Heroes offer a vast variety of playstyles: Sniper, Tank, Melee, Hybrid...you name it they have it\n- You need to adapt your playstyle for each hero\n- satisfiyng grind for loot, lvl-ups, rewrds, unlocks, ratings, etc.\n- easy to play and get into, but challenging on higher difficulty/hardcore\n- good gunplay and shooter mechanics\n- solo play und multiplayer PvE is fun to play (for me)\n\nCons:\n- some escort missions can be stressful/tricky on the first attempts\n- 8 Maps only for PvE so far (more to come, but DLC policy)\n- pay for DLC´s\n\nVerdict:\n\nIs it worth the price? For me yes, because I get enough out of it (and thats solo and PvE only). But I can also see some flaws and it is far from perfect, but really great fun to play so far. If you are unsure wait for a discount, if you also like to play PvP then go for it, obviously most people think it shines even more on that side.\nI do despise the pay-for-DLC-policy, but I will wait to judge on that until they show up and then try to get them on a good discount.","May 13","true","47.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alcandor/recommended/394230/","alcandor","Ja, schon acht Bier am Tag.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alcandor/","78 products in account","The decision of the Tracer's-Back-loving community seems to have been made already. The hype for OVERWATCH is uber, BATTLEBORN comes around as the less polished funny little twink.\nBut alas, the com got it all wrong. Now the impossible (ask the media-payed online magazines) comparison to OVERWATCH.\nHere we go.\n\n+++ Heroes and Abilities\n\nPoints for BATTLEBORN. The heroes in OVERWATCH have in average fewer abilities and in average less intriguing abilities than the heroes of BATTLEBORN. There is no QWE+ULTIMATE for every OVERWATCH hero. Some can more or less shot and jump. Meeh. But nice butts though.\n\nIn BATTLEBORN you have the helix - meaning you can play every hero in very different ways. There is no such option in OVERWATCH. The heroes have generic roles and do nothing else than this one design.\nI call the design of the BATTLEBORN heroes superior to OVERWATCH's heroes.\n\n+++ Gameplay depth\n\nGames can end in 5 minutes! What does that mean? Kill the following (very exciting) possibilities: no comebacks in OVERWATCH. No delaying/evading strategies because there is no leveling.\nThe gameplay in OVERWATCH is generic. It just is. Don't fool yourself.\nThere is only one boring mode - capture two points and call your Bastion. Bam bam - game over.\n\nAnd the maps! The maps in BATTLEBORN I maybe call it's main weakness - the design is okay and works, but not especially intentive. But in OVERWATCH the maps are completely bonkers and lame tubes - you start in base, you have twenty seconds before you meet the enemies' base entry and NO KIDDING: you can basically spawn camp them. This is just bad design.\n\nEvery graphic detail of OVERWATCH is meaningless, it adds nothing to the gameplay and is really surface. Running and climbing and jumping around in OVERWATCH is like swimming in plastic.\n\nMany people call BATTLEBORN confusing - there is too much going on. I think that is a very sad notion. Instead of asking yourself if you're maybe a little too slow mentally, or just investing more energy (not even time!) in trying to understand a game, you blame the game. This is an development in gaming that will end in boring and polished game with zero immersion. Immersion starts where you have to learn the ropes, where you even have to give something from you to the game - this is why old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate were great. The design philosophy of games like OVERWATCH would have called this game to be "too hard" and "too frustrating" for gamers and would polish everything.\n\n+++ Endgame and Meta\n\nThere is gonna be a hardcore heavy meta upcoming for OVERWATCH. For anybody who wants to play with his friends and copy the latest Blizzcon winners because the gameplay really\ndoes only allow one style if you want to play on a successful level.\n\nThere is gonna be Tier1, Tier2 and Tier3 strategies/hero choices. And you gonna go and play like the meta calls it or you fail.\n\nIn BATTLEBORN, we have the same risk of meta-based and lastly boring gameplay. But Gearbox has reacted fast to the community calls and nerfed Ambra which was far too strong and would have dominated the meta otherwise.\n\nI have high hopes for a sane meta in BATTLEBORN since the designers seem to be paying attention. This can't be said for the OVERWATCH designers. They pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed it up with HEROES OF THE STORM and the design philosophy for OVERWATCH seems to be the same.\nGames must flow like gummy bears - detect and delete all obstacles please, Mr Lead Designer. Games must be designed for braindead zombies. Didn't you see the sales?\n\n+++ Resumé\n\nWell, here I end my review. Recommendation for BATTLEBORN if you're interested in a complex, yet not frustrating and intense gameplay that you and your friends can really dig in.","May 13","true","18.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Oversaturation of colors makes it hard to play for me, i have something wrong with my right eye and it gets tired too hard (it gets tired even if i drive in the evening from the lights around me).\n2. Playing a melee battleborn in a multiplayer mode is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it is unreadable most of the time. As an avid moba player i find this unacceptable.\n3. FPS issues are still there, they are unbearable in one single player mission, somewhat bearable in others, and mostly decent in multiplayer. Phenom 2 1075, HD 7970, 8gb ram.\n4. I've never encountered a hacker while i was playing but reading subreddit makes me sad that there are hackers. I thought that would become an issue since you are using the same engine as in Bornderlands.\n5. Single player campaign is a marketing move and a joke, it doesn't stand up to what it was hyped for. The only two legit interesting missions we already seen during free play time. Every mission after that isn't good at all.\n6. I had to replay co-op campaign three times because one enemy monster fell under the texture and we could not kill him (Talking about playing the game for 8 hours here, lmao).\n7. Sound is poor. Music isn't setting the tone and can't support the pace. Sometimes it is too quiet for no reason. In game sound doesn't speak to the player about what is going on around him. In other co-op (moba mostly) games sound helps the player to recieve important information about current state of the battle, in battleborn this isn't working at all.\n\nSo other minor issues:\nMatchmaking isn't here, if it is - it doesn't work. How does score system works is a riddle too, it's hard to keep myself in game if i have only 2 score points while at the same time i've been runing around objectives like a dingo while also saving my teammates as Boulder.  Some mechanics were never explained to the player which makes it even harder to learn to play. Hero unlocking systen isn't justified and it reminds me of Call of Duty MW 1 and 2, which was 10 years ago and was fine back then, but now it doesn't do any good for the game. By the way why am i forced to watch intro cuntscene and play prologue again after i log in from my laptop? And as a final note some legendary items are plain broken, which makes some battleborn broken especially against inexperienced players.","May 14","false","8.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

On top of that if you matchmake campaign it will not allow you to change difficulty.\n- Some heroes need some balancing. People are arguing that they need to learn the game; If all it takes is for someone to run up and hack and slash and kill you more than half the time, I would say there are some issues.\n- Matchmaking is not very good; almost always will not have a good spread of command rank. I do understand that players cannot be evenly spread all the time but to atleast have some consistency would be nice.\n- Lack of staying with a party. Very rarely I will find myself playing with a nice group of people who openly communicate and play as a team, but cannot play another game with them because you have to re enter matchmaking everytime you win/lose a game.\n- Lack of multiplayer maps and content. Hopefully dlc will fix but this is definately not $60 worth of content.\n- Scoring in multiplayer needs to emphasis objectives. Too many people thinking kills > objectives.\n- Campaign is a little lackluster and seems rushed. Not a real vareity in gameplay. You're either defending something with waves or just escorting. Where is the creativity that was in borderlands 2?\n\nOverall I would recommend this game despite the huge list of cons because I do see the potential that this game has.

What really makes the difference are the different characters you can play and the three different game modes (each has two maps). In my opinion, a large map pool isn't necessary for a good MOBA anyways. And at the end of the day, Battleborn is pretty similar to a classic MOBA: It's a combo of Dota and a hero-style FPS.

Support characters aren\'t all about healing, but can also be hybrid damage dealers, deal increased damage to shields, be better at crowd control, etc.\n\nI\'d honestly say this is a very nice breath of fresh air from a AAA dev, considering literally every damn AAA game these days has microtransactions one way or the other, whereas you literally don\'t have any for this game, not even loot boxes - those are only bought for Credits you get for playing matches or doing challenges.\n\nThis comes from a person who enjoys both Battleborn AND Overwatch, and I really have nothing against Overwatch despite the overshadowing of its competition.\nYou can enjoy either, or both, if you really want to - I know I will do the latter.","June 1","true","104.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","4"

It's especially imporant to do this when games (like this one) are ported over from the consoles, and have framerate limitations as to not be a hinderance on the consoles. Make sure that you enable unlimited framerate before you head straight to the steam store page and DEMAND that the game is fixed, or be as brash as to request a refund before EVEN MESSING WITH THE GRAPHICAL SETTINGS. Go back to your damned precious console if you're going to just go straight into complaining about something without even making a valid attempt to fix an issue.\n\nTLDR; The game is awesome, go into settings before you play the game, and the prologue is about 20 minutes long.

They have very different gameplay ethos but trade off similar mechanics and character designs. Oh even that is more explanation than is required though. Overwatch is a fancy three course dinner at a nice restaurant while Battleborn is stuffing your face with a bag full of dollar menu hamburgers. There really is no reason I should want the bag of greasy junk food over the nice meal, but sometimes you just want the junk food..

You will hear almost all of your character's dialouge in the first story mission or match you play... lots of repeating).\n- Repeatitive cutscenes\n(The intro animation is repeated EVERY SINGLE TIME you play a mission.  The same little hand animated interstitial scene is also repeated virbatim EVERY SINGLE TIME you play any game.)\n\n\nI feel like this is a free to play game in look and feel, that was restructured late in development to be full priced (I know this is not the case, but the problem is that this is how it feels right now).

It will take many hours of repeating the same missions over and over to even unlock all the characters, then you need to decide which one you like but cant really decide until you played them all and then you need to grind some more to level up that specific charcter before you can decide if its any good.\n\nAll in all, its a grind fest with minimal content, and sub par performance. Before you have unlocked everything and died of bordem doing it, there will be a DLC that you will have to buy and grind some more. This game will die.\n\nGame Performance.\n\nHere is a video of my game experience. I am playing single player, with FPS at the top left, In my opinion it looks like an Xbox 360 game and notice how it goes from 60 down to 14, 17 , 30 etc, its very jaring and makes me dizzy with all the effects and when I try to aim it feels like the cross hair is floating and lagging behind my movement.\n\nThis is with all the settings off or on low, I show the settings at the end.\n\nI challenge anyone to show me smooth gameplay without jarring fps drops, of course you have to show the fps in real time, like I did.\n\nhttps://vid.me/b799\n\nIntel Core i5 4670k@ 4ghz\n16GB Ram\n2 x amd 7950\nIntel 730 SSD\nOnly battle born steam, MSi after burner and OBS.\n\nMy experience is the same if I am recording or not, I am recording to a seperate hard disk and the game uses around 30% of my cpu.\n\nMultiplayer, anit-cheat or lack of.\n\nBattleborn the Zero anti cheat game.\nDoes this game use VAC? No\nDoes this game use any third-party anti cheat software at all? No\nDoes this game use proprietary anti cheat software? No\nAre the developers collecting statistics? Don't know.\nHas anyone been banned yet? No(there have been paid hacks available since closed beta)\nCan you attach a debugger to the game without a problem? Yes.\nDoes this game have sensitive game data client side? Yes.

Its an extremely polished and smooth FPS fun ride. Just under 6 hours so far and im having a blast. Was a little sceptical due to Gearbox's recent failures other than their Borderlands series but Battleborn proves that Gearbox excels at this type of game. Its nothing like Overwatch (though Overwatch is also a great title) even though most will be quick to compare the two since they are both FPS games. I enjoy both and will be playing both for some time.\n\nBattleborn's DLC, in the fairly cheap 19.99 Season Pass, is only going to be campaign oriented.

It's got all the whacky humor of Borderlands, lots of memorable characters, the one-liners in pvp, even the MOBA-style defense base has more attitude than most games! Once I got killed by the Super-Sentry, and he proclaimed "Thank you for standing still." and gave me the finger. The game world is colorful, deadly and hilarious.\n\nMatchmaking\n\nPVE matchmaking is pretty good, although you can't pick which story mission to play you can vote over which one you'd like best, and usually the result is a ton of chaotic and whacky fun! The mode's great with randoms and with friends.\n\nIn PVP people keep bringing up unbalanced matches due to level difference.. But account level actually does nothing in this game except unlock more stuff. Sure it means you're either played a ton, or completed more challenges than the other guy, but it doesn't make you stronger or a better player by default.\n\nPVP matchmaking sometimes takes time, but unlike popular belief, I don't feel like matches are really all that unbalanced. People are stuck in the old MOBA mentality in Battleborn's PVP, and it frustrates me to no end to see people practically throw games that are fun and could still be turned around! In this game it's actually possible to do so. In Meltdown, my team and I were down 200 points, you need 500 to win, and we still managed to climb that gap and turn the entire match around even though we were getting wrecked earlier, through teamwork and exploiting flaws in the enemy team's tactics.\n\nGearbox\n\nGearbox has been fantastic throughout the launch of Battleborn, and I'll keep this section updated as things develop.\n\nThey've proven they're listening to feedback, they patch everything they can in a timely manner, although bigger patches take time thanks to Microsoft and Sony's patch certification system. We're still waiting for the first big patch, but we already know a lot of the upcoming changes that will address issues in the current game, and they seem to be pretty on top of Battleborn balance! They've hotfixed a number of issues in the game so far and I'm sure they will continue to provide great support like their Borderlands series.\n\n\nEnd of review\n\nIf you'd like for me to talk about some other aspect of the game, leave a comment! I'll try to update the review whenever I notice. :P","May 22","true","94.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","13","24","2","0"

Over and over.\n\nYes, matchmaking is finicky. Yes, players can currently cheese one of the incursion maps (which I have never witnessed myself thus far). Yes some heroes are a downright pita to be matched up against (early days yet to be able to give an opinion on balance updates - unlike some players I can understand we can't have a patch every other day). And yes, there urgently needs to be a way to report toxic players.\n\nBut it is fun. It's got a great single player and co-operative campaign, which may seem short at 8 missions but I've found the replayability is there and I really don't mind doing this for gear upgrades. The recent addition of Advanced matchmaking has been a godsend and I've been lucky with the PUGS I've played with. Except on The Saboteur. That mission is cancer.\n\nLike Borderlands before it, the games oozes character. The campaign is full of the Borderlands standard of humour we've come to know and love but I think what really stands out is the characterisation of the games heroes. I've found myself doing the Lore challenges not just for the hero specific legendary gear attached but... gasp... the lore. Oscar Mike being a personal favourite.\n\nMultiplayer wise, I've come to prefer Incursion. The games most moba-like game mode. And while I've experienced the same issues as others being matched against higher level premades I have not had any issues waiting for matches. The longest waits being on the 2-3 minute side. Hero balance is an ongoing thing and it's quite early to comment specifically on how well Gearbox is doing with this, other than there has been some balance tweaks in hotfixes already and they have shown an interest in hearing what the players have to say.  I've not as much been infuriated by certain characters being overpowered but moreso with certain premade compositions (read as: I need friends and to not play alone). Obviously being moba-like, communication and co-ordination is key and a helpful pug can turn the tide against higher level premades. Sometimes. Kinda.\n\nPerformance wise I've had some hiccups on certain missions and maps. I am however playing on a low to mid range rig and with most settings at medium and AA and Physx off I've had a steady experience with fps and no other performance issues preventing me from playing and enjoying the game.\n\nI do hope the game offers a demo or free weekend at some point as there are (and rightfully so) a lot of mixed views on this game the best way to decide if it is for you is to test the waters for yourself.\n\nPersonally, I'm having fun and while I can see why some aren't I'm deciding to keep the faith in GBX. At least for now.","May 23","true","39.3"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","3"

But its flaws just utterly hinder any enjoyment you can get from this game.\n\nLet's start with what the game does well. You have 25 characters which all have their unique twist and don't just feel like a reskin of the same 3-4 characters. You have melee, sniper, support, healer, skirmisher, flying characters, high DPS, defenders, tanks and all kinds of in between characters to this.  Discovering all the different characters is quite a lot of fun, The PvP, when well matched, is one of the most entertaining ones I have seen due to the wide variety of characters. There's also the voice acting. Hey it's Gearbox, you expect great voice acting, you get awesome voice acting. Hearing a german aristocrat say "I declare war on all liberal arts major" is just awesome.\n\nNow for what the game does not so well. The PvE, while pretty fun, is just 8 maps of defend the checkpoint against the same 3-4 enemies. It's miles off from what Borderlands was. I personally don't think this is much of an issue, because it's still quite amusing to kill hordes of enemies and it's a great way to discover how a character play mechanics work. However, some people, understandably, find this off-putting especially for a Gearbox release.\n\nFinally for the major flaws of the game. This is what, sadly, destroys all the work the developers put into character building: the matchmaking. It has 3 major issues.\n1. The algorithm is god awful. You get matched in with ANYONE. This means level 8 gets matched with level 76. I know level doesn't directly affect your character, but come on, some who player 300+ hours matched against someone who just bought the game is extremely unfair. I played over 30 hours and more than 80% of the time I'm getting my ♥♥♥ kicked by people who have been playing the game since the alpha.\n2. The lack of player population. Well this is in part due to the first point. It's also been extremely poorly marketed. I bought the game at launch and after 1 week the waiting time is around 10 minutes during peak play time and 15-30 minutes in off time.\n3. If someone disconects duing matchmaking; tough luck you know play 4 v 5. And if you rage quit, well ♥♥♥♥ you got to wait 30 minutes as a godam penalty now. If you want to stop getting analy ♥♥♥♥♥ in the game you need to covince 3 out of the 5 players to surrender and let me tell, some people would rather give up their first born than surrender a game where you are 200 points behind.\nSo when you buy the game, here's what you have to look up to: spend 20 minutes waiting for a game where you will be matched against some one who has already invested 200 hours in this. After a good 10 minutes of getting your faced bashed like there is no tomorrow, you will ask for surrender just to get hit by a wall of "Just learn how to play". You will think, this was only one bad experience so you will try again. After sinking 20-30 hours into this game, you will realize you spent more time waiting to play or respawn then actually playing the game and just give up.\n\nThing is, the base game is awesome. It's just not ready to be played. I feel like Gearbox just released as fast as possible to try to beat Overwatch. However, by doing so, they actually killed the game. I highly doubt there will be anyone left playing this game after Overwatch comes out.","May 18","false","54.2"," 50 of 97 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","50","97","0","0"

It's closer to 3-10 mins max if you're on at least NA servers. I can't say for other servers.\n\nIf a comparison is made to overwatch you can stop reading because the review will not be worth your time. Any comparison made to the game is ignorant and more often than not made by someone who hasn't tried battleborn.\n\nThe game has MOBA like pvp, 3 modes, 2 maps each, with gear and buildables.\n\nA story mode with 8 levels each allowing gear and credit collection while getting xp for yourself and characters.\n\nEach of the 26 characters can level up to 15 and every level will give you something either for the character or as a loot pack. They also have 5 lore challenges each to work towards unlocking to get more info on the characters. They each have a helix as well that allows 1 of 2-3 skill augments each level that last for the match up to level 10.\n\nI reccomend this game as all the issues are being addressed. Gearbox has put out an update each week since its launch to tweak balances and modes.\n\nThis games marketing was very little, and the ignoramuses comparing it to overwatch have also hindered it, but battleborn is worth a try, especially now that it's discounted. Grab a copy, grab some friends, and have fun.\n\nHopefully this helped some on the fence.\n\n","May 27","true","146.5"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

It's worth $40 - $50 at most.","May 22","true","20.1"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","21","40","0","4"

Do you like Borderlands' humor?  You are going to love this game!  The graphics are beautiful, the game is smooth, beautiful and a ton of fun.  I've only played for a little bit and this is exactly the type of game I have been waiting for to play.  It plays like a FPS MOBA with Boardlands' humor and great character progress.  Playing the missions are challenging and lots of fun.  The PvP aspect of the game is even more fun and keeps the game fresh.\n\nHIghly recommend this game and I believe it will only get better later on with the DLC and overall player base!","May 2","true","26.2"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","22","42","3","0"

Incursion (single lane type maps), Meltdown (2 lane type maps) and a capture the point game mode (haven't played yet).\n\nCONS\n- Only 1 so far is the "Prologue", no way of skipping it (although the cutsense is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, I would of liked a way to skip it xD). <--- Not really a con tbh, but being forced to watch it annoys me.\n\nWill update this again after an all day playthrough tomorrow. But yeah, would definately recommend this game, currently my favourite out of LoL, Smite, HotS and Paragon.","May 2","true","81.1"," 61 of 119 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","61","119","3","2"

Personally I play mostly the story missions which remind me of missions from the Syndicate shooter from a few years back. Sort of like 20-30 minute raids with objectives, mini bosses, and a multi phase final boss. Meltdown is a blast when people play it right (kill creeps, players not so much) and the capture the flag varient is pretty straight forward if you want a more traditional shooter game type. For what it's worth I like the MOBA-esqe mode as well even though I don't really like the average MOBA very much. The characters are varied a lot, so any type of playstyle you like there will be a few characters you can get behind.","May 22","true","74.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They seem like less srs business than Dota 2, which is a nice change of pace from other MOBAs.\nPvE mode is a MMO-like "raid" mode which I've not seen in any other MOBA.

Personally I play mostly the story missions which remind me of missions from the Syndicate shooter from a few years back. Sort of like 20-30 minute raids with objectives, mini bosses, and a multi phase final boss. Meltdown is a blast when people play it right (kill creeps, players not so much) and the capture the flag varient is pretty straight forward if you want a more traditional shooter game type. For what it's worth I like the MOBA-esqe mode as well even though I don't really like the average MOBA very much.

I do beleive that it does need some fine tuning though. During my ~150 hours of gameplay I have encounted some bugs. Although these bugs are not gamebreaking in the least, it is still dissapointing to see these flaws. There is also a slight issue with matchmaking. Allthough the issue does exist and is annoying, it is not nearly as bad as some people seem to make it out to be. Some players feel that the matching is broken and flawed as we are put into matchs where players have massive level differences. The matchmaking does not look at levels when creating a match it looks at W/L ratio so a high level who has only played pve and lost all their pvp matchs (ex. 1) they will be put with a lower level match with people who also have lower W/L ratios. The real issue is that the system doesn't take into account amount won vs lost, so someone who has won 100 matchs but lost 100 matchs can be put agaisnt someone who has only won 1 and lost 1. Other than that I have found this game to have very high replayability especially if you have a cool group of friends to play with.\n\nLastly, I feel this games gets a bad rep as it came out and looks similar to overwatch and paladins. As someone who played the beta for all 3, I will tell you battleborn is very different then paladins and overwatch (which are both very fun and good games in their own right).","May 22","true","191.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henkiolento/recommended/394230/","henkiolento","Leafhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henkiolento/","87 products in account","I'm not very good at writing long detailed reviews, so I'll just go straight to the point!\n\nI'm absolutely addicted to this game, even playing solo I'm having an absolute blast. It's definitely not a perfect game (Is there really a perfect game?) but it is definitely worth every penny I paid for it! All of the characters are interesting, the gameplay is captivating and the graphics are very appealing.\n\nI would however encourage people to actually research the game before buying - you should do this with any game or purchase, really.\n\nBesides that, I'd like to address some things I've seen in other reviews and on the internet about this game;\n\nI have had no trouble using the menus, absolutely no mouse lag. There could be some quality of life improvements, but overall menus work well.\n\nAll game sessions are hosted on public servers. This means they can't be kept open forever and have a timer.\n\nYou do not need to touch the higher difficulties to get the best gear to drop. in fact, it is probably more efficient to farm in the easiest difficulty. (The main point of the harder difficulties is to give a challenge. Drop chances are higher, but RNG is still RNG.)\n\nI am now Commander Rank 86. The only loot packs I've bought are Faction Packs, since I want skins and taunts. All the gear I've gotten is from the small amount of time I've spent playing through the PvE content. Excluding Legendary gear, the drops are extremely generous. I don't even know what to do with all this gear! (So no, you do not need to buy loot packs at all)\n\nUnfortunately PvP doesn't reward you with loot, and you get less credits from it than PvE, so if you want that Sweet Loot you'll probably have to delve into PvE at some point.\n\nExpect a Grind. With a capital G. Make it bold too. A lot of stuff needs unlocking. A rather artificial way to prolong the lifetime of the game, but I've been having such a blast with the game that I don't mind. If you dont like the idea of not getting everything the game has to offer immediately, you should probably pass on the game.\nAbout characters, their unlock requirements and Lore Challenges:   Most characters are locked behind challenges (most of them are a cakewalk, some might be a little more challenging - Ghalts unlock is probably the hardest, at Command Rank 40 or by completing all story missions on Advanced with at least a silver medal) If you enjoy the game, none of the character unlocks should be that hard. You gain Command Ranks by playing and all but the DLC characters can be unlocked by CR. You'll get all characters by naturally playing the game, even the DLC ones. (If you are willing to save the credits for it.) I had no trouble unlocking all the characters, though I understand that might not be the case for everyone.\n\nDLC characters are 47,500 a pop. That is a pretty hefty sum, but as stated above, you'll get all the credits you need by playing the game. And there really isn't a need to spend credits on anything else. It would be nice if you could try out the character before shelling out the credits for it, but alas, there is no Try mode in the game. So do check out some gameplay videos first!\nEDIT: You can actually Refund bought characters - at least if they are bought with the Hero Key, not sure about credits yet.\n\nSeason Pass owners get access to DLC characters a week earlier than everyone else. They also get a Hero Key, which they can use to immedately unlock DLC characters. They can also use the Hero Key on default characters. The Hero Key will be refunded once the original unlock requirement for that character has been met. Shelling out the extra money can significantly lower the grind needed for the characters. Gearbox is a business afterall, SP needs some appeal.\n\nAll characters have 5 Lore challenges. Behind these challenges are, you guessed it, Lore about the character in question and the Battleborn Universe. Upon completing all challenges, you get a character specific legendary gear. They'll boost some stats and will also have a unique legendary effect appicable only to the character the legendary was made for.\nFor some characters, the Lore Challenges are extremely easy and you can complete most of them in a couple of matches.\nUnfortunately not all of these Lore Challenges were created equal. There are many of them, so you'd be best off checking the wiki to see and judge for yourself. Personally I think the Lore Challenges need some major tweaking.\nSome can only be completed in PvP, some can only be completed in PvE. Some are much harder to complete in PvP than in PvE.\n\n\nThat's all I can come up with now. This ended up being pretty long and incoherent so I'll stop here. If you have further questions, try heading to the official Battleborn Forums, or it's Reddit page. Gearbox Devs check both!","May 29","true","222.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there are things that make me grumble on occasion, they aren't things that happen often or can be patched out. So, here's the rundown.\n\nPros:\n-Super fun PvE campaigns, with Advanced difficulties. They're also relatively forgiving if you want to try out a new character since most people on your team will know what they are doing.\n-Every character feels uniquely different, and has a full fledged skill tree for every match to try new builds, unlockable skills, unlockable lore, and unlockable taunts, and not all of them are show in the command menu.\n-Speaking of lore, all the characters are very well developed! Their lore will explain how they became such badasses and their trials before you met them like Rath, or reveal things like Oscar Mike's terrible fear of spiders.\n-Very humorous, and all the\ncharacters have dozens of different lines. Even the campaign dialogue will change depending on the characters present.\n-Tons of replayability due to the unlocks.\n-PvP is challenging but satisfying when you win.\n-The soundtrack is pretty damn good.\n-Fast paced crazy action, just like Borderlands.\n\nCons:\n-Sometimes enemies will bug out and be stuck behind a wall, where you can't kill them. This can prevent progress, but can usually be solved by AOE abilites, waiting, or in the case of timed levels walking away.\n-PvP is HARD when you first start. Expect to die a lot.\n-Not everyone thinks to be mindful of their teammates and stick together, or they stand in front of you where you can't shoot around them. This game is very cooperative in every aspect but single player, so you can't leave your healers and snipers out in the open.\n-Getting pushed into a wall by an Attikus and Kelvin then pummeled sucks, because you're literally stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n-Melee tanks are a little squishy, so you have to be very mindful of staying in motion.\n-Poor optimization. I run this on medium settings and still get  big FPS drops on certain levels, (*cough* I'm looking at you Saboteur...) whereas I can run MGSV on high and never get any drops except for maybe like 30 seconds rarely.\n\nI'm hoping I wrote about an equal amount for both, as I can't really tell on my phone. But really, give this game a chance, even if you wait for a free weekend, a sale, or even have a friend that owns it share their steam library with you. It has a solid story, varied game play, and is just made to be fun.","June 6","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style is incredibly snazzy and there's a lot of diversity in character design. Humor is very similar to Borderlands, which isn't everyone's cup a tea but a lot of lines are highly amusing. The characters have very satisfying and fluid gameplay and the helix and gear system adds a level of personal customization I find lacking in other "hero-shooter" games like Overwatch. I like how they actually made up original multiplayer gamemodes in the form of Incursion and Meltdown. There are a huge number of characters and character based unlockables that should make for many hours of progression. It's definitely a more niche game than something like Overwatch, but I think it'll have a dedicated playerbase for some time to come.","May 3","true","35.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This review can change with more playtime.\n\nGearbox has put together a very competent Frankenstein's monster.\n\nIf you enjoy the quirky - if not at times cringeworthy - sense of humor and aesthetic of the borderlands games, the PVE dungeons in Destiny and Hero based MOBA games, then this game is probably for you.\n\nBattleborn is a jack of all trades that doesn't do the best at any one thing - compared to each contemporary in that genre - but as a sum-of-all-parts it's a great package that will keep you addicted.\n\nPVP plays as an objective based MOBA with a substantial upgrade path from level 1 - 10 in each match and limited item customization via items you can bring into the game and use currency you build during a match to activate.\n\nIt plays a lot like a first person MOBA but is still different enough to entice people, like myself, who are not big MOBA fans.  It's truly a hybrid between the world of first person shooters and MOBA games in a way that rewards skilled FPS players but doesn't overly punish people who prefer isometric 3rd person action/strategy games.\n\nOn the flip side, if you're a skilled FPS player who thinks he's going to go it alone - rambo style - then you're in for a rude awakening because teamwork is definitely the key.\n\nThis is true in PVP and PVE which plays a lot like a strike in Destiny.  PVE levels are 5 player co-op missions that take roughly 45 minutes to complete.  They're easy enough that you won't feel frustrated by your teammates if they refuse to work as a team but difficult enough that you WILL fail if everyone is off doing their own thing.  The challenge comes in meeting objectives rather than being killed by enemy NPCs and my group failed to defend genermcjiggerwattchamacallits at least 2 - failing the entire mission - because we allowed ourselves to scatter off.\n\nLittered through out the levels are upgrade pods that will allow you to purchase, with money you get from killing enemies/from the environment, different types of turrets, traps, and UAVs that help you.\n\nSpeaking of which, you WILL need to make use of these in order to win the levels and determinig which of these to spend your currency on, and at what time, is where the challenge comes into play.\n\nIf you scoffed each time Dinklebot said "hold off these enemies while I scan this wall" then you'll be disappointed to know that many of the levels have multiple parts where you're doing just that.  Only, in Battleborn you're protecting a device from destruction.\n\nWhen you mix the constant waves of enemies with the upgradable traps/turrets, it feels a lot like a first person tower defense game.\n\nBattleborn truly is a hybrid of all sorts.","May 4","true","20.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I loved Borderlands but just scratched my head at this IP.  However, open beta came around and I decided to give it a try since it's Gearbox and all.  First run was on PS4 since that beta started first.  After I did a solo story mission, my outlook hadn't changed much.  But then something clicked.  The second run and following runs (co-op and all)  it began to grow on me and I became a huge fan.  Once the PC open beta started I was fully ingulfed and knew this game was amazing.\n\nI highly recommend trying it if you're still in doubt.  It's good fun!

Quality voice acting is pointless if the game is shallow murder the opposite team.\n\nDoom 4 had horrible graphics with forced AA hiding a console game\n\nParagon was pretty but turns out wasn't really a shooter. The ranged attacks in that game don't go but a few feet. Very disappointing as these are the guys who made the new UT4 engine. I was the most excited about this one and the most disappointed.\n\nI initially had the lowest hopes for Battleborn based on it being be the dev who brought us Duke Nukem and Colonial Marines. I also am not really a fan of cartoony art styles as they almost always mean console style low skill cap shooter.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised to find a high skill cap shooter (or melee-er) with multiple fun modes that could be built out. Very highly recommend for PC gamers and veteran shooter players. Terrific voice acting and the world feels like an expansion of Borderlands in terms of storytelling which can be a positive or a negative as it is admittedly a bit childish in it's humor.","May 11","true","123.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(I swear that crazy 6 armed dark magic female alien has the exact same voice as the little girl from the last of the Borderlands franchise, and she's bat @#$% crazy!).\n\nThe cons - The story (campaign was way too short). This leads to the game feeling extremely repetitive if you don't play against other human players. Even with new characters being unlocked frequently as you progress through the story, even the new abilities and weapons can't cover the fact that you've become a farmer after your first completion of the campaign. Although I haven't tried it yet, my only solution would be to avoid repeating for gold medal completion and simply head on to the next level of difficulty.\n\nI would've loved to have seen more variety in this game, but yes.. I'm well aware that it's NOT the new Borderlands. Well done to the developers, keep it up.","May 13","true","57.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its flaw is the same flaw as every multiplayer game - your multiplayer experience is dependent on the folks you play with.  Play with some friends in a coordinated team you you'll have a better chance of a good time.  It's got a single-player/co-op story mode too, which allows you to get used to the game & some of the characters, and allows you to unlock more characters and gear mods for your player.  For all you Borderlands fans - this is NOT like Borderlands at all, though it retains much of the humor found in Borderlands games.","May 13","true","28.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Things like a pre and post match lobby are missing and if it was included it would provide a much better social aspect whereby players can make friends with team-mates and add them to friends lists to team up with later. I appreciate however that some things I would like will not come as the game is not a solely PC game and is more popular on consoles. Consoles do not easily support said features and as such they may never come. Smaller things that could be added would be a buff and debuff hud icon with effect timers etc and these features could work on both as they are just a HUD change/addition.\n\nThe game isn't hugely popular on PC either and players in countries with lower active player counts report long queue times. I would say my average queue time is approx 45 secs in normal and advanced mode PvE instancing and in the Incursion and Meltdown PvP modes. I am from the UK and guess I play on the EU servers.\n\nThe game seems simple on face value but is actually quite complex in regards to the "Heroes" and their individual play-styles and what they are suited too. Characters excel in certain roles and are terrible in others and not knowing this could make the game seem really easy or incredibly hard depending on which character you chose to play what mission or PvP role. To me this is great as I love tactical planning for victory or the chance to play a badly suited class for a mission as a challenge!\n\nI don't know what else to say really. Maybe watch some streams and see what you think of the game-play in action. I love it but we are all different! I hope this at least offers a slight perspective of someone really enjoying the game.","June 1","true","111.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It literally feels like one or the other. Also, I tend to see dips in fps even though the graphics don't tend to be anything complex.

A large cast of unique characters, solid control scheme, and good game design make for a very enjoyable experience.

I can tell you right off the bat to disregard anyone whose primary argument is go play Overwatch. None of the reviews I've read like that had anything useful to say, just biased hate and buyer's remorse.\n\nAt the time of writing this I have 32 hours in the game and have only been playing the PvE story content. This does mean I've repeated the missions many times over but I've honestly found them all to be quite replayable/enjoyable.  Including the prologue and the finale there's 8 of these missions that easily take 40-50 minutes each. You can unlock most things in the game through these missions with the only major exceptions being lore and achivements related to fighting other players in a PvP environment. Additionally, achievements that require match victories can actually be done by beating missions too.\n\nI've found pretty much all the characters to be quite memorable without even having played them all; whether or not they're enjoyable is another matter. There's a couple whose personalities I just can't stand (Bouldur, Benedict) but beyond that their ability sets and histories are actually unique. Unlocking lore and skins/taunts for characters you enjoy is very satisfying and it simply adds to the game universe, and if you enjoy hoarding lore en masse then you'll easily get your money's worth out of this game several times over.\n\nNow, for the negatives, such as optimization issues in the game. I can tell you right now if you have an AMD graphics card you'll want to disable PhysX as soon as possible and then just try to find settings that help your performance. While I don't know how bad performance is in the smaller multiplayer maps I do know that at least a couple of the PvE missions are suffering from some serious optimization issues in a couple sections of the mission, and sometimes regardless of the missions you're in you may just have some rampant effects crushing your fps as the game in general doesn't seem to play  nicely with AMD GPUs. Don't get too discouraged though, bout 95% of my experience has been perfectly smooth gameplay, but the 5% is pretty noticeable when your frames are crippled.\n\nI've heard a lot of people complaining about PvP matchmaking being imbalanced and some frustrations with certain Battleborn being overpowered. I think the offenders were nerfed recently, but I can't speak much on this as I have yet to try versus. That being said, I got this game to escape from the expectations of hardcore competitive play that I usually expect to see in games like League of Legends. It could be that its imbalanced enough to not be fun, but when I get on to play this game I get on to play a specific character because I enjoy their abilities and their personality. I've heard some pretty funny statements and interactions come out the few times I've had my ♥♥♥ handed to me in the PvE missions, so my outlook is I look forward to hearing the full compliment of my character's voice lines when I start playing PvP. I'm just looking to have some casual fun and I think this game is in a prime position to allow just that without riding the esports hype train that other games do.\n\nLastly it seems Gearbox just gets a lot of hate in general. I'll be honest, I don't know ♥♥♥♥ about this or why this is. I've absolutely loved the Borderlands series and I pre-ordered the deluxe edition of this game with no regrets. I know some major complaints are the $20 off sale in the 2K store that occurred 2 weeks after the game released, but I imagine that was mostly to try to compete with Overwatch's release. A number of players feel ripped off because they payed for it at full price, and while I can appreciate the sentiment, I also feel those players had no business buying the game in the first place. When I spend money on a game, when I pre-ordered Battleborn, I did so with the intention of not giving two ♥♥♥♥♥ if it went on sale the next day. I wanted to spend that money on the game to support its developers in addition to getting access to the most content because I think its worth it. Objectively anyone could argue whether or not its worth the value, I've penny pinched on plenty of games by waiting for sales, but when I find a game that really looks fun and I have the money I will pay full price and more for it. And I still think Battleborn is worth that full price, there's a fair bit of DLC that seems to be planned for release down the road that can be secured with the deluxe edition or buy the season pass separately.\n\nBeyond these points I can't argue much else. Most of the other negative reviews out there are valid (except if they're calling it dead already, that's just unfair) and if they turn you off from the game then don't spend the money on it. I think, like borderlands, this is a game that's only going to get better with time as more content becomes available. I look forward to seeing where the story goes and what future of the games PvP content is, and even if it suffers at present I definitely seeing it experiencing several population spikes as future content is released and sales for the game become available through Steam.\n\nAlso if you do nothing else there's a pretty badass animation that occurs right before the prologue mission in the game. Look it up on youtube "Battleborn Prologue Animation." It got me and friends super hype to play the game and on its own the animation is pretty great.","May 29","true","109.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I own both of them and have played them both pretty extensively. I enjoy them both but for completely different reasons. Getting the most out of either required that you know what you are getting into so as not to feel shorted once either delivers exactly what they said they would.\n\nBattleborn is strategic where as Overwatch is tactical.\n\nA lot of planning has to be done prior to the match starting. Characters and load out choices cannot be changed once the match starts. The TTK in BB is much longer than OW giving players more time to use abilities, counter enemies, and work the battlefield. The inclusion of various structures around the arena adds another level of strategy as players must choose whether to stay and help on the front lines, or fall back to enlist NPCs, construct support stations, spawn special units, or simply use their collected shards to activate their gear.\n\nOverwatch is a highly visceral, extremely fast paced pit fight where TTK is quite often instantaneous. Each character has a maximum of around three abilities that do not change making the game more similar to an arcade style shooter. Characters can be swapped out mid-match as players jockey for the best team counter composition but the way you play them is always the same.\n\nBattleborn is chess where OW is checkers.\n\nBB is a very involved experience that can overwhelm players with choices while OW is a get in and get out quick fix intended to sate the appetite of a particular demographic of players. This is not wrong and I myself continue to log into OW when that is the itch I am looking to scratch. However, BB on the other hand is where I go when I am looking for a more filling, cerebral experience.\n\nWe are in a time in the gaming industry when fast, easy gratification is the selling point and Blizzard is no fool. They crafted Overwatch and then distilled it down to the purest form of this ideal and wrapped it in a highly polished layer of sex knowing that it would sell like crazy to a market where anything involving more than two steps or 5 minutes is considered too hard, or in need of a "quality of life" nerf. This is why they have simple sexy characters, all there at the launch, no development, and never a match that lasts more than 5 minutes.\n\nBattleborn is there for those looking for something different. The fact that BB has a story, gear to work for, load outs to consider, strategies to think about, these are all things that were not meant for the OW players and shouldn't be. They are both brilliant games, and Battleborn gets a lot of bad press recently because it is not OW. Personally I am glad. I love their off sense of humor (Orendi cracks me up), their quirky characters, the story, and simple joy you can tell went into making this game. It is fun plain and simple. OW is very in your face all the time. The community seems more hardcore and I have found much more caustic than Battleborn.\n\nSo there you have it. If you are looking for a light hearted jiggle and the time to think and make mistakes, looking for a great story, off the wall characters, and more to think about than should I hit button A or B, then Battleborn is exactly what you are looking for. If you are looking to be the best of the best and you will play 8+ hours a day if that is what it takes to be that no matter what then OW may be more your cup of tea. I have been playing FPS games since Quake CTF and I am good, not amazing, good and I can tell you, OW is a serious challenge. Battleborn is just... fun. Some times you want one, sometimes the other. But there is definitely room for both and Battleborn is amazingly crafted, well thought out, and well worth the look.","May 29","true","46.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

With 25 heroes to choose from, and 5 (free) DLC heroes upcoming, it's a great deal.\n\nHowever, there are a number of issues that need addressing - the low population means that matchmaking is absolutely awful, if you can even get a game. This may change if more people buy it, which I hope they do. From experience, it doesn't have the level of toxicity that some other MOBAs have, and that's a good thing.\n\nIf you have the patience to learn the ins and outs of an FPS-MOBA hybrid, you'll enjoy yourself. Just don't buy it if you're in Australia, you're gonna have a bad time.","May 26","true","61.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The humor is typical Borderlands style and hilarious. You'll discover jokes and references everywhere, even in the menu. It is well done and truly a labor of love, Gearbox made sure you'll discover new jokes and character responses on multiple mission play-throughs. The story may not be very deep, but the setting is cool and interesting and ties it all together.\n\nThe skills have punch and feel great, the movement is perfect. The music is lovely, the voice acting on a high level, even the german voices did a movie-quality performance!\n\nThe game blends multiple RPG / MOBA elements into the first person shooter at its core, which adds a lot of depth and things to discover. This adds a lot of replay value, as you can not only mix up your team composition, but also skill your selected hero differently each match, to adapt to the game.\n\nThe core mechanics are highly addicting, be it destroying those orange shards and collecting their pieces, searching the map for chests or simply the fluid combat and movement.\n\nYes, the graphical style might put some of you off, but it is like the Saturday morning cartoons we all loved to watch in our childhood. You'll get used to it, and in combination with the humor and the fun atmosphere, you'll enjoy your stay.\n\nA word about the endless comparison to Overwatch: As thousands of people told you before me: These two games are very different. Overwatch is like Team Fortress 2 with heroes, a super simple and fast-paced shooter with hero classes.\nBattleborn has much more depth to its gameplay and complexity, it is more tactical and varied. It also offers you solo or coop PvE gameplay, which Overwatch doesn't.\n\nSo: Go get Battleborn - You were born for this.","May 5","true","61.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The best way I can describe this game is a mix of Borderlands and Smite. After playing the open beta and had an awesome time playing it, I decided to buy the game when it released. I don't regret buying it. It's a lot of fun.\n\nThe game has a lot of content. It has a story mode that you can play solo or coop with friends or other players. It also has multiplayer. There are 3 modes in multiplayer: Capture, Incursion and Meltdown. All modes are fun to play, in my opinion.\n\nBut what I like the most about Battleborn are the characters. Each character is unique and plays differently. You can build the characters in different ways (depending on your playstyle), there are a lot of challenges to complete with each character and a lot more to do. The game runs well and I like the graphics. The only thing I don't like is the queue times, but besides that I think Battleborn is an awesome game.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.

Only played story and never touched PVP during that time. Tried as many characters as I could.\n\nRelease day comes out and it's still a blast. There are many pros and many cons to the game, but if you're just looking for an overall, I say it's a positive that could only get better with added content. So we'll start with the good.\n\n+The main idea of the game is that there are tons of characters to choose from, each with a different playstyle, and that playstyle can morph and mold to the situation with each level they gain. No build is concrete, but some talents are overwhelmingly more powerful than others. I think that will change very soon.\n+Story mode is difficult, but casual. You can take your time, play any character you want, and still have a decent run in solo and cooperative alike. The challenge really seems to reward groups that think about the composition(I.E.: Tank, Damage, Healer).\n+Story mode is replayable through audiologs and different character interactions, along with just playing a different character in the same setting. Mobs aren't randomized, but loot is, so you can plan ahead and expect what's coming. This isn't a rogue-like adventure, sadly.\n+Loot exists. It's not awesome, but it exists. And the legendary gear isn't amazing, but it does feel good to use.\n+All the characters are wacky and awesome in their own special way, the Gearbox way. Which, are all customizable to an extent through unlocks gained by replaying them and doing challenges to unlock their lore entries.\n+Versus mode is very competitive. A mixture of first-person and moba-like playability is what Battleborn shot for, and it landed it correctly. Now it just needs to fix a few problems...\n\nAnd that's where the cons come in.\n\n-The talent system, also called Helix Mutation, is currently pretty badly balanced in my opinion. When it comes to PVE and PVP alike, there are a lot of talents which are just overwhelmingly and objectively better. Plus, you have to unlock some of them, which means going into PVP without a fully leveled character might put you at a disadvantage. Example: Galilea. I'm certain they'll address this kind of problem eventually.\n-Story mode can be frustrating on some maps. Defense mainly, when you have to protect a core from being destroyed, and you have no way of repairing it or directly defending it besides killing the monsters attacking it before they manage to demolish it. This aspect might not be fixed, but it can be played around once you learn the game a bit more.\n-You can just look up the audio logs and spoil the replayability from wacky banter that way.\n-Loot isn't awesome, but it exists. The stats are random, but follow an idea of quality, tpye, and rarity, which all dictate how much shards it costs to activate. Sometimes it matters how much it costs. In PVP, a legendary item can be great, but not if the enemy is running three white items which boost their combat power by a lot right away. But this is going into specifics. If you don't get serious about gear, this won't matter too much.\n-There isn't a heck of a lot of customization you can do for the characters. YET.\n--PVP altogether. Very competitive. NEVER QUEUE ALONE, EVER. If you do, pick an independant DPS character and prey on the weak. You'll usually get ganged up on and die a lot, which will lead to a loss, if your team composition isn't perfect, if your team isn't in sync with what you're doing, or if the enemy is using an exploit to win. Eventually, this has to be changed, because balancing is important to the growth of any competitive game. As of this review, I can say that the PVP is fun as long as you do it as a team. Battleborn is a team game from start to finish, not like a traditional moba where the team splits into lanes and judges the early game on "individual preformance". If you don't communicate for team versus team warfare right away, there won't be much of a team left for the disadvantaged. At least there's a surrender feature...\n---FRAMES. One big problem with Battleborn right now is frame problems with a lot of machines. I know at least 4 people personally who run this under 30FPS with lowest graphics possible, including myself. I had to run this on 1360x786 on windowed mode to even get frames relatively usable in a shooter, and even then I lose a lot of frames when I get into the thick of combat. If this game was more third person, it would be a bit easier I believe, but that just isn't what the game was built around. I believe it's because the game was a bit rushed and didn't get properly optimized...So I am VERY MUCH HOPING it will be addressed, fixed, and resolved for good, so that machines that date earlier than 2015 can run this game without a hitch.\n\nBut even with most of these(PVP centric, honestly) many cons, I still love the game and will keep playing it for however long it takes to be perfected, above and beyond. Battleborn is a game with a lot of potential, and I'm confident with some time, it will succeed in being all I was dreaming of seeing when I first saw the game last year.","May 10","true","111.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's like Overwatch but with MOBA elements. It's like Borderlands but only visuals-wise. It's like SMNC but a bit more dynamic. What I'm saying is Battleborn takes a lot of familiar things and packs it all into a surprisingly fun game. I have to admit that I had my doubts when I bought this, but I don't remember having this much fun in a MOBA-esque game in a very long time.\n\nBattleborn's strengths in my opinion are in its characters and its writing. When viewed as a "story campaign," its Story clearly lacks content and is repetitive. BUT when evaluated as a series of "raid" missions a la Diablo or other similar games, it brings some decent gameplay on the table. It is clearly designed to be played over and over again, seeing as it features alternative dialogue during different runs. The Helix leveling system also helps. (Think DotA, but instead of unlocking/leveling skills, you unlock mutations/modifiers to your skills) There are also dialogue specific to some Battleborn. (My favorite feature.) Gearbox also brought along its over-the-top writing, breathing life into all 25+1 characters. (Shayne & Aurox count as 2, right?) Some of their lines are a bit hit-or-miss, but most of them did make me laugh. A lot.\n\nMultiplayer is a bit mixed for me right now. Save for Capture, Battleborn's multiplayer features MOBA-inspired gamemodes that allow Battleborns to synergize their unique abilities in order to outplay the enemy team. Balancing issues aside, matchmaking is iffy right now because of the lack of players in my region. (SEA) You can get a match relatively quick. (<5 mins) but only in Incursion. (Again, only in SEA. I heard you can queue quickly in any gamemode in NA or EU) There have been some negative statements on the lack of maps, but Gearbox has promised to release new multiplayer content for free. In fact, all multiplayer DLC will be free updates.\n\nYou probably already know about the negatives of this game. Balancing issues, Matchmaking issues, "Lack" of content, Online only, etc. So, I'm just going to use this section of the review to tell you what is going on right now. It's been a bit over three weeks since release, and Gearbox already released a content update a couple of days ago. (featuring a new Battleborn and some well needed adjustments!) They are also actively listening to the community, be it Facebook, Twitter, or the Battleborn subreddit. They have also hotfixed frequently in the last weeks, addressing some of the more immediate concerns. Gearbox also publishes a weekly "Battleborn Battleplan" to keep the community in the loop on the developments of the game.\n\nTL;DR Battleborn is a great game if you are even remotely interested in an FPSMOBA hybrid with colorful, badass characters and a decent amount of content that will only expand from here on out.\nIf you are still on the fence about it, pick it up on a sale. There is an active community albeit a small one, and we could use all the players we can get.","May 22","true","128.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But it's certainly worth 30$ if you stumble upon such a deal.","May 24","true","92.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Tons of characters to choose from and unlock. No micro transactions. I havent even touched on the pvp part but its also very good just not my thing. I like pvp games that include some ai enemies as well and this game does that. Characters are very unique and with over 25 of them that says something.

Almost every mission became either Escort or Defend this point, all ending with a boss battle, i got to the second last mission before i decided it was not worth it. I honestly regret pre-ordering it because i got bored with it so fast.

So here goes.\n\nBattleborn is a first person MOBA-esque game. It has a small campaign of 8 missions and a prologue which can be beaten with 1-5 players in under 8 hours. The meat of the game (to me) is in the multiplayer. There are 3 game modes with 6 maps.\n\nCapture - 3 points on the map where you have to hold to get points, more plots you own the more points you get.\nIncursion - Most similar to a moba gameplay style. You escort minions across the map in order to attack their 2 sentries. That is the main goal, whoever kills both sentries or whoever has the best score after 30 mins, wins.\nMeltdown - 2 lanes where minions spawn on both sides. The goal is to get your minions into the enemies grinder, for every minion scored you get an amount of points (depending on how big the minion was) while also killing enemy minions and players in order to stop them from scoring.\n\nLets go through some pros and cons\n\nCons\n1. Balance - Many people complain about balance issues with specific characters but Gearbox has been issueing out patches every week and modifying characters often. For the most part the blanace is great, out of 26 current characters there are very few that need work (underpowered or overpowered).\n2. Matchmaking - I will not lie, the community of the game is small-ish with the peak at around 2k players and the lowest around 800+. I have heard if you live in another country especially Aus then you might have some connectivity problems as there is even less people playing there. The largest population comes from the US. I live in the US and get connected in 1-5 minutes, the downside is in the early morning aroudn 4-9am the game is pretty quiet and can sometimes cause me to wait up to 20-30 minutes for a match.\n3. Performance - The game is not optimized very well and I have heard it is worse for AMD users. I have a Gtx760 with an AMD Fx-8350, running on an HDD and i have to turn my settings to low-med to get a steady framerate above 50.\n\nThose are the 3 main issues with the game that many people have, but lets get to the Pros.\n\nPros\n1. Characters - There are currently 26 characters to choose from that all feel unique and all are really fun to handle. There are 3 types of Classes, Support (Healers/Shielders), DPS (Ranged/Melee) and Tanks (Ranged/Melee). I personally play support most often and enjoy all 6 of them.\n2. Loot - After each match you get credits that you can save up and buy lootpacks to modify your loadout (3 peices of gear per loadout, loadout chosen before the game starts). The gear is diverse and has a lot of great stats to play around with. Alternatively you can do campaign missions, they feel like a dungeon in an MMO to me where you run them over and over and you find loot there with the possibility of getting mission specific legendary items which have great stats and a special trait attached to them.\n3. Gameplay - I love the gameplay, on any gamemode I have a great time. I prefer Incursion since it takes the longest and you have a higher chance at maxing out your character and doing some real damage then.\n4. Built in voice chat - Its awesome that the game has a built in voice chat system, makes communicating with your teammates that much easier.\n\nOverall Battleborn has its issues for sure, just like any game does. But the gameplay, characters and community make up for that tenfold. I have put in well over 170+ in game hours and I find myself coming back to it every single day to grind some more campaign or to smash face in PVP. I say give it a try.","June 2","true","326.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

For example, I have terrible accuracy, but I can spend many rounds getting turrets and accelerators going while taking down the enemy turrets and accelerators. If I am feeling quick, I can also focus on the center field shards – making it take longer for the enemy to activate their items. One match I did this so well that even though the other team was technically more skilled at killing our team we were able to win due to my team fighting back and me spamming large minions onto the battlefield.\n\nBut if I get tired of the PvP (usually when I get a string of losses), I can always switch over to the campaign maps and either play with a team or by myself. Either way I get levels, credits, and gear that might help with the PvP game.\n\nSpeaking of gear, most gear isn't going to make or break your game. Yeah, legendary gear is really nice but it is expensive to activate and if enough shards aren't available in game then you just wasted an item slot. Often times I will go into a match with 3 common items  and have them all activated within the first 10 minutes of the match or campaign map. It won't win the match for the team but that's a slight edge I am getting that a person equipped with 3 legendaries won't be seeing for a while, if at all.\n\nFinally, I like how in PvP that teams have to be made up of unique characters. You won't have 5 Benedicts flying around blasting the enemy team. While some people see this as a problem, I feel it limits the impact of a character being imbalanced (and let's face it, imbalances are going to happen when you have hero classes, or any game that has classes – it's just the nature of the beast. And the more you have the more likely there will be imbalances). When Galilea was a bit overpowered at release, it wasn't a huge deal for me because I knew I'd never compete against a team of 5 Galileas. Furthermore, by requiring unique characters I never feel like I lost a match because everyone wanted to be the “cool” character.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy this game. I do wish a bit more marketing went into it though because there seems to be a lot of misinformation out as to what this game is actually about.  But if it ends up dying quickly, I still feel I got my money's worth.","June 2","true","113.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I do understand those that were upset after paying full price, and see it go on sale. This happens not just in games, but in all free market products, but it still is aggravating.  This is my first Borderland's franchise purchase.\n\nThe postives:\n1. The Art style is stunning and a real joy to play in.\n1. The story liines are fun, For me they alone justify the price. There are diferent mods offering some replaybility.\n3. The voice acting is fantastic.\n4. The game runs very well. I'm running an i5-4689k paried with 32g and R9 Fury card and I'm at the 60fps constantly\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is dumb. So much so that, fighing with the bots is not the least bit challenging.\n2. Could use a slight blalnce pass. Some characters shine, right now and some ohters not so much.\n3. The PVP is fun, despite the beforemention balance issue, it's fun and challenging. I have never played a MOBA style game to compare it with, but is very interesting.\n\nOverall, I would say it's worth the price on sale.\n\n\n","June 2","true","102.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
