"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/recommended/394510/","mafiaguy7","Mister Maf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/","235 products in account","To my fellow former Alien Swarm junkies: Helldivers is the closest you're going to get to filling your fix. The short of this review is that Helldivers is a brilliant parody of Starship Troopers and the right-wing military-industrial complex, with a healthy dose of Warhammer 40K xenophobia and vehicle design, fused together into a solid A-grade twin-stick co-op shooter.\n\nThe good/game overview\nThe game shares some surface similarities with Alien Swarm, but it handles completely differently. It's made by the creators of Magicka, and it really shows. Characters move and turn more slowly while aiming, but are also able to sprint and hit the deck to avoid enemy fire. Deaths and teamkilling (there is much teamkilling, so don't be mad when it happens) aren't the end of the world, as there is a team "resurrect spell" like there is in Magicka in the form of reinforcements. Indeed, "spellcasting" is one of the game's most defining featues.\n\nIn Magicka, players can cast spells by pressing combinations of different elements using the QWER/ASDF keys, each key representing earth, fire, water, etc. That system has been brought over to Helldivers in the form of the radio. The player can press a button to open up the radio and dial in codes for support assets using the WASD keys. What support assets, called "stratagems", are available to the player is chosen at the start of the game when everyone is selecting their loadouts. Stratagems vary from heavy weapons such as machine guns and rocket launchers, backpack items such as jetpacks and ammo bags, vehicles such as mech suits and tanks, and fire support like bombing runs and orbital strikes.\n\nThis system is interesting because the player is unable to perform combat actions while interacting with the radio, making it very difficult to use in combat unless you get down the muscle memory or are able to get cover from the squad while you dial in the code. This is very important for stratagems like reinforcement and fire support, which can either result in you saving the day or dying miserably after dialing an incorrect code.\n\nMissions appear to be randomly generated in a pre-made open map. That is to say, there is a variety of different objective types, and the locations, number, and types of objectives you must complete are randomly selected based on the difficulty level. Difficulty ranges from level 1 all the way up to level 12, and the harder the difficulty, the more objectives and more enemies there are to deal with. Rewards scale, as one might expect — more powerful stratagems are unlocked at the higher difficulties, and the opportunities to collect the science points used to upgrade your arsenal are more common.\n\nThe reward for difficulty level 12 is a special cape that shows your mettle to other players. There is a character customization system that is 100% cosmetic-only and is a surefire way to make your character look like the badass he or she is as a warrior of the Federation. Weapons and stratagems unlock by leveling up and completing missions, and the number of ones that are actually useful and balanced is actually pretty decent. Like any game, there are trash weapons, but there are enough useful ones to allow the player to create a play style that is totally different from their squadmate's and still be completely viable. All things considered, that's pretty impressive.\n\nAn awesome feature of this game is the ability to mix local and online multiplayer. If you connect your computer to the TV, you can have a couple friends join with Xbox controllers and bring in a fourth person over the Internet. More games need to do this.\n\nAll of this takes place in the context of a galactic war metagame. Completing missions grants "community influence", points that contribute towards beating back the enemy. Humanity is waging a very fine and just war among three different fronts against three enemies, each of which can eventually be defeated and removed from the war. So far, I've yet to see this happen, but it is interesting. It's also where the character of the game and its hilarious Starship Troopers influence is at its best.\n\nThe bad\nAs mentioned earlier, missions are randomly generated based on difficulty. The consequence is a total lack of structured story missions of the kind found in Alien Swarm or many other co-op games. While this on the one hand can keep the player on their toes, the drawback is that it's somewhat uninteresting and can get tiresome doing different variants of essentially the same mission structure.\n\nThe galactic war being tied to unlocks is interesting, but it also has a couple drawbacks. One, it's boring playing through baby-level missions to get a piece of essential equipment. Becoming skilled enough to get the high-level ones will come with time.\n\nThe other more significant downside is that because the war is always shifting, different planets with different unlocks become available and others disappear. After almost 100 hours as of time of writing, I have still yet to unlock the anti-personnel landmines because I can never find a planet that offers it as a mission reward. I have plenty of other equipment and can easily live without it in ordinary missions of any difficulty, but it's still somewhat annoying and it especially reduces my usefulness to approximately zero in a particular boss battle in which mines are essential equipment.\n\nThere is also a hefty amount of equipment that is restricted behind a DLC paywall. A lot of it is useless, a lot of it is useful, and a couple, such as the mech mounting an anti-tank cannon, are borderline pay-to-win. Satchel charges help a lot against bosses and holdout missions, and all-terrain boots make your life a lot easier walking in snow. There is plenty of different equipment in the base game that can approach the same task differently and just as effectively — for example, the armored car with heavy cannon in the base game can do the same job as the DLC anti-tank mech, and it even has significantly more ammunition — but it's very difficult to safely deploy in combat to bail the team out of a losing situation, which is something the mech can do with ease.\n\nFinally, while mixed local/online play is awesome, playing with a gamepad is not. Using a mouse and keyboard, the player is afforded a crosshair while holding down the aim button, and punching in radio codes with the WASD keys is efficient and smooth. Using a gamepad, there is no way to precisely judge aim without a laser sight equipped, costing the player a very valuable inventory slot. Meanwhile, the directional pad on the Xbox 360 controller that most PC gamers use if they have one is also subpar, and that's bad news when using the radio, which requires fast correct inputs under high pressure; the d-pad makes this difficult, to say the least.\n\nConclusion/tl;dr\nGood things\nSolid twin-stick shooter mechanics\nHilarious Starship Troopers-inspired setting\nMagicka-inspired radio "spellcasting" system\nVaried and versatile unlocks\nGalactic war metagame creates a sense of community\nMixed local and online multiplayer\nBad things\nGalactic war metagame can make it either easy, hard, or boring to get specific unlocks\nRandomly-generated missions can get stale\nLots of DLC equipment in varying levels of usefulness\nSubpar experience if using a gamepad instead of a keyboard and mouse\nVerdict: A\nTwin-stick shooter fans, co-op fans (both online and couch), and Alien Swarm fans will find a home in Helldivers. If you're none of these, consider giving it a go anyway with Steam refunds in mind. I have several friends who aren't twin-stick shooter fans who had a lot of fun with it. While it has a few weaknesses, the overall game is a shining co-op experience.\n\nUpdate April 2016\nAt my character limit, but see the forums about a critical matchmaking bug!","December 17, 2015","true","156.2"," 218 of 224 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","218","224","12","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrappywu/recommended/394510/","scrappywu","YoBananaBoY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrappywu/","161 products in account","I am posting here hoping to reach  people or the devs to inform people about the negative review regarding the DLC. I have noticed that many of the recent negative reviews, including the top, most helpful review, is bashing Helldivers for their "DLC practice". Mainly being that they think there is no way to upgrade from the regular edition to the DDE edition if you bought the standard edition/vanguard edition previously. The negative reviews stem from that fact that they believe the only way to acquire the DLC is to purchase all the DLC separately costing more than double the base game. This is not the case. The mega reinforcement pack costs $25. Adding this pack to the standard/vanguard preorder edition means you are paying $45 versus the $40 DDE, hardly a difference worth complaining over.\n\nTo the devs, the mega reinforcement pack is pretty hidden in the DLC page and I only came across it by chance. If you were perhaps more transparent with this purchasing option, I am sure it would calm many of the negative reviews. Some ways to do this would be to adverstise this DLC pack on the main store page before all the individual ones and also referring to it as a DDE upgrade. Perhaps even just responding to the top negative review right now explaining this would help others see that your game is fantastic and that the "DLC practice" is not screwing over those that pre-ordered the Vanguard edition. I am commenting here in hopes of keeping Helldiver's from losing its overwhelmingly positive rating that it deserves over something as simple as a misunderstanding and obscure buying option of the mega reinforcement pack.","December 8, 2015","true","32.8"," 249 of 289 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","249","289","3","18"

It's a top down co-op shooter at its finest. Arrived at the scene, complete the objectives, then wait for extraction. Failed one of the objectives? Not a big deal soldier, get your ♥♥♥ to the extraction point and live to fight another day!\n\nIn this game, you are a Helldiver. You, alone or with friends or strangers, will be deployed to a planet, which you can choose, and try to complete missions in those planets. Each missions is procedurally generated and has its own objectives. Some of the objectives are specific to an enemy race, but sadly there are not a lot of variety on it. Everytime you complete a planet, you will gain some influence points. And then you jump to other planet, complete the missions, then gain another influence points. These influence points are important to take over regions, and when all the regions are under Super Earth control, then you can participate in an event, the final push to enemy's home world, to defeat them once and for all.\n\nAs you rise through the ranks to become the Admiral of Super Earth and helping Super Earth to regain control of the galaxy, you will unlock weapons, stratagems, and perks to help you eradicate your space adversaries. Each weapons and stratagems can be upgraded by using research points, which can be gained by getting samples while you are on the field, or by simply ranking up. Oh, and you can also change your appearance, by the way. Just saying.\n\nAlthough advanced or modified weapons and stratagems helps (a lot), but teamwork is still the most important thing if you want to complete all the objectives, especially in harder difficulties. Even a Private can help a lot, as long as that person isn't dicking around. Stick to your teammates, move as a team, all of you must become a unit to be successful. Obviously the devs had this in mind, so in order to make all the players work together, they decided to lock the camera, so you and your teammates can't wander too far from each other. I understand and actually liked the camera lock, but sometimes the camera lock can be annoying since it limit your view.\n\nAs you can expect from the creators of Magicka, you will die, a lot. But if you are looking for stupid and hilarious accidental deaths, then you are gonna be a little bit disappointed. It's an accidental death, so yeah there is a funny side to it. But there are not much variations of it, and when sometimes in Magicka you can be overwhelmed by the combinations and you can accidentally killed yourself or your friends, in this one that's just not gonna happen. I guess i just expected too much in this aspect.\n\nIn terms of performance, so far so good. Constant 60fps. Never had an issue, no CTD, no sudden lag. Lack graphical options, but i can't say i expect more.\n\nIn the end, HELLDIVERS is a fun game. I had fun with randoms, and i'm sure it will be even more fun to play with friends. The upgrade system add a bit of depth, and the influence system made the game more immersive, although to understand it completely i think you need a bit of googling.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR, A fun top down, twin-stick, whatever-you-call-it shooter. A great PC port, stable performance. Try Alien Swarm, it's free, if you like it, then there is a big chance you'll like this too.","December 5, 2015","true","47.4"," 106 of 115 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","106","115","4","2"

Today, at this very moment, you are contemplating the most difficult decision of your life. You're thinking to yourself: "Do I want to protect my homeland, earn the privilege to have children, and gain the respect of my peers?" Or "Am I content with being a coward and most likely an Alien sympathizer?" There's a war out there and Super Earth needs your help!\n\nFight for Democracy! Join the HELLDIVERS!\n....\nYou wanna know something? Starting off this review with such a cheeky intro, probably isn't the greatest idea. What I should have said was "anything that can go wrong, will go wrong". HELLDIVERS aka Murphy's Law: the videogame is not to be taken lightly. It can be raucous and exhilirating entertainment, but it can also cause finger-pointing, object-throwing, and enough expletives to block out the Super Sun. Also, while this game is excellent in many ways, it also has a handful of design-decisions that keep it just shy from classic status. Still, if I were to end this review right now, I'd say that this game is very highly recommended.\n\nBut the review is far from over, so allow me to continue.\n\nIf you've seen Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, then you already know this game's story. Super Earth, the greatest planet in the Universe, has declared war on three factions: the cyborgs, bugs, and illuminate. At one time or another, one of these factions may or may not have unleashed a devastating attack on Super Earth. This tragedy must not go un-punished. Aside from destroying every last alien you confront, you're also expected to exploit their resources, assist colonization efforts, and broadcast the message that Super Earth's democracy is the greatest.\n\nTo really enjoy HELLDIVERS, you're expected to play cooperatively. This is a four-player game with both online and couch support. Aside from the introduction, there isn't really any campaign mode or much of a story. You assist the war effort by completing missions on various planets.\n\nThe most intriguing aspect of this game is that friendly-fire is always on and can never be disabled. While this game can be considered an isometric twin-stick shooter, you can't simply point and fire. No, you have to point and then fire. If you're not paying attention, your next shot might go through a team-mate's skull instead of into the weak-point of a bug, cyborg, or illuminate. This extends to nearly every action in the game. Your re-supply air-drops aren't going to be welcomed with open arms if they crush your allies. These rules make for a game that's a lot more interesting than most others of its ilk. Over time you'll develop an understanding of what actions your team-mates will take. The best teams will operate as one, while the worst will produce a comedy of errors.\n\nA lot of the entertainment comes from adapting to the myriad of situations that can occur. By using strategems, players can receive unique weapons, call ordnance on stronger foes, or acquire vehicles that makes traversing each planet easier. Some of the heavier equipment (such as the RL-112) benefit more with one player carrying the gun, and the other carrying the ammo. It really drives home just how important good team-work can be, and it's the difference-maker on the hardest difficulties. The enemy is infinite, and as long as their patrols spot the players, they will bring as much force as necessary. At this point, the best response is usually to run away. Almost every enemy can be escaped, and will even despawn if you and your allies get out of the immediate area. In short, stealth is the #1 key to success, but not particularly entertaining.\n\nAs you continue to play this game, you'll notice that if you can eliminate patrols, then you won't have to worry about much of anything else. This tends to be the optimal way to play, since dealing with adversity will waste time (and leads to deaths). Aside from missions that require destroying a set number of enemies, or boss-fights, the bulk of the game can feel rather barren. All of the neat strategems and intriguing co-op ideas will fall by the wayside, as long as players are sharp and quick enough to take care of patrols.\n\nThis is usually the reason why I play with random players. Jumping into games where I don't have any idea what the other players are doing, and then adapt to their behavior/equipment, helps keep the game fun. I like to see danger, I like to see terrible situations, and hopefully we as a team can turn things around to accomplish our objectives. Videogames tend to "grow" with the player. As the player becomes more skilled, the game becomes more challenging to compensate (through difficulty settings or other means). HELLDIVERS can only grow so much, and that can be attributed to the design-decisions of stealth. If there were more missions where the enemy has fortified positions, or the players had to invade planets where there more than just patrols wandering around, it would definitely keep the game fresh for veterans.\n\nSome encounters in this game could also use a little tuning. For example, there are three bosses. The boss of the bug faction does a lot of burrowing in and out of the ground. I've noticed that all too often, shots that look like they hit don't do any damage. For such a large and mostly immobile target, this creature has a surprising number of invulnerability frames. As the fight progresses, larger and more dangerous bugs join in. It's not enough that there are threats from every direction, but the probability for actually damaging the boss drops to .01%. Basically what I'm saying is that this isn't a fun battle. My suggestion would be to slightly decrease the damage that some of the enemies do, or maybe not give certain bugs so much armor. At least when entering a boss-battle, players have ample time to attempt it, and change strategies if their attempts fail. A person only has so much patient though, and rage-quits are always a possibility.\n\nAs you play this game, you're bound to notice other players with unfamiliar weapons, strategems, and perks. A lot of these are acquired by completing missions, but there are also a lot of them that are straight-up DLC. I'm... well... not terribly fond of this practice. For example, there is a perk known as the all-terrain boots. This allows players to not be slowed down by marshes or snow. There are planets that are nothing but snow. While it can be considered a situationally useful perk, these all-terrain boots are practically forced on the player. If I opt out of buying this DLC, and my team-mates do, then I'm going to be the one holding everybody back. I've also become overly reliant on the LAS-16 Sickle (a DLC gun). I'm not sure how well I'd do if I went back to any of the other guns, and I don't want to think about it.\n\nWith stealth being overpowered and the unfortunate DLC situation, I can't quite call HELLDIVERS a perfect game. Usually when reviewing a game, I don't even think of the word "perfect", but I came awfully close here. The cooperative aspects are absolutely brilliant, the sound-direction is flawless, the mechanics of gun-play and controls are spot-on, and the respect given to friendly-fire is a revelation. It's going to be exceedingly difficult for me to play any other online game that doesn't punish me for shooting my team-mates. This game really does almost everything right, which makes the aspects where it falls just a little short, stand out that much more. Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend HELLDIVERS.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 9","true","20.8"," 82 of 87 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","82","87","17","4"

This game is great! It's a lot of fun, very challenging and it's got some really nice attention to detail but I have to give a "Not Recommended" due to the DLC practices and the lack of information on the way DLC is handled.\n\nRight now the base game is the game, the three free content "expansions"(They didn't add much to warrant naming them expansions; three new unit types, three new boss planets/types, three new mission types and a new planet) and that's it. The DDE gives you all the DLC for an extra €10 which you probably won't buy considering you wouldn't think the DLC included in the DDE is 1. Every single bit of DLC on offer and 2. Wouldn't impact the game to make it significantly easier(Or P2W).\n\nThe DLCs itself is a mixed bag. Some of them look pretty useless unless you really want the cosmetic gear but some of them seem like must haves and would make the game incredibly easy by comparison with those who have the base game. The only option to get what the DDE nets you other than buying the DDE outright? Well, if you look at the store page it lists all DLC for €43. Don't let that fool you, the devs cheekily hid the cheaper option that nets you all DLC for €20 called the "Reinforcements Mega Pack" and the only way to get to it is to check individual DLCs and scroll down a bit until the pack is viewable. Even at that, that's twice as much as the DDE would have cost you. Is there any option to upgrade to the DDE? Nope! None. Why not? Because they obviously want to get as much money from you as possible upon realising your foolishness in bot spending the full €30 on the game to begin with with little to no information(If you pre-ordered) on the DLCs on offer.\n\nIt will only be after you play the game, get in and see how much needed some of the DLC is that you'll realise how screwed over you were and how the DLC makes the game P2W. It makes it considerably easier with abilities that give auto targeting to instant kill tank units where base "Strategems" require you to land these barrages on top of the target and time it to land within three seconds or so. Don't want the hassle? Pay for the Precision DLC pack: Anti-Tank/Armoured missiles will auto target the tanks or armoured units if they're on the same screen where the base "vanilla" DLC lands right on top of where you drop the beacon.\n\nHow about Anti-Tank mechs or tanks? Well, for the price of €4 you can unlock an anti-tank mech, a massive overpowered tank and a two man motor-bike for funsies! Or you could have paid €10 extra before you bought the game and gotten EVERYTHING included. Pity... now your only option is to pay for DLC individually or pay €20 to get what the DDE would have given you.\n\nIt's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ especially to those of us who pre-ordered and had no idea what the DLC was or how it would affect gameplay or how much easier it would make things or give you a massive boost in progression. You get a tank if you pay for it. You won't know it until you actually play the game for a while but there isn't a tank in the game. The DLC is the only way to get the tank!\n\nIt's a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practice and there should have been more information given to us when we were asked to pay up but they didn't. They just listed DLC packs, no information on them and gave the illusion that the pre-order bonus of the Ranger DLC was unique but it's not... It's probably the more useless packs in the game.\n\nThe game is fantastic but if you're going to get it and think you'll love it just spend the extra €10 otherwise you're going to be feeling really sour about your purchase.","December 7, 2015","false","55.5"," 949 of 1,316 people (72%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","72","949","1","43","84"

Set in a scifi environment, you are part of an elite squad of soldiers, the Helldivers, sent forth from your home planet of Super Earth to spread justice, liberty, and democracy, to alien scum, etc etc. Now, it sounds pretty generic and B-rated movie nonsense, but honestly it shines as a strong co-op game that hinges well on good teamwork and coordination, while not ruining it for people looking for more casual fun too with the different difficulty levels of missions.\nHowever, the biggest point that stands out for the game is it's unique supply drop system, called "strategems". Basically, you can call down extra firepower or support by plugging in a set combination of directional keys and then waiting for them to arrive. While it seems simple, it can get very hectic to do so while under fire and being swarmed by the enemy, so it adds a fun challenging charm to an already amusing game.\nThe small quips your soldiers make while fighting are humerous, the guns feel nice when firing, the aliens die satisfyingly, and you get a good sense of accomplishment when completing missions, especially if you can manage to do so without dying.\nSpeaking of dying, this game was made by the same folks who thought up Magicka, so yes, there is friendly fire, and yes, you can in fact be crushed by the strategems you call in if you're not careful enough. so have fun with that, since it adds more to the teamwork dimension of the game.\nDoes the friendly fire take away from the game? Honestly, after playing the game for a bit with a mix of pubs and friends alike, I can safely say that it really doesn't. More often then not, you'll be killed by the aliens or the strategems you called in, not by your teammates, unless they're actively trolling you. If that's the case, you can kick people being problematic from your game and continue on your merry way of spreading democracy in the name of Super Earth.\nI highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a good priced co-op shooter, and don't let the DLC fool you, you don't need all of them (or any of them for that matter) to enjoy the game. They just add some armor customization cosmetics and a few alternative versions of weapons you can already unlock by simply playing the game itself, only 2 or 3 actually make a noticeable difference and are "worth" getting (and I use the term "worth" loosely here)\nAs a whole, great fun, totally recommend it, grab it with some friends and get to shooting!","December 10, 2015","true","17.2"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","60","68","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomkl/recommended/394510/","tomkl","TeeKay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tomkl/","130 products in account","This game, despite having a few major flaws, it still pretty fun for a while. I wanted to write an informative negative review about something other than complaining about the DLC or controls, which is what almost all the other negative reviews are about.\n\nIn my opinion, there are three major things wrong with this game:\n1.  On higher difficulties, the game revolves largely around avoiding being detected by scouts but the mechanics of the scouts are dull and sometimes frustrating. This is by far the biggest problem with Helldivers.\n\nOn the higher difficulties, mission success is very, very reliant on remaining mostly undetected.  The map has wandering scouts, who call for backup if they are not killed within about 2 seconds of being alerted.  Their sight range is about half a screen length, so they can sound the alarm within 2 seconds of appearing on the edge of your screen.  This itself is not a problem, but . . .\n\nIn multiplayer, all characters are locked on the screen and can not move the camera independently.  However, the scouts' alert range remains the same.  The result is that the scouts can sound the alarm from off-screen, unless the players are traveling in a tight group in the center of the screen, practically shoulder to shoulder, which is very hard to do unless you're playing with friends who are good at co-operating.  This makes the multiplayer awkward and frustrating at times.\n\nBecause the game revolves so much around not getting detected, players must stop and press TAB to open the map every few seconds to try see the approaching scouts on the map before they appear on screen.  Some players bring lots of ammo (or a weapon that doesn't consume ammo) and shoot them off-screen.  This kind of gameplay gets very, very stale within a few hours, yet it's what you'll be spending 90% of your time doing if you play on the highest difficulty.\n\nAs a result of all this, it's much easier to play the game alone, so your character is center-screen and scouts can never catch you by surprise.  You'll still be opening the map every 5 seconds, to make sure you're not facing the wrong direction when they come.  Playing alone gets boring.  A game that encourages playing alone has problems.\n\nThis could be mostly fixed by making each players camera move independently, or completely changing the alert mechanics, preferably the latter.\n\nOn top of all this, once you do start soloing, or playing with a group that's decent at killing scouts, the game becomes way too easy.  No one should be able to consistently solo the hardest difficulty within their first 20 hours on a game, yet after about 20 hours of play, soloing the hardest difficulty was so easy to me that it became boring.  I may have been able to do it even earlier had I thought to attempt it.\n\n2.  The controls are awkward.  This is more of a problem for newer players, because you do get used to the awkward controls eventually, but it makes the first few hours of play much less enjoyable than they would be otherwise.  Also, because the scouts sound the alarm very quickly, being able to shoot them as fast as possible is very important, and the awkward controls add a very not-fun layer of difficulty to this.  Awkward controls shouldn't be used to add difficulty to a game, unless it's in a hilarous and fun way such as Magicka's spell casting system.\n\nWith mouse and keyboard, the awkwardness comes from the fact that the cross-hair does not show up on the screen while the player is not aiming down their sights (which greatly slows your move speed).  The cross-hair also resets to the middle of your screen (or a few feet in front of your character, if you use that option) every time you stop aiming down sights.  The result is cumbersome and unintuitive aiming controls that frequently make you lose track of your cross-hair.  It also forces you to pick up and move your mouse a lot.  The white cross-hair is also difficult to see in some maps.\nA lot of players are suggesting that the cross-hair be always visible, which would certainly help, and it sounds like the developers are considering it.\n\nOn a gamepad, it's simply difficult to know where you're aiming, and difficult to aim precisely.  Often you'll see gamepad players fire a couple rounds just to see where they're aiming, then adjust their aim on target and fire again, effectively using their first few bullets as a laser pointer.  Of course, you can run with the laser pointer perk all the time (and many gamepad users do this) but this limits your loadout significantly.  Aiming feels so much better with the laser pointer perk (and so bad without it) that I think it should be there by default and not take up your perk slot.\n\n3.  Some important (but not essential) items are sold as DLC.There are a few items in the DLC packs that are very helpful, although it's still very possible to manage without them.  I dislike when games sell important items as DLC.\nThe items I'm referring to are the UAV drone, All Terrain Boots, and Exo-51 Lumberer Exosuit.  Most of the other DLC items are not game changing, and many of them are hardly ever used.\n\nAt this point, I've probably made this game sound pretty bad.  Helldivers was still pretty fun for the first 30 hours or so, but the lack of difficulty and poor stealth mechanics make the game get stale much faster than I would have liked.  With some changes, I could easily see myself playing Helldivers for hundreds of hours and rating it as one of my favourite games.","December 23, 2015","false","33.7"," 276 of 402 people (69%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","69","276","402","13","15"

After launching on PlayStation consoles back in March, Helldivers is at last making an appearance on Steam. In Helldivers you play as a helldiver (you don’t say) trying to rid the galaxy of three enemy factions to protect Super Earth and all of its wonderful, freedom loving inhabitants! The more freedom you deliver to the galaxy, the more cool stuff you unlock in the form of armour, weapons and stratagems (I’ll explain this in more detail later on).\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nHelldivers is a good looking game with great design. I’m not really sure what you’d call the style of graphics this game but you can tell from the screenshots it looks good. As I said everything is well designed, particularly the enemies, and everything looks good even from the camera angle in the game. The UI is clean and simple, effectively giving the player all the info they need. It can sometimes get in the way of things if you’re towards the bottom of the screen but it’s translucent and can be scaled so it’s not too bad. One thing that a minority (I think it’s fair to call it that judging by the positive to negative review ratios) have been up in arms about is the fact that the game is screen-locked, meaning you all four players are on screen at all times and the camera moves to make this possible. While the argument against it has its merits (see forum threads if you’re interested) I thought it was a good design choice. That doesn’t mean I particularly like being screen-locked, what I do like though is how it forces the players to work together which is incredibly important in this game.\n\nGameplay\nIn Helldivers your aim is to wipe out the three enemy factions to ensure Super Earth’s safety. This is done by reaching the home-worlds of each faction and taking them out. At the time of writing this review we haven’t reached the home-worlds in the current galaxy campaign and so I’m not actually sure what these home-world missions entail. So what’s this galaxy campaign? The galaxy campaign is what you see when you look at the map on your ship. Each sector between Super Earth and an enemy home-world requires the players to earn a certain amount of influence by completing missions in said sector. The galaxy campaign is shared by PC users as well as PlayStation players and resets when all three factions are wiped out or Super Earth falls. If a previously held sector is about to be re-captured by an enemy faction a City defence event is triggered which lasts for just over an hour and awards double exp for every mission done. If enough influence is earned the sector is held.\n\nNow onto the missions which you’ll be doing more regularly than that. Each planet in a given sector is randomly generated, has a difficulty level between one and twelve (twelve being the hardest), has between two and four missions and has a reward for the player upon completing all missions. The missions themselves require you to complete certain objectives such as performing a geological survey or escorting some stranded humans to a safe location. Some of these objectives, as well as your stratagems, require you to enter a combination of keys to complete it, basically a QTE. This is another thing that some people don’t like and while I wouldn’t say it’s my favourite part of the game I did like it being there, it adds a nice bit of variety to the gameplay.\n\nSo what are those stratagem things I mentioned earlier? These are defensive, offensive and equipment based drops which aid you in completing your mission. An example of a defensive stratagem is a machinegun turret that fires at enemies (and you if you’re in the way). There are also objective specific stratagems which are available to you when necessary.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning for gameplay is the fact the game has friendly fire. Generally one or two shots won’t damage you but anything more than that is going to do serious damage and might even kill you so you have to keep an eye out at all times. Another thing that some people have a serious problem with. I don’t think anyone, apart from the very tiny population of trolls, would say that they like having friendly fire but this is a hardcore game and this does make it more challenging so I personally wouldn’t want to see it go.\n\nMiscellaneous The last thing that people have a problem with (this is where the negative reviews come from) is the control scheme for KB&M. How it works is that your crosshair is only visible when aiming with the RMB and when aiming your movement and turn speed is decreased. I wasn’t keen on this to begin with though I did get used to it. I can understand why people are so against this as it is rather hard to get used to but once you have gotten used to it I think it’s pretty good. The devs have said they’ll consider changing it but the reason it’s like this is because the ways they tried it with the crosshairs on made using KB&M significantly easier than using a gamepad.\nThere’s not a huge amount of it but the voice acting in the game is good. The majority of the dialogue in the game comes from your characters’ one liners such as “How do you like the taste of freedom?” or “Would you like a cup of liber-tea”. They are rather amusing though can get irritating, thankfully there’s an option to turn them off!\nThere are quite a lot of weapons and stratagems to unlock and they all have upgrades purchased with research points earned by gathering science samples or levelling up.\nEach faction is made up of quite a few enemies, each with a very different combat style.\nSolo play is possible but some of the in-game objectives are incredibly difficult to do without help.\nVerdict\nEssential Purchase.\n\nHelldivers is an outstandingly good hardcore co-op game that manages to be incredibly challenging and fun at the same time.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 7, 2015","true","25.5"," 126 of 173 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","126","173","5","23"

You fight agaisnt 3 races over random generated mission on planets. The story invlolves about SUPER EARTH that has the only right way of life; DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE and LIBERTY.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmazingAssonanceAlex/recommended/394510/","AmazingAssonanceAlex","Doom Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AmazingAssonanceAlex/","392 products in account","You drop in with your friends, kill a bunch of aliens from 1 of 3 factions (crustacean bugs, cyborgs that are a bit like Warhammer 40k's orcs, or the illuminates that are based on the trope of super-intelligent aliens with their gleaming white robots), call in drops called "stratagems" and kill everything.\n\nThe game works by generating a small map with several objectives (the number and type of objectives changes on higher difficulties). The objectives vary from just capturing an area to performing geological surveys to disarming minefields to escorting people from one point to another and so much more.\n\nSingleplayer is completely viable, which is very nice. But the game really opens up with multiplayer (up to four people total). And all bullets flying through the air are capable of hurting you, be they from the enemies, you, your friends, your turrets, your friends' turrets, etc. Going prone puts you out of danger from all that, and even helps you survive explosions. One possible objective of the game is to blow up a structure using a massive explosive that you have to call in and activate; jumping to prone right before it goes off and surviving is incredibly satisfying.\n\nAt the end of every mission, after completing all the other objectives, you have to get to the extraction point, call it in, and hold out until the ship gets there. At this point, everybody pulls out their mechs and turrets and heavy machine guns, and all the enemies know you're there and you get swarmed. But it's incredible because everyone is firing like mad, and the guns feel powerful - it reminds me of how the Dawn of War games would be with big-scale shootouts and ridiculous firepower.\n\nOn top of it all, there's a huge number of unlockables - weapons, perks, stratagems, upgrades - that you'll go hunting for. Some of them you get from leveling up, other times you get them as a part of completing planets (each planet has 2-3 missions), and all the upgrades you get from research points that you find in the map or from leveling up. There's so much to get, and none of it changes the game so much to make you feel pointlessly invincible.\n\nThe DLC has some stigma because it was there on release. The thing a lot of people don't realize is that those were released slowly over time while this game was on the PlayStation, and it would be pretty unfair to get them for free when the PS players had to pay for them all. Also, none of the items are game-changers, and you can do without them. Furthermore, buying them supports the incredible Arrowhead.\n\nThat said, they've already released 3 free content expansions during its time as a PlayStation exclusive, and from what I understand, they intend to make more. That means all the meaningful content like new planets, enemies, or mechanics aren't lost on people who don't want to pay extra for the game. They don't want to split their community, especially because it plays such a pivotal part of the central game. All Helldiver players everywhere indirectly take part in a universe-wide war with the three factions, fighting for territory or defending planets.\n\nTL;DR: Just buy it.The price might seem a bit steep at first, but then you realize that the game has so much there. There are no gimmicks or tricks, it's just plain fun. All in all, I have little to no complaints. The game is extremely replayable, fantastically fun, works well in singleplayer, and shines in multiplayer.\n\nEdit:\nThere's some negative opinions about the game's keyboard and mouse controls. I've tried them, and I think they need a bit of getting used to but don't hinder the gameplay much at all. That said, the game does play better on a gamepad (it's called a twin-stick shooter for a reason) and even if the keyboard and mouse controls were 100% perfect it still would not be as good as playing with a gamepad. Gamepads are simply better controllers for certain kinds of games, and this is one of them. Just get a gamepad if you really mind the K&M controls :)","December 12, 2015","true","21.1"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","44","48","3","0"

Everything deals damage to you, and the game plays like a couch co-op game when multiple people are in a game, where the camera is focused in on the host while everybody else moves around within the confines of that camera's field of view.\n\nHelldivers is an absolute blast to play with friends, randoms online, or even yourself. The game is balanced well in singleplayer, where you're given more than one life, but it's still best played online so you can experience the various unique mechanics that make teamwork as necessary as it is. It's not anywhere near as simple as evading enemies and spraying bullets all over the place like most twin-stick shooters. Instead, you'll find yourself picking your targets before firing, and ensuring that no teammates are going to get caught in the crossfire. Leveling up also rewards you with upgrade points and new gear to spend them on, allowing for an even more diverse group of helldivers ready to take on the game's strongest foes. There's also a lot of time management and cover fire necessary to throw out the various abilities you can select from, as they're cast with unique button combinations, and required for necessary functions such as reviving teammates and supplying your team with more ammunition.\n\nOn top of the great looking visuals and audio, online voice chat quality is top notch, and there's text-based chat as well.\n\nYou're getting a ton of content for your money with the vanilla version of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BYODB/recommended/394510/","BYODB","Tallahassee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BYODB/","80 products in account","I've put a pretty good amount of time into this game, and I can honestly say I enjoyed almost all of it.\n\nSo, why the negative review?\n\nWell, I'll tell you why. And no, it doesn't have anything to do with DLC that was pushed out in the year prior to it's PC release or the porting from the PS3. (Although frankly those will be issues for some people. Read the other reviews if you want more on those issues.)\n\nThere are three reasons I can't recommend this title.\n\n1) The price.\n\nThe base game's price of $20 is about what it would be worth with all the DLC included. Why is that, you ask? Namely because after you unlock all of the Stratagem (you should have them all by level 25-30 out of 50 levels, without farming, which should be roughly 40-60 hours) the gameplay becomes monotonous in the extreme. By the time you're level 15-20, you'll likely have every stratagem you'll ever use if you choose wisely.\n\nThe maps are randomly generated, and that's a wonderful attempt to make each map feel unique, but all it really does is slightly alter the shape of the map and the location of a small selection of objectives to complete. It could have been amazing if there were either more enemy types or more types of planet to fight on, but there simply aren't enough of them to make the RNG of map generation feel that meaningful to me. It's still just a volcanic world, an ice world, a desert world, or a forest world, or if you're super lucky a city map once in a blue moon.\n\n2) Overly repetitive content.\n\nThere are only 3 enemy types, and 5 'biomes'. One biome, the city map, only opens in the rare circumstance when you lose a sector of space, and is only open for two hours, so really there are only 4 biomes you'll see on a regular basis.\n\nThat's pretty bare bones, but to make it even worse there are only a few types of objective too. While the RNG map creation does switch things up, that's more a matter of placement vs. what you're actually doing. Also, while there are many 'Stratagem' abilities only a handful of those abilities are useful for the limited amount of objectives in the game.\n\nEventually, you realize that the only objectives that provide even a slight challenge are defense style objectives and among those only three provide any actual challenge. Even among those three, each of them are defused from 'slightly hard' to 'effortless' simply by using the Distractor Beacon. (Which, by the way, should be properly labeled 'EZ Mode' since it effectively breaks the entire game by allowing you to lure all patrols to an area where your team isn't.)\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, you don't even need the Distractor beacon. On high difficulty modes, it isn't actually any harder than the easiest difficulty modes. The difference between Difficulty 1 and Difficulty 12 is mostly negligible as long as you kill the patrols since if you kill any patrol you come across you never spawn any enemies. The patrols don't become appreciably harder between 1-12, so effectively there is no difference once you're used to the game.\n\nEssentially, the game will feel very 'carebear' past 50+ hours and the only mitigation to that are new or bad players joining your game that don't understand the mechanics of shooting patrols in a timely fashion.\n\nThis becomes even more problematic when you start to realize that the biggest threat to you in Helldivers is actually your own team. On top of that, there is absolutely no way to filter your lobby so that level 1 people can't drop into your helldive mission. In my opinion that's pretty unforgivable since I can't even begin to tell you how many level 1-5 players have dropped into my missions only to immediately shoot everyone and instantly lose the map. Sometimes, it's funny and awesome but a lot of the time it's just griefing or annoying. Not to say I don't like the TK element, because I definitely do, but a new or even intermediate player is just as likely to take your head off as an enemy.\n\n3) War Campaign Mechanics\n\nThis could have been a really great thing, and in theory it sounds good. With each map you complete, you add points to a total for that sector of space. Everyone's maps in that sector count towards the goal, and once the total is high enough you conquer that sector. You conquer each area of space leading up to an enemy homeworld, then you assault their homeworld and knock them out. That sounds great, right?\n\nIt does until you realize that once you take out that homeworld, you can not fight that faction again until the war is over. This means that if you like to fight bugs, too bad once they're out. You won't see them again, or be able to fight them again, for a week or longer.\n\nInstead, you'll be forced to fight the other two factions until they're completely defeated, which can and will take days or even weeks to complete. It's also no coincidence that the order in which the planets are generally defeated have been Bugs > Cyborgs > Illuminate, and believe me when all you can fight is the Illuminate you're going to start questioning your sanity pretty quickly since all the other problems I've mentioned above are magnified given that each homeworld has a set biome type. (Ice for Cyborg, Forest for Illuminate, Desert for Bugs)\n\nThat's right. The game locks you into fighting one enemy type, on one biome, until everyone finally gets their act together and gangs up to actually beat them. It's even worse if you don't defeat them, since then you have to start the process of knocking them out all over again and people hate fighting the Illuminate so much that this routinely happens even though everyone knows that just prolongs the process.\n\nOn top of factions becoming locked off once they're defeated, the stratagems themselves are randomly assigned to various worlds within each factions space. Once that faction is defeated, you can no longer unlock those abilities. So, if you join the game and you want napalm bombs but they're in a defeated enemies space too bad. You can't have them until the next war, period. Long term, that isn't an issue but in the short term it's beyond annoying.\n\n\nConclusion!\n\nSo ultimately, this is a pretty fun game for a little while but if you're looking for something that has decent replay value sadly I can't recommend this.\n\nIf you want just a little casual game to fill in an hour or two a week this title may be for you, but at the same time you'll be at the mercy of the War Campaign on what you can and can't play that week.\n\nThere are so many missed opportunities in this game that it's palpable, and I think you'll see a lot of players shed this game as soon as they hit the 100-200 hour mark for all the reasons listed above unless Arrowhead start pumping out more DLC to beef up the actual content of the game beyond new Stratagem's and outfits.\n\nThere are several other issues with this game too, don't think this is a definitive list. Most of the other issues this game has I can get past, but unless something drastic and fundamental changes with this title I will likely never play it again.","January 21","false","209.7"," 304 of 458 people (66%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","66","304","458","18","15"

If you recall Starship Troopers or Robocop (original) from Paul Verhoeven then you can imagine the exaggerated, ignorantly utopian world which is pretty much a satire for everything we know. This feeling has been delivered here by Arrowhead Game Studios in a game format, which is entertaining and addictive.\n\nIt's an isometric action shooter for 1-4 players where you are an Super Earth elite soldier battling 3 alien races throughout the galaxy sectors, with progress being accumulated by every player's contribution by completion of objectives. Which in turn leads to additional, major events.\n\nGame has an incredible amount of weapons - from direct damage firearms, mechanized exosuits, APCs, tanks, to turrets, call-in airstrikes and technological gadgets. All of them can be upgraded by receiving research points from leveling or gathering special objectives (samples) in levels, opening new ways to use them or improve on weak points.\n\nHELLDIVERS has 12 difficulty levels divided by planets in sectors. Every loadout slot is a tactical choice and can either compliment team composition to be able to deal with all manner of threats or strengthen individual divers.\n\nEssentially it's an Alien Swarm meets Magicka game. Having very dynamic gameplay and challenges for all levels of skill and group compositions.\n\nIf you decide to get it - buy the full dlc version as it will save you money on individual dlc purchases where some really great items are provided (perk boots, tank, solid mid tier walker, etc).","December 12, 2015","true","44.1"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","0"

But this got my motor going immediately when I saw it 8 months ago on the other plattform it was released first.\n\nI chose to wait, because I was certain it'd be on Steam.\n\nThe day arrived. I immediately got the Digital Deluxe Edition. It contains all DLC's ever released so far. And I sure hope there will be new ones.\n\nIf you are against such games, try it anyways. You can always use the Steam return and get your money back.\n\n\nWhat got me especially into buying this game:\n\n- Hardcore gameplay (really punishing for little mistakes sometimes. Like friendly fire or getting crushed by an ally or even your own pod)\n\n- Customization of your character. (choose your headdress, your clothing, even your gender)\n\n- Stratagem system (I didn't count them, but there's a lot of them. basically pod drops. Calling in air strikes, ammo, support weapons, revival pods, even mechanized robots which you can control. Mini Titanfall, am I right? ;) )\n\n- Weapon upgrade system (level up or gather samples of the planets to earn research points. Invest then into upgrading your favorite weapons and stratagems, which contains more ammo in weapons, or faster deploy of stratagems and longer duration of it)\n\n- Perk system (choose perks like a laser sight, terrain boots (which make you go on a normal pace in snow and swamps which can really save your butt, contained in the terrain DLC), a jump pack, an auto injector which makes you get up faster when knocked down, and so on~)\n\n- Planets with quests (drop down on the planet and do various objectives. Like defuse left over bombs, which you have to uncover with a "sniffer", which is a metal detector. Or find a black box/survivor and return them to the base. Or even arm a nuke, which you have to defend for a certain amount of time, which then goes off to wherever. By the way, the planets are supposedly procedurally generated - means it's a different stage layout every single time.)\n\n- Enemy variety (there's 3 kinds of enemies. The Bugs, the Cyborgs, and the Illuminate. All of them with their own kind of units with different, really mean, attacks.)\n\n- Leveling system (just as other games. You level up and unlock clothing, weapons, stratagems, perks )\n\n\nWhat is upsetting about this game:\n\n\n- Dying because of a stupid reason like when someone joins your game and you get their drop pod on your head. You can still see where it lands don't worry. But in the heat of the battle, sometimes you overlook it. Another reason is getting a full load of an ally who empties his magazine into you. May it be on purpose or not. Don't worry, you can be revived as often as you like, as long as there is at least 1 dude alive and it is not on cooldown.\n\n\nSo basically only the dying part, which WILL happen and often, trust me.\n\nBut overall, buy it. Don't think, just buy it. Go into Multiplayer and look for some nice people. It's pure fun.\n\n\nThanks for reading.","December 8, 2015","true","55.2"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","41","52","0","2"

But like a real combat medic, you just want to help fellow soldiers/players, no matter the risk. :-)\nBeen the only player left standing on a Cyborg desert mission, toss a reinforcement beacon only to see it bounce off a cliff into oblivion (!). Rushed to a safe zone and finally called in a reinforcement which gets everyone back on the ground, a rush feeling. :)\n\nBonuses awarded at Mission's end for a low number of player deaths really motivate everyone to work together.\nMade lots of great new Steam friends playing this game so far. It feels made from the ground up for co-op, even with friendly fire in place, and it just makes you want to enjoy playing the game with other people. :-)Easy Multiplayer\nThe Steam co-op gameplay set up integration is seamless, and starting up or joining an existing game is easy:\nGraphical multiplayer game browser, which shows you a game's planet location, difficulty, objectives and number of players in the game.\nSeparate tab lets you see any Helldivers games your friends are hosting or are in. You can join them with one click on the fly.\nYou can right click on anyone in your Steam friends list to join his Helldivers game or invite him to yours.Controls\nWhile I've ultimately embraced keyboard/mouse controls, I'm first to admit that a,w,s,d movement in overhead twin-sticks can be a bit klutzy at times. However, I've found the mouse crosshair aiming -- once I got used to it, and it definitely takes some time and persistence to do that -- much more precise than with  my Vita's thumbsticks. If the kb/mouse frustrrates you at first, and you're not a controller fan, please keep playing/practicing. I promise it clicks (at least for most) in due time. :-)\n\nStill, you may find controllers a better fit, which is its Sony Vita/PS3/PS4 DNA afterall, so that's great as well.\n\nKeybindings are fully rebindable, and controllers/gamepads are remappable.\n===============================================================\n\nFor more information on Helldivers PC, please check out my Unofficial FAQ, which I moved from the Steam forum to Steam Game guide format:\nAn Unofficial Helldivers (PC) FAQ\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=569766067\nI only bought a PlayStation Vita back in March this year to play Helldivers. And am really glad it made the leap to PC. :-) I'd wrote more in this review, but I've put 18 hours into the game and need to get back to it! :-)","December 6, 2015","true","130.8"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","3"

The players are friendly, the gameplay is a whole hell of a lot of fun and the missions range from 'dive in the park' easy to absolutely insane. You will kill a lot of teammates, get killed by even more of them but at the end of every mission you're blasting away at hordes of aliens while you wait for your shuttle to extract you, with epic music blasting into your ears. What's there not to like?\n\nCalling in supply drops with directional-pad combinations gives a great depth of skill next to the actual positioning, shooting and anticipation of the gunplay. The ability to call in mechs, turrents, heavier secondary weapons or even a 4-man APC gives the game even more depth. ♥♥♥♥, you can team up in pairs to reload anti-tank rockets faster. All the while faced by the looming threat of getting killed by bugs, dropping pods or friendly fire. This is co-op!

In order to really enjoy this game, you need at least two DLC packs with some essential equipment. (1) RANGER PACK - this unlocks an unmanned drone which is absolutely ESSENTIAL because it reveals sample locations when fully upgraded saving tons of time for farming. (2) TERRAIN SPECIALIST PACK - this gives you a perk which nullifies the slowing effects on snow and swamp planets...mobility is life. I would also recommend the optional (3) ENTRENCHED PACK, as it provides a useful anti-tank mech and barbed wire, which will save your life on retaliation strikes.\n\nGameplay Videos:\nSolo Gameplay | Retaliation Strike Gameplay | 4-player Co-op Gameplay\n\nHelldivers is a top-down, cooperative action game set in a generic sci-fi setting. Up to four players work together to complete objectives during missions to unlock experience points, gear, and research points to upgrade their gear. Chains of missions can be beaten to conquer planets, which feeds into the Helldivers meta-game, which is quite clever. In the meta-game, humanity is fighting a war on three fronts (corresponding to the three alien races you’ll encounter). Each front is divided into sectors, and as you conquer each sector you get closer to the enemy home planets, which when defeated knock that enemy out of the current “war”. Every planet individual players defeat contributes to the point threshold in each sector, which is conquered when the required threshold is reached. Occasionally the enemy will go on the offensive, forcing you to defend planets (and ultimately Earth). If Earth falls, the current war ends and a new war begins in a presumably alternate reality.\n\nHelldivers requires a sense of humor. It’s designed to be played with four players, and each player is constantly calling in orbital bombardments, resupply drop pods, vehicles, and equipment. Each one of these can kill you when they enter the map. You’ll die if you stand in front of a teammate while he’s firing, if you’re too close to his mech when he walks, if you jump out of your vehicle while it’s still moving and it runs you over, if you jump off the side of a cliff, drop a grenade at your own feet, or die from the actual enemies in the game. It’s all part of the fun, but it presupposes that everyone is taking a similar, light-hearted yet directed approach to the game.\n\nIn my experience, the community is fun and welcoming, for the most part happy to work together to collect samples and complete goals. All in all, Helldivers is tremendous fun and provides excellent value. It’s a shame that several DLC are considered essential to enjoy the game to its fullest, but I suppose you can always get those on sale.\n\nRead the full review[www.thesewall.com].

Ladies and Gentleman, Super Earth is under attack! Yes, we reached out of space and discovered 3 other galactic civilizations and our initial contact was friendly. Now in 2064, we have to defend Super Earth from 3 fronts! Fortunately we have the best military units in the galaxy and you know who they are . . .  the mighty Helldivers; thank God for that!\n\nHelldivers is an action twin stick shooter / online co-op game where you play a soldier in the famous Super Earth military unit “HELLDIVERS”.  You have to prevent Super Earth from being destroyed by three very interesting intergalactic races (Bugs, The Illuminates and Cyborgs) by taking over regions in the galaxy and by successfully defending them from their counter attacks.\n\nWhen you first launch the game, you will go through a quick but thorough tutorial which give you a very good understanding of what you have to do in combat. Then you will hit the main spaceship bridge where you will be able to choose missions, weapons upgrades and the excellent “Helldivers encyclopaedia” with plenty of content.\n\nHead up to the Galactic Campaign table; from there you will be able to see the war fronts and choose which race you would like to fight against, or just join another group in battle. There are lots of variable missions; some will be to eliminate a specific number of enemies, some will have several objectives to achieve before you go to your extraction point! You will face an infinite number of enemies in each map and your team will be using all available tricks under their sleeves to extract themselves safely.\n\nSome of the tricks are: the “Stratagem” (which are additional gizmos you can call upon), ammo drops, defence turrets, strikes, vehicles and more. You will find samples lying on the ground; make sure to collect them as they will go towards your research points. Collect 10 samples and you will get 1 research point. Each time you level up, you will own an additional research point which you will need to upgrade your weapons and stratagems. One thing I forgot to mention is to be really careful who you shoot, as friendly fire is always on! Plenty of “Oops, sorry mate!”\n\nIf you successfully achieve your mission (objective and extraction) you will be given XP and great rewards depending in which region you fought in. Rewards could include new stratagems, weapons and more.\n\nThe graphics and animations are fabulous and the game runs brilliantly.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great graphics\n-	Fun and fast gameplay\n-	Plenty of enemies – 3 different races\n-	Number of upgrades and equipment\n-	Different levels of difficulty (1 to 12)\n-	Up to 4 player online co-op\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\nMy goodness, I am hooked on HELLDIVERS!

A little top down shooter maybe based on starship troopers. As you can see from the store page, it has a nice unique artstyle. It's extremely enjoyable, you go on short missions to advance in a war with the community, to get to the final mission and take out the home planet of either cyborgs, bugs, or ... Illuminati? idk.\n\nThe game features single co-op missions, this is not an RPG, you unlock standard guns, skills and perks. It features a system where you unlock combat deployable ablities by clearing planets, ranging from turrets that drop from orbit, to support weapons and supply drops, even attack runs from air support.\n\nYou unlock guns as you advance in rank, and some fun perks like different types of grenades and weapon enhancements. There is also something of a perk spec system, RPG like, but not RPG. You end up spending research points on weapon upgrades, and upgrading your orbit drop abilities.\n\nThere is team damage, and environment damage, super fun. Get killed by your friends, watch out for supply drops from orbit, you will get crushed, and just when you think you are out, watch the heli land on you. Fun way to spend some time with friends or kill time solo.\n\nPriority level 93/100  (Get this game as soon as you can and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it)\n\nEDIT: There is a mega pack for all DLC. If you get the base game and want to upgrade later, it costs 12.5% more total than the DDE. Just keep it in mind. No the DLC does not cost 40 to buy all of it.

Oh boy was I in for a treat..\nI'd like to share with you a short mission log. My, first mission to be exact. *shudders*\nMission log 01: Bug territory.\nSo I had decided that when purchasing the game that i'd convince my friend to buy and play the game with me.\nRegrettably, I was successful..\nWe began by making comments to eachother about how cool the mission select interface was because you were actually inside of your ship in real-time selecting a mission to run on the galaxy map and then dropping into the thick of it! cool huh?\nWell, that's what we thought.. we were so, so wrong. *shudders*\nWe began with a distress call from one of the "Bug" planets which had become in danger.\nWe orbited the planet, climbed into our drop pods and we were on our way to the bug hunt!\nAfter landing on the planet's surface we had no need to aquaint ourselves with the controls as the game had already given us this pretty cool boot-camp esque experience as a tutorial upon logging in, and so we set off to the nearby "SAM Site".\nUpon reaching the "SAM Site" we began reactivating the consoles and that's when we noticed the "Bugs"..\nThey were small, crab-like drones if you will.\nWe gunned them down with no hesitation and that was it.. We finished reactivating the consoles and had no trouble from any other bugs, which seemed odd.\nAnd so we proceeded to the next objective which was the retrieval of a "Black box" which must then be delivered to and outpost.\nEasy enough huh? well.. I found what was left of the previous carrier and proceeded to take the "black box" and began walking toward the outpost, with my friend in front to defend me from those pesky crabs.\nThe planet's surface was volcanic and had many treacherous drops into lava and so he had to tread lightly upon the ash-strewn surface.\nWe were almost at the outpost when something happened.. something that changed me forever.\nWe proceeded onward with my friend infront of me, my friend had been playing around with the dive mechanic and joking about by shouting "get to cover!" for no reason at all.\nHe, huh.. he ran ahead and shouted "get to cover!" and leapt onto the ground a few feet away from me..\nThere was a magma vent right next to him.. I had to watch as my fellow helldiver was encoated in volcanic material and dissolved infront of me.. screaming. My fellow helldiver, my friend.\nAnd so I just called in another pod and he was back because the game works like that..\nWe killed some bigger bugs, one of which was able to plant it's tendrils into the floor and pop them out of the ground to assault you, and that was it.\nTime to go to extraction! and only one death!\nWe proceeded to the extraction site and activated the beacon, calling the dropship to our location.\nHowever, we had to hold out for a minute whilst the ship arrives, which is fine. Who doesn't enjoy a good firefight eh?\nWe held back the alien horde with automated turrets and strafing runs until at last the ship was arriving.\nThe relief that we were finally going home! it was overwhelming!\nAnd so we ran to the ship as it was docking and were crushed by it in the process.\n\n> GG WP 20/10 Would get flashbacks from a fictional war in a videogame again.\nYou weren't there.","February 5","true","32.3"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","79","31","39","37","4"

Thematically, you'll be reminded of every Sci-Fi trope that you can imagine as you travel around the galaxy, meet new and interesting species, and act as an ambassador of Democracy. Think.... Starship troopers.\n\nPositives:\n+The action and gameplay of shooting up aliens as a spaceman is very well done.\n+The progression system system is very well-done. Leveling is as you'd expect- get levels, unlock skins and weapons. Players can also unlock new strategems (powers) by playing through a series of missions successfully. Lastly, players must accrue research points (through leveling and collecting samples on maps) to upgrade their gear. This is a sort of talent tree for your character.\n+Equipping your character individually, as well as a team, presents a lot of interesting and meaningful choices. You only have 4 strategem (power) slots, a weapon, and perk (big power) that you can equip. Much of the fun is the trial and error of different loadouts for you and for your team.\n+There is a huge variety of weaponry. Most of the weapons are different enough that there's not really a 'super weapon' but rather weapons that fit a specific roll or style.\n+There is a massive variety of powers that you can unlock. Think of Guild Wars/Guild Wars 2 - the possibilities are immense.\n+The combined arms aspect of the game is well-done.\n+BIG ROBOTS that you can use to spread Democracy.\n\nNegatives:\n-There are occasionally steam network/game connectivity issues. If you disconnect from a mission,  you lose your progress in collecting science samples (which are really important.)\n-You absolutely must stay on the same screen as your teammates. This can get a little hectic/difficult if your cursors are scattered all over the place, constraining your ability to see what's going on around you.\n-The controls can be a little hard to master. Your mouse cursor will move faster than your characters/turrets can turn. Ultimately, there's some balance to this... but many PC players will find this to be a bit sluggish.\n-When playing with randoms, there is a (small) potential that you will encounter a hacker; reportedly, a hacker can increase your XP/science points to max, somewhat thwarting your progression.\n\nOverall, this is a great game to play with your buddies looking for a Coop game, or with random folks and pubbies. The action is good, and there is a lot of value in the hilarious wipes that you'll surely incur.","December 10, 2015","true","66.8"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/394510/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","HELLDIVERS is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nCreated by the team behind Magicka, a game that destroys friendships, comes another game that destroys friendships.\n\nSet in the distant future of next Thursday, HELLDIVERS, as my Steam library likes to shout at me, is a game about humanity at war. You are a HELLDIVER, a type of orbital shock unit that gets into little pots and fired at planets like angry genocide bullets. Super Earth is in danger! Threatened on all sides by evil alien threats, the HELLDIVERS must lead the spearhead from planet to planet, conquering and annihilating all opposition in your way so you can indoctrinate and exploit your enemies harshly and go back to your way of life of being spied on by the government and using dead bodies as food.\n\nWait, are we the bad guys?\n\nHELLDIVERS is a strictly multiplayer game, sure you can go in lone wolf but much like my ex wife, it kills most of the fun and forces you to live out your days living in your own refuse.  Unlike many games with a war narrative, HELLDIVERS is entirely about the war, where you and thousands of other players march from planet to planet and conquer them in the name of Super Earth, taking over sector after sector until you can reach your enemies home world and knock them out of the war for good. And when all three enemy races have a Burger King on their home world, the war is won and the game resets! Letting you and your HELLDIVER comrades start from square one.\n\nBut the real meat of HELLDIVERS is the actual game play. After picking a planet and the location of the planet you want to attack, you're introduced to a top down stick shooter with various objectives for you and your three squad mates to accomplish. Now, I'm not a fan of twin stick shooters, they are to me what Carlos Mencia is to comedy, that is to say they don't click. But I ended up actually really enjoying HELLDIVERS, all of the weapons had this very crunchy kick to them and it was satisfying to rip cyborgs and bugs to shreds under a hail of gunfire.\n\nHELLDIVERS also has the advantage of letting you customize your load out, taking down with you not only perks and weapons, but also vehicles, defensive emplacements, and even tertiary support like air strikes and orbital bombardment. The game play compliments the war-time narrative, by making you feel like an actual fighting force rather than a hero unit with an objective.\n\nAnother thing that lets HELLDIVERS stand out from other twin-stick shooters is that it isn't a horde mode game. Many games of it's natures just have you mow down wave after wave of enemies until they finally get you, tallying up the wave you killed and giving you a score much like getting a gold medal with chocolate inside in elementary school for participating in track and field. While HELLDIVERS does indeed have a game mode like that, even that one has a kill limit. Your goal in HELLDIVERS is to complete your objectives and then escape the planets surface without being completely overrun by your enemy.\n\nEven though I liked HELLDIVERS, I like it the same way you like eating fast food or smoking crack, it's good but you shouldn't be doing it all the time. Due to it's nature, HELLDIVERS is a very repetitive game, there isn't much variety in missions and all the difficulty levels do is add more objective while throwing more dirty alien commie scum ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at you. But I don't think HELLDIVERS is meant to be played all day every day, more like you put a good number of hours in when you first get it, and after that you just kind of play it from time to time.\n\nThere are other things I can criticize about the game that isn't really the games fault. Like the one guy who doesn't know what friendly fire is, or that other guy who will drop equipment at the worst places, or THAT ONE GUY WHO DOESNT REALIZE THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME CAMERA AND SHOULD PROBABLY STICK WITH THE GROUP INSTEAD OF DRAGGING HIS FACE ACROSS THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN LIKE A VERY OPTIMISTIC WINDOW SHOPPER.\n\nISNT THAT RIGHT, CARL?\n\nBut should you play HELLDIVERS?\n\nIf you think a narrative can carry what is essentially a repetitive but quality twin-stick shooter, than yeah. The game feels good and is fun to play in short bursts, and there are enough references to classic science fiction series to enjoy. There is also a hella amount of DLC but they aren't necessary to do good and don't really make much of a difference in the long run. As a base game, HELLDIVERS is a fun time waster with a narrative and reward system that makes it feel good to accomplish the task at hand.\n\nBUTTJUMPERS gets 7 Starship Troopers references out of 10.\n\nPumpkin spice lattes can increase the chance of getting cancer.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","February 27","true","19.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","18","19","10","1"

The game has several elements that make it really shine including planetary domination and eventual galactic conquest. The instanced feel of each encounter makes it easy to pick up and play for any period of time. The controls for the PC are just not workable so having a controller for this is the one major hiccup if you don't already own one.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\nDropping in – I liked that you sort of set your own fate in multiple aspects. You choose where to fly and begin your conquest. Once in a system you choose which planet and mission to take. You get to place your drop pod anywhere on the map for the instance you enter on the planet, which can be a blessing or a curse as you see in my video. The feeling that you are in control of your own fate with so many facets is certainly a unique and fun mechanic incorporated into the entire experience.\nEnvironmental planets – Each planet I dropped into had different themes, all which fit the entire art style and “space travel” story line  exceptionally well. The environments are also dynamic and certain ones have lava explosions or other hazards that can kill your Helldiver. I ran into some lava on a bug infested planet and it wasn't pleasant. The variation in planet type and environmental atmospheres is done well enough that the feeling of travel and exploration is felt strongly.\nShoot up some aliens – Shooting aliens and taking over planets is fun. I really enjoy a game that has a simple style like this, incorporated into a bigger overall picture. The combat is dual stick and these are the same designers of “Magicka” so be prepared for a frustrating situation here or there, but mostly it comes down to managing your mobs, and if in co-op, managing your team well.\n\nWhat I disliked:\nController Required – If a game comes to the PC, it should have a workable control scheme right out of the box. I found the default to be just awful, and honestly for a two stick shooter you need a controller. I have one so it was not that big of a roadblock, but for someone without a PC stick, this could be very annoying.\nMissed shots – I felt like at times my bullets sort of passed through certain mobs rather than killed them, which caused a death here and there. It may be that there is a miss percentage, or that you've got to line right up to their center. I think this was the only major area of combat that felt like it could use some work.\n\nA two stick shooter like this with co-op for a few friends is certainly something worth looking at. I enjoyed playing it and can't wait for release to spend some time with the co-op. It's already been highly reviewed by the Playstation crowd, so I'm affirming that it's a fun game and if you didn;t get to play it on the PS3 or PS4, you should pick it up for the PC.\nScore: Buy it now","December 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","1"

It's not very visible on the main page, you can find it by clicking on an individual piece of DLC and looking at the related items. I definitely don't think this game deserves negative reviews for having a slightly misleading Steam page (may not even be the devs fault, and they seem to be extremely passionate about this game).\n\nThat aside, the game is an extremely fun coop twin stick shooter, reminiscent of Left4Dead and Alien Swarm. I've been playing with random people and I've been having as much fun as I've had with friends (even moreso sometimes). It's unforgiving in its difficulty and it's a pleasure to play. Finding the right load out and strategies for the different varieties of planets and missions is a real challenge. The netcode is rock solid (compared to the cluster♥♥♥♥ that Magicka online was), and the developers seem relatively active in patching and releasing new content (it's been out for a year on PSN and has had two major updates, plus the DLC).\n\nHaving a bunch of the content locked behind DLC is a little concerning, but I've bought a few pieces and it doesn't seem to give me a huge advantage over the base content. They're pretty much sidegrades, and anyone who hasn't bought the DLC will have a great and competitive time regardless. The top review (at the moment) cites the tank as something you can't get without buying the DLC. It's true, but the tank is also remarkably useless compared to other strategies. I suppose if you really really want to drive a tank you're stuck for options, but it's by no means a pay to win scenario.","December 8, 2015","true","12.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jones/recommended/394510/","Jones","Inspector Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jones/","495 products in account","LIBERTY FOR ALL!\nHelldivers is a frantic 4 player cooperative twin stick shooter that lets you and your friends play the role of space marines fighting against swarms of bugs, cyborgs, and robots. Every aspect of its design is polished and it feels very responsive; and this is important because Helldivers is a very punishing game but rarely does it frustate. More often then not death and failure occurs can always be avoided; but mistakes and oversights will result in scenarios that can be both hilarious and frustartingly tense. At the same time, with coordination and planning it's possible to pull off satisfying high strategy maneuvers that can pull your team out of a dire situation and win games. There is a lot of strategy in this game, especially if you're able to find a few friends to coordinate with.\n\nEven at the base price, there is a satisfying amount of equipment avaiable from weaspons, perks, and a selection of special utility items called stratagems that help specialise and differentiate your helldiver from the squad. strategems can range from defensive items like land mines to automatic turrets; offensive items like orbital stikes and missle barrages; and specialized equipment like jetpacks and vehicles. Futher more, a satisfying progression system allows weapons and stratagems to be further improved by spending research points on them.\n\nPresentation and theme goes along away to making this game's feel as well. Weapons and vehicles look and feel as powerful as you'd expect them to. Helldivers themselves are heavily stylised and will shout out corny one liners while they relentlessly tear through waves of bad guys without questioning their orders spread the glorious concepts of freedom and democracy around the galaxy. It's a fun universe to play in, even if there's not much in the way of story here (It would just get in the way of freedom anyway).\n\nThe only caveat is regarding the DLC. Just know that when choosing to buy the base game, you'll be missing out on some cool equipment. While none of it is really needed to enjoy the game; some of the tools and weapons provided are very useful. I'd personally reccomend going with the Digital Deluxe edition if you can afford to because it includes all the DLC. It's not listed on the store page as of this review there is a DLC pack that offers all the DLC for $25 as opposed to purchasing it all separately. This is the only thing that is questionable, but I think for the amount of content you get and the gameplay at hand, $40 is a fair price.","December 8, 2015","true","36.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Helldivers still manages to create a brutal, intense and frantic gameplay, surprising with the variety on multiple levels, the tactics, the enemies, the planets, the tools and the randomness mixing things up a bit.\n\nA top-down shooter, with pure fun, lots of death, hectic fights with good effects and animations, different tactics, missions, planets, enemies, weapons, almost all unique and fun, though still inspired.\nThe game has an interesting setup, with the player on a spaceship dreadnought bridge, where you can upgrade equipment, study an encyclopedia (IMPORTANT!), mess about and prepare for the Helldrop, the coop works well and you can join your friends easily on their bridge or in the middle of a mission, talk tactics and coordinate on what equipment to take on the drop, where to drop and what to focus on.\nThis game feels like a massive scale galactic campaign, and it doesn't even have a story, but it manages to create that feeling via the galactic map where you can see how other helldivers are attacking on what fronts, the mission structures and how planets and difficulties affect the influence in the war effort on that front.\nIt would be a nice finishing touch to have some missions, like defending capital cities or the final push on the enemy homeworld, played out more like a war and not an op, to have npc marines follow you and your squad into a push on entrenched enemy positions, and have enemies swarm some extraction point with you and npc marines setting up a defense.\nThere are other areas where the game gives impressions on how to improve and add to create an even more enriching, immersive and fun experience, but still, the game is great already as it is. If only modding would exist for this game.\n\nSome inspirations to note:\nAlien Swarm, the free source-engine mod/game here on steam, but Helldivers manages to build upon the gameplay a lot.\nAliens, obviously.\nStarship Troopers, in the strange dystopian cheesy atmosphere and bughunts.\nWarhammer 40k, also to some degree in the setting, atmosphere and some design choices.\nHalo, with the cheesy but fun and colourful action and vast battlefields, many different enemies with different behaviours, weapons, styles and scales.\nAs a PC port, it feels excellent, the mouse and keyboard work well, the system requirements are reasonable, not really many graphics options to tweak, but still, it looks great and the options you can change are probably the ones people can have different tastes about. The online and local coop work well and are very straight-forward, the esc menu clearly states your privacy settings and push-to-talk options, the bridge is the hub for your decisions on joining in on other players or selecting your own missions or customizing your character etc.\n\nThe DLC was made after the game was released on the different PS platforms, so it misleadingly looks like day one dlc on steam, when it wasn't originally available on day one. It makes sense to have the already full and complete fun game for a reasonable price, with the option to buy in different packs the dlcs which are also fun and varied, also useful and can make life easier, but not adding "pay to win" elements into the game.","December 31, 2015","true","37.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtylaundry/recommended/394510/","dirtylaundry","Dirty Laundry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtylaundry/","115 products in account","I've recently seen a lot of the reviews for this game go downhill because of the over-all cost of DLC. I came from the PS4 to the Steam version to immediately support the game because of how much I enjoyed the experience on the PS4. I've played it since launch. Furthermore, I've invested over a few hundred hours into the game as it was my "go to unwinding" experience from League of Legends and between business trips.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, with very few complications. Most people will opt to use the laser until they're familiar with the scope and trajectory of their favored weapon. The only issues and gripes I have remain with the controls, which can sometimes feel lacking when trying to move fast enough to avoid damage and in turn you're severely punished for something you cannot control. The deadzone for joysticks is disgusting and should be revamped and patched eventually. It feels more natural to play with a PS4/XB1 controller, so I've opted out of the keyboard. Regardless of those small complaints, I've yet to feel they hinder my enjoyment of the game.\n\nOnto the subject of DLC: On the PS4, the group I casually played with, we were at the top of leadership boards. It wasn't difficult to achieve considering most of us only had time for this game during transmutes. I was traveling from state to state, so playing a few rounds of this was much easier.\n\nThe misconception that people MAY have about the DLC is feeling that it provides an unfair advantage. That is completely and utterly wrong. The best weapons in the game aren't unlocked through DLC. And, in fact, function better than DLC weapons because of their linear playstyle.\n\nHere is what you would use: SG 225 - "Breaker". An automatic rifle with high range after fully upgraded and high damage output. It's very good for mob clearing and tackling objectives whwile collecting samples. This is the BEST starting gun. You'll replace it eventually and situationally with AR 20-L "Justice". The highest damaging rifle in the game, bar none.\n\nPerks (in order of best to okay): Strategem Priority (REALLY HUGE GAME MAKER HERE) / All Terrain / Precision Call In.\n\nI personally stuck with Strategem Priority because the refund rate was astronomous when it came to clutch moments in helldives. The other ones are situational.\n\nStrategem (in order of importance): UAV (FULLY UPGRADE IT FIRST) / AMMO (SECOND HUGE UPGRADE) / ML54X COMMANDO (OR ANY BAZOOKA) /  ANGEL (UPGRADED) /\n\nOnce you've acquired the amount of Research Points you want from Samples, it's perfectly fine to swap out UAV for Vindictor Dive Bomb. Vindictor Dive Bomb is the most important upgrade to have but it's the LAST upgrade you want. Bazookas will get rid of pesky and annoying giant monsters, which typically you'd want to carry with you instead of having a pug. An alternative to allowing a pug to have this is great timing with Grenades and swapping it for Angel. Ammo is self explanitory. You'll run out fast.\n\nUpgrade order: UAV - > AMMO - > Bazooka -> Angel -> Vindictor\n\nIf anyone has noticed, most of these items are NOT DLC ITEMS. That is the BEAUTY of it all. You can mix and match the Strategems but the most essential ones are provided without DLC. DLC is completely optional and will not ruin your enjoyment of the game if you forego it.\n\n","December 8, 2015","true","54.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

THIS GAME IS AMAZING! A 9/10 easily. Lets start with graphics and sound. Both the graphics and sound are flawless. The aliens sound and look like aliens should for their particular race. The explosions/dust particles/weapons fire/environments/planets themselves and all other aspects involving graphics and sound are fantastic. I have ZERO complaints about that!\n\nNow, lets talk about the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics are for, without a doubt, hardcore coop players. If you are not a team player, you will find it difficult to make it through the game alone (but it can be done). Friendly fire is 100% and can NOT be turned off, the game was designed this way for intense fights and epic battles where you and your team have nothing but coordination and cooperation to survive the mission. THIS GAME IS NOT EASY! Enemies are endless and will constantly spawn. You do not get xp for kills. You will find a large learning curve when you first start out. However, you will enjoy it as you can't help to admire the beauty as your entire team struggles to make it out of certain, impossible situations alive. My one complaint about the game is the strategems. Strategems are how helldivers call in equipment/bombing runs/defensive structures/ect from space. These take time to arrive (some are faster than others) and you WILL ABSOLUTELY USE THESE! ALL OF THE STRATEGEMS ARE AWESOME! However, my complaint rests with certain strategems eventually becoming useless or out of date. Do not let this discourage you though. That is just my opinion. EVERYONE will find a strategem they feel is pointless but other players will use quite often because everyone is different in how they play the game. It is important to know you need to pick your strategems based around the objectives and what your team is choosing to use. Another mechanic that is worth discussing is the weapon stats and description. THERE IS NO SUPERIOR WEAPON IN THIS GAME! WHICH IS AMAZING! Every weapon has its pros and its cons and the statistics on the each weapon are to the letter. If a gun has low stability but heavy power, it will perform as such. If the gun has high rate of fire but long reload time, it shows in the game. This mechanic is very well done and worth highlighting as other games have weapon statistics but sometimes the weapons all the feel the same (a good example is *cough* EA battlefront *cough*).\n\nNow lets talk about story (my only real complaint): There is very little story.... AH WHO AM I FOOLING! THERE IS STORY!!! You are helldiver spreading democracy and FREEDOM! AND LIBERTEA!!! but thats about it. But in reality, that is all you need. The missions you go on with your best friends and how you survived a near death experience will create stories. Those are the best kind of stories in my opinion. I enjoyed discussing over chat on how we were completely surrounded without our backs to backs and we still made it out by the skin on our teeth.\n\nIn summary: this game is fantastic, buy it and get your friends to buy it. I RECOMMEND IT 100%!\nGood luck recruits and to the veterans of PS3 transferring to PC, I"LL SEE YOU ON THE FIELD FOR FREEDOM!!","December 4, 2015","true","59.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","12","13","3","2"

Ordinarily this would easily earn a recommend from me. However, in this case there really are a few things that hold the game back.\n\n1) The grind. Dear lord. I'm 29 hours in, having played hard and well, and I haven't unlocked all the base items. Some of them are very important to play the harder difficulties. This is compounded by there being only a very small number of mission types, and aside from terrain most maps play the same.\n2) The camera system is incredibly obnoxious.\n3) DLC is both expensive and necessary. The harder difficulties almost require them, and the community is turning toxic - I've been kicked from games because I don't have certain DLCs, which is unacceptable.\n\nOf the three reasons, the third was the point where I realised I cannot recommend this game. Please avoid unless you're willing to shell out additional money to get the "full" game experience.","June 2","false","29.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Basically, you will infiltrate an alien planet in a team or solo, finish your missions while killing monster hordes besides , reach the rendezvous point and wait there for the chopper to pick you up, get rewarded for the mission and upgrade your weapons. Sounds easy, if there weren't all that ♥♥♥♥ that happens ... Friendly fire, overran by a friendly vechicle or squashed by a friendly orbital landing pot, things like that happens every now and then. (In a noob team it will happen frequently) You can play it solo if you want to, but I would rather recommend you to join any running games for some multiplayer sessions.\n\nDE/ Wenn Du was zum lachen brauchst, ist dieses Spiel wahrscheinlich genau das richtige Spiel fur dich. Im Grunde läuft das Spiel so ab, dass ihr einen Alien Planeten im Team oder solo infiltriert, während ihr die Missionen abschließt werden gleich ein par Alienhorden mitgenommen, dann begebt ihr euch zum Treffpunkt wo euch ein Flieger abholt, und schlieslich konnt ihr eure Waffen durch die Punkte die ihr fur die Missionen bekommt upgraden. Hort sich leicht an, wenn nicht die ganze Scheise zwischendurch passieren wurde. Friendly fire, von verbundeten Fahrzeugen uberrollt werden oder von einer verbundeten Landekapsel zerquetscht werden gehort hier zum Tagesgeschaft. (Wird in einer Anfangergruppe wahrscheinlich haufiger passieren)  Man kann zwar auch alleine spielen, aber ich würd eher empfehlen irgendein laufendes Spiel für den Multiplayerspaß beizutreten.\n\nJP/ ちょっと笑いたい様な気分の時にあなたにピッタリなゲーム。ゲームの基本的な流れとしてはチーム単位か一人で異星人の星に潜入し、敵を屠りながらミッションをこなし、最終集合地点へ向かいそこで迎えの飛行機を待ち、ミッション後に得たポイントで武器を改良していくといった感じのゲームです。単純に聞こえますか。途中思いもよらぬハプニングさえ起きなければ確かにそうなのですが・・・　味方による誤射、味方車両に轢き殺される、味方着陸ユニットの下敷きになる等のハプニングは云わば日常茶飯事です。（初心者が集まれば集まるほどこのようなハプニングは起きる）ソロでも遊べるが、好きな時に誰かの進行中のゲームに飛び入り参加できるので、マルチ・協力プレー推奨。","January 6","true","11.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Go with borderless or windowed or it will complain about drivers and want to revert your colour scheme to W 7 Basic.\n\nSo the game runs flawlessly and now I will head over to gameplay.\nThe gameplay is fun, challenging and really gives that panicking feel when you are the only one left and a swarm is chasing you down in the deep snow.  The game gives you alot of varietys when it comes to equipment and you do not unlock all of if too fast.\nI have 4 hours played so far, so not much but I'm lvl 10 and I'm loving every second.  It's not hard to play with others either as the multiplayer is fast connecting and east to find games.\n\nThe only thing I might point out that will bother ppl after the first 10-20 hours hype is the mission system. It is really excellent, but it's risking of getting repetetive is there. But I have not made it that far yet =)\n\n\nEdit: I've always loved games like Alien Swarm and such and if you ever played/play that game. (It's free) Then I will say that this game is even better, similar but better. it may not have such a developed story, but still it's not even close to as streamlined and you have to work together to a very good extent if you want to survive in the higher dificulties.\n\nSo far the number of accidentals that I see is sky high. Ppl just panick when 4 behemoths are storming your extract location ^^\n\nEasy 9/10 on this game.\n\nEDIT 2: 20 hours: Still in love with this game and I'm looking forward to many more hours spent. If I where you I would make sure to either find some friend in the game or bring your olds ones. That will ensure you have alot of fun. Game is still good in alone, and even possible as a single player.\n\nWhat ever you do get the Digital Deluxe if you buy this game, it gives you all the dlcs. The price difference is 10 euroes from normal to digital deluxe, and all dlc cost ALOT more then that.\nAlso it gives you a ♥♥♥♥ ton of new toys to play with.

Team coordination is key and pulling off a mission you've been struggling with is tremendously rewarding. The amount of unlockables allows for each person to specialize in their own little role and get good at something else.\n\nThe atmosphere is also top notch and if you enjoyed the movie Starship Troopers, you'll love the over-the-top war for democracy in HELLDIVERS.\n\nCompared to Arrowhead's other releases, this one has very few bugs, none of them major. Gamepad support is also excellent (I honestly recommend a Dualshock 4, as the game was made with it in mind and works out of the box).\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite games of 2015.

In other words, BUY IT, play it, and love it.\n\nThe game focuses on objective-based play and is most fun when played with other people. There is a semi-steep learning curve and a proper game etiquette that is learned over time but it is most definitely worth the effort. Even in the lowest level play, the outrageous death and destruction raining down on the screen makes the game fun. Teamkilling is inevitable but it's all in good humor. Yes, dying is fun in this game.\n\nOne gripe I have is that while all the weapons and equipment in the base game are considered "good", much of the DLC equipment is better, even if only situationally. So, if you're wanting this game, it might be a good idea to wait for a sale and buy the deluxe edition to reap all the rewards that it brings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/recommended/394510/","kt_extinction","KT_Extinction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/","1026 products in account","HELLDIVERS™ is an amazing experience. Essentially Starship Troopers: The Game, this is a well polished, balanced, and ultimately just plain satisfying experience. Twin stick shooters have been popular since, like forever. There's something elegant and pleasant about the simplicity of the controls, and everyone loves mowing down tons of bad guys while moving through an environment at a leisurely, god like viewpoint in the sky. However, the simplicity of the gameplay belies a really deep experience within HELLDIVERS™. You play as a faceless Orbital Drop Shock Trooper fighting a bloody war against many extraterristrial foes for an ultra nationalist, almost fascist like government of SUPER EARTH. For Liberty, Freedom, and Democracy! The world building is delightfully light-hearted and comical, despite the somewhat desperate backdrop. It creates a setting that anyone who enjoyed Starship Troopers will feel right at home in.\n\nOriginally a PS3/PS4/PS Vita title, the port runs fantastic, however this isn't really surprising considering the somewhat pedestrian graphics. The game looks good, but nothing amazingly beautiful pops out. The firing/ weapon effects are something to be commended; the landscape lights up with pretty volleys of bright, fiery torrents of bullets while you shoot various weapons. There are plenty of cosmetic customization options for your soldier, unlockable through gameplay. The deep gameplay I previously mentioned comes through the nonstandard interpretation of what most twin stick shooters are composed of. Ammunition is relatively rare, and you can't religiously reload after only firing a few shots because your soldier will discard the entire magazine, forever losing the rest of the ammo. Friendly Fire is ALWAYS on, and it doesn't only pertain to gunshots and grenades either. Calling in helpful equipment slams crates falling from space into the ground, but if you happen to be under the landing zone you will get squished immediately. The sweet dreadnaught-like mechs that you can drive will crush your teamates if they run underneath your robot feet. Your own gatling turret will also riddle you with bullets if you happen to be in the way of their view to an enemy. I can't overstate how great the Friendly Fire aspect is. In other twin stick shooters, even cooperative ones, I could easily hold down the fire button while spinning in a circle like a madman, with not a care in the world for running out of ammunition or hurting my teamates. HELLDIVERS™, with all of its dangers and challenges creates a more tactical, slow paced experience. Positioning and aiming are so important in this game, I honestly have never had so much restraint in firing in a twin stick shooter before, but due to the Friendly Fire in this game I'm constantly trying to avoid hitting my teamates. It's great stuff, I get a really Magicka-like vibe from it, which makes sense because I believe the series shares the same developer.\n\nIn addition to all of this, there is a huge selection of weapons and strategems (equipment/ support) to unlock, and you can choose which kinds of weaponry/ tactics to upgrade and specialize in. There are some neat team-work elements, such as being able to help a teamate reload a recoiless rifle or cruising around in an APC together. Calling down a strategem isn't as simple as pressing a button either, there is a nifty little DDR/Guitar-Hero like minigame to call in support. I actually loved this, it's a lot more challenging than just mindlessly pressing a button. It's pretty difficult to keep calm and collected as the hordes start to breach your position while trying to call down a life saving weapon/ artillery strike. There is a fantastic meta-game going on in the background as well: the Galactic Campaign. Every mission you complete, you add influence to a community pool which helps turn the overall greater battle towards a certain direction. Areas of the galaxy become unlocked over time and eventually we will be able to engage the enemies on their homeworld. There are also defense missions where one of the enemy factions will attack an area where you can join in on the defense, and I haven't played these yet, but I hear they are pretty difficult. Speaking of factions, I was under the impression that there was only a single faction, the steretypical Starship Troopers "Bugs", but there are actually three distinct factions! The technologically advanced Illuminate, which uses shields and weird zappy laser things, the rebellious human Cyborgs, which are heavily armored and have weird ♥♥♥♥ed up robotic attachments and ♥♥♥♥, and the ravenous Bugs, which are essentially the Zerg/ Tyrannids. These factions all require different tactics to deal with and lend an extra layer of strategy to an already brilliant package.\n\nThis is one of the best twin stick shooters I've ever played and has surprisingly made it into one of my top 10 games of the year.

Yes, you can. You can do all content solo and/or offline, but its more fun with others - usually!!\n\n"Do I need the DLC/is it OP etc". No, the DLC is not overpowered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenilya/recommended/394510/","jenilya","Jenilya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenilya/","300 products in account","BackgroundHELLDIVERS is a 4 player co-op "twinstick" shooter. It was originally released on PSN (Playstation Network) and received positive reviews. Its PC port is no exception, and is a wonderfully fun action game to enjoy alone or with others. Although the true fun of the game comes from 4-player co-op, when you can tackle harder missions. I would place it in the "party game" and "couch co-op" categories.\n\nSummaryThe game takes place in the local galaxy, in a distant future with space travel. Humanity resides on "Super Earth", as a very technologically advanced race. Humanity has united under one super-power, that believes strongly in democracy, freedom, and liberty (space murica'). During our expansion we have come to war with 3 races; Bugs, The Illuminate, and Cyborgs. All with their own reasons and backgrounds for going to war with us.\n\nGameplayThe main goal of the game is to push back and defeat each race, and conquer the galaxy in the name of Democracy. There is a large galactic map where you help fight the war and push back each race, and eventually eliminate them from the war. This is done through Influence points, which is gained by completing missions, higher difficulty missions give more Influence. However, they can push and fight back as well. If the players lose battles the enemies can retake sectors, and eventually lay seige to Super Earth. If Super Earth is lost the war is over, and the players lose. In either scenario, victory or defeat, a new war is started afterwards. The cycle then repeats.\n\nFriendly fire is enabled which leads to some frustrating, and hilarious, moments. This forces coordination, checking firing lanes, player skill, positioning, and caution. The game is based as a twin stick shooter, and can be played with a controller. However my fellow PC users do not worry, the game plays absolutely fine with keyboard & mouse. It's a solid PC port with important PC features such as: Text Chat, VOIP, and Steam integration.\n\nThe game's difficulty scales from 1 - 12. 1 being the easiest (Dive in the Park), and 12 being the hardest (HELLDIVE). As you go into higher difficulties more enemies appear, and more difficult ones with them, but the rewards grow too. One key to playing the game is to keep moving, as the enemies will never quit coming. Patrols alert their allies, thus calling in more powerful enemies. It is imperative to kill these patrols quickly before you are spotted. You can likewise avoid patrols entirely, stealth is an option though difficult. Playing online can make it frustrating when one player is hanging back and not moving with the team, preventing everyone else from moving forward; the screen is locked, and all 4 players are stuck on it.\n\nFighting on planets earns XP and new items for the players to use. These items are called Strategems, which are drops the player calls in during missions. These can be anything from an airstrike, a heavy machine gun, a sentry turret, landmines, and even tanks. Be cautious though, these drop-pods can crush you and your allies (and enemies too!). There is character customization, althought it is light. You can change your outfit, cape, and select a gender (female is slightly skinnier looking, it doesn't affect gameplay). Expect your character to shout plenty of liberty, freedom, and democracy lines and puns, which gives a good laugh.\n\nClosingOverall the game is a fun action romp that will make you laugh, keep you focused, and have a good time. It's best played with friends, or people online. Solo players may find it difficult to unlock all the items, and do higher difficulties by themselves.","February 4","true","61.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is definitely a good pickup and play type game, while not tying you down for too long as most missions can be relatively short.","December 15, 2015","true","21.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

That means guns, lots of guns, lots of in-your-face and entirely assumed corny jingoism à la Robert Heinlein (DEMOCRACY!), and bugs. Not as in "janky gameplay", mind you - bugs as in "giant chitinous mothers who want nothing more than to serve you a nice, steaming cup of MOIDAH." Yes, murder.\n\nHelldivers pulls no punches. It's Magicka without Green Magic Beams of Healing Friendliness, so be prepared to learn to shoot. Accurately, that is. You can't barge in there like TF2's Heavy, blanket the State or province in lead and wake up to the sight of your comrades smelling like the proverbial rose. The supposedly optional right-trigger laser sight you start out with?\n\nDon't replace it. Keep it, if you value your co-op funtimes.\n\nSeeing as the game frames a persistent galactic war, expect plenty of procedurally generated maps and objectives - which means you'll quickly start to get Warhammer Lite vibes from the setup. Most maps have plenty of natural cover or are large enough for you to hoof it out of dicey areas, but most objectives are constantly pulled out of the same shallow pool. You'll disarm minefields, bomb bug hives into oblivion, raise flags over supposedly significant areas, reinitialize S.A.M. batteries or escort civilians to safety, among a few other things. You'll see the game's overall palette of objectives within two or three hours. Past that, drudgery sets in, unfortunately. The only thing that might keep you going could be the thrill of unlocking more ordnance or upgrade parts, or maybe you'll actually derive some pleasure out of grinding an upteenth faceless mook of a character.\n\nSo honestly, this is another grinder's paradise, at least up until you do unlock gear that complements your playstyle. Once you do, it's a lot easier to just let jolly co-operation happen and shoot mooks with complete strangers.\n\nA bit like Magicka, you practically have no reasons to play this alone. You can, of course, but your personal ship and home base comes complete with four "hellpods", a constant reminder that you could be boosting that XP meter much faster.\n\nIf anything, I'll mention there's nothing quite like accidentally killing a buddy with an item request. Or enemies, for that matter. Death by Supply Drop. Isn't that fairly ironic?","December 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Some people might see this as a con, but I enjoyed the tactical nature of it.\n- The galactic war is a neat way of everyone playing together to defeat the enemy factions.\n\nCons:\n- The camera feels maybe a bit too restrictive, especially in multiplayer. Unless you stay packed in tight, you're going to get shot or blown up or stabbed by enemies you never see coming.\n- With no scaling, the harder missions are going to be near impossible to do alone or in a duo. Unless you're stealthy as hell, you'll be quickly overrun by enemies.\n- Even with what seems like a lot of replayability, you'll eventually notice some pretty repetitive gameplay.\n- DLC is displayed in your armory, so unless you pay the premium to unlock everything, you'll have stuff sitting there taunting you that you can never get.\n- The galactic war seems to be maybe a tad mistuned. Even with several thousand players actively fighting a single faction, we were unable to defeat the final planets.","February 21","true","27.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But that does not mean the game is without faults, or that it is a game for everyone.\n\nCouple areas of concern... "Consolization" or whatever people call it nowadays, really hurts this game. incase you were not aware this game was only on PS4/PSP/PS3 of quite some time, and like many other titles have done in the past, when the game is ported to PC or other platforms its missing things that are more or less requred for PC gaming (i.e. graphics settings). Queing into games is affected as well. All players must load a map before each mission starts. On the PC these screens have loaded for 5-10mins when connected to a full team of 4 people with PCs of varying speeds!! This is simply an issue that does not exsit when playing on Playstation.\n\nBy the way this game is not easy. There is progression in the game as far as equipment and skills to unlock but a higher level will not make you more powerful or resilant out right. The real thing you need to succeed is good old teamwork and cooperation: LOTS OF IT. Friendly fire is most definitely ON at all times and really shapes the way the game is played. This leads to countless occasions when HELLDIVERS teeters on the line between difficulty and frustration.\n\nWould you like to know more??\n\nHELLDIVERS is awesome when it works they way its intended to. Oozing with Starship Trooper themed action and humor; Its never felt more satisfying to hear patriotic music over guns blazing while spreading Managed Democracy In the name of Super Earth. The entire HELLDIVERS community works to beat the game together with every completed or failed mission affecting the war effort against threats to mankind.\n\nIm doing my part...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nexoros/recommended/394510/","Nexoros","Nex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nexoros/","401 products in account","Helldivers is a fun game from the makers of Magicka. It is similar to Alien Swarm, but it has randomly generated maps and more humor. Missions are short but get longer as difficulty increases, and there are clear moments of low and high tension which keep the game interesting. At the end of each mission is a 2 minute extraction sequence kind of like the equivalent of a Left 4 Dead finale.\n\nEach planet has a pattern of patrols crossing through it with some randomness. If a patrol spots you, you have a couple of seconds to kill it before it sounds an alarm and summons stronger enemies. It is technically possible to get through a mission without sounding any alarms, but I haven't done it yet.\n\nLike Magicka, human players are  very powerful, with each player bringing 4 "stratagems" to each mission. A stratagem can be airdropping ammo supplies or it can be calling in an airstrike, or almost anything inbetween. I personally enjoy bringing a Guard Dog drone, which flies around and shoots at enemies (it has a quick reaction time, which helps me against the patrols). in addition to the 4 chosen strategems, each player gets a reinforce stratagem that resurrects dead players and any mission-specific stratagems like a metal detector for sniffing out mines. Because of the resurrection stratagem, death in Helldivers is not a big deal, and most of the time a player is not out of the game for very long. Also like Magicka, a mission is failed if all 4 players die without calling for reinforcements, however.\n\nTwo key differences between Magicka and Helldivers are:\n1) In Helldivers, it is relatively easy to know when and where your attack is  going to hit. Killing friendlies is easily avoided most of the time, and few of the attacks are going to wipe the party. This allows for more consistent, less annoying gameplay, imo.\n2) The writing of Helldivers has a theme with a bit of a smaller scope (making fun of Starship Troopers, mostly) but there are less references to internet memes.\nI consider both of these differences to be, on the whole, positive.\n\nMissions are randomly generated and each completed mission adds to the Community Influence in the galactic campaign, which is an aggregate function of all Helldivers' efforts in the war. As players spread managed democracy across the galaxy, they approach the home planets of 3 alien races: the Illuminates, Bugs, and Cyborgs. Each faction has its own sector of the galaxy, and the playerbase as a whole must balance their efforts to make sure that none of these factions gets too close to SuperEarth by completing missions in each respective sector.\n\nThere isn't a ton of plot, but there is some lore to read up on if you're into that sort of thing, and the Helldivers occasionally spit out gems like "Say 'hello' to Democracy!" while blowing up a planet with orbital strikes or stomping on things in a Mech resembling the Dreadnoughts of Warhammer 40k. You also unlock cosmetic customization options as you progress through the leveling system, and some of them look pretty nifty. Your cape is the most important item in the game, as it will flow magnificently behind you as you twirl in place.\n\nOccasionally there are connection issues. A friend of mine seemed to be disconnected from the game any time we failed a mission. Other players have reported black screens. Once I saw, through a screenshot of someone else's game, an objective spawn outside of the bounds of the map. Personally i haven't experienced any issues other than seeing my friend disconnect, and I consider the game to be pretty playable in its current state (5/17/2016).\n\nIf I have a major complaint it is that the game forces all players to share a screen. This is the era of internet play and I don't need that nonsense. I have died a few times because I got stuck around an objective off screen and couldn't see. It isn't a huge deal in terms of enjoying the game, it's just an archaic design decision that gets in the way for players who are not playing local coop.\n\n9/10 - shows improvement from the studio and fills the dark void left by Alien Swarm.","May 17","true","29.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I inexpertly chose to helldive in the middle of an objective – a SAM site I had to reactivate in order to help the war effort against the Bugs – and what that meant was the moment I came out of my pod I was swarmed by crawling insects, desperately trying to bludgeon and fire my way away from them before activating. I survived, because democracy must be brought to everyone.\n\nHelldivers is a game version of Starship Troopers, to explain the sentence above. You are a highly armed, entirely disposable marine from Super Earth, whose job is to spread freedom and democracy to the melee-centered Bugs (yes, that’s how they’re called), the tech-heavy, shield-using Illuminate and the also heavily armed Cyborgs. You do this by killing them by the thousands with guns aptly named ‘Double Freedom’ and ‘Patriot’, all the while screaming one-liners like “FREEEEDOM!”. Other references to Starship Troopers abound in the introductory cinematic and the dialogue you can have with the other military personnel aboard your ship, though there’s no plot-depth to speak of – there’s a war and you need to win it.\n\nFrom your hub you will upgrade your weapons and stratagems, change your perks and, of course, customize your clothes (Helldivers evidently wear capes, because why not), and once all that is done you can choose which enemy you’ll face and what planet you’ll helldive onto. The war effort is essentially a cooperative one, as each of your and other helldivers’ actions on a front add points to a bar that, once full, will allow you to besiege the enemy’s home planet and terminate him for the remainder of the war period (or if you allow them to push the front, they will besiege your capital planet and you shall need to defend it).\n\nThe missions themselves can be carried out by one to four people, with more helldivers equaling more and tougher enemies, and get increasingly hectic with both amount of players and mission difficulty. Arrowhead’s past with Magicka is clearly here: from the frequent friendly fire – you’ll often shoot your friends to death or deploy exosuits and turrets on top of them, spelling their demise, though they won’t be stuck in boredom for too long, as you can quickly and easily re-deploy them – to the key combinations that you’ll use to call in a wide range of stratagems, from fly-by shootings and tactical nukes to shoulder-mounted flamethrowers and motorcycles.\n\nThe objectives of each mission are varied and intuitive, and you’ll see yourself having to use your abilities in different ways as you defend an area for a set amount of time, escort a group of friendlies to an extraction point or search a small field for ordnance you need to disarm. The means to carry out these missions also increases greatly as you gain experience and research points, not only unlocking new weapons, stratagems and perks but improving said weapons and stratagems to further flesh out their uniqueness. I found the progression system to be particularly good, as I never felt like I was playing to progress, but rather progressing as a consequence of playing – the variety of enemies, planets and their hazards (from frozen wastelands and boggy swamps that slow you down to volcanic regions that spew fire) and tools to deal with them means you have to alter your loadout according to necessity, as each faction plays differently and is susceptible to certain tactics and weapons.\n\nWhile it isn’t particularly good-looking, with relatively simplistic graphics implemented (likely due to its presence on the PSVita), Helldivers is far from an eye-sore, and once you’re in motion – deploying bombs and in gunfights – the lack of detail becomes hard to notice. The sound design, on the other hand, is superb: meaty sound effects and visceral noises play appropriately according to who you shoot and what you shoot them with, each weapon having a distinctive and recognizable sound that ramps up according to its firepower.\n\nHelldivers is a simple game, but what it does it does well. With little down-time within and between missions you’ll constantly be in the thick of combat, praying that neither foe nor friend kill you, laying down democracy at whatever rate of fire your weapon has. A quick to join and easy to use multiplayer interface means your friends and strangers can easily drop in and out of your games, no hassle involved, and while you can certainly enjoy it alone Helldivers shines when you’re shouting at your friend for deploying his tank on your head you and your buddies help each other, frantically trying to stave off hordes of enemies before making a heroic escape on the dropship.

The developers posted they deliberatly impaired the keyboard + mouse  control system because it was to superior to the controller. Maybe you've played that game QWOP? think of the control scheme desicion making leaning in that direction.\n\nOn to the issue at hand, think open loop control system with limited conditional feedback. Your aim reticule position is hidden when you move thus it's constantly changing out of view. With the reticule orientation and  zero position tied to WASD, it's never in sync with your physical mouse. Which forces you to constantly reorient your mouse to the new position when you finally do see the reticule.\n\nAlso just to throw instult to injury, when your in a mech the proper control scheme is suddenly there. Which creates unneeded frustration to know the game could be enjoyable if you didn't have to fight the asinine controls.","December 21, 2015","false","75.9"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","28","51","5","2"

This is however very often counter-balanced by the frenzied fighting to secure those objectives, which is where the game shines the most.\n\nAlso, I'd advise getting the Deluxe Edition.

The weapons are almost universally fun to use, the mechs and tanks really give you a kickass feel, and there are few equipment options that are downright bad.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game?\n\nThe camera. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera. It was designed for a hot-seat/friends-in-front-of-TV multiplayer situation, meaning that it just settles in the rough center of the group of characters. This keeps everyone together, which is good, however, the view area is painfully tiny, which is bad, and it is consistently the least fun mechanic, because the view area is so TINY that big enemies can barely fit in it alongside the player characters. When you die, it'll rarely be because you got outflanked or screwed up, it'll be because you got sniped by an enemy literally outside of the field of view or because you ran afoul of the view area and got trapped in a niche somewhere while enemies dogpiled you.\n\nThe camera works fine for singleplayer, but the game ramps difficulty too high for most people to play singleplayer beyond the very earliest and easiest stuff. If there's a patch saying they've improved the camera by the time you read this review, ignore it, get the game, you'll have fun.

I do not know why I failed to remember that.  Perhaps a wizard put a spell on me.  There are approximately 3 different missions in this game which you will repeat over and over and over:\n\n1) Fix a dumb computer which is located in the middle of a hostile alien planet for reasons unknown\n2) Pick up somebody's luggage and carry it to a hut because space luggage is very important and needs to be in its space hut\n3) Kill things\n\nOh also there's escort missions where you guide a pack of slow, dim-witted morons across the map and watch them get killed halfway to your destination because instead of having brains, god installed putty in their heads.

Other than the patrols roaming around and any mayhem the players themselves are causing, there's nothing going on anywhere ever. No enemy workers doing daily tasks, no bugs feasting on corpses, no cyborgs fixing their mechanical limbs, no random firefights between human survivors and whoever owns the planet you're on...\n\nThat's all of the gripes that come to mind.\n\nThe sound and visual design is amazing, all of the weapons are satisfying to fire and explosions are fun. When you fire an LMG and the screen starts shaking and that beefy sound hits your ears, it makes you feel like a total badass.\n\nWeapon variety is nice. There's pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, flamethrowers, plasma guns, missile and grenade launchers, demolition charges, LMGs, lightning guns and a fully automatic rifle that fires rockets. For vehicles there's 3 different mechs, 2 APCs, one tank destroyer and a motorbike.\n\nDespite the game's flaws, and it being relatively dull when played solo, I still keep coming back for more. If you like twin stick shooters, loved Alien Swarm and/or have a friend or two who would like to give it a try, go nuts. If you don't like twin stick shooters or hated Alien Swarm, steer clear.","March 18","true","154.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Helldivers are commando units that accomplish short missions to advance in our fight for democracy on distant worlds. It can be to nuke a bug nest, reactivate a SAM site, defuse mines in a minefield, rescue some survivors. You get in, accomplish one or more objectives and get out. It can get repetitive if you spend hours of your day playing Helldiivers, but for people my age that have to do grown up stuff, it is perfect. The game reminds me of the old NES Guerrilla War, but this time you can kill your partner and ask for special equipment or artillery fire to be delivered wherever you want.\n\nHelldivers multiplayer is great. People are nice enough to let you ruin their game without being too rude. Yeah, sorry about that guys, but I´m a slow learner. However, the game is not hard to master, and you can serve of great support once you learn how to use stratagems and not to kill your friends.\n\nIt lets you play cooperatively on your computer, which is a plus for me because I play with my GF and my kid without affecting the game of others. We have a blast with this game.\n\nIt also runs smoothly without being too demanding on hardware, and it still looks awesome.\n\nI recommend this one for people who do not have the time to dedicate hours to a long campaign, and want to start killing stuff in the name of liberty within minutes. Some DLC are decent, the Terrain Specialist DLC is a must, do not whine about it not being included and just get it, you will need it.","February 25","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schtakimushrooms/recommended/394510/","schtakimushrooms","Harvey Wallbanger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schtakimushrooms/","331 products in account","Possibly the best top down shooter I've ever played.\n\nIf you like twin stick shooters and just hated how arcadey they usually are, this is the game for you.\nTake a standard top down shooter, add ammo wastage, remove automatic reloads, and add friendly fire. This all contributes to a really strategic cooperative experience that is both satisfying and unforgiving.\nAnd I really do mean unforgiving.\n\nDying in this game is almost as common as dying in a roguelike, it's often and the cause can be just about anything.\nIt still makes me laugh every time I join a multiplayer session to orbital drop straight on top of someone's head, watching them explode into this accidental, visceral mess. And they're probably laughing too, which is great.\n\nThe game has a 'strategem' feature where you equip various beacons before missions which allow you to call in various types of support during your time on the planet. Vehicles, ordnance, equipment, and defensive structures like turrets.\nBut as the name implies, there is a lot of strategy to equipping and using these things.\nThrowing a beacon out for an airstrike? Best aim it good or you'll kill your teammates.\nPlanning on bringing in a turret? Watch where you place it because that thing shoots at enemies no matter what, even if they're directly behind you. You'll know who to blame when you're turned into swiss cheese.\n\nAlong with the stratagems there's multiple weapons and a perk system. The weapons you unlock through leveling up along with the perks, but you can upgrade the weapons through research points you can earn by leveling and picking up samples when on missions. The upgrades can be applied to strategems too.\nIn my opinion the upgrade options on the weapons are a bit shallow but the research points come in at such a pace that there's some real decisions you'll have to make on what to upgrade because the points quickly become scarce.\nIt's nicely balanced though, if you're playing with friends you can coordinate with each other on who upgrades what because you each get an individual loadout for the missions you go on. You can all focus on contributing in different ways.\n\nThe missions themselves are decently varied. You get volcanic, snow, desert, and forest planets that are all inhabited by one of three types of enemies, Bugs, Cyborgs, and the Illuminate. It's not an incredibly wide variety of settings but it's definitely enough to keep the game varied as all of the planet types come with their own challenges.\nSnow is incredibly hard to move around in, so it's useful to bring along a vehicle to help speed things up whereas volcanic has less cover but more pits of lava and the occasional eruption which have to be avoided unless you want to burn to death.\nThe 3 enemy factions are also sufficiently varied, each having completely unique enemies with their own attack patterns and weaknesses. The enemies encircle Super Earth, the humans home planet, and their aim is to destroy it. The aim of the humans is of course to do the same to the 3 factions, push them back and assault their home planet. This makes up a  neat metagame that anyone playing Helldivers contributes to when completing missions and liberating planets. The more people that contribute to a region, the quicker the region will be captured.\nThe ultimate goal is to wipe out all 3 factions, at which point the war will end and begin anew.\n\nAll in all, Helldivers is great. If you were thinking about getting this game but are hesitant I honestly can't recommend it more. Get some friends together, shoot some BUUUUUGS and liberate some damn planets.\n\nFor democracy!","December 7, 2015","true","45.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game lacks much in the way of content to keep you going after you have unlocked all the strategems and done the bosses once or twice each. But if you play with friends you can keep it enjoyable even after that by leveling up for bragging rights, or by participating in the war effort.\n\nThe game isn't forced group content, you can solo nearly everything in the game with skill, practice and leveled up strategems. The only content I found myself unable to solo no matter what, was the illuminate "great eye" and the cyborg helldive arenas. (The ones where you have to kill 400 enemies.) However playing with others made everything easier and faster not to mention vastly more fun.\n\nThis is a GREAT game to play with some buddies, or even just random people when you get bored. And surprisingly the community is mostly comprised of good people. (Out of some 3,000 battles I've encountered only 4 terrible people.)\n\nI've spent about $40 on this game +DLC, and I can definitely say I've gotten my money's worth, every last cent.","December 6, 2015","true","155.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Other than the patrols roaming around and any mayhem the players themselves are causing, there's nothing going on anywhere ever. No enemy workers doing daily tasks, no bugs feasting on corpses, no cyborgs fixing their mechanical limbs, no random firefights between human survivors and whoever owns the planet you're on...\n\nThat's all of the gripes that come to mind.\n\nThe sound and visual design is amazing, all of the weapons are satisfying to fire and explosions are fun. When you fire an LMG and the screen starts shaking and that beefy sound hits your ears, it makes you feel like a total badass.\n\nWeapon variety is nice. There's pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, flamethrowers, plasma guns, missile and grenade launchers, demolition charges, LMGs, lightning guns and a fully automatic rifle that fires rockets. For vehicles there's 3 different mechs, 2 APCs, one tank destroyer and a motorbike.\n\nDespite the game's flaws, and it being relatively dull when played solo, I still keep coming back for more. If you like twin stick shooters, loved Alien Swarm and/or have a friend or two who would like to give it a try, go nuts. If you don't like twin stick shooters or hated Alien Swarm, steer clear.","March 18","true","154.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fragging your teammates is very common, and messy situations are a norm.\n\nBut the game goes beyond that. It features a really nice community "campaign" that really makes you feel like you are contributing, even if you aren't playing as often as your friends. The music is really nice, as it pumps you up whenever there's a firefight going on and gives you a nice, sneaky atmosphere as you are skulking around on the enemy planet.\n\nFun for everyone, even if they end up dead by their friends.\n\nExcellento.\n\nSuper.\n\n\n\nFor real.

Teammates are a close second though (I excluded the incidents where I deemed it a good idea to run into their bullet-stream from this ranking). Exiting a moving vehicle may kill you, You may spawn doomed, when your character gets out of his pod and you see the teammate's pod incoming. I wondered: will it kill me? Which is a stupid rquestion in this game. Yes, of course, it will kill you.\n\nIf a map has structures that kinda look like bridges over a canyon: yes, they are bridges, and yes, it is deadly to step beside them.\n\nWhen your teammates die, you can call them in as reinforcements (witha cooldown). If you are not carefull - you guessed it - their drop-pods kill you. However, you would also kill any big bad monster that happens to be below the drop-pod...\n\nThat sounds like teammates are bad - but it's really fun. I totally failed about 10% of the missions (5 out of 52), but the game lets you attempt the stage again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feindfeuer/recommended/394510/","Feindfeuer","Feindfeuer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feindfeuer/","1015 products in account","This is one of the Titles that made me contemplate getting a Console again when it was first released, but now we got a PC port, and a good one at that. The Resolution can be customized to whatever you need, the framerate seems good and the controlls are perfectly adjusted to be used with mouse and keyboard now.\n\nThis is Magicka 40.000 - Starship Troopers Edition; you get the franktic, team-killing heavy co-op experience of Magicka set in a star ship troopers (movies, not the books) inspired future rounded up with the magicka typical humour. Of course there is no magic and spell mixing, instead the frantic button pressing comes from interaction with objectives and calling in support drops (which you'll be doing a lot), those are done with WASD input string.\n\nUnlike Magicka, you don't get a story campaign; instead you liberate planets by going on procedural generated missions to help the overall war effort; securing victory for Super Earth over the two alien and one heretic faction. The victories and failures of every Helldiver is collected and applied to the online campaign map with special siege and assault missions getting unlocked as the Players lose or gain supremacy over a system and either push forward towards the alien homworld or get pushed back towards Super Earth. Once every Enemy homeworld is destroyed the war is one, and you get a victory cutscene and a trophy, or Super Earth falls and you lose and you don't deserve nothing for that.\n\nThere is a progression system. For each mission you gain XP to level up your alter ego, unlocking new weapons, perks and visual customization in form of armor parts. You also gain new Strategems (call downs) by liberating planet and you can further upgrade all those weapons and strategems by using research points you gain from leveling up or collecting scraps of research related stuff during missions.\n\nBUT there are some things that people might not like:\n- turning isn't instant, your turning speed depends on the weapon (or vehicle) you're using and if you're currently firing a weapon and what weapon. Some people dislike this sometimes sluggish feel, but I like it as a way to differentiate weapons and balance some of the heavy toys\n- you'll die a lot, and sometimes your teammates will be at fault or, even worse, you yourself screwed up. Some people get easily frustrated by stuff like that and this game is certainly not for them.\n- calling in Strategems and interacting with objectives can feel like a QTE, especially if you're doing it while a hoard of bugs is charging you and your team is all lying dead on the floor. For me (and only in this case) those add tension and challenge to the whole situation, others just get annoyed by that so be warned.","December 5, 2015","true","28.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has been out on the Playstation 4 for 10 months now, and the devs have been getting feedback from the community on what they wanted in the game, and have added it.\n\nFor me, I only purchased the base game and still have a blast with it, and I suggest you do the same until you have a grasp for the game, and understand what YOU would want added to it, and see if that is in the DLC. I already have 31 hours into it, and still have a lot to explore. The best way to describe this game is that you pod drop into a map as strangers, and come out as brothers. The difficulty can get very real later on down the road. However, with the correct amount of skill and correct load out choices even the most difficult of missions can become trivial.\n\nIf you are looking for a GREAT Co-Op game that has you fighting tooth to nail, is extremely hectic, and that will always have you on your toes then this is the only game I could reccomend for that. All of that with a very nice progressive upgrading system that doesn't go easy on you. You get 1 research point per level-up which is nice to start off with, but once you hit level 15 the experience gain won't keep you afloat on everything that you'll be unlocking that you want to try out. In turn, the devs have added "Samples" which, after you collect 10, will net you a research point to upgrade your equipment. These samples can be found scattered around the map and offer a risk-reward type of system for exploring the zones.\n\nThe graphics hit home with the aesthetic, the game doesn't take itself too seriously with some light-hearted puns. You aren't going to be thinking by the end of the day how you wish you could have that cool DLC item that Random Shmoe had, you're going to be thinking about that time where he called down a Mech that landed on a friendly that wasn't paying attention, or him falling down the same hole TWICE in the same mission because it wasn't apparent, or running away for your dear life from an army of Cyborgs, or even that time you got that sweet revive off just as you were the last person to be killed, reviving all four of you.\n\nThis game you play for the experience, and my experience has been nothing but positive even with just the base game.\n\nPros:\n- Great Co-Op\n- Hilarity in Deaths\n- Good leveling up system\n- Wide variety of equipment\n- Excellent difficulty curve\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty eventually becomes trivial (For high skilled players with the correct load-out)\n- Forced to play Multiplayer for most of the unlocks","December 8, 2015","true","42.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay has a learning curve but once you get into the swing of things the strategems (weapons, vehicles, and ordanance) become a second nature and are absolutely vital to do well. I'm happy to see a game like this that has not got a single microtransaction and instead expansion packs that give you new toys to play with as you wreak havoc across the galaxy.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are great and the game doesn't need a top-spec computer to run well.\n-Gameplay is fun, challenging, humourous and tactical.\n-Teamkilling never gets old, although it tends to be an accident majority of the time.\n-The game doesn't take itself too seriously and the difficulty levels range from incredibly easy to downright impossible, there is a difficulty for any pace of gameplay.\n-Enemies all have their own unique abilities and tactics, making no two missions the same.\n-Levelling up and unlocking new items becomes addictive and keeps you coming back amongst other things.\n-Levels are procedurally generated, adding much needed variety.\n\nCons:\n-Hard to see where you are looking at on a mouse and keyboard unless you aim. The cursor is signified as a transluscent blurred circle, making it hard to find in the heat of battle.\n-Some members in the community are elitist that take the game way too seriously, I'd recommend picking this game up and having at least two friends to play with.\n-Warlocks.\n\nFantastic little game, best I've played in a while.\nHighly recommend it to anyone who wants to spread the word of Democracy.\n\n"HAVE YOURSELF A NICE CUP OF LIBER-TEA!"\n\n-Edit-\nSpelling and grammar mistakes.\nExtra positive point.","January 24","true","12.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

You are a Helldiver and that means making the safety of Super Earth your personal responsibility, using a huge range of weapons you will spread “managed democracy” across the galaxy one bullet (or laser or toxic goo or missile or fire etc…) at a time. It takes a very satirical approach to the messaging reminiscent of 1998 masterpiece Starship Troopers.\n\nFirst up is the graphics, they are not genre defining and by no means the selling point of the game but Helldivers is pretty to look at. By utilising vivid colors and an almost cartoon quality Helldivers is easy on the eye, throughout my time with Helldivers I experienced no graphical or frame rate issues. Most impressive are the weapon effects, each weapon handles very differently and you can plainly see the time and effort that has gone in to the various animations. Bullets from a LMG spray across the screen with smoking shells flying and laser guns overheat with smoke rising from the weapon, it is this attention to detail that really gives this game an edge. The only weapon that left me slightly disappointed was the flamethrower, the first spews out in a steady stream rather than the sustained wide destruction you would want from such a weapon especially as the effects on all other weapons are done so well.\nSound next, whilst lacking in variety the score is a perfect representation of how quickly things can turn bad for a Helldiver. As you land on the planet and are exploring you will be treated with a quiet mellow tune, this will quickly change when you are greeted with waves of enemies. There is nothing like standing back to back with your squad awaiting extraction as dramatic music reminiscent of final battles in big budget Hollywood movies plays, again it is these moments that set Helldivers apart from other top down action games.\n\nNow the gameplay, this is where Helldivers really shines and this is what will keep you coming back to play it again and again. The premise is simple, you with up to three others drop on an enemy planet and you are given a series of objectives that you can complete or fail. Failing a single objective does not fail mission, you will still get the chance to extract but will be penalised when it comes to receiving XP. Helldivers is simple on paper but I cannot stress enough, this game is addictive as hell! I can’t remember the last time a game completely consumed me and I have not been able to put it down since purchasing it.\n\nYou will face three different alien races as a Helldiver. The Illuminate are an advanced bunch, capable of futurist feats and able to kill you in a single blow with a shot from one of their laser cannons. Next are the Cyborgs, these guys are heavily armed and to face them you should be to, unless you want to end up as roadkill underneath one of their hulking tanks. Finally, my personal favourite, the Bugs. These come in all shapes and sizes and can prove quite deadly to an inexperienced squad.\n\nHow you tackle these three enemies differs massively, having a single load out will simply not cut it. Take the time in the lower difficulty zones to see how the enemy operates and find their weaknesses. This should adequately prepare you for what is to come but you can never be sure and believe me when I say everything in Helldivers is out to kill you but more on that later.\n\nThere is simply so much to this game that completionists will easily be able to squeeze 100 hours of gameplay from Helldivers. You collect research points which allow you to upgrade weapons or stratagems, you get these by either collecting samples found in the map and by levelling up your character. When you have collected enough you are presented with so many options it can be a tough choice. Do you upgrade your machine gun to hold more rounds? Do you upgrade your APC to give more protection to your team? The list goes on but it is important to say that all of the upgrades have meaning and will change the way you play, nothing feels tacked on for the sake it.\nIt is a good idea to make your character strong as mentioned previously everything in Helldivers is out to kill you. Not only is friendly fire always on but the pods your teammates arrive in, defence turrets, mines or vehicles will instantly kill you if you are not careful. Even trying to play the game defensively can quickly end badly. Death for a single  Helldiver is not the end of the mission however, as long as one teammate is alive (and the stratagem isn’t on cooldown) your dead teammates can be dropped back into the action…just be sure to not stand underneath them when they do.\nHelldivers does a very good job of making you feel part of an army with the galactic war set up. The war is fought on three sides representing the three different alien races, as you complete missions and secure planets in a particular zone you will eventually reach the alien home world. This will start a timed event calling all Helldivers to focus their efforts to defeat the enemy. Alternatively if there are not enough Helldivers fighting the alien scum the war can reach Super Earth, much like reaching a home world all Helldivers will be called to defend their home.\n\nBesides the small selection of music and underwhelming graphics the one major downside to this game is not capitalising on its humorous tone and Starship Trooper inspiration. Whilst your character will occasionally shout hilarious comments as they fight the enemy this is all we see, I would have loved to see more cutscenes and perhaps be introduced to interesting characters within the universe.\n\nHelldivers gets a score of 90/100. Besides its lack of story content, uninspired visuals and relatively small selection of music the gameplay easily makes you forget all of that. In fact without those minor issues Helldivers would be a perfect game. Helldivers provides some of the best white knuckle co-op action I have ever played and there is no better feeling than making it off a planet swarming with enemies with your whole squad. This game is definitely worth a full purchase as you will want to keep coming back…and bring friends, it gets dangerous out there!\n","February 22","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/centagon/recommended/394510/","centagon","Cent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/centagon/","423 products in account","Pretty much all the negative reviews focus around the DLC model. Most of the DLC is trash anyway, so only those who love (inferior) variety should think about getting the bundle packs. Purchase selectively if you want. Best DLC are: Demolition's Pack for satchel charges, Support Pack's laser carbine if you liked the standard beam weapon, and the Vehicle pack for the anti-tank mech. So, overpriced or sleazy or not, the DLC isn't even a factor.\n\nThe rest of the game is simple, casual fun. It's basically a fleshed out Alien Swarm with a grindy community-metagame tacked onto it. There are more items/weapons/vehicles/gimmicks, but the game plays and feels the same. You drop into procedurally generated maps of varying difficulty with randomized objectives, blast everything and exfiltrate. Replayability comes purely from trying different combinations of loadouts, affecting your call-down abilities and starting kit.\n\nThe game is really quite simple and fun, and has the content and replayability of a $15 game (the store descriptions of '100+ hours of gameplay' and 'hardcore' are... too optmistic), so I'd say that the only legitimate complaint is that it is only slightly overpriced right now.","December 8, 2015","true","60.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game plays surprisingly well even with the multiple controller actions that you can do - Yes, just like in Magicka, you'll sprain your fingers making and managing the right key combinations.\n\nI've only gone through the training mission and then the first place the army dropped me (for the greater good) was smack in the middle of a very intense war zone. My first solo exploration didn't go so well, in fact I got schooled big time in less than 2 minutes.\n\nAt minute 3 I was joined by another player - I did not even know my game was open to the public, so my first action killed my new "friend".\n\nWhat later followed after an apology and a revive (called reinforcement) 2 more players joined and for almost 20 minutes we fought BUGS! Lots of BUGS!\n\nThere are more enemies to encounter, but we (Earth, or Super Earth) seem to be getting our collective backsides kicked on those fronts.\n\nThe game is interactive and things happen even if you are not playing, which is another concept I really like about this game.\n\nAs for technical aspects. The game runs fine at 60fps on a GTX970, but it will not work well on a multi-monitor setup like mine (I got 3x 27" for flight/racing etc.), but its windowed mode it perfectly adequate as the intensity of the game pulls your focus right in and you won't even notice it.\n\nI would advice that you use a game pad for this game and what ever you do, watch your fire - you can easily kill friends as enemies - this game is as unforgiving as Magicka.","December 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only tips I can give is try not to get angry at Teamkilling.\n\nIts going to happen a lot.\n\nThe game is essentially a group of mini-missions that can be completed with freinds or alone to conquer a planet for the glory of super earth. You must attack, defend, escort a series of objectives on a mission and then extract. The fun comes in the powers availble such as airstrikes and deployable turrets. All of these have big boom firepower that can devastate your enemies and your freinds.\n\nWhilst playing alone is a bit of a poorer experiance it is possible and can be a quick bout of fun but the real deal is doing the higher tier missions with a full team set for extreme combat.\n\nI cannot recommed this game enough for the price and the fun factors with friends.","December 7, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would you like to spread democracy across the galaxy?  If the answer is yes then Helldivers is the game for you!  Made by the developers of Magika and Gauntlet, Helldivers puts you in the boots of a space marine in charge of fighting a three front war in order to defend Super Earth and bring freedom to the galaxy.\n\nThe game features plenty of weapons and perks that allow for great customization within a squad.  Although the game can be played alone it truly shines when you invite some friends along for the ride.  If you enjoy top down stick shooters you should not pass this one up.\n\nThere has been a lot of issues made over the amount of DLCs avalible, their cost, and if they give players an advantage over the default weapons.  While there are some packs that have helpful weapons or items, none of them are really a must have unless you see something that fits your playstyle.  If you are going to buy a DLC I would suggest picking up the Ranger Pack for the UAV to find samples and the Terrain Specialist Pack for the all terrain boots for snow worlds.","December 7, 2015","true","581.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What this means is that while paying a few bucks will give you more options it also has allowed them to release the important things for free to everyone - which is important because it avoids splitting the community the way that larger paid expansions would.\n\nA couple of the DLC do seem overpowered in the beginning but I think that's mostly because you have them unlocked automatically while everything else you need to unlock manually.","December 9, 2015","true","34.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played Magicka a bit but it bored me after a few sessions, for this game I just keep going. Over 20 hours in 5 (working) days...\nThe game is frantic non-stop action with a high skill ceiling and varied gameplay.\nWhat stood out to me the most (if I have to focus on one unusual thing) is the attention to detail in the animation department. E.g. how the Helldivers enter various vehicles. A lesser dev might have just made them pop in and out of the models but not Arrowhead! The Helldivers enter and exit through hatches on the models with a corresponding unique animation – which has a function from the gameplay standpoint too since the vehicles can burn up and explode and you have to take the escape time into account.\nOr one could provide the example how they made all vehicles control differently on purpose – the motorcycle controls like something out of a racing game with the RT serving as the accelerator while the bastion tank destroyer controls, well, literally like a tank with each stick moving one tread (push both up to move forward, push them in opposite directions for quick turning).","December 10, 2015","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you and some friends are bored and searching for an entertaining title to play, look no further. I was reluctant to purchase this due to the whole over head camera view, never really been drawn to this style of game. I noticed it had full controller support so I figured I'd give this a shot before keyboard and mouse.\n\nBottom line, get a controller for this game. Not only will it make it more enjoyable, you will absolutely need it when you start taking on the higher difficulty setting. Oh..and if you don't have a controller, it's worth a purchase solely for this.\n\nHELLDIVERS provides you with some of the most intense, white knuckle moments you will experience in a game out today. It takes only 1 of your team mates to not be completely focused to bring an entire mission into shambles. Team work, strategy and communication is KEY. Higher difficulties are not for the faint of heart. Never have I experienced such a sense of accomplishment after finishing a difficulty I didn't think was possible beating. This game will push you and your friends to your absolute limits, it's one HELL of a ride, or should I say dive.","February 26","true","45.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Get 2 to 4 players on the same screen, have no friendly fire protection, then have practically every action capable of killing your own team-mates.\n\nThe enemy types are different enough from each over to make things interesting, and there's a novel take on the campaign map screen that does hammer home the feeling of being in an "elite" army "fighting against hostile invaders" that "threaten" Super Earth.\n\nAnd yes, the Starship Troopers style mockery of the action is funny, if it does get a little grating after a while. There's only so many times you can snicker at deploying a "Truth Trainsmitter" and knowing full well it's a mind control device.\n\nAs for the weapons, there's a fairly good spread of the standard fair. The DLCs does add to the pool with some intriging takes on the base loudout, but certainly not as "game-changing" as the forums are currently alight with. But I digress.\n\nMultplayer runs fairly well. There's a tech in game that can bump you up the matchmaking list if you badly need another Helldiver to deploy to the squad, but finding the time to do this mid-mission when you're better off focusing on actually staying alive is a tad tricky. Aside from that, Arrowhead's love of not allowing players to hide behind turning off friendly fire brings it's usual bundle of backstabbing, accidental or otherwise, as well as all the wonderful ways to troll the party. For those that might be concerned by this, there's a rep system which will allow the more "helpful" players to find eachother, as well as a kick system. Of course, there's also the option to limit the Lobby to Friends only or to a Private session as well\n\nSolo play isn't that ideal, but it is possible. Basically you're automatically respawn upon death, but only once at the start, then another chance is added upon completing an objective. It's certainly less enjoyable than dodging your team-mates fire as well as your own turrets and the enemy, but it's there for those that want it.\n\nOveral I've been enjoying my time with it. The only real change I'd like to see is more of a warning when dropping large vehicles down to avoid "accidentally" dropping another pod on top of it. Granted that might remove some of the fun, but it's a tad disheartening when a badly placed ammo drop is timed beautifully to explode that APC you were putting your hopes on.\n\nThat, or I guess we can Get Gud, right? d=)","December 7, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BreadedSam/recommended/394510/","BreadedSam","BreadedSam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BreadedSam/","24 products in account","Helldivers is a top-down twin stick shooter from developer Arrowhead, on the surface this description is underwhelming but through a combination of diverse enemies and addictive gameplay it has the potential to be the very best in its genre.\n\nOn starting the game you are greeted with a slick recruitment video giving you all the motivation you need to drop into enemy territory. You are a Helldiver and that means making the safety of Super Earth your personal responsibility, using a huge range of weapons you will spread “managed democracy” across the galaxy one bullet (or laser or toxic goo or missile or fire etc…) at a time. It takes a very satirical approach to the messaging reminiscent of 1998 masterpiece Starship Troopers.\n\nFirst up is the graphics, they are not genre defining and by no means the selling point of the game but Helldivers is pretty to look at. By utilising vivid colors and an almost cartoon quality Helldivers is easy on the eye, throughout my time with Helldivers I experienced no graphical or frame rate issues. Most impressive are the weapon effects, each weapon handles very differently and you can plainly see the time and effort that has gone in to the various animations. Bullets from a LMG spray across the screen with smoking shells flying and laser guns overheat with smoke rising from the weapon, it is this attention to detail that really gives this game an edge. The only weapon that left me slightly disappointed was the flamethrower, the first spews out in a steady stream rather than the sustained wide destruction you would want from such a weapon especially as the effects on all other weapons are done so well.\nSound next, whilst lacking in variety the score is a perfect representation of how quickly things can turn bad for a Helldiver. As you land on the planet and are exploring you will be treated with a quiet mellow tune, this will quickly change when you are greeted with waves of enemies. There is nothing like standing back to back with your squad awaiting extraction as dramatic music reminiscent of final battles in big budget Hollywood movies plays, again it is these moments that set Helldivers apart from other top down action games.\n\nNow the gameplay, this is where Helldivers really shines and this is what will keep you coming back to play it again and again. The premise is simple, you with up to three others drop on an enemy planet and you are given a series of objectives that you can complete or fail. Failing a single objective does not fail mission, you will still get the chance to extract but will be penalised when it comes to receiving XP. Helldivers is simple on paper but I cannot stress enough, this game is addictive as hell! I can’t remember the last time a game completely consumed me and I have not been able to put it down since purchasing it.\n\nYou will face three different alien races as a Helldiver. The Illuminate are an advanced bunch, capable of futurist feats and able to kill you in a single blow with a shot from one of their laser cannons. Next are the Cyborgs, these guys are heavily armed and to face them you should be to, unless you want to end up as roadkill underneath one of their hulking tanks. Finally, my personal favourite, the Bugs. These come in all shapes and sizes and can prove quite deadly to an inexperienced squad.\n\nHow you tackle these three enemies differs massively, having a single load out will simply not cut it. Take the time in the lower difficulty zones to see how the enemy operates and find their weaknesses. This should adequately prepare you for what is to come but you can never be sure and believe me when I say everything in Helldivers is out to kill you but more on that later.\n\nThere is simply so much to this game that completionists will easily be able to squeeze 100 hours of gameplay from Helldivers. You collect research points which allow you to upgrade weapons or stratagems, you get these by either collecting samples found in the map and by levelling up your character. When you have collected enough you are presented with so many options it can be a tough choice. Do you upgrade your machine gun to hold more rounds? Do you upgrade your APC to give more protection to your team? The list goes on but it is important to say that all of the upgrades have meaning and will change the way you play, nothing feels tacked on for the sake it.\nIt is a good idea to make your character strong as mentioned previously everything in Helldivers is out to kill you. Not only is friendly fire always on but the pods your teammates arrive in, defence turrets, mines or vehicles will instantly kill you if you are not careful. Even trying to play the game defensively can quickly end badly. Death for a single  Helldiver is not the end of the mission however, as long as one teammate is alive (and the stratagem isn’t on cooldown) your dead teammates can be dropped back into the action…just be sure to not stand underneath them when they do.\nHelldivers does a very good job of making you feel part of an army with the galactic war set up. The war is fought on three sides representing the three different alien races, as you complete missions and secure planets in a particular zone you will eventually reach the alien home world. This will start a timed event calling all Helldivers to focus their efforts to defeat the enemy. Alternatively if there are not enough Helldivers fighting the alien scum the war can reach Super Earth, much like reaching a home world all Helldivers will be called to defend their home.\n\nBesides the small selection of music and underwhelming graphics the one major downside to this game is not capitalising on its humorous tone and Starship Trooper inspiration. Whilst your character will occasionally shout hilarious comments as they fight the enemy this is all we see, I would have loved to see more cutscenes and perhaps be introduced to interesting characters within the universe.\n\nHelldivers gets a score of 90/100. Besides its lack of story content, uninspired visuals and relatively small selection of music the gameplay easily makes you forget all of that. In fact without those minor issues Helldivers would be a perfect game. Helldivers provides some of the best white knuckle co-op action I have ever played and there is no better feeling than making it off a planet swarming with enemies with your whole squad. This game is definitely worth a full purchase as you will want to keep coming back…and bring friends, it gets dangerous out there!\n","February 22","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only will it make it more enjoyable, you will absolutely need it when you start taking on the higher difficulty setting. Oh..and if you don't have a controller, it's worth a purchase solely for this.\n\nHELLDIVERS provides you with some of the most intense, white knuckle moments you will experience in a game out today. It takes only 1 of your team mates to not be completely focused to bring an entire mission into shambles. Team work, strategy and communication is KEY.

Yet, somehow, it does all this without being overwhelming or intimidating.  I learned enough to stop being a team-killing rookie within the first few hours of play.\n\nAnother thing that anyone looking to buy this should know is this: even though single player is an option, it isn't really feasible beyond the easiest missions.  Because enemies can attack from anywhere, and because characters cannot turn around instantly, 3- or 4- person teams are required to effectively cover multiple angles.  This isn't like MAGICKA, another game developed by Arrowhead Game Studios.  I was able to solo much of MAGICKA.  But in HELLDIVERS, I got killed within a minute of trying a medium-difficulty mission.\n\nThus far, I've had minimal experience with jerk randoms.  A majority of random players I've encountered have been helpful and skilled.  The downside of this game's multiplayer is, like any multiplayer, you're at the mercy of public game availability.  During peak hours, finding a game is easy.  But if you're like me and your friends don't play this game, and you have a hankering to play at 3am or something, you're out of luck because there won't be any public games up.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with this purchase, and I can see myself playing this game for a long while.","March 5","true","39.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It' hardcore in playstyle and it challenge the players to think different when given challenges at higher difficulty. You will die a lot from friends, probably more than from your foes. The stratagems and perks gives you the variety to complete a mission with so many different tactics and that itself with the slow hard earned progress will keep this game alive for many months to come. This is a box of challenge and tons of fun explosive stuffs and mechs to aid in your role to conquer the galaxy.\n\nTips & Info:\n* Weapons that are good alround for starters: Breaker. Sickle (learn to pointfire, dont auto), AR20L-Justice, Schyte, Paragon\n* It's better to complete a mission of lower difficulty than failing over and over, you dont get exp for fails.\n* Level Up doesnt make you stronger, it just gives and upgrade point to spend so upgrade UAV to scan for Samples, it's the currency to upgrade and ur only given 1 every lvl, 10 samples=1 point=1lvl.\n* Train and test new loadouts in single mode before experimenting with 3 others online, you will probably cause more damage to your team untill you master the offensive stratagems.\n* Try to have upgraded anti-tank for harder missions.\n* Think teamplay over all, you're not rambo when past difficulty of 9\n* Campaign is shared with PS3/PS4/Vita players but is not crossplay","December 11, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game that can be both casual and deliciously hardcore.\n\nIf you are not attentive you can trip over a friendly players mines, get stomped by a mech, get shot in the back by someone not looking, so on and so forth. The only tips I can give is try not to get angry at Teamkilling.\n\nIts going to happen a lot.\n\nThe game is essentially a group of mini-missions that can be completed with freinds or alone to conquer a planet for the glory of super earth. You must attack, defend, escort a series of objectives on a mission and then extract. The fun comes in the powers availble such as airstrikes and deployable turrets. All of these have big boom firepower that can devastate your enemies and your freinds.\n\nWhilst playing alone is a bit of a poorer experiance it is possible and can be a quick bout of fun but the real deal is doing the higher tier missions with a full team set for extreme combat.\n\nI cannot recommed this game enough for the price and the fun factors with friends.","December 7, 2015","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerCabal/recommended/394510/","gerCabal","Cabal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerCabal/","84 products in account","________________________________________________________________\n\nHell divers is a jewel among the twin stick shooter games. Extensive weapons and tactical equipment to ensure that it is not boring. With time, you get a knack for what weapons and tactics for the upcoming mission needed. The battle is raging on three different planets. In addition to the sympathetic bugs comes huge cyborgs and highly technologically developed opponents with mental abilities.\n\nI look at the Coop mode with a smiling and crying eye. It's great fun with well organized player. But unfortunately, good players are only rare and the advertised level of the single player suggests rarely to have managed a professional team. This makes all the more enjoyable with friends.\n\n\nThere is simply no experience for killing the opponent. It comes with completed jobs within a mission. Of course there are experience top bonus when you've mastered all sections, are still alive and fully back has left your team planet. Random players tend to destroy all enemies with a heavy arsenal of weapons. Average, a mission with the highest difficulty level takes time like to up to 30 minutes. Experienced players create the solo in half of the time.\n\n\nThe DLC´s are not needed in the progress. The freely available arsenal is sufficient and leaves little to wishes. You can activate within the greatest share of equipment of missions. Who wants to subsidize HELLDIVERS will not regret it. The additional arsenal brings even more fun on the battlefield.\n\n\nEven after many hours, the game is still great fun. The time factor is awesome. Also its a casual game. The missions requires not much time.\n\nHELL DIVERS is his money worth. I can recommend it and wish you a lot of fun with it! You will have it!\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nHelldivers ist eine Perle unter den Twin Stick Shooter. Umfangreiche Waffen- und Taktikausrüstungen sorgen dafür das es nicht langweilig wird. Mit der Zeit bekommt man ein Händchen dafür welche Waffen und Taktiken besonders gut für die anstehende Mission geeignet sind. Die Schlacht tobt auf drei verschiedenen Planeten. Neben den sympatischen Bugs die wir schon in Starship Troopers haben gerne platzen sehen, reihen sich noch Cyborgs und hoch technologisch entwickelte Gegner mit mentalen Fähigkeiten.\n\nDen Coop Modus betrachte ich mit einem lächeldem und weinendem Auge. Es macht großen Spaß gut organisiert die einzelnen Welten zu erobern. Doch leider sind gute Spieler nur selten anzutreffen und das ausgeschriebene Level der einzelen Spieler lässt selten darauf schließen hier einen Profi im Team ergattert zu haben. Mit Freunden macht es dafür umso mehr Spaß.\n\nFür die Tötung der Gegner gibt es schlichtweg keine Erfahrung. Die kommt mit abgeschlossenen Aufträgen innerhalb einer Mission. Selbstverständlich gibt es Bonus Erfahrung oben drauf wenn ihr alle Teilabschnitte gemeistert habt, am Leben geblieben seid und Euer Team vollständig den Planeten wieder verlassen hat. Random player neigen dazu mit einem schweren Waffenarsenal alle Gegner zu vernichten. Im Schnitt dauert eine Mission mit der höchsten Schwierigkeitsstufe schon mal gern bis zu 30 Minuten. Erfahrene Spieler schaffen das Solo in der Hälfte der Zeit.\n\nDie DLC´s sind nicht für das Vorankommen notwendig. Das frei zur Verfügung stehende Arsenal ist völlig ausreichend und lässt kaum etwas zu Wünschen übrig. Den größten Anteil der Ausrüstung könnt ihr innerhalb von Missionen frei schalten. Wer HELLDIVERS aber finanziell unterstützen möchte wird es nicht bereuen. Das zusätzliche Arsenal bringt noch mehr Spaß auf das Schlachtfeld.\n\nSelbst nach vielen Stunden macht das Spiel immer noch große Freude. Der Zeitfaktor ist genial. Helldivers ist mit seinen Missionen auch ein Spiel für zwischendruch da es nicht viel Zeit fordert. Eine Mission ist schnell erledigt. Und wer gern mehr will - der Kampf tobt überall.\n\nHELLDIVERS ist sein Geld wert. Ich kann es Euch nur empfehlen und wünsche Euch viel Spaß damit! Ihr werdet ihn haben!\n________________________________________________________________","December 26, 2015","true","112.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially Magicka.\n\nIn Helldivers, there are a lot of ways you can get yourself and your teammates killed.\n\nBe warned, death is inevitable. You are basically diving into hell.\n\nAll I can say about Helldivers is that it is a game where you can have a lot of laughs with your friends... For example\n3 friends and I just dropped into a mission, one of us purposefully deploys 2 sets of Anti-Tank Mines in the area as we were calling in our Equipment...\nRealising that there's mines in the immediate vicinity, we have to navigate around the Mines to retrieve our equipment.\nThat friend started running around triggering the mines and it blew all of us up... except him.\nAt the end of the mission, there are stats that the group can review.\nHe had 5 accidentals...\n\nMy verdict for Helldivers is a solid 7/10\nA very well made above average game that I would recommend to my friends. It has a lot of replayability, but the game gets repetitive quickly.\nAll I'm saying is that you can take this game seriously, but half the fun is fooling around with your friends.\n\nAlso, you should pay attention to the tips in the loading screens, they help.","January 4","true","249.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M3rcer/recommended/394510/","M3rcer","M3rcer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M3rcer/","251 products in account","DLC controversy\nYes the game has "Day One" dlc. The game also came out earlier this year on the PS4. Every dlc was sold first on the PS4 then ported to PC. There is a digital deluxe edition you can buy which contains all the dlc. Make of it what you will.\n\nTL:DR\nDecent game with friends. Pub can be nightmare sometimes with inexperienced players. Single player is boring most of the time except for farming samples. Buy it if you want fast paced shooter where you can "accidentally" teamkill another player.\n\nStory\nNot much to say. Earth is united into Super Earth. The government is done through Managed Democracy where you answer some questions and the computer votes for you as to not make uncertain and "wrong" votes. You take to the galaxy "spread" managed democracy and "secure" needed resources. You will meet interesting people including cyborgs, bugs, and the illuminati. If you think this is spoilers well tough ♥♥♥♥. Seriously the lore is there, story not so much.\n\nAlso the "lore progression" is done by having the entire community helping each gain influence and launching an assault on a homeworld. And so you conquer the race and win/lose wars. It is possible to lose a war. At current rate I would say that time is not really near, for winning or losing.\n\nGameplay\nI started playing this with a controller. Had trouble consistently aiming with weapons that require precision, such as the "Justice" assault rifle. I switched to mouse and keyboard and never had trouble aiming ever again.\n\nFriendly fire is on; always. See the trailer how you nuke your own team? Or when the shuttle that was supposed to evac you out crushed everyone? Yeah that can happen. You can teamkill; or what they call accidentals, very easily. Casually spamming your laser "Sickle" or that shotgun and suddenly your teammate runs in front and gets gibbed.\n\nYour loadouts consist of Perk, Primary Weapon, and 4 strategems.\n\nHp is a bit different than most other games. For the Helldivers (you/players) if your hp goes below half you will be incapacitated. You can still move slowly. You can shoot with your pistol and reload it if need be. You can get yourself up by holding the interact button. Note that the enemies can still hit you while your incapped. Also some attacks will outright kill you.\n\nVehicles generally have a lot of hp. However, if it goes down below a certain threshold it will become unusable and slowly take damage until it explodes. There is a repair strategem you can use to heal it back up.\n\nStrategems are like items you take with you into a game. But they have to be activated after you're in the game. For example. There is a resupply strategem which contains ammo, grenades, and special ammo for certain weapons. You call it down to the map by holding the strategem button and pressing the up,down,left,right combinations. You will then hold a beacon which you can aim and throw it a certain distance. Now depending on the strategem. You will either drop in a hellpod; which can kill your teammates/self, or some kind of damage.\n\nYou unlock Perks and Primary Weapons through leveling up. You unlock Strategems by completing planets. To complete a planet you need to finish the missions. You start with 2 missions per planet and increase to 3 at higher difficulties. Each mission has 3 objectives and increase to 6 at higher difficulties.\n\nYou can not upgrade Perks, but you can upgrade weapons and Strategems using research points. Research points are earned every 10 samples. Samples are collected during missions. For this reason I highly suggest buying at least the Range dlc. The sniper "Camper" that comes with it is so-so. But the UAV drone strategem that comes with it is essential for farming samples to upgrade your gear. Fully upgraded it can detect the samples. To fully upgrade it costs 4 research points or 40 samples. Relatively that is a small investment compared to the time it would take finding samples without it.\n\nSingleplayer\nBoring as hell sometimes. You would do it to farm samples or get certain achievements. But it gets real old real quick.\n\nCoop/Multiplayer\nThis is where the game is meant to be played. With people. Sometimes you join a random game and everyone knows what they're doing. Everyone clicks. Other times you join inexperienced people and get slightly frustrated or laugh as hellpods land on everyone.\n\nVerdict\nBuy it for the fast paced shooter with coop.","December 24, 2015","true","110.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The control methods may seem different for some things at first, but then make so much sense and work well to the atmosphere and design. A bit of dark humor liters the scene with a parody of social commentary that can be appreciated our dismissed at will paints the atmosphere well.\n\nMore importantly it's even more fun than you think it is from the videos.\n\nThose harping on the amount of DLC, it's because this game has been out for a long while on Sony systems and makes for an easy pick and choose purchase design and you can still be plenty effective without them as you unlock the plethora of gear by simply playing through your adventures with friends and new friends.\n\nThe game's truly, and literally, drop in and out gameplay means you'll rarely ever lose progress. People who lost connection usually won't stop the rest from rolling. Lost connection but made it to near the end before your rewards could be listed? relax, the game let's you know you didn't lose your hard earned rewards.\n\nDied from a friend doing something daft? All part of some of the most funny moments you'll witness and the reinforcements calls often come flying to bring you back in.\n\nDon't let the starting Controls and deaths scare you, this one makes a lot of sense, really fast, and thigh Magicka 2 didn't quite deliver, this one has for some time and does so greatly with STEAM's help of feely connecting people so well.\n\nRejoice for everyone from mech pilots, tank crusaders, combat medics, weapons specialists, and those who like to help heavy weapons speed lad from behind will find smart ways to play and enjoy some hilarious moments when done of it goes wrong and in ways you can understand why.\n\nIn short, it's like a Warhammer 40K Imperial Guard Specialists simulator and some how the Captain of your ship is a certain luck riddled Commissar who decided to drive you where the fleet things you won't mess up to bad and the administratum are happy to throw you access to new gear for throwing yourselves into the teeth of xenos and tech heresy.\n\nNot a short enough version? This game gives you more in game play than you expect too, and entertainment is inevitable.","December 7, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It can be challenging, and fun to play. Although it may NOT be suitable for anyone."\n\nHere is my full thought:\n\nGraphic and FXNothing extraordinary to see here, though, they have done a good job making it fits nicely with the gameplay. There are some improvements over its console part, and clearly, it runs with decent performance on my medium-tier rig.\n\nAudioSurprisingly, there are more to the in-game audio than it seems (for this kind of game anyway). There is a little difference when shooting in different locations / areas, which give the sound a little more dynamic touch than hearing the same sound fx over and over again.\n\nThe Helldivers' responses are plenty, can be funny, can be annoying, and at times, it suits very well in the heat of the fight for survival. You can actually play the game without having to talk on the mic, as most of the time your avatar will says what you are doing out loud.\n\nThe basic command radio is there (Yes, No, Stop, Move) to help coordinating with your team too, which is more than welcomed for this kind of game, and it is quick and simple, no going through clumsy UI during gameplay.\n\nGameplayI won't be going into detailed gameplay since you can find them easily already, though, I will be mentioned on certain aspects.\n\nThe tethered-screen gameplay, shared screen, locked screen, or whatever you may call it. It is NOT a bug (there are people asking the dev to fix this), but a design choice to encourage teamplay. It fits the gameplay nicely, though it can be VERY annoying when you have those deaf, blind, and selfish trigger-happy player(s) on the team. (not that many since those kind will get frustrated, and stopped playing, then start complaining)\n\nThe game is OBJECTIVE-BASED, not KILL-EVERY-ENEMIES, kind of game, so most of the time, your goals are to complete them (or fail them on purpose) and extract. You won't get anything out from keep on shooting enemies, unless the objective says so. (apart from steam archievement)\n\nHere is the interesting part, the game feels a little bit likes sandbox-type game, where you are given things to play with, how you play is yours to be decided. Your loadouts play a huge part in how you play.\n\nYou can make it simple, or challenging at your own pace. The base game offers a number of equipments, support items, and etc., which offer different playstyles without having to rely on DLCs.\n\nThe DLCs are more of what they already offered in the base game, thus, they give you more of the flexibility than owning only the base game. however, most of them can be used by others, who do not own the dlc, which is a nice touch. At first sight, they may seems to be OP, but really, no, it is not. Just because you unlocked it right from the start that it feels OP when you start playing, not that it over-shadowed loadouts from base game.\n\nThe control needs a little practices to get used to, but overall the game do a good job for KB+M, while giving the game a unique control.\n\nYou can actually kb-input chat on PC for this game, that's a positive for me (and in my local language too, though it is not perfect but more than enough)\n\nOverallIt is a nice game for coop play, it can be soloed too. Recommended getting the deluxe version for more gameplay flexibilities.","December 7, 2015","true","48.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I bought it as I was bored, stumbled across it on the steam store and thought yeah that looks fun. Half way though the download I realised how much I definately didnt want this game as it seemed like a basic game someone had thrown together for abit of money. I played it abit thinking we'll see how it goes. Normally Im a £1 per hour gamer with unknown or some games. However 8 hours in I can see Im going to get my £25 worth of enjoyment from this game in all its Digital Deluxe glory.\n\nThe almost constant threat of death or failure or letting your team down or KILLING your team makes almost every second a insanely fun dash to survive/win/excel. With all the weapon or stratagem/air drop upgrades and combo you need to learn your playstyle and the enemies. As well as your teammates.\n\nMy only real issue (its a personal one) is that the DLC is just there. You just get it I wish it was level unlocked so I would work for it but to be fair they are average weapons no better or worse then the core game ones and you have to unlock research points to upgrade so really you still have to work for it.\n\n\nGreat Game look forward to playing the hell out of it.","December 8, 2015","true","21.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M3rcer/recommended/394510/","M3rcer","M3rcer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M3rcer/","251 products in account","DLC controversy\nYes the game has "Day One" dlc. The game also came out earlier this year on the PS4. Every dlc was sold first on the PS4 then ported to PC. There is a digital deluxe edition you can buy which contains all the dlc. Make of it what you will.\n\nTL:DR\nDecent game with friends. Pub can be nightmare sometimes with inexperienced players. Single player is boring most of the time except for farming samples. Buy it if you want fast paced shooter where you can "accidentally" teamkill another player.\n\nStory\nNot much to say. Earth is united into Super Earth. The government is done through Managed Democracy where you answer some questions and the computer votes for you as to not make uncertain and "wrong" votes. You take to the galaxy "spread" managed democracy and "secure" needed resources. You will meet interesting people including cyborgs, bugs, and the illuminati. If you think this is spoilers well tough ♥♥♥♥. Seriously the lore is there, story not so much.\n\nAlso the "lore progression" is done by having the entire community helping each gain influence and launching an assault on a homeworld. And so you conquer the race and win/lose wars. It is possible to lose a war. At current rate I would say that time is not really near, for winning or losing.\n\nGameplay\nI started playing this with a controller. Had trouble consistently aiming with weapons that require precision, such as the "Justice" assault rifle. I switched to mouse and keyboard and never had trouble aiming ever again.\n\nFriendly fire is on; always. See the trailer how you nuke your own team? Or when the shuttle that was supposed to evac you out crushed everyone? Yeah that can happen. You can teamkill; or what they call accidentals, very easily. Casually spamming your laser "Sickle" or that shotgun and suddenly your teammate runs in front and gets gibbed.\n\nYour loadouts consist of Perk, Primary Weapon, and 4 strategems.\n\nHp is a bit different than most other games. For the Helldivers (you/players) if your hp goes below half you will be incapacitated. You can still move slowly. You can shoot with your pistol and reload it if need be. You can get yourself up by holding the interact button. Note that the enemies can still hit you while your incapped. Also some attacks will outright kill you.\n\nVehicles generally have a lot of hp. However, if it goes down below a certain threshold it will become unusable and slowly take damage until it explodes. There is a repair strategem you can use to heal it back up.\n\nStrategems are like items you take with you into a game. But they have to be activated after you're in the game. For example. There is a resupply strategem which contains ammo, grenades, and special ammo for certain weapons. You call it down to the map by holding the strategem button and pressing the up,down,left,right combinations. You will then hold a beacon which you can aim and throw it a certain distance. Now depending on the strategem. You will either drop in a hellpod; which can kill your teammates/self, or some kind of damage.\n\nYou unlock Perks and Primary Weapons through leveling up. You unlock Strategems by completing planets. To complete a planet you need to finish the missions. You start with 2 missions per planet and increase to 3 at higher difficulties. Each mission has 3 objectives and increase to 6 at higher difficulties.\n\nYou can not upgrade Perks, but you can upgrade weapons and Strategems using research points. Research points are earned every 10 samples. Samples are collected during missions. For this reason I highly suggest buying at least the Range dlc. The sniper "Camper" that comes with it is so-so. But the UAV drone strategem that comes with it is essential for farming samples to upgrade your gear. Fully upgraded it can detect the samples. To fully upgrade it costs 4 research points or 40 samples. Relatively that is a small investment compared to the time it would take finding samples without it.\n\nSingleplayer\nBoring as hell sometimes. You would do it to farm samples or get certain achievements. But it gets real old real quick.\n\nCoop/Multiplayer\nThis is where the game is meant to be played. With people. Sometimes you join a random game and everyone knows what they're doing. Everyone clicks. Other times you join inexperienced people and get slightly frustrated or laugh as hellpods land on everyone.\n\nVerdict\nBuy it for the fast paced shooter with coop.","December 24, 2015","true","110.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Especially Magicka.\n\nIn Helldivers, there are a lot of ways you can get yourself and your teammates killed.\n\nBe warned, death is inevitable. You are basically diving into hell.\n\nAll I can say about Helldivers is that it is a game where you can have a lot of laughs with your friends... For example\n3 friends and I just dropped into a mission, one of us purposefully deploys 2 sets of Anti-Tank Mines in the area as we were calling in our Equipment...\nRealising that there's mines in the immediate vicinity, we have to navigate around the Mines to retrieve our equipment.\nThat friend started running around triggering the mines and it blew all of us up... except him.\nAt the end of the mission, there are stats that the group can review.\nHe had 5 accidentals...\n\nMy verdict for Helldivers is a solid 7/10\nA very well made above average game that I would recommend to my friends. It has a lot of replayability, but the game gets repetitive quickly.\nAll I'm saying is that you can take this game seriously, but half the fun is fooling around with your friends.\n\nAlso, you should pay attention to the tips in the loading screens, they help.","January 4","true","249.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

A lot of potential was wasted here.\n\nTHERE ARE SOME ISSUES:\n\n1 - LOCKED CAMERA: Quite ironic in a game that has your characters screeming "FREEDOM!" all the time. Everyone shares one single screen. If you wanna go your own way, you can't. If you want to shoot something off the edges, good luck. If you are trapped between a monster and the end of the screen, forget it, you are dead. And at least one of these situations happens 100% of the time. Dumbest camera ever.\n\n2 - MAPS: The "random generated maps" turn out to be, basically, 1 same map-- "limited open space with rocks and stuff scattered over it". There's none actually designed with a specific purpose in mind, no really interesting place to go through, nor any real difference between them other than the texture packs and snow/water, on some, that slows you down.\n\n3 - DLCs: Read the negative reviews. Right on release date, 14 DLCs up, together amounting to twice the base game's price. And they only add a few weapons/stratagems each, nothing that actually makes the game better. Ridiculously greedy move.\n\n4 - DIFFICULTY: Your main obstacle will be your team mates. They'll either kill each other accidentally too often, bring the wrong gear to the mission, or be too slow in the head. If you get a decent team, the game is really not that hard-- kill the scouts before they sound the alarm, success, game over. The game's point ends up being not to fight your way through, but to avoid doing so. There are some arena and boss missions, though, which present a better challenge.\n\n5 - WEAPONS/STRATAGEMS/CLOTHES: Most weapons are similar-- machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, lasers (maybe there's something different on the DLCs, I don't know). Stratagems are stuff you call from space during missions to aid you, like extra ammo, Exo Suits, artillery strikes. Most of the artillery strikes (and all mines) are useless, they serve only to kill you or your team mates. Now, the clothes, they are just there to... be. No matter what anyone dresses like, they all look the same in game. You can only tell one person from the other by the names under the charaters.\n\n6 - MULTIPLAYER: You can check your filters to "Show games from other regions". I've played with french guys, asians, south americans. But, other than during rush-hours, only 0-4 games usually show up on the "servers list", even with thousands of people playing it at the time. I don't know what's up with that, but it sucks.\n\nSumming up, it feels like it took them 2 months to develop this game-- it doesn't have a whole lot of content, nor anything really new. And the devs' DLC policy is a joke.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n1 - Graphics are very nice.\n\n2 - The game's mechanics/controls work fine.\n\n3 - Three different enemy races, with some interesting units in them (although the Illuminate are a total copy of Starcraft's Protoss)\n\n4 - Bosses. Three of them.\n\n5 - No bugs, at least I got none after 40hrs+.\n\n6 - Altough some of the previously mentioned stuff pisses you off and you feel like you are playing the same mission all the time, the game is still pretty fun for a decent amount of time.\n\nYou'll most likely enjoy it, but it's not THE game you may have been hoping for, nor the awesome game it COULD have been. That's the sad part, the wasted potential. Alien Swarm has a much better level-design and is way more intense than Helldivers, with more inventive stuff of its own. More thought went into it-- and it's old, and free.","December 9, 2015","true","53.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdinc/recommended/394510/","sdinc","SD-[Inc]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdinc/","70 products in account","This game keeps getting better and better.  Been playing for months and I can't put it down.  There are plenty of great touches that make the game a classic.  I love the overall campy/Starship Troopers feel to the game.  But, instead of just bugs you also have to fight the technology of the Illuminate and the gun-toting armor of the Cyborgs.  It is a war against 3 races in a number of interesting environments (forest, snow, desert, and volcanic).  You play the game as a team of up to 4 players.  Your mission is to complete several multi-objective missions in order to secure a planet and help all Helldivers gain a foothold against each of the enemy races in an overall war.   If the community neglects any one race, it could quickly overcome Super Earth and the war is lost.  But drive forward through multiple systems and the Helldivers can conquer the home planet of any of the races and knock them out of the war.  Knock all 3 races out and the war is won.  Along the way, your player gains experience and unlock stratagems and weapons.   Stratagems can be called down throughout the battle.  They can provide support or devastating attacks.  But calling down a stratagem is no simple tasks as you need to complete a series of up-down-left-right key combinations to call it.  This means taking your eye off the battle with possible fatal results.  Losing focus isn’t the only way to die.  Your teammates can accidently shoot you, a drop pod can land on your head, a volcano can dump its lava all over you, or you could fall off the edge into many of the bottomless pits on many maps.  At times there seems like a 100 different ways to die.  This can be tough on players new to the game.  But, this is indeed where the real challenge lies.  There is nothing more satisfying than a perfect Hell Dive accomplished with an experienced team.  The community has been great.  A game like this lives or dies based on the number of in-game idiots.  But, my experience has been very positive.  I’ve added more Steam friends playing this game than any other in the last 5 years.  Finally, the graphics themselves are plenty adequate for this type of game.  But the sound quality is EXCELLENT.  Environmental sounds and weapons fire are extremely well done.  The cinematic score does an excellent job of building up the excitement when the action is hot.  I don’t ever remember a game where the musical score did such a seamless job of building suspense and excitement.  This game tastes better than a “cup of LiberTea!!”.

It's basically Starship Troopers, complete with fascist/militaristic overtones of human exceptionalism, power armour, orbital drops, enemies that die in droves, triumphant music that plays during the last, frantic battle to secure the landing zone for your dropship and hopefully eventual escape. Tons of upgradable weapons and abilities to choose from, as you battle from planet to planet, trying to eventually push each of the respective enemy factions back to their homeworld for a final battle to eliminate them from the current war.

The guns and strategems all feel fun and different, and it's great trying out different builds and working well within a team or just being a jack of all trades. The feeling of anxiety and dread you get playing a tough level is something that's hard to produce in most games, and when the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan it gets even better. The dangerous nature of the team, between friendly-fire and constant drop pods is definitely a great aspect, as well as often being hilarious. Plus nothing makes you feel cooler than holding out for the drop ship, back to back surviving waves, or dropping right into the thick of the enemy crushing three of them with your drop pod and gunning down the rest, turning the tide of the fight for your squad.\n\nLiterally my only complaint is that they didn't sell a 4-pack for $60, so that I could give copies to my friends.","December 8, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's probably the best co-op game I've ever seen/played because you really need to watch out for your team mates and you stay together at all times (the game basicly forces you to.) Friendly fire is 100% so you really need to watch where you're deploying and shooting. Theres a "war" system in this game where when you complete all missions on a planet the system gains influence, and when it has enough influence (which takes hundreds or thousands of players to complete planets) you take the system, eventually leading up to the capitalof the system that you need to do a final assault on, which if you succeed in you have completely defeated the enemy until the war is over.

You like Magicka? You like Alien Swarm? You like democracy?\n\nThis is a game for you then.\n\nPros:\n- Everything, minus those cons below.\n- You don't wait to find team members, high paced game, awesome feedbacks regarding the weapon (now THIS is how sound a minigun), many weapon style (close combat, mid/high range, artillery, mechs & vehicule you name it), scary and swarming enemies, interesting maps, great progression with lot to unlock (and lot of different builds for your characters)\n- Cooperative gameplay: a squad member can reload your rpg to shoot faster, vehicules with different spot, support dedicated skills & objects\n- Also you don't need to be 4 to enjoy the game. Being alone works great, and you'll always find team mates with the multiplayer system.\n\nCons:\n- Character might feel slow to react (move, aim, stand up, etc). However it's part of the gameplay and it did not bother me that much. I think it adds immersion and create those fun moments: diving at the last second to avoid an alien charging you, etc\n- Everyone share the same screen. Imagine a huge invisible cube that limit what everyone can see. No lone wolf in this game, as soon as you have team mates.\n- A bit repetitive for the moment, since after around 10 hours you are always doing the same objectives. But the game has just been released, and new content will come.\n\nIf you like anything that is close to top down shooters, and sci-fi, then don't think.

Something you are glad you found. It will soon become clear to you that what you actually have bought is a diamond... Covered in ♥♥♥♥. The matchmaking servers seem to be have perpetual issues. Games are rarely available to join and you can be assured that no one will ever join anything you host. The server browser is just barren. No games to join. Those issues alone kill the point of the game. The mechanics are brutal (which is good) but nothing scales with the amount of players. Couple that with the never ending server crapout and you get a glimpse of a fun game.... I only recommend this game if you can have friends playing locally in couch coop.\n\n\nThe war is designed so poorly that  global progress is purely a hindrance. Whats the reward for succes? A reduction in choice of missions. How stupid is that??\n\n\nMost of the weapons are locked behind a pay wall. Granted they are sidegrades and this is NOT a pay2win game.

HELLDIVERS is not a bad game. In fact, it has a lot of good ideas. The writing is surprisingly fun and charming for a game that didn't need any jokes. The shooting feels fun, the different guns are interesting, The graphics are good, and the controls work. The Strategems are exciting.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game? It's simple: Even though the game claims that Strategems, (airstrikes, summonable specialty weapons, etc.) are essential, they're not. The best strategy for every level is to just shoot things as soon as they appear on the screen. If you get good, you can shoot all the scouting units before they summon the more interesting enemies at all. Thus, you win, but didn't really have any fun.\n\nSo why don't Strategems work? A few reasons:\n\nEnemies often spawn so close as to touch you. THIS IS NOT FUN. One time, two tanks spawned so close to me that both could run me over simply by rotating. No amount of airstrikes would help for this. In fact, this system of spawning enemies up close means that some Strategems that target enemies will come and kill you for your trouble.\n\nMost enemies don't require Strategems to be defeated. For the Illuminate faction, even the "tank" style enemy can easily be killed with a single clip from most guns. The cyborg tank genuinely requires bigger firepower, but everyone I know just uses the rocket launcher, which you can summon in advance.\n\nAll but one or two enemies in the game can be outrun. Unless your mission is to defend a place, you can survive any situation just by walking away. I say "walking" away because you can get away even when burdened by a encumbring item.\n\nWhat HELLDIVERS needs to do is provide us with enemies with huge health bars that move slowly enough that we can actually hit them with Strategems. Stop spawning enemies on top of us, and give us a chance to actually strategize. If they do these things, they game could be super fun. As it is, it's only vindicated by the fact that co-op games are inherently fun.\n\nAlso, the survival missions where you have to kill X enemies before leaving the map have these problems plus a billion. Here's an idea: Box us in, but allow enemies to spawn outside the arena and approach us from a distance instead of spawning them up our noses.","January 1","false","31.1"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","0"

Great graphics (reminds me of X-Com), great humor (Starship Troopers style !) and the dynamic online "campaign" is a good idea.\n\nThe controls have some inertia to them which can be disorienting at first (especially the aiming), but overall it plays smoothly on kb+mouse which was my major gripe with alot of similar console games.\n\nMy main fear about the game is the progression, without a loot system I fear that you won't have much to do after you unlock all the equipment - granted this may take a long time since the XP isn't exactly super fast.\n\nI feel like it's worth its price, so I recommend it. If you have reservations, wait for a sale and grab it for 10-15€, but we do need YOUR help to take the fight to the aliens' homeworlds now !\n\n<insert Klendathu Drop music there>","December 6, 2015","true","42.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics of the game like shooting, moving, and calling in various types of support is a lot of fun. Even though the mini-game of calling in an airstrike or ammo is stressful, it adds to the frantic nature of the game.\n\nSingle player is almost impossible due to the difficulty of the game. Very frustrating. It doesn't scale based on number of players. In a fair number of cases, you need 3-4. This is a very minor gripe as the game is clearly designed for multiplayer.\n\n\nYou can mix local co-op and online co-op. People can easily and quickly drop in and out of the game. The only drawback to this is people joining locally take a copy of your unlocks/experience. They don't level up and unlock things on their own so they are somewhat limited in their choice of loadout.\n\nAll the DLC is rather crappy though. It's all skill/gun packs and way too expensive. There's no way in hell I would ever consider buying any of it at that price and for what you get. It doesn't feel as though I need any of the DLC to succeed anyways.","January 2","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would highly reccomend the Deluxe edition at this discounted price as most of the DLC is great. The barebones game is good but after putting a lot of time into it you will unlock everything and get bored. The DLC makes the game even better imo. You can get them on hald price atm for 1.49. If you only have enough to get one or two get the support one (its a must) for playing multiplayer. and if ur mor eof a solo player the ranger pack is great for the UAV which scouts of unlock points.

Basically there's the game, and then there's a ton of DLC content, none of it is essential but much of it makes the game a lot easier.\nThe all terrain boots for instance. You can circumvent annoying terrain with other perks and stratagems for sure, but the boots do it way better.\n\nPersonally I will never buy DLC like this, cheap 2 or 3 $ extra bits of content that makes you slightly better than your peers.

On the other hand, I don't recommend this game with its DLCs.\n\nThe game itself is fun. Clean, no bugs, very simple and easy to figure out. Like many have pointed out, its very similiar to Alien Swarm and I honestly think it has two animation rip-offs from there as well.\n\nGrab your controller and holler your friend to dive in to this co-op action game. Alone this game isn't worth that much and won't keep your attention, but with friend or two, it's a fun game. Enough content and different maps to play on couple of nights.\n\n- One mission takes somewhat 5minutes\n- Enough diversity in mission to keep you happy for couple of hours until it feels like grinding\n- Buy if you have a friend to play with\n\nDeveloper's way to use DLCs is something I have to point out. Game this small, core price at 20 $/€ and it already has dozen of DLCs and buying all of them is another 20 $/€. Way too much and NOTE THIS, they had all that content ready before launching to Steam. They made the choice to take these items away from the core game and made us pay more for them.\n\n----- >>> This game was out in March 4th on Sony platforms (Vita, PS3 and PS4).\n\nThat is something we, as customers, should fight against.

The game looks very nice and sounds great. The setting is awesome, especially if you were a teen when Starship Troopers hit the theatres in the mid 90's. The ambience, humor, and crazed politics are very reminiscent of it.\n\nIf you're used to gaming on console, and enjoy twinstick shooters with a gamepad, then this game is for you. It was released on PS4 first, the gameplay was designed for consoles, and that's how it's supposed to be played. But then, you should have been playing it for the past 9 months.\n\nAs far as a PC port, Arrowhead made some exceptionally poor design decisions when catering to the PC crowd- The developers - though publicly stating otherwise - seemingly neglected the fact that some PC gamers enjoy their games with the Keyboard and Mouse combo, and do not feel comfortable with a gamepad. A real shocker there.\n\nThe KBaM controls are stupendously counter intuitive. The crosshair only appears when you aim. When the crosshair disappears, it is automatically reset on the center. The only way of know where you'll be aiming is to look at where your character is facing. In sticky situations, things quickly turn sour. You cannot react quickly, and though you may get used to it, things never get comfortable. This also severely hampers the ability to dodge, jetpack, and melee.\n\nThere currently is a thread on the steam forums for this game, asking for the KBaM to be modified. It has 520+ posts in it as of yet. Though the developers replied, in the first couple of days that they were monitoring the thread, they have long since gone silent. Patches have been released, improving the controls...for the gamepad.\n\nIf you are a KBaM player, buy at your own risk. Many of us are extremely dissatisfied with the controls, something even more shocking given this is the studio that gave us Gauntlet. It seems dev teams do not communicate much at Arrowhead.\n\nEdit: Arrowhead developer ForeverAPeon seems to have posted another answer on the rather lengthy thread discussing the matter. Though not particularly informative, as he only stated they were still "monitoring the situation", it does show that the devs seem to be paying some attention to the situation.","December 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

And when you do, the crosshair appears in front of the character, in whichever direction you last travelled using the keyboard controls after which you can then move it around freely (As a cursor) to aim. When you let go of Mouse 2, which you need to do to move and turn at a normal pace, the crosshair disappears.\n\nThis is nothing but awkward and unintuitive, especially compared to a contoller where you just tilt the right stick in the direction you want to aim.\n\nIf you play with a controller, the game is great.

STRATGEMS (Equipment drops) are fun to use.\n\nBut the controls are so terrible that they took the fun out of this game.\n\nDuring multiplayer, half of the time you don't know where you are aiming because the aiming cursor resets to the direction your character is walking towars everytime you release the aim button. But in order to avoid enemy and ultilize equipments at the same time, you have to zigzaging in the field in all directions and there's no way you can keep aiming the same direction for the duration of the firefight.\n\nThere's a half second delay to your character's response. Which means your aiming cursor might be on spot at a target already, but your character will shoot way off mark, sometime hitting other players behind you, because your character has to "turn around" for the attack.\n\nWalking and running are confusing as f**k, the game force all the players to stay in the same screen, but the problem is, they all look alike. Sometimes you might be looking at a somebody which you thought was your character, and your character might be walking off into a pool of lava.\n\nSpeaking of lava, have you ever seen a map covered with active volcanos and will spill lava on your character as soon as they drop in? And when they get burnt to death they will respawn and die again because the area of damage for the volcano covers a great proportion of your screen?\n\nAnd weapons....

Even a fully upgraded laser rifle can't even compare with a  shotgun with only one upgrade.\n\nOverall balance is horrible.\n\nSo please do something about it","December 13, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

Not terrible, but it just doesn't pop out and make you want to play it.\n\nI've had my friends compare this game to another top down old-hand alien shoot-em-up, Alien Swarm, and let me tell you: My friends are full of ♥♥♥♥. Alien Swarm is the superior game, even if it lacks mission variety.\n\nFor one, Alien Swarm lets you move more than two feet from your mate's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The fact that the camera is centered on the rough center between you and your up to three other very similarly sized and colored companions, and zoomed out so you are all somewhat small anyway, means that you will lose track of who you are and, when you try to dive out of the way of an attack that you thought was going to hit you, the actual you dives into an explosion because you were halfway across the screen from where you thought you were. Even if you can overcome that hurdle and actually function like a proper human being (which, let's be fair, I am not because I tend to err on the side of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), everybody else in your squad won't: Unless you have friends who you trust, never, not ever, not once, play online. Always assume that you will get gargleblasted by either the enemy or your teammates because someone couldn't shoot the sniper who was off-screen or someonw thought they were someone else and shot their friend with a rocket.\n\nAdditionally, in Alien Swarm, your character faces your pointer at all bloody times: Helldivers decided it would be a spectacular idea to throw this out a window, and have your character's direction determined by your movement key inputs. What this means is that, if you are running away from an enemy and want to shoot them, you have to turn around, aim (which slows you down) and then start shooting: By this point the enemy will have caught up, with all his mates, and started turning you into a Super Earth Brand Human Shishkebab, every time. It also means that you will miss-throw grenades consistently, since the crosshair only appears while aiming, and that means more dead teammates. Even if you don't use explosives, your teammates will die anyway because your dumb ♥♥♥ thought it would be a good idea to pre-fire while sweeping towards your target with the LMG and someone who wasn't in your line of fire previously wandered into it because they thought they were another guy or because they took one too many confusion bolts to the face. Oh yeah, and that LMG I mentioned? It's a great weapon in my opinion, except for the fact that until you get the last upgrade for it, it immobilizes you while aiming. Yet, you can't upgrade that specific weapon to that specific level until you unlock an arbitrary laser cannon weapon, which I believe is an unlock you get from completing planets: This means you might not see it, or might not be able to get it, for a while if you're unlucky. Unless it's a level up reward, but I haven't gotten enough levels to know, so take this part with a pinch of salt (because I am well salted by now, I can spare you some).\n\nWhile we're on about upgrades, I like the system: Completing missions works towards conquering planets, and conquering planets gives you rewards, generally an unlock. This means that, with a friend or two who knows what they're doing, you can unlock a freaking mech in your first hour of gameplay, and then spend the rest of your time tearing it up inside of said mech right after you drop it in and crush one of your mates with it because he wasn't paying attention. In addition to the planet unlocks there are also level up rewards, cosmetic armor and main guns, and the weapons do offer some variety until you realize that some suck and others are outright better, even when comparing upgrades. Certainly, they all have some level of viability against certain targets, but... Well, we'll get to that problem later. As for how you upgrade your call-downs and shoot sticks, you wander around the map picking up science bits to unlock research points with every ten. With each upgrade generally only costing 1~2 research points, you can upgrade stuff pretty quickly, which is nice. You can upgrade it even more quickly if you purchase the DLC that gives you a UAV drone that shows you where all the science on the map is, of course, because greed is the path to evil and all developers have proven money is more important than integrity by now. This is balanced somewhat by the fact that most of the DLC weapons and goodies BLOW MASSIVE CHUNKS, but still.\n\n\nNow, comes on of the main mechanics of the game: The War. The universe is broken up into a lot of quadrants around Super Earth, your home and native land, and these quandrents branch off into three paths towards enemy homeworlds. Three different alien types means three different enemies to fight and familiarize yourself with, from the heavily shielded and psycho-blasting Illuminant to... Well, actually, I haven't fought any other races, because there's on enormous, glaring, huge-♥♥♥ problem with The War: Once the community has beaten back the enemy to their home-planet and conquered it, they are no longer a threat until the end of the war. That's right: You kill the enemy off and I can only assume The War is reset when all prospective enemies are dead. At the time of playing the community had whipped the ♥♥♥♥♥ off of every other race except for the Illuminant (and the home-planet of the "cyborgs" was avoided by me and my friends, since I was new to the game), who are hear-tearingly frustrating due to their shields, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one-hit KO snipers (who wouldn't be a problem if you could keep track of who was who in the midst of all the shiny, particle-effect, laser-wall laden chaos) and floating, chair-bound, Halo-Prophet-Rip-Offs with psychic control-reversing powers. Keep in mind that I haven't even FOUGHT on higher difficulty levels because me and my friends wanted to work my level up and get me some experience before I did: The highest mission I did was ten, which was literal hell on earth. You trigger one patrol and start fighting it, and then another three invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s pop up behind you and trigger additional spawns, with seven more invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s showing up to sound more alarms and trigger more spawns until you are awash in a sea of squid aliens and laser walls that block your movement and shots but in no way hamper the enemy. It's "fun" in the same way jamming a hot poker into your eye is "fun": Not at all. There are ways to avoid fighting, which is nice, but they are finnicky at best because the focus of the game isn't on it: Stealth? In my shoot-em-up? You bet your ♥♥♥ it feels tacked on and menial.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, there's a lot to complain about, which outweighs the good by a hefty sum. Certainly, it's fun at times, and I joined at a bad time for variety seeing as I can't fight anything else but the Protoss, but come on. My friends have defended the poor design choices, saying that they are intentional and that this game is supposed to be like Magicka, which these devs also made, where murdering your friends was your top priority and completing the story was a secondary objective.\n\nHorse ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis is not a game where it is fun to die constantly to your enemies and then your friends. It's a more serious feeling game, driven by success and unlocks: Magicka felt like a joke and that made the death less impactful because you hadn't just wasted a half an hour of everybody's time trying to complete the same bloody mission so you could get an unlock. Also, Magicka didn't penalize you for death really badly: You just start over and do it again. In Helldivers, dying too much docks you an experience bonus, which makes it even more rage inducing when you maybe could have gotten it but a teammate railgunned you in the back at the last moment because they wanted to "save" you from an enemy two feet in front of you while you had a shotgun.\n\ntl;dr buy at your own risk","December 28, 2015","false","5.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In Magcika you input an array of arrow keys, combining the different elements to annihilate your enemies or to ♥♥♥♥ off your friends. In Helldivers it is more restrictive, only allowing for specific arrays of inputs for a stratagem (the equivalent of a spell). This felt very unique at first, but I found myself missing the experimentation Magicka provided.\n\nUnfortunately, the supposed intense Galactic Campaign missions that require the community to reach a goal of community influence seems very unlikely to occur simply because the playerbase is too small.\n\nThe game was great in the beginning, but with only 3 worlds and very repetitive missions, the game lacks a long-lasting appeal. If this game interested you for the stratagem mechanic I highly recommend Arrowhead's other game Magicka (or Magicka 2).","December 24, 2015","false","33.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It has incredible potential but it's waiting on a larger player base to realize it.\n\nHere's the first con: it's either boring or impossible to play the game by yourself.\n\nYou can go after easier planets, and the challenge never really rises above annoyance. Enemies will perma-spawn, and you can never kill them all. At the same time, they're easy to take down. Save for being trapped into the sniper beam move one of the Illuminates has, it's very tough to be killed in action. But you also don't get any benefit from killing more enemies during a mission, so it some ways it feels like a crutch to make you think the game is difficult and hectic, rather than actually being difficult and hectic.\n\nOR you could go after harder planets, which require other players. Since most of your friends don't have Helldivers, that will mean that you're getting paired with randoms, though mercifully the game has built-in voice chat. Still, your good time relies on randoms having generally the same playstyle as you: if you're the kind of person that wants to go objective to objective and then extract or if you're the kind of person that wants to explore every inch of the map and collect every sample, you have to hope that you're paired with other players that feel the same.\n\nThe second con: the controls are frustrating.\n\nThere's an Illuminate that sounds an alarm if they're allowed to exist within sight of the player for more than 3 seconds. Which is fine, except that turning and manuevering is slow enough that, even if you see and intend to kill the enemy ahead of those three seconds, you may not be able to point your gun and start firing in time. I suspect it's that way because, if you were able to manuever more easily, the difficulty level would sink like a rock.\n\nIt's another aspect of the game that's being used as a crutch. Instead of coming up with clever enemies that challenge the tactics of the player, we'll just make it hard for them to turn and kill them!\n\nThe third con: it's repetitive.\n\n"But you've only played 4 hours! How could you judge?" Missions take about 5-8 minutes per, highly dependent on how much exploring you do. If you sit down for a long session with the game, as I have, you'll play 20-25 missions over that four hour period.\n\nActivate SAM site.\n\nDiffuse unexploded ordinance.\n\nCollect object X, move it to location Y.\n\nDoing that over and over again doesn't exactly make it feel like you're one of the most elite warriors taking on the scourge of the universe. Couldn't a lower-ranking battalion take on these responsibilities? I'm sure that the mission objectives get more diverse at higher levels, but you have to design a game that makes me want to get there. Right now I don't have much desire to get there.\n\n--\n\nTL;dr: Helldivers requires you to play with other people (which are most likely randoms because the game hasn't caught on yet) so that you can complete repetitive objectives and fight repetitive enemies with sometimes-frustrating controls. The idea is so good that it almost makes up for all of that. Hopefully they'll make some structural changes to the game, in the way that Blizzard did when they realized Diablo III was a bunch of good ideas that didn't work together, and more people will flock to it. I can't recommend it until then, even at $20.\n\nLast comment: can we remove the obviously fake "enemies killed" and "Helldivers killed" counters from the mission select menu? Don't try to sell me on the idea that thousands of Helldivers are sacrificing themselves every 10 seconds for managed democracy when less than 1,500 people overall are playing the game. It's laughably false.","December 31, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not terrible, but it just doesn't pop out and make you want to play it.\n\nI've had my friends compare this game to another top down old-hand alien shoot-em-up, Alien Swarm, and let me tell you: My friends are full of ♥♥♥♥. Alien Swarm is the superior game, even if it lacks mission variety.\n\nFor one, Alien Swarm lets you move more than two feet from your mate's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The fact that the camera is centered on the rough center between you and your up to three other very similarly sized and colored companions, and zoomed out so you are all somewhat small anyway, means that you will lose track of who you are and, when you try to dive out of the way of an attack that you thought was going to hit you, the actual you dives into an explosion because you were halfway across the screen from where you thought you were. Even if you can overcome that hurdle and actually function like a proper human being (which, let's be fair, I am not because I tend to err on the side of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), everybody else in your squad won't: Unless you have friends who you trust, never, not ever, not once, play online. Always assume that you will get gargleblasted by either the enemy or your teammates because someone couldn't shoot the sniper who was off-screen or someonw thought they were someone else and shot their friend with a rocket.\n\nAdditionally, in Alien Swarm, your character faces your pointer at all bloody times: Helldivers decided it would be a spectacular idea to throw this out a window, and have your character's direction determined by your movement key inputs. What this means is that, if you are running away from an enemy and want to shoot them, you have to turn around, aim (which slows you down) and then start shooting: By this point the enemy will have caught up, with all his mates, and started turning you into a Super Earth Brand Human Shishkebab, every time. It also means that you will miss-throw grenades consistently, since the crosshair only appears while aiming, and that means more dead teammates. Even if you don't use explosives, your teammates will die anyway because your dumb ♥♥♥ thought it would be a good idea to pre-fire while sweeping towards your target with the LMG and someone who wasn't in your line of fire previously wandered into it because they thought they were another guy or because they took one too many confusion bolts to the face. Oh yeah, and that LMG I mentioned? It's a great weapon in my opinion, except for the fact that until you get the last upgrade for it, it immobilizes you while aiming. Yet, you can't upgrade that specific weapon to that specific level until you unlock an arbitrary laser cannon weapon, which I believe is an unlock you get from completing planets: This means you might not see it, or might not be able to get it, for a while if you're unlucky.

You and up to three others drop on a planet, complete a couple objectives, then extract, all while fending off waves of enemies. It's great for the first hour or so, but gets incredibly repetitive, as all the objectives blend together (effectively, dash to this location, then do a quicktime event, then dash to the next). As for strategic objectives? There's a galactic map where you choose to fight one of three enemies, eventually pushing back to that enemy's homeworld. The end objective is to win the three separate wars with "Community Event" assaults on their individual homeworlds. Unfortunately, the devs forgot to, y'know, balance that "Community Event." 48 hours to get 7.5 million points, when a group of 4 people can get about 12 points for the toughest mission, which takes ~20 minutes? Do the math; there isn't anywhere near the playerbase to support that. So, the "Community Event" fails, and we're back to an endless slog.\n\nIt's a cute idea, and has potential (especially given the Starship Troopers vibe they're heavily going for), but not worth $20. Maybe $5 on sale. Doesn't help that it seems to be a vehicle for distributing DLC, what with the bunches of special packs that give you overpowered weapons.","December 13, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
