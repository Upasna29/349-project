Who would have ever thought that playing with ones self could be so fun and entertaining! Time Rifters makes it possible. If you like FPS games but want a break from 13 yr olds telling you they slept with your mom. This game is one to definitely check out! It's challenging and the music is amazing. Lots of secrets to find and plenty of replayability with the Leaderboards. I don't know about you guys but when a level has a % to finish, I always go for atleast 100% and this game actually allows you to go beyond that. You can also in-game record and save it, upload to the Steam Workshop and allow others to play along side your replay. I highly recommend picking this game up. Its addictively fun!\n\nNo crashes, No bugs, Art Style and Graphics are beautiful(Especially the Tree)\n10/10 Will continue playing until the whole game is atleast 100% done\n\nGameplay - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAW5UMRUF9U","October 21, 2014","true","10.5"," 50 of 62 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","50","62","8","2"

I got to learn more about how I play from another perspective.\n\nThe point of the game is actually simple. You run around FPS style, shooting cubes and cube monsters that move in a set pattern and you have to destroy them all within a certain time limit before the round ends to achieve the full 100% completion. But this is where you can really enjoy the game because you can create a tactic and then switch it up on the following arena round leaving your ghost to do what you prepared it for like flanking one way while you go the other to shoot down cubes and cube monsters to try to achieve higher completion points. And if one tactic doesn't work then you can think of many different ones to use and have your ghosts perform them while you try different ones.\n\nThere are a lot of Steam achievements to earn and even some achievements that have you find intentional arena escape glitches and some cool features like being able record and upload your replay ghosts for others to download and play with them or you can download theirs as well.\n\nThe controls are very smooth and the game supports Keyboard & Mouse, XBOX 360 controller as well as the Oculus Rift VR headset. This game shouldn't have a problem running on older systems. I even tested it out on a gaming notebook running a GTX260m with a Dual Core 2.93GHz Intel processor and 1920x1200 resolution with all settings maxed except for AA and got a fluid 60 fps throughout the game. And the cool thing about the options in the game is that you can access and configure them right from your point of view in the main area by walking up to them.\n\nThis is an awesome game and once you get your hands on it you will have a lot of fun and try your hardest to get those 100% completion points. :D The only downside I found was reaching the end and wishing there was more. :(","October 23, 2014","true","9.5"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","33","38","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/270010/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","608 products in account","This game is sheer brilliance, and I really mean it. It's not often I say that about any game at all. At the time of writing this review, I realise that I only have a little over an hour in it, but that's all I need to know that this game is amazing, and the hours will for sure be racking up in this game. Don't let the screenshots determine what this game is, this game cannot be described in a single screenshot. This game either requires you to play it for yourself and learn every little minor and major detail to help you win the game. Let's get down to the basics of what this game really is, and how it is absolute brilliance in a single game.\n\nBefore we get into what the game really is and how you play, I think it's important that I bring this up; this is something that I love in games. As you open the game, you aren't greeted by the usual, boring, same-old menus. No, you are greeted by.. Well, the game! That's right, you play straight from there. There is an amazingly simple but somewhat flabberghasting easter egg in this "hub" if you want to call it that. It's not my place to spoil it here, that's something you'll have to find.\n\nTo start playing, all you have to do is hit a big, floating "play" button. That's it. You're then welcomed by 3 seperate menus.\nCampaign; your basic campaign, where you fight the evil cubes and try to emerge victorious.\nDaily Challenge; community designed challenges which you can play every day.\nAnd for those of you who have a more creative side, you can also create a custom arena. You can choose to play others custom levels or you can create your own. That's something you'll have to find out yourself, I haven't even tried to do anything with that yet.\n\nIf you are wondering, "are the enemies.. really just cubes?". Yes, the enemies are basic cubes which follow a simple principal.\n- Red Cubes are the WEAKEST cubes with the lowest HP.\n- White Cubes are the NORMAL cubes with normal HP.\n- Yellow Cubes are the BEEFY cubes with high amounts of HP.\nEach cube will reward you with a yellow or white smaller cube. All you need to know about that is, those are your score.\nA white, small cube is equal to 1 gold, whereas the yellow, smaller cubes are equal to 10 gold.\n\nSo, enough about just the menus, I think it's time we talked about the game. The game has a dubstep soundtrack, and before any of you run away due to the fact that you hate dubstep, you have to understand this games theme. It's fast paced, high-octane action. The dubstep, if doing nothing else, will just hype you up and make you ready for the next spawn of enemies. The dubstep soundtrack, as someone who despises dubstep, actually really fits the games feel. I mean, the only music genre that pops to mind when you think high paced action with badass explosions, it's got to be dubstep, right?\n\nAesthetically, this game is gorgeous. No, I really mean it is GORGEOUS. The thought cubes to some people will probably make you think that this game is some Minecraft clone, and I am included in that general consensus. But when I started to play, I realise that this game is way more than that. It's nothing like Minecraft at all. This game has so much potential to be one of the best games out there, I just hope that the devs can do something about how short this game is. I mean, 3 areas each with 5 levels is only a total of 15 levels. Whilst that isn't that bad, it's not exactly great. And that's actually my biggest flaw with this game. Sure, it has tonnes of replayability, but it will only last for so long. If the devs can add more things to the game to keep people playing and gaining the game more publicity, then it's their choice to realise that that's what they need to do.\n\nSo, the basics of this game then.\n- Fast paced, cube killin' action.\n- Dubstep which fits the games theme.\n- Amazing amounts of replayability.\n- 6 great and very differing weapons to choose from.\n- Tonnes of fun.\n\nAlthough this game would be an instant GOTY for me if it was just slightly longer!! Just even 3 or 4 more chapters added on to increase the level of content and playtime that I can get out of this game. I want to play it for so much longer, but I don't know how long my willpower will stick out with no new Missions in sight. Great game, very short though.\n(Great price, too.)\n\nSo, final conclusion, get this game if you want to have a true gem in your Steam library. One of the best games out there at the minute and I cannot wait to play tonnes more!\nHave a great day/night everyone!","December 11, 2015","true","13.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","28","31","6","2"

You are tasked to enter an arena destroying as many targets as possible in a set amount of time. One attempt is not enough to get the job done. Luckily, through some kind of futuristic science, you are morphed into a new avatar and time is rewound so you can play alongside the first avatar. In the end you will be controlling the final vessel while 3 previous Time Rifters simultaneously play alongside you.\nIt takes strategy and planning to destroy all of the targets. A variety of weapons are available to choose from and collecting gold allows you to upgrade them in between each round. A little planning on what and when a specific firearm is used and how it is upgraded is an important decision that affects the final outcome. The thinking does not stop there as you must also plan on how you will navigate through each arena destroying the square blocks. Shooting random areas commando style will net you a low score with previous avatars attacking the same targets that are no longer there.\n\nGraphics/Sound/Performance\nTime Rifters runs fantastic on the Oculus Rift. No screen tearing, no jitters, and a consistent high FPS count resulting in a wonderful motion sick free experience. The graphics really come alive when looking through the Rift and the art style is well suited for a VR experience. The menus are superb and easy to navigate while giving a fresh style to the game. It also looks and runs great on a standard monitor though I would prefer a wider field of view. The soundtrack is also worth noting as it provides a catchy upbeat tempo that matches the play style.\n\nControls\nControls are a breeze whether using, a controller, mouse and keyboard, or the Oculus Rift. Everything feels just how any quality FPS game should feel. Aiming with the Rift is done by simply looking at where you want the reticule. It works perfectly and I cannot detect any delay in movement. I would like to see more FPS titles using this control method.\n\nMultiplayer\nThis title has been billed as a multiplayer game where you control all the players yourself. This means that a traditional online multiplayer mode is not included. It does offer what is called “replay mode”. This is accomplished with a player playing the first two avatars and uploading to Steam Workshop so a second player can play the second two avatars. In an age where a majority of online multiplayer games are dead before they even get started, I think this is a fantastic idea that works perfectly with the gameplay. It sure beats hanging around in an empty lobby in the hopes that somebody might join.\n\nConclusion:\nMy biggest gripe is that Time Rifters is a bit light on content. The Steam Workshop is a novel idea that hopefully will catch on adding some additional entertainment value. I would have also liked to see a proper scoring system with leader boards and more than one difficulty level as the game seems a bit on the easy side. These two things would have gone a long way.\nStill, the low asking price for the content available is fair. It’s well polished and has fresh ideas. Time Rifters is enjoyable using a standard display but simply a must buy for anyone owning an Oculus Rift. Since the launch of the Oculus Rift most of the available "games" fall into one of three categories. It is either a small snippet of a demo like Dread Halls, a shallow novelty experience like Riftcoaster, or a previously made game with Rift support shoe horned in. I have had tons of fun with all three categories but I have been left wondering when we will start seeing "real" VR games. And now we are.

The lack of a tutorial causes a little confusion at the beginning, but it doesn't take long to figure out what is going on.  You have four runs to complete the level, with all prior past runs combining with the current one (i.e. you are playing with yourself).  Play smart and start with an area effect gun for maximum damage (e.g. missiles), then on the second and third run stick to a section of the screen (left or right half).  Finally on the last run use an accurate weapon (e.g. laser) to cleanup.  With a good selection of weapons and upgrades, this game is definitely worth the asking price.","January 19, 2015","true","2.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

So I rushed home, bought this game and wrote this review. I've already played it for hours.\n\nThis game was in my wishlist in days. I have to say its art style impressed me, but it's not enough for me to gave it a try since it's terrible gameplay trailer: This video only showed some shooting scene, but the game's core mechanics -- you co-op with 3 other yourselves was not shown in the video! I feel lucky not miss this game, and for developers: you really need to learn how to make a trailer to help your game sale better :)\n\nAfter the trailer "disaster", everything went smooth. You have to shoot down every cubics in the level to have a 100% completion, but time is limited, there's no way for you to shoot all of them down in 60 seconds. But you have 3 other "yourselves" to help you! When time's out, you will become the next "yourself", and you will play along with the last "yourselves", they will perform EXACTLY what you have done just like back in time! This makes game pretty interesting: you have to find correct steps, combine suitable weapons, remember your past moves, and decide the best strategy for 100% level completion.\n\nThe game's art style is simple but elegant. GUI system is the most innovative I've ever seen. I don't know how they implemented that in Unity, but it's better than what I've thought. The starting scene is also a "wow" moment, you have to include this in your trailer :)\n\nFor me, I will give this game a 8.5/10. 9.99$ is a fair price, worth buying.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Art style\n+ Innovative gameplay\n+ Weapon Strategy & Combination\n\nCons:\n\n- Bad trailer(alright, it's not the game's fault)\n- Need some weapon balance or level adjustment, too easy to find "best solution"","November 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

I like tower defense games and first person games. Blam.\nIt's indirect co-op. You basically play co-op with your previous selves, four instances in total. This means you have to be cunning to actually clear an arena, plan what to do from your first character to the last, then execute.\nIt has progression, it's isolated to each 5-arena episode, then the upgrades resets. It's quite neat to try out different setups, and the resets adds a lot to the replay value. You get to pick one out of six weapons for each character and then decide which out of 4-5 upgrades you buy for each weapon. You buy upgrades from gold collected from slain enemies in the arena.\nI absolutely love this. You can climb out of every level, or as good as, and there are even achievements for doing it. Yes I have all of them already. I'm not sure why I like this, but I've climbed out of games since... I first could, it's just what I do. I like when developers embrace that instead of putting up invisible barriers instead.\nA nice collection of weapons an upgrades, a good variety that makes for a lot of experimentation and replay value :)\nPerforms really well, I could run this fine even on my old 560ti, now I sport a 970 and yeah, vroom. Out of 15 arenas I only got a very slight slow down in one of them, and that was when spewing acid like crazy. You'll know what that means.\nThose are the main points for me. Then there are additional features like lots of options, controls methods, leader boards, a replay system, etc. Icing on the cake really. Would I recommend this game? Yes, at least for people who like the features I mentioned above. So far I've plowed 12 hours into this, and I still haven't managed 100% on episode 2 or 3, so I have more to do!

Me and some friends managed to form a great team together, and got through most of the arenas okay.\n\nI was Blue. I was the weakest; I admit. Always behind in upgrades. When I entered the arena, I never knew what to do like everyone else. I would shoot at whatever I saw, but the others looked at me like I could never see the bigger picture, and I always felt like my efforts were pointless against the massive cube army we were up against.\n\nThen there was Purple. He had better reflexes, better skills, better gear... he would pick out groups and take them on, trusting his teammates to take on the rest, and keeping a level head. He was a better fighter than I.\n\nAfter him, there was Yellow. He and Purple made a great team, and were closer than any other two team members. He always seemed to know where the enemies would come from, how to take advantage of the arena... like he'd done this before. They would split up and take on different groups, laughing at me for flailing around so helplessly.\n\nThen, Green. He was a bit odd, didn't talk much. He'd watch the rest of us, maybe help us out, but seemed content to let us handle most of the work. And yet, whenever we missed a cube, he was there, destroying it the minute it slipped past us. Without him, who knows how many more cubes would have gotten past our lines.\n\nAll in all, we somehow managed to take out wave after wave. I'll never know where the others got their training, or what secrets they had. Ah well.\n\n\n(But seriously, it's a cool game with a cool concept.

That said, this game pulls the idea beautifully. I'll start with pros, then follow with con's\n\nPro's:\n-A simple and sqift movement system ensures that your copies will move and shoot the -exact- way you did when you recorded it, ensuring that the damage they do is reliable for ever added clone.\n-A varied weapons list gives you plenty of options for unique situations; even with the same weapon, you can upgrade it differently to specialize it. (EX. My first run I take a spread pistol with scatter and acid to melt a large number of soft blocks, and my last run I take a spread pistol with maxed damage and fire rate for single block cleanup.\n-Smooth gameplay and lack of danger let you really focus on efficiency. Memory, attention, and planning are rewarded: you don't need to kill the same block in a second go, the first clone will take care of it.\n-Each run is color coded to let you see where and what you did before, you can even watch where your curser pointed on previous runs!\n-Community built rooms and levels add a dose of the insane (Some crafters are just nuts.)\n\nSimply put, the game is fun. Its easy to learn, fun to play, its bright, and its colorful. It has a unique concept that plays beautifully as you orchaestrate your victory.\n\nCons:\n-The game is short. The standard "Campaign" Can be beaten in an hour. It'll take longer if you want to 100% all the levels (Which is HARD) but it won't take you too long.\n-Community levels, while they add on length, are simplified; they can't have moving blocks, and they lack the elaborate setpieces found in the Campaign.\n-You play the camp in sets of 5 levels, with 4 runs per level. Each run takes a solid 20 minutes, and there is no replay button. You can't replay an individual time loop, you can't even replay an individual level. You want another try, you start from literally square one. This is frustrating, especially when I missed the. Last. Block. of a level. 20 minutes of stress and effort, down the pooper.\n-The upgrade system is neat, and upgrades carry between levels, but that's a mixed blesssing, because it means that once you chose with 4 weapons you want, you're stuck with that combo for the rest of that 5 level set. You can't even change up the order.\n-Your first run of the first 5 level set starts you at 0 gold, and most weapons are useless at level 1. The scatter pistol, rocket launcher, and partical ball are the only ones with enough damage to actually kill blocks at lvl 1, but the rockets are slower than christmas and the partical ball has all the range of a baseball bat. In community levels, you start with enough gold for 4 upgrades, but in the camp you get zip. So, you either start with a scatter pistol or you press the escape button.\n-The balancing for weapons needs work; some weapons just aren't good. The partical ball, while it has the best damage, is crippled by the short range. The rocket launcher, again, has good damage, but the rockets take so long to travel that shooting at moving targets is a waste of time. The rest of the weapons are each good in their own way, but again, only the scatter pistol is useful at level 1.\n-Weapon upgrades scales unrealistically high. You will never fully upgrade a weapon in the campaign, because the costs literally become more gold than is in the entire campaign. It's an indirect cap on how many upgrades you can buy and its annoying that it's there at all, much less how sharp it is.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I very thoroughly enjoyed this game. The upgrade system is frustrating, but the gameplay itself is amazingly fun, and most of the problems become non-issues when you play Community levels. This game needs a serious patch to fix a lot of problems, but its a year old, so such an update is unlikely. Still, there's real potential here, and for a price tag of $10, I absolutely reccomend picking this game up.\n\nIf By some fluke, a developer is reading this, then start making a sequal. Give starting gold for first weapons, allow -at minimum- a restart by stage button rather than a restart campaign button. Balance the weapons a little, maybe add a few more if you can keep them unique, and if possible, take the leash off of community level creation. This is a beautiful concept and the game engine is spotless, it just needs some tweaks and some added content.","August 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Only a few know, that playing with yourself in an fps style TD - like game can be so entertaining and addicting. I would call Time Rifters a fps self-coop TD-like game ;) I really enjoy playing it and can only imagine what a blast people that own OR device are having.\nThe goal of the game is to destroy cubes of different color, bundled in different shapes, as efficient as you can - aiming at that 100% destroy ratio, and you have 4 tries to do it. For each try you play a differently colored character, that can choose a weapon and upgrades, that are character specific, but not exclusive - you can have all your characters run around with the same weapon. The only thing that's common between your characters is your money - you get those by destroying cubes and picking up the coins they leave behind. Upgrades are character specific - so you'll need a lot of coins to upgrade all of your character's weapons, as upgrades get progressively expensive. Once you've completed an episode, the game gives you the ability to choose and replay it again with free upgrades, so you can test and see, which weapon + upgrades is the most efficient way of achieving the goal.\nThe game uses unity engine and gives you a satisfying number of options to play around for your best gaming experience. The graphics are reasonable with some really beautiful backdrops. The "combat" is fluid and increasingly satisfying, once you wield a well upgraded weapon and melt cubes left and right ;)\nThe soundtrack is mostly dub step ( I think), and even though I'm not exactly fan of the genre, I found it fitting with the gameplay.\nJudging by the highscores, there is a way to achieve >100% destroy value by completing levels earlier - so yea, it's nice to have a competitive incentive to keep you optimizing that efficiency.\n\nTL:DR or you want to see the game in action : you can check my first impressions video - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330475600","October 23, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While ham-stringed slightly by a lack of overly challenging levels Time Rifters packs a fun and exciting punch, ramped up but a great soundtrack.  Your mission is simple, shoot every block and let none escape. Each arena you play in will have blocks that either move about the level or remain static, and you have a certain amount of time to destroy as many as possible. You will play a challenge four times, each time adding the previous recordings of yourself to your current play through, giving the game a faux-multiplayer feel by the fourth attempt.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle based shooters, or the types of mechanics popularized by raiding in MMORPGs (or Destiny) you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Each member of your team will need to have a specific role and execute that role flawlessly in order to reach perfection.\n\nThe levels are beautiful, crisp, and accompanied wonderfully by the electronic soundtrack. Diverse weapons, each with a particular use, will force players to make smart decisions about when and how to use them. Upgrades deepen the diversity by introducing enhancements like more damage, more accuracy and acid, which causes damage over time on blocks. These interesting upgrades can change the weapon significantly, but not always for the better depending on how that weapon is used. Players won't be able to afford every upgrade for every weapon, so they must make smart decisions and maximize the potential of each weapon . Acid tends to feel overpowered, it causes damage over time but doesn't appear to wear off, hitting a block with it means you can immediately move on as that block with quickly be destroyed. Once you discover the potential for acid you'll to never be without it.\n\nBlocks spawn in beautifully synchronized patterns that make each level feel like a work of art. Blocks take the shape of butterflies, bats or snakes, and sometimes form geometry and architecture. Each level has a unique feel and requires a tailored approach to succeed in destroying every block. Perfecting a level is satisfying as it requires you to work together with your previous recordings and be smart in what each character is doing on each playthrough. If you overlap shooting the same blocks as a previous version of you that block will be destroyed faster, but while your current character will move on, the previous version will continue shooting at empty space.\n\nThough thoughtful and surreal, Time Rifters could do with more challenging content. It will only take a few hours to perfect all but a few levels. With that said, this is partially a compliment as well as a complaint, Time Rifters is so enjoyable you will likely be left wishing there was more.\n\nThe leader board system feels unnecessary since levels are finite challenges with a cap on how well you can do, so setting a high score isn't really possible. Furthermore, the levels tend to be on the easier side so achieving 100% on most isn't much of a challenge. The Let's Re-play mode is creative and interesting, it allows you to create a recording and upload it to the Steam Workshop for your friends/fans to download and play with, but ultimately relies on people being interested enough to participate with it.\n\nOverall, Time Rifters is great fun and worthy of the price. It's a unique game that you'll go back to just to experience the zen feel of shooting colored blocks and sinking into the vibrant soundtrack.","October 21, 2014","true","2.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

You stack your performances throughout 4 playthroughs to blast all the cubes that are strategically placed throughout the level. You must balance your zone control, weapon upgrades, and skill in order to achieve 100% completion.\n\nThis game rocks my socks... 4 times in a row. The music is rock hard, the level design is both spot on mechanically as well as visually. Seriously, the amount of aesthetic diversity in the levels is immense. For those who have this game already, take a close look at the wall in the tree level. There's a pixel matrix style effect that is so subtle I doubt many will notice it but the fact that it's there speaks leaps and bounds about the love and care poured over this game.\n\nContent wise, there's 3 episodes consisting of 5 levels each which will take you about 30 minutes each. But if you actually want to beat them aka 100% them you'll be going back a few times. And then if you really want to push yourself you'll try to 100% the level before you've used all your guys.\nWhen you've had enough playing with yourself there are online replays that you can either upload yourself or download to play with. A handful of youtubers have already posted their's up so you'll be able to play alongside them right off the bat.\n\nDownsides? Well even after coming back a few times to up your score, the content feels a little on the short side but in my opinion it's still well worth the $10 price tag because of the immense polish around the game and you'd regret not having played it more than you'll ever regret having spent the money on this rather than something else.\n\nLastly, a quick note about the VR. If you're a virtual reality developer this is a mandatory buy for you. Buy it and see how to do VR implementation correctly. You don't have to copy it but atleast take a deep look at it and see why it works wonderfully from the autocorrecting camera depending on where you walk with the joystick to the UI they use to the menu and even the level design itself. Look at it and feel intimidated because they're setting a high bar to measure up to.\n\nFor those of you who aren't VR developers and wonder if this game is as good without an oculus rift, OF COURSE it isn't! EVERYTHING is better in VR but that doesn't make it a bad game outside of it. In the case of Time Rifters it works just as good and still is worth your time and money.\n\n4/4 Time Lords, would rift again.\n\nEdit: They've just released a daily challenge mode/level editor as a way to offer more content. No excuses now, get buying!","October 24, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game Time Rifters needs to have a bit more improvement. The way to create levels, as well as have 4 different teammates that you play as AND attempt to achieve a high score each time is really fun. However, I believe that this game really needs a multiplayer function so that you can attempt to play with your friends online. I may just be blind, but all that I saw was a way to record playthroughs to your friends or play by yourself, no live action feed, which saddened me the most. If that function were to be added, as well as separate gold for each character in the game so that some don't level up faster than others, then this game would be really fun. I still recommend this game to others, just not in the way that would be useful to most.","July 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The blocks come ina  variety of different constructions.\n\nA lot of the other reviews mentions the Occulus Rift or the DK2, I dont have one so my review is based on playing the game on a traditional screen.\n\nPros:\n- High replayability, it is fun to try different weapons in different situations.\n- Runs amazing, 100ish fps while recording with fraps.\n- A variety of unique weapons with unique upgrades.\n- Let's Replay is a really cool workshop feature, you can record yourself playing the episodes controlling two of the characters.

I highly recommend it to anyone who likes FPS's/Wave Defense Games/Puzzle-ish Games/Really Clever Indie Games. Plus it's only $10, that's a steal for the quality this game has.\n\nThe game plays kind of like a cross between Project Temporality and Sanctum. Movement is fairly quick, jumps are floaty, and gunplay is pretty arcade-y. The goal of each level is to destroy all of the blocks before they disappear either through a time limit, or out a specified exit.\n\nThe gimmick is: you play cooperatively with yourself. You get 4 chances to destroy all the blocks, and each chance runs concurrently with the previous ones. So, by the third iteration you're working with two versions of yourself in the past to destroy the blocks. This means you have to remember what your strategy was previous rounds, and also have to adjust your current tactics to make up for prior runs failings, weaknesses, and strengths. The six available guns each have different specialties as well, and sometimes it takes a lot of planning to get the order and upgrades up enough to clear a level at 100%.\n\nTime Rifters takes it a step further, and lets you record your own gameplay to share with other people. This way you can work with your friends to clear puzzles even if they aren't there. This feature is also set up for Youtubers to record themselves with commentary, so you can play along and have them talk to you as you play. It's a really clever feature.\n\nThe game itself is very pretty (kinda like Mirror's Edge), and has pretty great music (EDM/Dubstep- but they're not overwhelming at all.)\n\nIf you wanna see gameplay/my thoughts live, I did an impressions video as well:\nhttp://youtu.be/aZisQjQ7WGY","October 21, 2014","true","2.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

However, I feel that the game would have benefited from a bit more progression, like for example if the weapons were initially locked and you would get them after accomplishing something. It would have increased the replay value. But the price isn't bad for the amount of fun, so it is easy to recommend this.\n\nThe game also supports NVIDIA Surround natively (and Eyefinity, I presume). The FOV is customizable from 60 to 90.\n\nSomething I would like to be see in future versions:\n- Allow FOV to go up to 100, or even 110. It looks better on multi monitor setups.\n- Allow the player body model to be hidden. It makes the platforming needlessly difficult when you can't "see your feet", because the model is blocking your vision.\n\nBut anyways, good game, good job devs!","October 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Im not gona spend too much time trying to explain it... i think there is a lot of info out there already trying to do such. But basicly its you shooting blocks, and then you play with your ghost who is helping you shoot blocks.\n\nI just loaded the game up and didnt stop till i got thru all 3 eps... then i recorded for multiplayer. and played my multiplayer :P Its a lot of fun, easy to understand, diffacult to master. Visualy its clean and polished... and then you get cave stages where its all atmospheric and creepy. So its not the same thing over and over. Controlls make sence once i just start pressing buttons (i played with my controller) altho i immedately forgot that you could double-jump... didnt realize that untill 2 stages at the end of my TESTING my multiplayer. They also have this hidden emphasiss on "escapeing" wich after a bit of playing around is really neet. Like hidden stuff after you play thru the game.\n\nThere is no story here... so dont expect much that will change you inside... but what matters is that its fun. My only gripe is that its too short... im gona be doign a little bit of multiplayer before i aucualy put this down, but i think its really cool that even when i put the game down, i can still play with you... yes YOU the one reading the review.

To sum it up, you'll be playing alongside with either the ghosts of yourself or the ghosts of others from previous play sessions via Steam Workshop.  The menu itself really impressed me in that I could move around and interact with it, something I don't often see in games nowadays.  Some might be put off by the simplistic art style, but I found it to be colorful and eye catching.  I also like the fact that you can use gold to upgrade your weapons in your play sessions, though your gold only lasts for those arena bouts only.  Once you return to the main menu, your earned gold is lost.

After spawning, you can choose one of the 6 weapons in the game and buy some upgrades for them with the game currency (called "Gold").\nAfter buying your weapon you enter an arena and enemies will spawn. """Enemies""" with many quotes, are squares. They don't hurt you, they just follow a path in the arena and your mission is to destroy them, wich will give you gold and increase your score.

After spawning, you can choose one of the 6 weapons in the game and buy some upgrades for them with the game currency (called "Gold").\nAfter buying your weapon you enter an arena and enemies will spawn. """Enemies""" with many quotes, are squares. They don't hurt you, they just follow a path in the arena and your mission is to destroy them, wich will give you gold and increase your score.

But before I even mention them, I should point out that it's absolutely worth getting. I have a couple of minor nitpicks, but overall think it's a fantastic VR experience.\n\nFirstly, the aiming mechanics are somewhat ill-considered. Because of the look acceleration as you get further away from the center point, accidentally swivelling your chair while playing basically makes aiming impossible (which can be frustrating at best, neck-straining at worst). I imagine with a decoupled gun controller this game would be even more outstanding.\n\nSecondly (and perhaps more importantly): the gun balance is very poor. Several guns (specifically everything except the laser and the particle cannon) are completely useless. After a bunch of experimenting, I'm pretty certain that it's completely impossible to get 100% on all levels without using exclusively the laser and particle cannon. Perhaps you could also use the instant-rifle thing, but that's about it. The upgrades are also somewhat poorly done, with acid and punch being far, far more useful than any other upgrade.\nFor a game where the majority of the replay value is in experimenting with different loadouts and upgrade combinations, this is slightly disappointing.\n\nHowever, those two minor faults aside, I love Time Rifters. Of all my VR games, I've perhaps put the most time into this one (although that's probably just because my PC can't run Elite:Dangerous!)\n\nBuy it!","October 30, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The basic concept is that it's sort of a virtual reality shooting gallery.  You buy a gun, upgrade it with some gold, then hop into the level and kill as many target cubes as you can.  The cube patterns are fun and clever, sometimes even forming giant monsters that walk around the arenas.  After your time-limited run, you start again as a new character, buy new guns with the gold you earned from the last run, and then try again.  But there's a twist!  The 4 lives stack on top of one another and play out synchronously, so on your second life you'll see your first life playing along with you and you'll want to choose targets and weapons that compliment previous runs.\n\nIt's a bargain price (even full price of $10 is great) and provides a very unique and fun experience that combines some good FPS challenges with a clever and interesting single-player time-based co-op mode that works extremely well.  The presentation, music, visuals - they're all slick and polished making for a great overall package.  I want to give a special shout-out to the HUD UI - all of the menus are presented in a sort of helmet-based augmented reality that feels natural and keeps you in the game; it's very clever and I want to give a high-five to whoever on the team came up with it.  I can't *wait* to get an Oculus Rift to try this game out in (which is apparently has native support for!).\n\nThe amount of built-in content is admittedly low (only 3 "episodes" of 5 levels each, each episode takes about 20 minutes to play through), but if you work on trying to optimize and go for high scores you'll be replaying the episodes multiple times.  Additionally, it has full support for community-created levels, and I suspect they will eventually be adding more level packs if the game sells well enough to warrant it.\n\nThere's also a demo, which you should definitely try out.  The only thing that's not clear from the demo that was a really pleasant surprise was that as you go through the 5 levels of an episode you get to keep spending gold upgrading your weapons.  This means that by level 5 your guns are doing crazy amounts of damage and effects on the targets, which is a great sense of progression and strategy.","February 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is a bit on the short side (consisting of 3 episodes, each with 5 levels that can be completed in ~1hour overall), but because of the nature of the game, there is plenty of free workshop content to download in the form of arenas/score attack levels.\n\nThe basic game mechanics are simple. It's a first-person shooter where, at the start of the level, you will select what weapon you want and you can purchase upgrades for the weapon using gold earnt from killing enemies. Then you enter the level and destroy as many enemies (which are basically coloured cubes that move - sometimes they form a shape such as a spider or a crab) as you can before the time runs out. The really cool thing about this game, though, is that you then play the same level again alongside yourself from your first playthrough (a recording of your previous actions). At the end of a level you can have up to 4 copies of yourself all contributing towards destroying the cubes! So basically the game is as I said before, a single-player co-op first-person shooter.\n\nIn addition to the gameplay, the music is really cool too (mainly dubstep music) and the graphics are not bad either (there's only so much you can do with shooting cubes - though some levels have a nice cave design or an underwater theme). Gladly these were not done bad as nothing takes away from the base gameplay which is really good fun!\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of first-person shooters, time attack games, or playing with yourself, this game is for you! If you don't think you will get much out of the workshop content though, maybe wait for a sale.\n\nEnjoy! :D","March 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You then not just play with that current player, but it saves what you did your LAST trial, and your past attempt fights along side you, which is crucial to win in this game.

There are no "enemies" to speak of, no way to loose except failing to take out enough targets. Yet it is still incredibly fun.\n\nIf you are like me and enjoy FPS games as a fun and relaxing experience shooting stuff, and wish you could play a multiplayer game with yourself instead of a stoner, an 11 year old, and one guy who is afk, this is the game for you.\n\n10 out of 10 for the concept of 4 player coop with yourself. If they don't add more features to the existing game, I certainly hope there is a more fleshed out game as a sequal. A full FPS campaign, with enemies that shoot back, and a story, built around this awesome mechanic, could be one of the best games of all time.\n\nThat said, it IS a pretty basic game. Some arcade like shooting gallery levels, and user generated content for longevity. You will inevitably find yourself competing with yourself for a better score on past levels after the first few hours. For the price point though, 4-5 hours of great fun is totally worth it. And I would say it is a very replayable game.","May 6","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The maps are mostly blocks and geometic patterns, the dinglepoppers you have to shoot and destroy are boxes. There's the occaisional cave/surreal map that takes place, but its not as surrel as it should feel (at least to me) due to the high usage of geometric patterns to make landscape. In my opinion, the guns seem a bit too simplified, perhaps it was made that way to fit the futuristic-yet-simplistic mood.\n\nGameplay/Functionality\nThere isn't much to the game besides destorying floating boxes on different series of maps. Sure, some maps are finely built and are quite appealing, but the idea kind of degrades soon enough. The impressive part of the gameplay, though, is the concept of the game. Here, four people try to work together to destroy as many boxes as possible in a series (5 maps = 1 series). Those four people are you, you, you, and you. By playing the map as four different people and four different times, you get to see your previous self/selves work alongside your present self to eradicate the boxes, which I find to be really mind-boggling. Unfortunately, just this alone probably wouldn't deride the fact that this game is basically a shoot-the-box simulator.\n\nLongevity\nI'll be completely honest here. As I said above, you take turns as four alternating selves to shoot boxes, to top scores, set leaderboards, and (if you so wish it) compete with leaderboard statuses. But would that be enough of an incentive for you, as a gamer, to continue playing this game? Personally, unless the developers add in something to the game that gives the motivation, I find this a bit... dissapointing? But if you're happy with setting scores over and over again on  the same three series of pre-made maps (and the addtitional daily map(s)) then go right ahead. After a while, though, it gets boring.","August 8, 2015","false","2.3"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","13","29","2","3"

This game is good for VR but bad for a desktop PC. As a non-DK2 owner I can only give it a thumbs down. Maybe the devs should have just waited for the Oculus Rift to come out and publish the game then. On Steam and desktop this game is somewhat out of place.\n\nIt's like a shooting range, where you shoot at moving cubes and run around a small area for a better shot angle. The innovative part is that you do this 4 times per level, and each time you do this you are recorded, so next time you will see your own copies doing what you did last time. With the efforts of all your doubles combined, it plays like a co-op game. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is for a short time, just don't expect too much.\n\nUsually you will shoot a portion of the enemies in one run, another portion in the second run etc. Or, since it's all pretty casual and you won't plan much, you will just shoot what you can in the first run, then, recalling what you had difficulties with (like the tough yellow cubes), you focus on those in the next runs, maybe also guessing which weapon will be best for the situation. You also run around collecting loot (small dots which make a typical "score" sound reminding Mario-like 2D platformers). For the coins you buy straightforward upgrades for the weapons (more damage, faster firing, more spread, faster rockets etc). The game feels like an attraction in a theme park where you compete with other visitors to win a teddy bear for your girlfriend.\n\nThere is even a level designer but it's awkward to use on a PC since it's obviously made for people wearing a VR headset and struggling with its limitations. The graphics are bright and feel casual. The music is disco-style; it's good but somehow it adds to the game's shallow feel. The levels are pretty varied, struggling to postpone the rising boredom. You may want to play it 15-20 minutes in a session when you are waiting for something - much like a mobile/flash game.","December 29, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It fits well with the gameplay and doesn't clash with the sounds of you destroying blocks.\n\nThe gameplay at first seems like the generic FPS, but very hard. Then you realise that you play the level again, but with a different person. This makes the game easier and more enjoyable.\n\nYou have to plan your attack on the blocks. You are very unlikely to win if you use a 'spray and pray' tactic.\n\nEach level is something new. Especially the final ones. The levels not only look more exotic, but the blocks are more creatively placed. The levels naturally get harder the furthur in you go.\n\nThe weapons are interesting and diverse. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses and use the wrong comination and everything can go wrong.\n\nThe daily challenge is fun and interesting. There are many different levels in one and as it changes daily, allows you to see other's creativeity.\n\nThere are many secrets hidden around the game. I won't reveal any, but they are needed for achievements.\n\nThere are lots of achievements. It is almost impossible to collect them all in a day.\n\nLeaderboards have been added, so you can compete against friends and strangers.\nNegatives\n\nSadly all games have their negatives, this being no exception.\n\nThere are only 15 official levels, in 3 groups of 5, so you will end up turning towards community created levels and the daily challenge eventually.\n\nThere is no tutorial. Sure there is a controls board next to where you spawn, but nothing to tell you that blocks should be destroyed. This is however, slightly lightened due to an easy first level.\nFinal Notes\n\nTime Rifters is a very enjoyable game, with many, many hours of play time due to many different stratergies and daily challenges that are possible to play. As you can see the positives greatly out-weigh the negatives, so I am recommending the game.","December 23, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is the link to the longer review: http://pastebin.com/T70PP0t3 .\n\nGameplay: It's a game about shooting blocks with clones of yourself and different types of weapons. The weapon variety is alright, but there is some balance issues with the weapons. 15 levels in all, which can be beaten in an hour. Most of the gameplay comes from replaying levels, so if you don't like score attacking, you won't like this game. Fun for a little while, but I could see it getting old quick. 7/10.\n\nStory: No story at all, not worth reviewing.\n\nGraphics: Visually very vibrant, although somewhat underwhelming in terms of area design. Game runs very well at 60 FPS with uncapped framerates possible. 3/5.\n\nSound: OST is pretty much all okay dubstep, sound design is alright, guns are standard future-y pew pew fare. 2/5.\n\n7/0/3/2; 6.0/10.","August 5, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fits well with the gameplay and doesn't clash with the sounds of you destroying blocks.\n\nThe gameplay at first seems like the generic FPS, but very hard. Then you realise that you play the level again, but with a different person. This makes the game easier and more enjoyable.\n\nYou have to plan your attack on the blocks. You are very unlikely to win if you use a 'spray and pray' tactic.\n\nEach level is something new. Especially the final ones. The levels not only look more exotic, but the blocks are more creatively placed. The levels naturally get harder the furthur in you go.\n\nThe weapons are interesting and diverse. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses and use the wrong comination and everything can go wrong.\n\nThe daily challenge is fun and interesting. There are many different levels in one and as it changes daily, allows you to see other's creativeity.\n\nThere are many secrets hidden around the game. I won't reveal any, but they are needed for achievements.\n\nThere are lots of achievements. It is almost impossible to collect them all in a day.\n\nLeaderboards have been added, so you can compete against friends and strangers.\nNegatives\n\nSadly all games have their negatives, this being no exception.\n\nThere are only 15 official levels, in 3 groups of 5, so you will end up turning towards community created levels and the daily challenge eventually.\n\nThere is no tutorial. Sure there is a controls board next to where you spawn, but nothing to tell you that blocks should be destroyed. This is however, slightly lightened due to an easy first level.\nFinal Notes\n\nTime Rifters is a very enjoyable game, with many, many hours of play time due to many different stratergies and daily challenges that are possible to play. As you can see the positives greatly out-weigh the negatives, so I am recommending the game.","December 23, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The solo multiplayer aspect is a good way to get people thinking about how to set up their next move. My only real complaint is that the main campaign is quite short. It can be completed in around an hour. Still, it's a very enjoyable way to burn some time and get your brain thinking.","February 19","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say this game is almost like a puzzle because you kind of have to walk around the room or you might miss a room and miss a lot of blocks. If you like Time Clickers then you will love this because its basically 3D room.
