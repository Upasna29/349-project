"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/449060/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account",""Cellar" is as cute as it is short. One can finish it in around 20 minutes if they run straight to the exit in each of the 8 levels of the game.\n\nHowever, the presence of achievements increases the replay value a lot - they require gathering a few toy collectibles or finding alternate solutions for solving some of the levels. You will probably need to do a separate playthrough to beat the game without dying.\nIn addition to these features, completing the game for the first time unlocks challenge modes for every level - timed runs.\n\nAll-in-all, this short adventure of Lily searching for her lost teddy bear in the labyrinthine levels of her cellar is well worth the $1 price. Plaything the game warmed my heart and left me with a burning desire for more levels. I hope that the developers have something like this planned for the future.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 28","true","5.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/449060/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","I bought this game mostly because it looks extremely charming and I was kinda digging the atmosphere in the trailers and screens, but once I started actually playing the game, it quickly became apparent that it was not for me.\n\nStrike One: The controls. I am not a fan. This is not a game where you control the character freely, as in many top-down games such as old school zelda and console RPGs. Instead the character moves from square to square on a grid. If you just tap left, the character will move left one entire square. This isn't necessarily a problem in games that have reasonably-sized grid squares, but the grid squares in this game are so incredibly enormous that it only feels awkward.\n\nStrike Two: The gameplay is pretty dull. It basically amounts to putting the player in a maze with a locked exit. You have to find the key and escape, but when you pick up the key a thing will chase you, so if you don't reach the exit fast enough you will die and have to start over again. It's not very exciting gameplay, but the thing that really killed it for me is that there are, for example, tiles that you can only cross over once and then they crumble and can't be crossed again, so if you mess up once, you botched the entire level and just have to suicide or restart.\n\nStrike Three: I played several levels and it was literally that exact same thing in every room. The scenery didn't change and the gameplay did not get more interesting. I was hoping the game would be a little bit more of an exploration/adventure type of game, but the gameplay is more like an old Atari game, and not really in a good way.\n\nI love that pixel art, though!\n\nVerdict:\n\n7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.\n6) A good game that is worth the full price.\n5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.\n4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.\n3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.\n2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.","March 29","false","0.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Obviously it is the utmost importance that the lost teddy is retrieved, so the girl heads down to the basement. Your objective on each level is to pick up a key and then make a run for the door, while avoiding the monsters and hazardous pipes (they should really call a plumber). If you die, you restart from the beginning of the level.\n\nThe graphics and music are charmingly simple. The gameplay is basically a memory game, pick up the key after you discover a path to the door and remember that route. It is very, very short - I beat it in 14 minutes; but it is the price of a can of Coke. I really can't fault it on that.\n\nIf you want 15 minutes of entertainment, buy this game.\n","March 27","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Same music track every level, similar level design, and little to interact with gives a sense that while it is well made and interesting in the first few levels, it starts becoming boring very quickly. It eventually comes down to you getting lost in a rather uninteresting environment, having to look for both key and door before progressing. One mistep and it's back to the beginning with you, having you restart your trek all over again. That and whenever you DO die, it plays the sad trumpet sound, completely breaking whatever immersion the game had been giving you.\n\nIt's good that it's only a bit over a dollar, but that doesn't mean that there can't be cheap games that are also fun to play. Different level designs, different monsters, and new music tracks (including an actual game over sound that fits a horror style arcade game), would really go a long way with this one. A good horror game to start you 6 year old with, maybe, but being not scary enough to fit the horror theme and not interesting enough to play without it doesn't give this game much replayability.\nGood for maybe an hour or so, but it still left me somewhat disappointed.","March 23","false","0.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"
