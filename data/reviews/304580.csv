The steering is terrible. (Sensitivity is very high without an adjustment in the options).\n\n2. Controller support is there, but not ALL there. (50% of the keybindings for the controller you are not even able to bind to the controller) So you can only do a few things and the rest must be done via keyboard.\n\n3. The way the garbage is done is just terrible and very slow. (There is no AI help when doing garbage) You drive the truck get out, then you have to push a button to ready the truck to accept the bin, then you have to go get the bin, slowly walk it back to the truck (some of the bins are the double bins that a person could NOT push IRL) hook it to the back of the truck, push the button again to lift the trash into the truck then watch a cut scene then you have to take the bin off, again slowly walk it back to where you got it from (usually 50 ft from the road) then go back to the truck and hit the button again to close the forks and then get in the truck.\n(So many things done wrong here.) Cut scenes WHY? Just let it do the animation.\n\n4. The trucks make this annoying shifting sound every few seconds. I mean WHY! There isn't even a in cab view so why even add the shifting sound. I mean ya, you can have a shifting sound, but holy hell it's so loud and annoying.\n\n5. The AI workers you can send out don't actually go out and do the jobs given to them. Your trucks just sit at your parking lot and say "this truck is being used by a worker". Very lame. It's 2015 and these people can't even make proper features in a game.\n\n6. The AI cars are just plain dumb. They ram you, cut you off, run stop signs and you get the ticket for hitting them.\n\n7. You get tickets for hitting cars and pedestrians, but not for running red lights.\n\n8. I have done all of the jobs except the gardening. The jobs themselves are very simplistic almost to the point where the game looks like it is targeting an audience of 6 yr olds.\n\n9. The economic gameplay is a joke. You can hire workers and fast forward time and just get millions in about 5 minutes.\n\n10. The models of the trucks are 7/10 - the world is 4/10 (looks like it's from 2005) - sounds are 3/10 - overall gameplay 4/10\n\nIf you want to try it go for it. imo it's worth about $7\nFinal Verdict - Don't buy until 50%+ sale.","December 2, 2015","false","7.5"," 80 of 101 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","80","101","6","4"

First off all, all the vehicles only let 1 person in them ( So you cant stand on the back of the rubbish truck while your friend drives) which means you may drive but everyone else has to walk. You can only assign 1 challenge per group so you cant send your friend to go cut some grass or pick up some rubbish while your doing other jobs. The sensitivity on the keyboard is very low yet on a controller its very sensitive but unfortunatly the options wont let you change anything like that nor are the keybindings "all there". There is still alot of fun to be had in the game but when your truck sinks into invisible quicksand and your half way through the road and have to buy a new truck its just un-cool. The actual graphics of the trucks themselves is great and the buildings could be a bit more in depth graphically with more textures.\n\nBUT ! after saying this about the game it does have the possibility to be such a great game me and my friend enjoy it even with all the bugs, we just wish that it could actually be "multiplayer" so we can drive in same truck or even in 1st person would be nice. But to only be able to drive "1" manned vehicles at a time and do "1" mission while your friends waiting although he is there on screen does not make this game feel like a multiplayer nor a co-op. Lets just hope that futures updates will fix all this then I will change my review.","December 3, 2015","false","12.0"," 48 of 64 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","48","64","2","5"

But all of these are fixable in future patches. The developer has already released a major patch within a day or two of release, and seems committed to further updates to please the users. Great news, right!\n\nWrong. I'm afraid no level of updating is ever going to make this the great game you were hoping for. The freedom in this games' design is just too limiting within the confines of its skill tree and XP, and aside from unlocking the ability to move a different type of vehicle, over a different sewer, pothole, bin, car, hedge, or stain in a different part of the generic looking map to earn more XP leaves too little for the imagination beyond a few hours of grinding. Grinding can be fun but the mechanics and limitations in each skill tree are too similar. One issue I had was I was earning 3K and 250 XP per job for "towing" a car, then 6:00 AM the next morning it was 2K and 200 XP per job. Just when I thought I had found a way to earn quick cash for that next vehicle the rug was pulled under my feet! Also, hiring workers to do anything for you is useless when they earn 40% of what you would earn and take 4000% longer burning all of your fuel in the process.\n\nThe tools we are given look promising and realistic, but the handling is wonky and their uses are very much "on rails". I have a lifter on the front of my Paper Recycling truck, so that should give me the ability to drive up and lift the bins without doing the "dumpster drag" right? Wrong, buddy you are dragging dumpsters again. And why is there a small version of anything? I have to buy it and unlock a bigger version with a bigger tank of whatever to do 20 missions to get a bigger one so I can do it over again? I will say that I enjoyed the mowing and hedge trimming skill tree the most of all, as I felt it provided the best mix of challenge and reward.\n\nAnd last and least, the setting. I'll give the developers an "E" for effort, as I can see touches in the map and city design that give it a little bit of flair. But on the whole the city you are doing these tasks in is just too bland and uninspiring to draw you back into doing any more grinding. In other games you can take a look out the window while you are doing whatever and just enjoy the setting in a relaxing way. Here there is just too little for the imagination to work with.\n\nWhile this had the look of something great in this genre "on the tin", I'm afraid there is too little on the inside at this point to recommend it. On the positive, I’m totally ready for the “Dumpster Pushing Nationals” next year!","December 7, 2015","false","15.9"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","38","49","6","2"

The Dev team seems to be taking care of nagging issues and adding things to the game as they go along.\n\nThe game itself. Picture the following. Any Garbage Truck simulator (That are terrible and slow) Tow Truck simulator (That is just.. god awful) Street Sweeper simulator (Slow, never worked for me) take all the problems out of them, you got a nice little buisness sim game, The controls are nice and do support controllers and wheels (Added support) No Interior views but the models themselves are greatly put together. There are a few problems to be ironed out (Aggressive AI traffic , A front loaded Recycling truck that needs to be manually loaded by hand instead of inside the cab, Some locations that have traffic just stop dead in the middle of the road and kill framerate. )\n\nMutiplayer is OK in it's current state but needs much improvement when using some trucks.\n\nSo is it worth the buy?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/304580/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","It's time to take out the trash!\n\nAt first appearance Cityconomy is exactly what you'd expect - an unyieldingly focused simulation where you have to empty large bins into your lorry in real time, and keep doing this over and over. It lets you turn this into a career, able to expand your business (and gain new types of job to do) as you make money.\n\nBut it mixes in some very unsimulation-like concepts taken directly from RPGs. You  receive job quests from quest-givers, complete with cartoony exclamation marks over their heads. And completing quests levels up your XP and increases your customer satisfaction levels, with which you can unlock skills on your skill tree and new jobs such as street sweeper.\n\nThis is a blessing and a curse - it adds variety and gamifies a dry subject, but it also sets in stone the game as a grind where you have to really work at unlocking most of the game.\n\nFrom the start of the game you can only play as a bin man - the gardener, plumber, tow truck driver and street sweeper are locked behind walls of experience. You will need to empty 20+ bins (up to 2 hours of playing) before you can unlock your choice of one new job / unlock a new district on the map.\n\nGameplay video for collecting trash:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVZyRNVjOWg\n\nYou start your career with access to two vehicles - bin lorry and recycling lorry. Both operate the same. You can buy new vehicles, but you'll need to unlock the relevant job if you want to actually use them to earn money. You can instantly swap between vehicles using tab, which is weird at first but essential for time-saving if your vehicles are spread across the map!\n\nPerforming the garbage collection means knowing your vehicle - for each collection you drive as close to the bin as possible, open the "arms" of the vehicle, drag the bin over to the lorry, press the button to engage the emptying mechanism, take the bin back to where you got it from, close the arms again (if you're not driving far) and then tootle off again. Most quests involve emptying 4 bins in an area. It's fairly repetitive, but working out how to be super-efficient is oddly satisfying.\n\nOther types of job each have their own things to learn, and you'll have to learn a bunch of new keys to press (press O to show recommended keys, otherwise it won't tell you!). The street sweeper, for instance, requires you to fill your tank with water, extend brushes, engage brushes, and run over the instructed patch of oil on the street.\n\nAll vehicles need maintenance (because you keep driving into a lamppost), emptying of trash etc and regular pitstops for fuel. Sometimes this is a bit mean - your bin lorry only has enough room for 10 bins of rubbish, so realistically you need to do this every 2 "quests".\n\nThe open world, if not the best looking city, works well enough - you can do whatever you want in the course of the day, even to the extent of skipping hours at a time if you, say, fancied working at night. It's best at sunrise/sunset, when the light catches the buildings in a surprisingly fetching way.\n\nBut the city's a bit plain and you cannot interact with it beyond doing your job - other vehicles and street furniture are unmovable objects that will stop you dead if you crash into them. There is a limited amount of traffic (which can be altered for performance), and very few pedestrians.\n\nSo Cityconomy is a strange mix of simulation and RPG. There's little scope for playing for laughs (although you could probably get some off-piste fun out of the multiplayer), but if you're going to drop the best part of £20 on a game about collecting bins, you're not going to be taking this lightly!\n\nMore Randomise User indie game videos","December 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 52 of 89 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","52","89","6","0"

For anyone who is having issues getting this to run, the tips I got from mayamak and others were fantastic!\n\n\nmayamak 4 Dec @ 11:51am\nwhat is your system settings?\n\n* If you are useing laptop try to force Nvidia Card to run a game. Here is a description how to do it > http://steamcommunity.com/app/304580/discussions/0/485624149150490370/\n\n*update your Graphic Card drivers\n\n* Options menu setup on low system configuration:\n- go to Video tab change Antialiasing and max. Anisotropy parameters to lower values.\n- you can also chenge resolution form Default to some any other that will increase your performance.\n- go to Performance tab nad set LOW presets and turn OFF all parameters.\n\nMy laptop has a Radeon 5000 card in it so I downloaded and installed the AMD Catalyst Control Centre; and it worked!!!!!!\n\n\nPROS\n\nUnique idea: Not many have thought of the notion of a 'Utility Simulator' although I believe that there was one of these released before, but it was ham strung by limited missions!\n\nA good open world: Rather than being confined to a small area with little else to do after you have completed all tasks, the fact that this game has a huge map should help with playability!\n\nGood selection of vehicles: The vehicle selection in this is great with a good eye for detail!\n\nCONS\n\nThe game still tends to run slow at times; hopefully the devs will work on this\n\nAI traffic is a nightmare, as another player pointed out; they crash into you and then you get fined, again the devs should look at this!!\n\nMost of the sounds are fine, however the sound of the drain cleaners should be changed, as it sounds nothing like a drain cleaner!!\n\nOverall though a decent shot at a game, there are a few things that would be grat to see in it, first of all the interaction between the player character and the vehicles should change, the only vehicles to have any interaction with them are the garbage trucks. The street repair with the tar lorry or 'hotbox' as it is really known could probably do with the player having to remove the old surface with a pneumatic hammer and then use the hotbox to fix the surface. It would be great if there was a weather change, were it snowed and gritting lorries with snow plows could be used. A wider range of waste products such as construction waste, industrial waste, hazardous waste and on street domestic refuse would beef up the realism of the game; with these different categories, different vehicles could also be used such as skip lorries and big hook lift lorries with big skips for construction waste and closed boxes for hazardous waste, but then again that is just me and my imagination ;) So my new review would be 7/10, well done devs!!!\n\n\nFirst Review\n\nIt would be nice if the devs could turn the system requirements down so as more could play this game, I got the game as I figured that my gaming laptop could handle it, it wouldn't even launch as apparently my GPU does not meet the minimum requirements!!!! :( I have other games here which are just as graphically demanding, but run fine such as Farming Simulator 2015, which I consider to be one of the most polished and well presented games on Steam!! Dig It - A digger simulator, again when I got this I was suspicious that it might not even run, I was surprised when it did without lag or drag. I do have others as well which have fantastic graphics and don't cause problems! So until the devs come up with a solution to this problem it is a 0/10 from me, as it really is a gamble as to whether or not this will run on your machine!!! :( :( :(","December 3, 2015","true","16.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

I am pretty pleased with it and do think there is quite a nice variety of city services on offer. So far I have only tried Garbage man and Tow truck specializations and am enjoying it so far. A few points I'm dissapointed about it the lack of a interior view and a ridiculously slow walking speed when moving bins.\n\nUPDATE #1: Nano games have released a patch introducing Turn signals, faster movement of bins and more. Impressed with their observations of reviews.","December 2, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

All the garbage/recycling trucks work the same.. Even the one that has the overhead arms and dumps in the top..\n2. The AI get so close to your truck constantly you either have to keep moving up and hope they give you enough room to fit the dumpster in or drive/park on the sidewalk\n3. it seems like every 5 minutes it is raiining yet again, and again, and again.\n4. no variations for garbage truck, yet you have 3 different trucks for recycling stuff.\n5. Driving physics are poor. Can't drive somewhat decent and AI cars drive like they are driving a nascar race.\n6. AI hit you even when stopped and brake on and you get fined\n","December 11, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
