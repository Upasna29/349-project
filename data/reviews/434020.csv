"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/recommended/434020/","AgreedSA","AgreedSA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AgreedSA/","695 products in account","Update! The devs have promised a patch to overhaul the whole control scheme. As that was my biggest gripe with the game, I'm considering giving it another shot once this patch hits, as I still think some of the ideas on display are interesting. Looking forward to a second chance for this title. I'll reevaluate my opinion on the grind of the game once I can play the levels without control frustration.\n\nReview:\n\n***[Beta PATCH to address CONTROLS ISSUE out, haven't played updated game yet though.]***\n\nThere are a lot of things I don't like about this game, but the thing I like the least is that it's a frustratingly poor mobile port. Most things you'd want to "tap twice" to do on a tablet or phone still require two inputs, but it's ridiculous here - double type? Ok... And the control scheme is kinda garbage. There will be moments when you want to respond quickly to changing situations, but can't, because the controls inhibit your intentions.\n\nThe awkwardness of the user interface will be most noticeable when you're trying to do anything quickly. You'll be frustrated trying to place towers suddenly when a level's spawn layout changes after no prior warning (which is a mediocre design choice in my opinion, and forces you to build from the red line at the end of the level outward unless you want to get screwed on mobs slipping through your suddenly compromised defenses). The controls also suck when trying to get your hero to target enemies, either for their regular plink damage attacks or for their timed abilities. Also, the timed abilities are a little random in how they deal damage sometimes, which is difficult to square with the "Tower Defense" genre concept in my opinion. Shouldn't be very luck based at all.\n\nThere are a lot of things to grind out that make your towers or hero suck a little less, but at least in the early game it's just a grindy slog. Nothing in what I played so far to give you that "oh hell yeah" feeling some other games give you when you unlock a new tower type, no real decisions to make about how to specialize anything - just basic upgrades to basic attributes. I'd love this system if it had more choices in customization, maybe some exclusive choices to specialize a tower more. I dunno, I like that in other games of this kind and feel it might add some legs to the upgrade system to have even just one branching option at the end of an upgrade tree - make a choice, player, and enjoy the rewards.\n\nWhy am I bothering to make suggestions for a game I didn't even really like the first time I owned it? Well, the devs responded, and appear to be making a genuine good faith effort to work on areas that I personally found frustrating, and their communication with this review chain has given me some real faith that what we have here isn't a bad mobile port, but the makings of a Good Mobile Port, maybe even something that can find unique excellence on the PC platform if they continue to develop it and continue to pay attention to player response.","April 13","false","1.4"," 69 of 92 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","69","92","4","12"

There are multiple heroes to choose from all with their own individual skill sets,equipment and playstyles.

It's nice and refreshing to see an early access project where the devs don't crowd source just to end up abandoning the game.These guys are actually serious about Last Hope and it's clearly reflected in the state of their current product.\n\nHighly recommended.","February 10","true","12.0"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

Assuming this was originally a mobile game it plays well on PC with a clean UI, intuitive control system and no microtransactions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLeQk_tNVp8\nSpread across a multitude of zones, higher difficulties and new heroes unlocked once making progress. Basic single line marches quickly turned into enemies taking multiple paths, knocking down walls, climbing up cliffs and spawning from graveyards. Successful missions rewarded gold based on your performance which is then spent on buying and upgrading towers or purchasing new equipment. Heroes have talent trees, skills and equipment slots while towers had upgrade paths. Surprisingly okay story, complete with cut-scenes that added to the overall presentation. Steal at the current price and worth checking out for any TD fan.\n\nCopy was purchased by me, for me.

Wasn't expecting much of a game because of the very low early access price tag on this game...\n\nAnd this is one of the more fun tower defense games I've played.  Very, very impressive!\n\nHere is my "First Play on Launch Day!" Early Access Review Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jNfBNCyEtI\n\nNice style to the game, the zombies will climb cliffs to avoid your turrets, break through walls, and surprise you in other ways as well!  Pretty standard tower defense style of upgrades and using earned credits to research new weapons and upgrades as you progress through the levels.\n\nI love the art style, the way you can speed things up, and the humorous and witty text found as you play the game.  This is a very fun game, and it shows in the early access score I gave the game, which is heavily lifted because of its very high value score (huge bang for your gaming dollar)!!\n\nMy scoring system:\n\nValue:  40 out of 40\nFun: 25 out of 30\nControls & Bugs: 20 out of 20\nGraphics & Sound: 8 out of 10\n----------------------------------------\nMy Total Score:  93%     <-  This is a very impressive score for a game that costs less then a fast food burger!\n\n\nRecommended for most gamers!

That being said, this game is definately good for at least the $1/hour expectation.\n\nHowever... if you're looking for a good TD that will make you feel challenged, this probably isn't it.\n\nWhile the hero system has some merit with six different heroes (with a seventh available waaaaay too late to be worth mentioning), with both talents and gear to help you customize your play,,, that works as both an advantage and a disadvantage.  In many cases, you'll have to farm excessive amounts of currency to unlock a hero, then unlock his/her gear, then upgrade said gear... only to THEN have to level up that hero to be useful.  Given how slow leveling is, and how dull farming currency is, that's a monumental task.  Especially given that some heros don't work the way you'd expect them to just reading their stats.\n\nBut the real crime here is the towers themselves.\n\nOften times towers will fail to target correctly - either focusing on a slow mob that moved into range first while letting one or more faster ones slip by, or simply not hitting mobs because of strange line-of-sight issues.  For instance, an AoE tower might hit one mob at the back of a pack, but not hit the rest of the pack at all.\n\nWorse still, however, is for the many tens of thousands of currency you might sink into fully upgrading a tower... most of the game can be dominated with two tower types.  And no, they're not the advanced ones.  The most powerful tower seems to be spamming a certain, fully upgraded basic tower... and then adding in an anti-air turret if you have flyers.\n\nFor the most part, after about 5-6 hours, the game starts to feel repetitious... and I'm wondering if I have the fortitude to actually finish it.","April 14","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So far the game seems to have a decent amount of depth with upgrade trees for towers.\n\nI am not a huge Tower Defence fan but this game seems to have a lot of unique features which I haven't seen (Like I said not a huge fan so If some other games you know of have these features then my bad) such as heroes which are also upgradable and help out a lot, each hero has their own unique abilities that make them different. There are a handful in at the moment which should be enough for now.\n\nThis appears to have been a mobile game before but it seems put well together for PC as there are keys binded to abilities and such, there are also graphics options but honestly they don't make much difference. There are also NO microtransactions which is a + regardless of whether they were in the Mobile version or not.\n\n--Conclusion--\nIt's a tower defence game with some unique elements, if you're a fan of TD's then you should check this game out, if not but don't mind them then still check it out. I give the game a 8/10 Mainly because I'm not the biggest fan but I don't see why other people won't enjoy this game if they are a fan since it has a fair bit going for it especially at the price and having no content locked away behind Microtransactions. I'll probably play a fair bit more of the game than I have at the time of the review.","January 22","true","0.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

As your heroes massacre moving corpses flocking towards them, you can see the bar indicating the xp you gain so you know anytime how close your characters are to climb to the next level. The leveling system involves upgrading their three unique skills and access to better equipment and costumes which tremendously enhance their strength and capacity, and, at the same time, changing their appearance. Besides the battleground you will find a rich reward system for every action in the field thus giving you a powerful incentive (along with the accumulation of silver coins) to attack again and again even on the same levels, regardless if you pass them easily or being overwhelmed in the first minutes by the zombies.\n\n\nThe Last Hope is a tower defence game which will be for you a perfect entertainment platform that is going to captivate you for long hours. The constant reward of your actions and the monitoring of heroes and defense mechanisms while each growing rapidly, will lead to many enjoyable experiences. All that helps the launching of countless neurochemicals in your brain that will make you happy as you play with it. The three-dimensional representation of the action and the excellent zoom also helps in the absorption of the world's gaming details.

However there are some limitations set. It's a tower defense game with preset grounds where you could place the towers. Thus, you do not have freedom to place the towers wherever. However, there are upgrades for the towers possible with level clear bonuses which provides you with currency to develop and upgrade your towers.\n\nWhat makes the game different from other tower defense game is its focus on the hero. The hero does not have much effects on the game in the early phase but as the player develops the hero through the game play, the game seems to rely more and more on the hero. I would give it a 8/10. For the price tag it has, I'd say it's definitely worth a try playing.

Kingdom Rush, here the tower placements do not really matter, as long as they are next to the red line. The interface feels like American Shopping Television, it tries hard to make excuses for it's stupidity. The game itself needs to learn a lot to be playable, right now it is a horrible grind to get towers, and to "upgrade" them (many times over and over). It is not actually enough that you grind the coin to "buy" and "upgrade" but the "upgrade" is not really even an upgrade as it only *ALLOWS* you to "purchase" that "upgrade" when you actually get to "play" from all the "upgrading" on the horrible and tacky off battle "interface". Then when you actually get to play, remember that you need to upgrade *EACH* of your towers multiple times, as the "upgrade" in the menu was only a permission to upgrade anything in the game. If you like to "upgrade", then this game is probably great for you.\n\n-tower placements do not matter\n-interface is just horrible\n-"heroes" do not stay selected\n-placing of turrets is awkward\n-HORRIBLE GRIND, if you need to pay for it, why do you need to grind it to get the game open?\n-sad turret "upgrades" that are not upgrades but only unlocks for upgrades\n-constant "upgrading"\n-constant upgrading\n-religious/mystic themes, so if they are not yours, they are not yours.\n-tower elevation does not matter, maps are basically 2D\n\n+background sounds did not bore me even at 2h+\n+some of the zombies are well animated and stand out from the tacky 2D map\n\n\n\ntl;dr:       If you do not like to "upgrade", then use your time and money more wisely than I did.","February 8","false","2.5"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","2"

It's good, complex, satisfying enough until you get to a point when:\n- During a level, most of the time you do almost one thing repeatedly: upgrade.\n- The game gets hard, and all you do is grind the earlier levels for enough money to buy researches for your towers.\n\nThese are serious faults and make me not recommend this game.

The maps are not designed well and the rewards the games give you don't want to make be keep going, the side missions was not worth the time.\n\nNow your thinking "Whaaaaaat?"\n\nLet me explain. The maps no matter my skill with video games, are darn right confusing. I understand that they are unique yes, but I usally have to restart each map about 2-5 times to win. Usally cannot tell where the zombies will go unless you played the mission X amount of times. It gets annoying as almost ALL the maps are like that. More so with the side missions.\nI just found that annoying but I hit yes because this is a fun game if you can get past that.\n\nThe side missions I found boring and un-needed. The rewards for completing them arn't great and the item rewards you are given in this game usally don't work 90% of the time and you find yourself asking "Why is the posion arrows and bow I just earned (Not purchased) grey and not usable? "I DON'T KNOW".\n\nThen I'll play 2-4 more missions were I could have really used that bow or extra awesome gear or weapon in last missions..... I guess I'll go play that one ONE MORE TIME before (you know like 7th time) and oh look im not even half why though beating the game... Sigh..\n\nSo I know alot of people are going to disagree with how they should feel about the game.
