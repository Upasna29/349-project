"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/334230/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","Town of Salem is presented somewhat in the style of an animated board game, pitting fifteen people against each other in a clever roleplay battle of wit, perception, strategy, and deception.\n\nA quick recount of a fun session I played.\nIn a recent game, I was the serial killer. That means I can kill at night and can not be killed. All I have to do is keep killing people, keep deceiving them, and not leave any clues for them to suspect me. I won this specific game, because there was a player named Snoop Dogg and every time I killed someone, I would leave a "death note" with a vague dog-related reference on the victim - even some as obtuse as "Bow down before the Lion". This made people increasingly suspicious that this other player was the serial killer, without focusing any suspicion on myself. Yet, I (feigning to be a good guy) kept raising questions about yet *another* player, so that the town never had enough votes in agreement about Snoop Dogg to have him put on trial. Keeping Snoop Dogg alive meant I could keep killing with impunity. Until there were so few townsfolk left that I was able to kill Snoop Dogg, get away with it, and win the game.\n\nSo what is the gameplay?\nWhen you start each game, you can pick new name. Some people choose generic and some are clever. It's the internet, so plenty are offensive. When the game starts, all fifteen players will be told what their role is. Each role comes with certain abilities, traits, alignments, and limitations. The goal is to play your role, while supporting your faction. Each role has different faction alignments. Some are aligned with the mafia and the town. Some are aligned with the town and witches. Some, like the serial killer, are aligned only with the survivors.\n\nThe game is broken up into rounds. Your activities are performed at night. If you're the serial killer, you kill at night. If you're the investigator, you investigate one person's information each night. If you're the mafia, you communicate privately with the other mafia and the godfather at night, about who to kill and then you kill them. If you're the jailor, you put someone in jail overnight. If you're the escort, you distract someone overnight.\n\nThen there are limitations. For example, the serial killer can not kill the mafia's godfather. So if you choose to kill someone overnight, but are not able to, there's a good chance you (as the serial killer) have just identified who the god father is.\n\nWhen the night is over, you get a tally of the dead and how they died. You can read their will (each player can write a will, which for some is just a clever or insulting quip, but for others is an on-going ledger of information they've gathered while playing, so that upon their death, other players are informed as to what that player knew).\n\nStill in the day phase, everyone votes on who to execute, if anyone. If enough votes are tallied for an individual, that person has to plead their defense to the town (in their own words). The town can then determine if they find him guilty or innocent. If he's guilty, he is hung. After his death (as with all deaths), his name goes up on a visible list for all to see, along with their role. (As an aside, there are also mediums - who are the only players who can communicate with the dead players in chat, using their information for themselves or to share with the living to inform future judgments).\n\nIt will often play out something like this: Someone accuses a player of being the godfather. Everyone votes for that person. That person swears they are the sheriff and the town needs them. Nobody buys their lies. They hang him. Then the name and role appears on the grave sites... they were telling the truth! They were the sheriff! Uh oh!\n\nAnd then night comes again and we carry out the rounds like this, until almost everyone is dead and the town, mafia, serial killer, or other faction is left alive and declared the winner.\n\nThere are a few small hurdles that may trip some up. They are worth dealing with.\nFirst, this is a free-to-play browser-based game that is now also on Steam for $5 USD. Those $5 are converted to ingame currency to buy cosmetic items like death animations or houses. There is no pay-to-win aspect to the game; only cosmetic items. You also accrue currency simply by playing, so you could play with no disadvantage whatsoever without ever paying a dime.\n\nSecond, the game requires you to install Adobe AIR, so if this isn't already on your system, it will direct you to install it before the game runs. You'll also need to create a game account. Click "register" from the game's interface to be taken to the web page where you do this. The page it takes you to is a sign-up for a forum account, which may seem confusing. Just do it, as the account is directly tied to your game login. When you're done, login to the game with those credentials.\n\nThird, when you go to play a game, you'll have the options "invite friends" and "solo". This is very misleading, but if you click "solo", you will actually be entering the online multiplayer, which is what you obviously want.\n\nOverview.\nThe game is addictive and allows for a lot of role playing and deception. Even with fourteen other total strangers. Depending on the mode you are playing, there are also somewhere between 15 and 30 different roles to be played. Vigilante, veteran, doctor, mafioso, framer, godfather, spy, jailor, sheriff, escort, serial killer, witch, werewolf, arsonist, executioner, survivor, amnesiac, forger, vampire hunter, vampire, janitor, disguiser, consort, consigliere, blackmailer, bodyguard, investigator, lookout, mayor, medium, retributionist, transporter, jester...\n\nThe game becomes a clever meeting of wits, suspicions, piecing together what you know about roles and how they interact with each other, lying, determining truth, banding together, and backstabbing. It is absolutely unique and so compelling that I played six hours straight the first time I launched the game.\n\nThe game is a no-brainer at the price of zero dollars, if you play the web version. Frankly, it's worth $5 USD for the Steam version, too. If you're unsure, try the web version and decide if you'd like to support the guys behind this game by kicking in the $5 on Steam and getting this version. It also doesn't seem like there are a lack of players. Even past midnight, there were more than 300 ongoing games being played by almost 4,000 players. I never waited to get into a lobby and lobbies are filled and launched into the game within about one minute.\n\nI can't implore you enough to give this game a shot, if any of this sounds even remotely compelling to you.","December 16, 2014","true","84.7"," 425 of 438 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","425","438","21","3"

You can play it in your browser at any time. What I hope is that the devs will take this steam money and 1. improve the interface. 2. fix the bugs. and 3. fix the ♥♥♥♥ing interface bugs.\n\nSo, let me count the problems with this game:\n1. Inteface bugs. Menus will/may get stuck on your screen, preventing you from a proper play.\n2. Mafia is possible OP? maybe? (Update: I have lost once as Godfather out of countless games. I am either ♥♥♥♥ing incredible at that role, or it really is OP)\n3. Mediums ♥♥♥♥ing suck.: Clarification: The medium can actually be really helpfull. The problem lies with the fact that people always leave as soon as they die, rendering the medium useless.\n4. No way to exit a game, back to the lobby, without closing.\n5. As with any MP game, there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n6. quitters.\n7. You should not be able to pick a different name at the beginning of each round. There is no way to keep track of the trolls and the a55holes.\n\nNow let me count the ways I love thee:\n1. This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. I am seriously considering ripping it off and creating the same game under a different title. With a better UI,\n2. So much fun. No matter your role, you will have such a good time just watching the absolute paranoia, the accusations, the threats, and the mediums giving up imediately\n3. I can't stress enough how ♥♥♥♥ing funny this game can be. It is the players that make it so. You never know who is using reverse psychology, or reverse reverse phsycology. This is a thinking man's game, but at the same time, a non-thinkers game. YOU CAN NOT KNOW!\n\nSure, there are more gripes on my list than compliments, but the gravity is not the same. I would absolutely recommend this game to any friend with a head on his or her shoulders. It was given to me as a gift on the same night I spent over $200 on Steam games, and I have put more than double the time into it. As I said before, it is a free browser game, but your $5 helps the devs to improve it. And I hope they do. I will continue to consider completely ripping this game off, and creating my own.I could make a fortune. Absolute genius of a game.\n\nTips for making the game better for everyone playing, including yourself:\n\n1. If you are bored and trolling, play CoD.\n2. Fill out your will. Any info or observations can be very helpful to your fellow townies. especially in roles like escort, jailor and invest.\n3. Leave the racism at gradeschool. No one want to hear it, no one thinks it's funny.\n4. Don't spam the chat. See Tip# 3. It's also against the rules.\n5. Don't be an obvious jester. It's immediately obvious and annoying.\n6. Hate language is childish and ignorant. Grow up.\n7. Please, for the love of god, you do not need to declare your depraved sexual status in your name.\n8. If you are mafia/sk, kill the most obnoxious player first night.","February 3, 2015","true","51.5"," 354 of 418 people (85%) found this review helpful 114 people found this review funny","85","354","418","114","40"

Once past those 40 hours, the scroll update fell upon Town of salem.\n\nI would have recommended the game without a doubt before the update that introduced the scrolls.\n\nTown of Salem is a fun game(similar to the Werewolf game), that requires you to be deceitful and think logically in order to win. You have to think strategically your every move, choose who to trust carefully. You get a role at the start of each game, with its own objectives and skills.\n\nMost roles are fun and require a unique way of playing it. The townies are the most numerous and have to work together, the mafia must also work together, but in secret and most of the neutrals have their own agenda.\n\nThe two main game types allow for some very fun games.\n\nThe classic game type forces you to play with a given set of roles that make for a balanced game.\nThe custom game type let the host decide what the roles are going to be, which adds a lot of replayability and diversity to the game.\n\nIf you like the Werewolf type of game, I think you'd like town of Salem.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend Town of Salem as of right now.\n\nSince the scrolls were introduced, the game is a lot more frustrating.\n\nThe scrolls are in-game items that allow you to boost your chances of getting a specific role.\nFor instance, I can boost my chances of getting the role "Serial killer" from 7%(the default value) to 52%.\n\nThis will logically decrease the odds for all the other players, from 7% to 4% if only a single person has a scroll. Once you get the role you wanted, it will burn one scroll of that specific type.\n\nHow do you get scrolls? You have to buy them for the most part. They each cost 200gold, and although you can get gold by playing the game, it is far easier and faster to just pay for gold with real money.\n\nI don't have that big of a problem with the cosmetic purchases, like the different skins, houses ,etc, even though they can somewhat affect the balance of the game, as, if you're playing with a friend, you can tell more easily who that friend could be by looking at the different skins.\n\nBut the scrolls really messed up Town of Salem.\n\nSince the scroll update, I get a lot more often the boring roles simply because I have a very low percentage of getting them due to other people using those scrolls.\n\nI already bought the game, it is not a free to play on steam, I already for paid, there is no reason why an in-game purchase should affect the balance of the game. I understand that for the browser version they would add it, as it is free-to-play, but there's no reason why it should be there for the steam version. It doesn't make the game pay to win, it makes it pay for fun. Remove the $5 Town Points and let the game be fair again.\n\nWhile it was more tolerable back before the update to get the boring roles simply because everybody would have to get them at one point, but the chances of getting them were fair, unlike now. You could still expect to get a fun role in the next game. Not anymore. It's rare that I find a game where all the odds are 7% for every single role.\n\nFurthermore, leavers utterly destroy the game. When you start a game and half of the townies are gone, it breaks everything, as the town has no chance of winning right off the bat. There isn't any penalties for people who leave the game. Therefore, you can expect at least 2 people per game who will leave during the first round, and more afterwards.\n\nTo make it worse, a role(medium) is all about interacting with the dead townies to get some clues as to who is what, but since most people just leave straight away, it makes it pratically useless in most games.\n\nIn conclusion, Town of Salem is a fun game, even considering the very annoying quitting, but I'll only recommend it once the damn scrolls are gone and the devs add some penalties for quitters.\n\nIn the present circumstances, it is only a matter of time until another "Werewolf" game comes out on steam, without anything similar to the scrolls, at which point, Town of Salem will likely become deserted.","August 30, 2015","false","76.9"," 676 of 856 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","676","856","23","71"

My playtime is inaccurate since I had played for many more hours before it became a steam game. My love for this game has now been ruined because the developers have recently changed from nice people who listen to the community, to people who ignore/ban people because they disagree with the way things are now. I don't know what cause this change, but I greatly assume that it was the power and money got to their head.\n\nThey recently anounced that they would be releasing a card game for town of salem which will be funded on kickstarter. This is a blatent cashgrab since they are using the "Town of Salem" name to just reskin mafia/werewolf. As rewards for backing the card game on kickstarter, they are giving out a recoloured version of a previously released character as well as some items which used to be esclusive to people who paid alot of money funding the original kickstarter. Now the people who supported the game from the begining, no longer have a way to show it since their exclusive item is now being sold.\n\nI probably should have seen this coming earlier since they slowly been implementing moneymaking features into the game. For example they now have a feature where you can watch an ad for ingame currency. They have also got a feature where you can spend the ingame currency (which call be brought for real money), to buy higher percentages of getting certain roles.\n\nI would finall like to thank the youtuber "Tormental" for bringing light to how this company are now just running this game for quick money. After creating a video talking about this topic, Tormental was banned from the game even though he didn't violate any of the rules.\n\nUntil the devolpers apologize and stop the way that their game is heading, this review and my opinion of the game will remain negative.\n\nTL:DR The develpers are just running this game for money now and not for the community.","April 16","false","59.0"," 182 of 212 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","182","212","8","15"

I'll certainly play it some more. There are a lot of interesting aspects to it, more so than your average social deduction game. As for whether or not you should play it, I think it's high quality and a load of fun, but I'm not going to put an enormous amount of effort into convincing you this...\n\nI started playing it because some friends got me into it. You can set up lobbies ingame and invite people - as long as you aren't revealing info in a skype call that wouldn't automatically be known to everyone anyway, it's probably the best experience. Social deduction games always have a bit more flair to them when you know who you're playing with (without knowing if they're for you or against you)\n\nhttp://blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/\n\nI fully recommend playing this game on your web browser, as the free website version and the steam version are nearly identical. With all of that being said, I bought the steam edition several months ago because I was sick of dealing with inevitable web browser performance issues and such - they even offer some coins to spend on skins or a pet or something.\n\nUnfortunately, I regret spending money on the steam version, as I did not get much out of it (there really are like no benefits to this over playing in a web browser...) and the money also clearly didn't go anywhere worthwhile. As of right now, Blank Media Games has made a hella big profit off of their card game Kickstarter:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-the-card-game\n\nI don't imagine this game translating very well to a tabletop setting - a lot of the anonymity and role actions seem hard to emulate outside of a videogame, and I don't see why you wouldn't just gather some friends and play it like you would a LAN party game. That being said, at first it seemed promising, so I almost got the set. But the Kickstarter is starting to make it clear that the devs have a much different idea than I do concerning how us players should spend our money. The initial card game goal was $10,000. Despite having already reached $250,000 - BMG has still set up stretch goals after another whopping $100,000. This new stretch goal, if met, would add two new roles to the card game. These roles do not seem optimized or very originally thought up. In the ~9 months that I have been playing Town of Salem now, the videogame itself has only gotten two roles, the vampire and vampire hunter, which were almost as much of an unbalanced problematic afterthought as the card game rewards are. Speaking of these card game rewards, which ones have already been met? An "nsfw" pack. Yes. A ♥♥♥♥ing nsfw pack of cards for a party game I originally wanted to just open up with friends and play like we would Apples to Apples or maybe the new popular game Secret Hitler.\n\nWhat's worse is that this Kickstarter is seemingly the only legitimate way of purchasing the soundtrack - of course that's a tier wayyyy above the card deck itself, much more expensive than a typical soundtrack would be, which is about the only thing I'd be looking for. You can't even get the soundtrack if you're under 21, thanks to the nsfw cards being bundled with it.\n\nSo I guess my logic is that if I've supported this company multiple times, only to feel utterly frustrated with them and convinced that my money was wasted - just do yourself a favor and play the free web browser version identical in gameplay to what I'm playing anyway. Grab some friends, form a lobby, and have fun with them. Enjoy cosmetics by getting coins ingame for winning games, and choosing your new skin or pet carefully knowing it's not really worth it to buy another one with real money.\n\nI'll end this with what is probably the best argument I have. The card game backers aren't the only people who bought something that wasn't really all that special from BMG. In fact, this isn't even their first Kickstarter:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization/\n\nAround a year and a half ago they started a Kickstarter for some game updates, but mainly focused on putting ToS on steam and mobile. Of course, the steam version of the game is here. But the mobile is still in beta. This Kickstarter was also completely over-funded, and yet the devs are asking for more right now when they haven't completed what they pledged to give the backers of this, back in September of 2014.\n\nLook, I'm all for videogame developers making a living and earning the money they deserve. Really, I am. This philosophy is definitely something I care about, and that just makes it all the more significant that I'm taking what might be a less than forgiving stance this time around. Because usually I don't. But I think at some point, if you consider spending more money on Town of Salem, you might want to stop asking "Is this benefit/version/cosmetic worth $5 to me? and start asking "Is the amount of content that BMG has given us (and the manner in which they have) worth more than the hundreds of thousands of dollars that they already have?"","May 10","false","60.0"," 162 of 188 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","162","188","0","14"

That's not why this is a negative review, because everyone should play Town of Salem right now - in their browsers. The Steam version of this game is strictly inferior to the browser version, the only advantage I can possibly think of being that you'll know when your friends are playing without needing to login, assuming they ALSO have the Steam version, which is a $5 investment more than the browser version. As for what makes it worse?\n\nWindow settings are not saved when you close the game. It will launch in full screen each and every time. If you want to go into windowed mode, you either need to hit escape, or enter a game and press the full screen button. Upon entering windowed mode for the first time on a fresh launch, the window will be unimaginably tiny and must be manually resized to something functional. To go back to full screen, you MUST enter a game and press the fullscreen button. It cannot be done from the menu.\n\nThere is no way to back out of a game, even if you have no chance of winning (e.g. died during the night as a jester, lynched as an executioner). There is also no way to return to the login screen if you timeout.\n\nThere is no log out button. The only way to change clients is to exit the client and log back in.\n\nThe only instance I would recommend grabbing the Steam version of this game is if you were already planning on buying $5 worth of town points. Seeing as its a browser game to begin with, there's no particular convenience of having it on Steam right now, and the Steam version feels like it was rushed to meet a deadline without any actual attention given to justify its presence here.\n\nLuckily, the devs ARE working on fixing these issues, and I'll be editing this review as they come, and once I feel like the Steam version is a worthwhile buy, I'll change the review to be positive.","December 22, 2014","false","85.7"," 487 of 643 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","487","643","19","24"

They were me, my brother,my dad,my mom,my weird cousin and my smart sister. But one day I decided to kill my cousin because he was really weird and I didn't really like weird people.\n\n\nThe Town began to be crazy since my cousin died with another guy died too by an organization called "mafia". The first day there are some accusations but nothing serious. The second night I decided to kill a dude who made accusations because said "it's him" with no proof seem suspicious. I always thought my dad had something to hide because he didn't really talk a lot but it's my dad though I prefered my mom.

Of course we have made some decisions in the family to stay together because we normally loved ourselves. But they were left 1 maf and 1 crazy killer so I was very shocked because how can be a serial killer here... So the story continued.\n\n\nBut my brother whispered me "kill Mom at night" and I was like "O_O". So I decided to kill my brother because he wanted me to kill mom  who I loved so much.\n\n\nThe sun rose and there were left me,mom and dad. They were left 1 maf and 1 serial killer. My brother wasn't a serial killer and I don't know why but he wanted to kill mom so I did the necessary. Dad must be the maf,I always knew that in my hearth. Mom must be a serial killer but it's mom. I said to mom that I killed my brother because he wanted to kill her.\n\n\nIt's time to vote who is guilty. Dad was saying a lot that he is married with mom and they supposed to support each other. I said "guilty" to dad because I loved mom and he was maf,I knew it ! Mom said "guilty" despite of dad was saying a lot about "marriage" "together" "family" 'couple" but she prefered me because I was his son and I helped her.\n\n\nDad was hanged. He was really a maf.

I simply can't.\n\nThe reason why I cannot give this game a good review is though once this game had some potential.. It screeched to a halt long ago and hasn't moved forward since. The speed of updates to the gameplay have all but stopped, with the devs preferring to make cosmetic skins and maps referencing other media rather than balance the wonky game that lies before us.\nThe Community for the most part is utterly toxic, with most random lobbies being nearly unplayable with the amount of game-throwers, rage-quitters or meta-gamers. The only time that I would have found fun is with playing with friends and trying to deceive each other, though even that's worn thin.\n\nCombine this with the devs saying that the game is doing better than ever even though it's statistically false after research, the ways that the staff operate on the games forums and a mountain of other things that I won't go into..

Unless a better method of dealing with game throwers and cheaters is devised, the game will continue to suffer from its inherant flaws.","April 28","false","21.6"," 70 of 93 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","70","93","3","0"

I've played this game on the browser version since July 2014, and have loved it since. I recently got the Steam version, which is essentially the same thing but gives you $5 worth of Town Points. Basically, you're paying for the average $5 TP purchase, and the same game but on the Steam platform.\n\nI love the game in general, and I recommend buying it or playing it on the browser. It's a very fun game and if you're into strategy, this is a must. Games usually last around 15 to 25 minutes, and are extraordinarly fun. I play a quick game almost everyday. There's a few Game Modes, including the new Ranked mode which is in beta. The basics of the game is that there's 3 sides: Town, Mafia, and Neutral. You don't know what anyone's role or side is, and you go off of assumptions and your abilities if your role has them. Town has to lynch/kill all of the evil roles, Mafia has to kill anyone who isn't a Witch/Mafia, and as for Neutral, that varies. You have to rely on strategy, and a bit of luck to win. All of the roles are balanced, none of them are OP or underpowered, and there's new roles coming out soon.","February 22, 2015","true","637.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","31","34","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/334230/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Town of Salem is a Strategic Elimination game that's set the the town of, well, Salem, back when the witch trials were very much alive.\n\nThis was a browser game in the past for quite some time, but December 15th is when it's mark on Steam came along. I played the browser version pretty extensively, and it's a very fun game to play because the outcome solely depends on player interaction and decisions.\n\nSee, you have these various roles, all with different alliances. Townies try and work together to survive and find out who the bad guys are. The mafia are their own group, trying to eliminate anyone who isn't them. And then the neutrals are people trying to achieve their own goal, neither with townies nor mafia. 15+ roles exist in the game, and they can all have a huge outcome on any game.\n\nWhat's the catch? You have no idea who is what, so you need to use your smarts and think about whether to trust the people you're with or not. Each day, there's a discussion, then there's voting. If one person is voted to be lynched, they have a chance to defend themselves, then the town decides whether that person is guilty or innocent. The game then transitions to night, where the action happens. People can be stabbed, moved, killed, distracted, just about anything can happen at night, as careful as you may be. The game ends when either the Townies or Mafia wins (Neutrals are rare cases.)\n\nThis is why I like this game so much. Like I said, it depends heavily on human interaction, which is what keeps every game fresh and alive. You're always given a random role at the start of a new game. You can pick classic mode where there's a set list of roles, and all 15 players fufill one, or you can do "All Any" where you don't know what roles exist, and that makes it an even bigger mystery.\n\nOverall, Town of Salem is an awesome game to play just for the suspensefulness and the fresh variety with every game, I really recommend this game.","December 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","1"

They do not know how to run a community-driven game.\n\n- There are a number of problems with the mechanics of the game (which they have received many suggestions to fix) but updates to the game balance are almost non-existant\n- They added a ranked mode but the ELO system is broken and it barely works.\n- Rules that can get your account banned if broken are not communicated, just hidden away in the ToS\n- The devs choose to focus their resources on updates nobody wants (physical card games, cosmetics like skins and pets, etc).\n- They do not take constructive criticism well.\n- There is a forum for suggestions and feedback but they almost never even acknowledge the posts, much less implement anything in-game.\n- They take things personally and get insulted. They hold grudges against users they see as nay-sayers and there is a feeling that some of the users are a bit elitist and there is favoritism at play.\n- They have had 2 kickstarters and a 3rd is planned for the physical card game. They still haven't met the goals of earlier kickstarters and it's hard to imagine their profits are being used appropriately.\n- There is a problem with some of the players that they seem unable to deal with (game throwing, leaving while alive, etc)\n\nBottom line: The idea of this game is amazing, but it's basically just an online version of Mafia or Werewolf. If someone were to make and manage it properly, it could be a wonderful, unique multiplayer experience requiring strategy and manipulation. As it stands, don't bother. Just use their free website to play until you get sick of the BS too.","April 17","false","81.4"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kupsy/recommended/334230/","Kupsy","Kupsy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kupsy/","159 products in account","Pros:\n\n\n•It is actually an entertaining game. If the stars align and you have a run of good towns, you can have lots of fun with them all and end up wasting hours wondering how to be the best damn Jester you can be.\n\n•The graphics suit the game and it looks rather pretty, especially if you have a town of people with different skins.\n\n•It runs well, on steam at least. When I used to play it from a web client it had lag issues.\n\nCons:\n\n\n•You can actually play it for free on a web browser, though you end up with more advertisements and possibly more lag.\n\n•For me, there are four big problems with this game right now, one of which is the scrolls. When you buy the game on steam, you've paid money, so you expect to get a fair game and a stab at all the roles, right? Nope. Thanks to people using scrolls, I've been stuck with crap roles all day today, to the point of getting the same one three times in a damn row, and it gets really disheartening but I don't want to be pushed into a microtransactions battle...\n\n•Leavers. See, even when I did get a crap role I'd still stick a game out and play it the best I could, but it's hard to actually get a good game in when people are allowed to just quit when they get a role they don't like. They need to change how this works, make it so that if people leave a game they have to wait a certain time until they can play again or something, because today I had 5 people leave on the first night. Two of whom were Mediums...\n\n•Bad players.. So you got a role you like and people didn't leave? Well then you're just gonna have the perfect game now, right? Maybe... See, most of the time you end up with people who play a role stupidly (earlier a retributionist brought back a bodyguard. Then the jailor executed the bodyguard), people who throw games for a friend or just to be an idiot (earlier I was in the mafia, one of the mafia members quit and outed all of the mafia in his will), sometimes people will just plain want to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (I don't feel like I need an example here, welcome to the internet), and sometimes people will play together sitting next to each-other irl and just plain cheat (earlier there was a sherrif who somehow INSTANTLY knew all the mafia, from day 2. They even admitted to it later, and told people in the mafia "please don't kill my friend")... In a game in which the multiplayer IS THE GAME, you'd hope reports would have more effect against these people, because at the moment there seems to be no deterrent and they get away with ruining games.\n\n•Last, but by no means least, ads popping up. Really? REALLY? I already BOUGHT a game that's FREE, and you're still going to throw adverts at me? Sorry, but that's poor. Please please please disable this for steam players, we've already contributed, we've done enough.\n\n\ntl;dr - I can't recommend this right now due to difficulty getting a good town without a load of leavers, throwers, cheaters, adverts popping up, and being almost constantly stuck with bad roles which I can do nothing about without spending money. I would suggest playing it online from the browser first, and if you feel like buying points for the game, then you might as well buy it here, as you get points in the bundle and it does run smoother in my opinion.\nJust be aware that even though you buy the game, other peoples microtransactions and nonsense can still screw you over.","February 19","false","155.9"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","58","80","2","18"

(If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan.

Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

However it is rather poorly executed. The game suffers from a huge lack of balancing especially in Ranked. NK and Mafia have such a hard time in winning in it.\n\nThe other main gripe is how much advertising is in the game for microtransactions. I don't mind paying for a game, but when there is a free version and you going to still flash up with 'pay real money for this bundle' it get's annoying. The points are also a grind to earn to actually get things legitimately with ingame currency.\n\nOther than that it is just simpily a social deduction game which seems that most competitors in ranked now have been dropped on the head a few times. Examples - Mayor decided to kill someone who was confirmed on their side, Mafia chooses to kill at a pointless and risky time has the target swapped and kills his own guy and throws the game.\n\nThe investigator results are a bit unfair for the mafia as one is a rare role, easily confirmed, or the godfather meaning they are always lynched. Another one is a role which is confirmed kill and a mafia.\n\nI would honestly recommend something like Secret Hitler/Palpatine on Table Top Simulator right now as is. I understand that they cannot change the community on a game like this so they don't troll or do stupid things, it is shame but it is a burden bore by all multiplayer games.","May 7","false","144.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"

It's addicting, I don't even know why.\n\nGameplay revolves around lie and deceit, sometimes on trust, but expect that trust to be shattered on random occasions. As such, game's sometimes filled with hatred, foul language and slanderous remarks, as such it's the nature of the game. Use every caution when playing with teens. Thankfully there's a filter and report function for deterring such toxicity.\n\nTo win, you need to see your role and objectives, then act accordingly. More often than not, this requires plenty of experience on examining people's behavior and try to adapt or manipulate them to get your goal done. While it seems easy, in reality it's not. You will see people's reaction very different than you have hoped, thus failing your objective. There are bunch of roles to learn, ranging from good roles e.g Jailor, Medium to badasses (is that even a word?) e.g Mafia, Serial Killer. The roles contradict each others, heck even good guy can kill good guy in chaos, making it confusing. Logic is necessary before you judge.\n\nIt's recommended to read the roles carefully and check the wiki every now and then if you get lost somehow.\n\nThere are basically two game modes, normal (fun sessions) or ranked (oh-so-damn serious sessions). You need to get certain threshold to unlock the ranked match, which is expected  as thorough knowledge of the game is necessary so you don't ruin others' experience during ranked match.\n\nThis version of Town of Salem on Steam is coded on Adobe AIR of which naturally has different issue than, say, outdated graphic/sound drivers. The most common complaint is the inability to even launch the game due to Adobe AIR issue. I honestly think they should've coded this with different engine/programming language. However, due to low requirements, even toasters can run the game. I've had success launching the game on Intel HD-based machine myself.\n\nSome other annoying issues for me personally are:\n- inability to minimize the game completely, as it runs on borderless window that can't be minimized. Can be forced into background/inactive window, but that's all.\n- You'll also get kicked if you're AFK in normal menu (not in a match with other players) something that I can't understand myself.\n- Also, there are random disconnects that force you to restart the game because you stuck in one menu and unable to open, say, lobby or join match.\n- Soundtracks are repetitive and boring.\n- Microtransactions are shoved on your face. While it's not required to play the game or give any advantage whatsoever, it is annoying to see the pop up every time.\n\nSalem has the data saved on cloud/server-based, so you won't have to worry about your game data unless they shut down the server. You just need to take care of your Steam login and you're set. And to date, the game's still being developed. As of today, I read the news post about new role update about Vampire/Vampire Hunter, which is good knowing it'll add another layer of strategies and... lies.\n\nA bit note of game's replayability - it's very high. Although the mechanic stays the same from session to session, it's not similar experience as you're dealing with different people every time on different sessions (unless you're playing with all friends). Good stuff really.\n\nNow for pricing, for me it seems to be appropriately priced. This Steam version contains in-game coins equal to 5 USD, while the free version (browser version) does not offer such. I got the copy from recent Bundlestars' bundle, though, very cheap around 5 USD for like 9 games.\n\nSo, while generally I can appreciate and recommend this game, there are several negative points that must be addressed above. Overall, it will be fun session should you try to play the game.\n\n7.5/10\n\nNow I'm off to kill some big bad guys... and Townies. Yes I'm that good guy and jerk alike.","October 17, 2015","true","140.0"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

It's worth it just to support the developers who made this game.

So you don't have to wait ages to find a game.\n\nSome negative things:\n- There's no button to quit a game when there's no point staying.\n- No longer supports login via Facebook :(\n- Doesn't remember your account details for auto-login.\n\nThese negative things are obviously all insignificant to the positive things.\n","December 15, 2014","true","12.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherealsage/recommended/334230/","etherealsage","Acanthus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherealsage/","145 products in account","As a preface, I went into this game knowing exactly what I was in for. I knew the mafia game, I knew (some of) the roles, looked up the rest, I knew that my $5 was more to support the steam release and that I didn't get anything more than $5 of in game currency for cosmetics, I knew that an online version of this would lead to certain issues such as cheating, toxic players, and/or (most commonly) just people leaving/afking. Surprisingly, the game design shows that it's well aware of its own learning curve and provides an opportunity to read all the roles from the main page as well as providing you with any and all information you need about your role in game (for the forgetful and the lazy, I guess).  I like the game, its foundation, and its execution. It does have flaws, however, and I'll explain them below along with its merits.\n\nThings I like:Roles\nThere are no roles with no point. Every role on every side has SOME kind of special ability or a special win condition that either adds to the depth or intrigue of the game. The exception is survivor, which is exactly what it sounds like. You're simply not rewarded for interacting as a survivor other than to say you're a survivor. A lot of people (in game) rail on the town roles, but I actually find them the most interesting and varied. And the more I play the game, the more I find a use for "that role" that seemed so bad before. (Except Disguiser. Mechanically, you have to hope someone was bad for that role to work. Or you need an accompanying janitor.)\nThe whisper system\nWhen you first play, the whisper system seems almost out of place and like an obvious way to stand out. People who actually utilize it are among the strongest percentage of players. EVIL players able to get in on those networks are among the best liars in the game. Even if you have the presence of mind to try and nip things in the bud by attacking those who start the network, you actually run a huge risk because a protective role with the same presence of mind as you could make you waste a turn or potentially kill you. Every play you make is an exercise in risk/reward management.\nThis is an intellectual game\nThis game is an exercise in a large number of intellectual skills, but there are 4 big ones. Psychology, politics/social skills, deductive reasoning, and ESPECIALLY inductive reasoning (in the early game, which matters quite a bit, you will almost never have absolute proof). Honorable mention to metagaming though, as that's still a strong skill, but not a core one. Of course there are people who play that are only good at a portion of or none of these (and players who fake that they are this), and these players are something of wild cards to their side and the enemy. Most often they're harmful to their side, other times, well, crazy stuff happens (especially when they're good at metagaming, rofl).\nThere is no luck beyond that which a given player is willing to allow\nEverything that happens can be traced to choice. If a bad outcome happens for your side, you, and your team made more mistakes than your opposition. If someone made a "lucky" choice on faith, yeah, okay, but he still chose to make that choice, not some random number god. This actually cuts down on a lot of frustration for me personally. I almost never play flawlessly and lose. This is also because I almost never play flawlessly. If I lose, I can almost always point to something I could have done differently that could have changed the result. The exception is when people flat out do not listen to you. It happens, but each game is like 12 minutes long. It's easy to move past.\nMixed Bag:Realism (lack thereof)\nFrom a code standpoint, everything that happens make logical sense. They are not realistic, however, and events that happen have to stretch your imagination (to the realm of magic and the fantastical sometimes, such as tricking a player into shooting themselves as a transporter). However, I think it actually adds to the game's overall depth. The only reason this is here is because I'm aware that other players may not agree. Still, this gets a thumbs up from me.\nFlaws:Let's start with the elephant in the room. The graphics suck and will always suck.\nBut let's be honest, graphics don't matter at all. It's just icing. It just so happens that the icing is bland. The main reason you and I would be here is the mental challenge and the immersion. It does both jobs very well.\nSecond elephant: Trolling, leaving, cheating\nIt happens. There are 2 devs and a bare-bones report system. They will forever have a backlog even after they design a leaverbuster and spam detector/preventor. I do not begrudge them this, however. It's not AS big of a problem as people make it out to be (the leaving is, the rest isn't).\nThe UI\nIt's clunky and sometimes unfriendly, but intuitive enough to get the job done after you realize some initial quirks. I have a feeling this will see work someday in the distant future.\nCustom game lobbies\nCustom game mode is actually my favorite mode for numerous reasons. The down side is that you have the same matchmaking as every other queue. This leads to frustration for people who want to experiment or do something random/for funsies because the inital host is ALWAYS random. This actually doesn't affect me personally (because those rare times I'm the host, I still understand game balance enough that people accept whatever deviations from the norm I put forward). This can also lead to a war to /repick to a host who will implement something sane. Also people occasionally try to leave and rejoin at hyper speed so they get put into the same queue over and over, making EVERYONE wait. (No, people tend to not troll this way. Yet. They're just too oblivious to let someone take their slot by waiting 5-10 seconds.)\nRuns on Adobe Air\nI hate Adobe Air. But I like the game. But I hate Ado- aw ♥♥♥♥ it. But seriously, I've never been a big fan of the program, and any limitations in feature implementation in the future can be pointed to it, but the game DOES run as well as it can thus far.","January 26, 2015","true","146.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

I liked the game and bought the game on Steam but I regret doing so. Ranked queue is glitched and gets stuck once timer reaches zero; which means you have to restart the game, sign back in, and join the queue from the beginning.\n\nBuying the game does not disable pop-up ads for in-game cosmetics! What the hell? I should be able to at least turn it off. If you want to put a promotional banner for new content on the front page, fine. But pop-up advertisements are NOT OKAY.\n\nUpdated 05/20/2016: This game has been flooded with...let's say less mentally capable people. Devs paid Youtubers to promote the game and now ranked mode is filled with people who can't reason simple things out. It took me a month to realize that this game is beyond repair. The devs are too busy raising money on kickstarter for a board game and refusing to create a ranked mode that actually requires knowledge and skill to participate in.\n\nShort version: fun game to play with others, but don't bother spending money to buy it on Steam.

But let´s be real You pay 5 Euros, not only for the game, but you get the equal amount of in game money worth of what you pay, which is a good deal from my perspectiv. The reason behind it, is that it can take a long time to get in game money, for buying new skins or caracters, but with buying the steam version, not only do you get some money for new things, you also get a more convinient version of the game, since (atleast in my opinion) steam is easily accesed. But with that out of the way, i think that the game is worth buying, and more so if you have some friends or know some people who might be intrested in playing a game with you over a voice calling program and having a great time together. Just remember the game is not perfect in the 1.0.0 version, since it does not auto-login into the game in the steam version, and there is some few bugs here and there, but it is not something that is gamebreaking in my opinion. So yeah, Buy the game if you feel like supporting the developers and get some in game money in the process.

The major problem with the game is people who leave at the start, because they don't like their role.  In addition there are a lot of people who skype or otherwise share info outside of the game.  It makes it frustrating for the real players.  The addition of Ranked mode cuts both of these down tremendously.

You can easily play this game for free through your web browser, and you'll be connected with paid players too. Which means anyone can easily troll and break rules and ruin the game for serious players. If you pay for this game, you are going to be confronted with a lot of stupid players, trolls, and  newbies.

Each player receives a role from a made up list of 15 out of 30 total roles in the game. Actual mechanical options of each role are actually limited compared to blockbuster strategy games, but still they are very distinctive and important. The way you choose to interact the game will actually impact your chance to win and there is a high skill cap despite the limited mechanics. Still taking a casual aproach can be very fun.\n\nThere is a free version of the game which is equal to the steam one, but just because its free doesnt mean its not worth 5 dolars.\n\nEven if you like the concept of a slow paced different game like this, there are as of now 2 turn offs that Id like to point:\n\n- No Ranked Play: According to the developers this is the next thing being implemented shortly. Still this means that as an average player you will face almost every game people less commited than you (including a big amount of quitters) and ocasionally games where everyone is more commited than you and will become upset at your aproach.\n\n- No hard option to browse custom games or to create a custom room: Custom rooms are where the real games happen. This means sometimes you will want to play a balanced, advanced standard game and the host will either try to make something very unusual or unbalanced. Or you will be looking for a unusual game and will have to hop in and out of rooms for minutes (you can only join a new room once the previous is full of 15 people) until you have the luck to be host or find something you like.\n\nStill a fantastic game which already delivers what it promises and can only improve and as far as i know a new, very good concept.\n\n9/10 Would spend 10 minutes trying to host a custom game again to have someone quit on the 1st turn on a balance imprescindible role and ruin it for everyone. Many times.","December 18, 2014","true","39.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

However, I've been unable to join any ranked games. Client disconnects after about 30 seconds of staying on home screen without joining any games (some culling of inactive connections, I presume - just have to restart for it to work again) - not an issue in non-ranked play, but queues for ranked are long enough for disconnection to occur, so it can never join a lobby. Might just be a very specific issue only I have, idk.\n\nThe game itself is quite good and can be a lot of fun, but not with such a playerbase. I hoped it would get better some time after launch, when those who have more interest in trolling and derping around than in the actual game quit, but nope. Still the same, perhaps even worse.\n\nIt's still recommended if you have enough friends with some free time to play only with them. But not otherwise.

This is a game where everyone is on an equal level. There are no overpowereds or underpowereds there is just you, a group of people and your wits. Town of Salem is an inspired system that brings a popular party game beyond it's humble beginnings and creates a truly spectacular and frequently updated system where you and your friends can have the most fun playing off against each other and still come out the end laughing. The aim of the game is simply to fulfill the goials of one of many roles either Saving the town from the menaces of the mafia or becoming the monster within the town and making the peasants bow at your feet. Alternatively you can become a murderous killing machine who wants everyone dead or be a poor innocent caught up in the crossfire who wants nothing more than to survive. Or maybe you just want to find the truth of who you are. The Roles within can consume hours of fun working out strategies using or even being against these roles.\n\nThe game also benefits from caring and considerate Developers who have proven time and again they have the communities best intrests at heart with kickstarter reward fulfilled at every turn and promises that are kept and an undeniable desire to make the game better.\n\nTown of Salem is a truly amazing game that deserves it's recognition by far. Already it has turned the intrest of many big name and small youtubers alike. Everyone should play this game at least once. It's one of the very best indie games out there.\n","December 15, 2014","true","8.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you enjoy Werewolf or Mafia, then this is one of those perfect games to sit back and relax to. Money has become signifigantly easier to obtain recently even though its still pretty hard to make quick cash but to be honest, it's not like cash provides anything non-aethstic. Also the creators are very dedicated and have been continously updating and improving the game since I've first joined it months ago and hold their players in very high regards. Each game should take about 20 minutes, so plan accordingly. Remember that if you leave a game early, you dont get the smaller loss reward which is better than no reward.\n\nNow, what's different about the steam version?\n\nThe main thing that you get with the steam version is simply the $5.00 town points for buying the game and the lack of advertisements for owning the game. One VERY noticeable difference is that the Steam version runs much faster and much more smoother than the browser version and has little to no lag which has been very beneficial to me and has prevented me from returning to the Browser version. Some people are asking how to leave a game early and it's almost the same way as the browser version, click ESC to get out of full screen mode, close the game client, and load it back up. The creators do not have a back to home button in either version and it is something they are working on.

I've heard from a friend that ToS has existed for a long time, but thanks to the recent popularity increase from Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Lordminion777 and plenty of other YouTubers, the game has sadly devolved into a free-for-all cluster[bleep] from hell.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love to play this game with friends on skype, working with (and sometimes against) them to achieve victory, and I really enjoy playing it, but the enjoyment is usually killed off by the community and their... "ways".\n\nI got the Steam Version anyway, even after playing the Free Browser Version, and I do not regret the purchase. But sadly, the community has devolved the game to what looks like a group of 6-15 players in the age range of around 8-18 who will scream at you if you even talk sometimes. The Last Will and Death Note can be abused to add things like "GO F*** YOUR MOM YOU PIECE OF S***" (Bleeped out so Steam won't hate on me). ToS has also become a "random kill" style game too, where if ONE person votes any random person, an entire town will turn against them. 98% of the time without proof.\n\nIf I had anything to say to the devs, it would be this:\nYou have a great game, I love it. But it can do with extras like a Censor Filter (Perhaps a toggle feature) that'll Censor chat/wills/death notes from the BS that the community brings, perhaps try to add punishments for attempting to bypass when the filter is enabled.\n\nAs for the RDM Killing, there's not much that can be done about that, but again, the community ruins it with Randoms. Not the first time I've seen a friend get killed for the *sole* reason that they're a brony. (A friend even revealed themself as a Mayor, and the entire town voted against, because they were a Brony)","March 1, 2015","false","170.4"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","46","83","10","7"

Why? because if you have never played a live chat MP game where paranoia and investigation (and ultimately survival) is key then you need to try this. So grab a random role and try to hide it away from others - until it's time to step up - or not - depending on your role and situation.\n\nI suppose the biggest brilliance of this game is that it overcomes easily the '12yo XDXD le troles bringing the bantz' because a) they dont want to play this as they are the underdogs quickly. Players appear semi-mature atleast b) The more stupid you act the more likely you get random lynched which gives more time for others to form the real game ending.\n\ni'd say this game is almost immune to trolling as fooling others is the name of the game. Gamethrowing aka people quitting is not much of a trouble either because even if half the people quit it still doesnt matter - epic and surprising endings are aplenty as games are decided in the last turns usually.","October 10, 2015","true","31.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/recommended/334230/","MeltingComet","龍 Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/","329 products in account","Town of Salem brings the crazy role-countering party game “Mafia” onto browsers/digital screens, and despite its drab presentation, proves to be dastardly sinister fun.\n\nNOTE: You can play the game for free on browser at the game’s site.\nPros:Dynamic classes that all counter other classes or play major roles in the game.\nComplex Features; Normally Mafia’s gameplay is simplistic to keep it understandable as a party game, but they went full out in this game, with tons of abilities, new classes + the mix of Werewolf, Neutral Classes, and Last Wills.\nThe Emergent Interaction with other players is fantastic and fun.\nNetcode is done very well; No matter how poor the connection I was able to play the game and interact with everybody just fine.\nNitpicks:No Private Lobbies, which I think is disappointing because having a full group of friends together would really make this establish itself as a party/LAN game.\nGeneric as hell music. I just ended up muting it eventually.\nSteam Version does not save settings; when I boot the game it doesn’t know that I previously switched it to windowed. Really annoying.\nCons:Drab and boring presentation; as a flash game, it can run on a toaster, but it doesn’t excuse it from it’s menus being unintuitive and not-so-good-looking and it’s visual artstyle from looking so cheap.\nMicrotransactions aren’t a big deal since the only purchasable items are really cosmetics, but the class scrolls are a horrible item that is either incredibly useless or unfair, contradicting what makes the game so good.\nFriends System is glitched and broken, usually doesn’t update or send notifications to others, making it frustrating to organize events with friends.\nThe Review\nTown of Salem is very simple to explain to those who often go out on parties. It’s basically Mafia/Werewolf, except as a video game! It takes the advantage of complex mechanics (that can easily be done in games versus as a party game) to elevate Town of Salem as a much more dynamic game. There are a lot more countering between the roles, which means there’s a whole lot more to keep up with. This is what makes Town of Salem a much more fresh experience.\n\nThere’s so many things to keep track of too. You’ve got escorts that can distract players, jailors that can interrogate others and execute them, there’s just so much going on. There’s Last Wills, a Serial Killer role, neutral roles that can get caught in the crossfire, unique Town roles besides just “Citizen”, and so much more. If you plan on playing it’s competitive matchmaking, you have to keep every aspect of the game in mind.\n\nAdd Werewolf in the mix, and you get pure insanity. That doesn’t mean you have to play with the Werewolf roles, however. Town of Salem allows for custom matches where you can pick the roles, which will definitely make for a lot more creativity and unique game modes to pop up.\n\nHow ever, it has to be said that it’s presentation is really, really bad. If it’s loading times, far from serviceable graphics and bad UI makes it a lot less appealing. While the loading times aren’t as bad as the browser version, and the graphics can be more of a nitpick at this point, the horrible UI can not be excused. It takes so many clicks to do actions that could had easily be cut down, the various windows for the game are placed all over, and the UI while in a game completely clutters the screen. It’s a good thing you can do something about the in-game one though, but those with low monitor resolutions are not going to have a good time.\n\nIt’s visuals are honestly subpar, but it can be excused for it being a flash game (Why it is a flash game in the first place will forever confuse me). However, what I found really grating was it’s cheap and horrible music/sound design. It’s music was generic as hell, and the sound effects were cheesy and annoying at best. It’s easier if you just tune into your own music while playing.\n\nThe microtransactions generally consist of mainly cosmetics, so it’s not that big of a deal. However, the BS that is the scrolls are completely obnoxious. Purchasing scrolls allow you to get a higher chance of a certain role, which completely ruins the RNG factor that is picking the roles in Mafia. It stoops the gameplay very low, and it’s really sad that people will have less of a chance to pick roles people have put scrolls towards.\n\nHowever, in practicality, the scrolls end up actually being a total waste of coins, because you’ll probably not get the role anyway. It basically turns what is a game-breaking item into a useless item at the same time.\n\nSo let’s talk about organizing the game as a party game. It can work, but it’s ultimately a huge disappointment. There’s no private lobbies, meaning if you have less than 15 people, you will have to play with randoms. Due to the messy UI and bad friend system getting in the way, sending up lobbies can become a hectic mess. Sometimes, it doesn’t update whatever or not a player is online, meaning sending them an invite is virtually impossible.\n\nThe Steam version (besides loading times and the fact that it isn’t free) is fine. You get some in-game currency and better loading times since you’re running on a client versus a browser, but if you don’t want to pay for an experience like this, you really don’t have to get it on Steam. Also, it does not save any of it’s settings on the Steam version, which means I always have to toggle “No Fullscreen” and “Mute Music” settings when I get the chance.\n\nBut besides that, what can I say? It’s Mafia. Despite the disappointing aspects of the game, I still find it to be a solid time killer and definitely a complex and entertaining game. Tarnation indeed.\n\nTL;DR - Although disappointing some aspects, Town of Salem is still a fun and very playable game.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","March 22","true","15.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Because of doing such a thing, we get 9 year olds who think they're as smart as Dr. Mckay or Batman. Trying to keep your cover as an important townie role becomes more difficult as time goes on, seeing how the town believes the kid who can't spell "Investigator" right.

One of the best and funniest party games I've played in a long while. It's based on the Starcraft 2 mod Mafia, and it is set in an alternative universe of Salem, where a group of 15 players must lynch or kill those who are not on their side, there is the Townies, the Mafia, Serial Killers, Survivors, Arsonists, Witches and Werewolves (Survivors, Arsonists, Witches and WWs are only in the Custom gamemode, and Classic can only have 1 SK.)\n\nThe townies have to gather clues from previous deaths, other players, your class ability and guessing in order to hang or kill all the Mafia and the Serial Killer. The Mafias must kill all the townies and hang the SK, while the SK has to lynch the Mafias and Townies but he can kill on his own.\n\nThe game has a nice artwork and charm to it, and the player characters range from fitting and nice, to advertising like a shameless ♥♥♥♥♥. The houses you can have ranges from classical houses that usually were built during the time of Salem to a ♥♥♥♥ing Balloon house. The pets range from faries to Doge. Yes, the meme.\n\nThe players can be from very clever to just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and roleplaying racists. The devs are planning to add in a ranked mode which should get rid of most of the annoying people, so that's really great, because being a Medium and having dead players quit is the ♥♥♥♥ing worst.\n\nThat said, play it on the browser then if you like it? Come over here and give over your 5$ for 1300 coins, and support the devs.","January 16, 2015","true","21.2"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","14","23","8","2"

I mean c'mon, why do we HAVE to close the game via Alt+F4?\n- When you get asked if you want to share an achievement or a won game on facebook this works perfectly fine in the website version. However, in the Steam client version the window doesn't pop up, which denies one 25 gold per share.\n- Only Full Screen mode.\n- Updates have slowed down already since the release of this version.\n\nConclusion:\nThis version has it's problems, but I'm not here to rate the version, I'm here to rate the game.\nThe game itself is pretty darn funny and enjoyable, I can only recommend you to play it, but preferably for free on the website. If you'd like to support the team go ahead and purchase ingame coins or donate, but I wish I would have waited to buy the client since it just looks clunky and unfinished.\n\nEDIT:\nExit button was added, seems like they solve problems now :)","December 24, 2014","true","24.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Game was originally based on a web version, and still holds to the same UI.  While it's nice that all my friends don't have to pay 5 bucks to play with me, it doesn't feel so much an in-game menu as it does a popped out webpage.  Not a huge problem, just not very aesthetically pleasing.\n\n2.  Game was originally free, and there seems to still be a very big push to convince (paying customers mind you) to buy extra coins.  By that I mean the speed at which you earn in-game currency is abominable.  I've bought 2 customization items in all the time that I've been playing this game.  2.  In 25 hours.  For a game I payed for.  Seems pretty dumb to me, just saying.\n\n3.  Very little moderation.  While I personally don't mind profanity, I'd really have liked to play this with my younger siblings, but I'm not going to expose them to a community that casually calls eachother racist and homophobic slurs.  My mother would kill me if I did that.\n\nThat being said, the game is fantastic.  I don't think I've enjoyed a game this much since I first started playing Dark Souls.

Best part in playing with friends is lieing about your role to get them to put their guard down, the imediately killling them.\nNote: Dont use TS, Skype, etc. to cheat though, thats strictly against the code of conduct.\n\n\nSteam or Browserversion?\n\nThis seems to be an active topic, and all I can say to this is that you do not need to buy this game on steam.\nBuying it only adds $5 worth of Town Points to your account. By buying this game for $5 your not paying for the game, but some bonus townpoints. (Townpoints are the in-game currency)\n\n25 Townpoints can be ottained every day, for your first win.\nWith additional town points for gaining achivements with your given role.\n\nI would suggest however, if you want to try a few games, take some time to sign up for an account at...\n\nhttp://www.blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/\n\nDo a few classic games, get to know the some of the basic roles, then, if you feel like you want that new character skin or maybe even a pet or two, buy the steam version.\n\n\nPros:\n-Runs much smoother with less loading times compared to the browser\n-$5 worth of town points!\n-Steam Achivements!\n-Backstabbing is fun!\n\nCons:\n-Uses adobe air...for some odd reason\n-Requires a brain, for some that may be a bit hard, I know.\n\n\nTl;DR- Buy it for the backstabbing.","December 19, 2014","true","23.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This role is a town friendly role that can take matters into their own hands and shoot someone. I accidently shot another town member and my character took their own life.

Im not as clever as those folks, so here it is. Town of Salem is a wonderful text based game with lies and murder. Half the people are lying to you. The other half is trying to convince you that they are who they say they are. Its a blast. I most often play it alone. But you can play it with your pals.\n\nIts best when playing with friends to tell eachother your names but not your roles. Since they will ususally hear your keyboard and find out what your name is rather quickly. Tradeing information outside of the game, or "Skypeing" is not fun for the people playing including yourself. Along with the fact that any player who has played WAY to much like me will notice in a heartbeat what your doing. The actaul visual interface is not even nessesairy, but its a fun way to add more debth to the game.\n\nI suggest learning the game by playing the game mode "Custom Any" (Custom Game Mode -> All Any.) its named that for good reason. I won't go into it but you will find out.\n\nHonestly I have payed A LOT more for games I havent liked. I paid $5.00 for this game. Since that day I have had SOO much fun playing this. Weather its a binge sesson of 10 games or im at work and I pull it up while im sitting on hold.\n\nI hope you give this game a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vai90/recommended/334230/","vai90","vai90","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vai90/","1032 products in account","TL;DR\nI highly recommend this game!\n\nIntroductionThis review of a friend of mine drew my attention toward this game. Having played the similar StarCraft II mod "Mafia", I was intrigued and tried it out on BlankMediaGames' website HERE[blankmediagames.com] for free.\n\nAfter a whole night of playing it, I decided I had to buy it. It was incredibly fun.\n\nBuying Town Of Salem on Steam supports the developers and grants you $5 worth of the in-game currency (gold) with which you can buy cosmetic items. You can also earn more gold by completing certain tasks within the game, which I would say is a fair business model.\n\nAbout the gameTown Of Salem is a multiplayer-only game based on the party game Mafia[en.wikipedia.org]. It features a team of townsfolk who have to work together to find out who the evil people in the town are and have to get rid of them by hanging them or killing them off in various other ways. The tricky part is that the townsfolk don't know their allies, while members of the Mafia know exactly who they are working with. The serial killer is essentially a lone wolf and tries to kill everyone else.\n\nThere are fun alternative modes with more roles, several of them evil or neutral, which can make the game much easier or harder, depending on the size of the teams and the distribution of roles.\n\nThere is so much more to this game that I would love to write about in great detail, but for the sake of getting to the point I'm gonna cut it short a bit here and will move on to other aspects now. Besides, the game's description on the store page has got you covered on more details about the gameplay, so check it out. :)\n\nTechnologyBeing built in Flash Action Script, Town Of Salem's graphics and animations are rather rudimentary. However, this kind of game does absolutely not need advanced graphics and especially not animations, so I suppose anything developed in that area is to be considered a plus.\n\nI haven't encountered any problems with the game's online features/servers so far, so to me those seem to be reliable.\n\nSo what I'm saying is: technologically this game gets the job done, doesn't have major issues and isn't horrible to look at.\n\nConclusionIf you enjoy strategy games based on bluffing, this game is absolutely for you. Bear in mind that it can only be played with other people online and that it almost entirely relies on communication with said people via chat. Personally, this game got me hooked.\n\nThere are a few shortcomings that naturally occur as soon as other people are involved, for example, players leaving the game immediately after finding out they were assigned a role they don't like. This is absolutely not the developers' fault though, but as far as I know, they're working on a solution to encourage people more to keep playing.\n\nI have played Town Of Salem for about 35 hours on Steam thus far (+ at least 5 hours through their website).","May 14, 2015","true","35.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The community is terribly toxic.   If player's behaviors weren't bad enough cheating is currently a issue as well.  It's got so rampent that some groups don't even bother to hide it.  Then there are the trolls that mean to throw the games to ensure your team loses.     15 people per town and almost always you will have one toxic player spamming the chat with your typical racist, sexist, and homophobic nonsense.\n\nDon't buy this game if you really want to play it use the F2P version which lets you play with Steam owners anyways.  This is how the toxic players all play as well so if they get banned they simply come right back.    The  horde of trouble makers is so immense that the developers are making a "trail" system in which the community will police itself by being able to review flagged players in games  and  basically decide if they are guilty or not.    But this just shows how bad the community really is that the developers can't handle it and are passing the responsability to you.    Furthermore once again this won't stop anything as they will come back with new free accounts.      A terribly lazy and flawed plan by the devs.\n\nThis game doesn't deserve your money and I regret giving it mine.","January 28, 2015","false","89.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It was a game to help pass the time between my lectures and actually had some sort of strategic aspect. I mostly played ranked games and they were amazing, After the past few months, however, I have watched ranked play crumble with gamethrowers and spammers. It just isn't fun anymore. The staff do not punish repeat offenders, so the same people continue to spam/throw games on a constant basis (who are also the most active players as of recent)\n\nIt seems as though the staff only care about the money at this point. The lag/DCs are the users fault, because the server "never goes down." Although people have complained about the game lag and DC periods in the middle of games, the staff deny this ever happens and tells the users to "check their connection."\n\nThere is also a lot of back and forth on "rules" of what is and isn't gamethrowing. One minute the staff agrees on a rule, the next they change their minds and say something is no longer gamethrowing. Consistency has ALWAYS been an issue and continues to get worse.\n\nI don't reccomend this game to anyone at this point.","April 3","false","721.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I do like this game but it has some things that need to be notcied.\n\nPROS:\n*Roleplaying, You can pick your own name and you get a different role(or maybe the same sometimes) every game.\n*Skins, You don't have to buy skins to look different, in the option section you can pick from 5-6 defaults.\n*Deception, Tricking players and outsmarting players is somewhat easy.\n*Chat Filter, You can have the option to censor swears others put in the chat.\n*Rage-Childs, You gotta love those kids who rage so hard when they lose.\n*Not Pay-to-play, Note, yes its $5 on steam, but that gives you points ingame for customizations like skins and such. You could just play it on the web browser for free. But those points, don't give you an advantage. They just make you look cooler.\n\nCONS:\n*Slow type lag, Most of the time you'll end up typing, but by the time you finish, you notice the game is still inputing the beginning for the message. Which can cause you to mess up badly. Very rarely you end up with the games where you can type quickly and it inputs it just as quick.\n*Exclusive Chat Filter, It doesn't include racism.\n*Racism, There is a ton of children who rage so much they feel its necessary to call you a Jew, or they feel like its okay to call you a "N" word.\n*Know-It-alls, There are players who think they know it all, and if you try doing your job, you get called a "tryhard." Great example is when you play jester, Your job is clearly marked as "Get the town to lynch you at any means necessary", Key words, "any means necessary." = "Do everything and anything that you can to get it done."\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes I do, it is a fun game.\nPlay with some friends, Trick the town, Murder the town, or Save the town.\nOr perhaps troll the town's medium into thinking there are more mafia in a "all-any" game","July 2, 2015","true","80.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it's worth every penny on Steam. :D\n\nThose who claim they didn't get the 5$ worth of in-game $ probably didn't read or follow the instructions in the notifications that popped up in the screen the second they made a game account.\nThose who claim there are no tutorials... go online and look at the wiki. Or don't, and play a few matches, and learn how to play somewhat adequately that way too. The game's simple enough that it doesn't need too much of a tutorial once you've read the roles list on the wiki.\n\n*edit* In hindsight, feel free to check my games list.

The aim of the game to use your role's abilities to help aid your team to victory. Each session is just as unpredictable as the last one. Personally I would reccomend playing All Any mode (Under the Chaos section) since the roles are randomized and no one knows what roles are game, it makes the game more interesting.\n\nPro and Cons\nPros\n\n1. The game has variety of modes to choose from.\n2. It's easy to play, but takes a while to master.\n3. The game is addictive, fun and competitive.\n4. The game is regularly updated, so the game is kept fresh with new content such as roles, skins, houses etc.\n5. The microtransaction system is good and doesn't unbalance the game.\n\nCons\n\n1. The scrolls system reduces the chances of players getting certain roles unless they purchase some scrolls.\n2. Some players don't stick to their given alignments and favour other people. (Which leads to gamethrowing.)\n3. The report system is rubbish and most rulebreakers don't recieve punishments.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique experience from a game and a enjoyable game. :D","January 11","true","59.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The animations work for this game and I genuinely enjoy them. I'll go further into the animations in the topic "Game Play".\n\n*Hours to complete: ~~~\nIn all of my other reviews this is a topic, so I decided to include it in this one. Why not. This game you can play for infinite hours with out getting bored! Plus, there are loads of achievements on steam for this game; around 200 I believe.\n\n*Story Line: 10/10\nThere's not really a story line to this game, but basically there are three different game modes. Classic, Chaos, and Custom. (We will go into more detail in "Game Play") once you find out what your role is going to be, i.e.. Investigator, your goal is to strategically survive with out being hung, killed by the mafia, or killed by the serial killer. Once you win you get in-game currency that you can use to purchase customizable content for your avatar.\n\n*Game Play: 10/10\nSo this is going to be the most important part for you to fully understand what you're buying, because when I bought this game I had absolutely no clue what I was purchasing. When you load up the game, you are required to hook up your steam account to the game. Once you get through that process, you get to choose whether you want to play Classic, Chaos, Custom mode.\nClassic mode: Every time you play, all of the "roles" you get to play as are always going to stay the same.\nChaos mode: This mode generates a random list of roles to each game so it's constantly changing.\nCustom mode: This game gives the host a chance to set up the roles how ever he/she wants. You can have 4 serial killers in one game if you wanted to!\nThere's also a ranked mode.\nStill with me? After you choose your game type, you can pick a custom name to go by for that game! You can pick your own name to go by, i.e. Josie, or you can make up a fun name to go by! Once you choose your name and the game loads, this is where all the fun happens. You'll be told your role, what your role means, and what you must do to win the game. For explanation purposes let's say you're given the role Investigator (my favorite role). The investigator's job is to investigate each person every night to get a clue as to who is evil in the town. You don't want to tell the town right from the start what your role is because the mafia or serial killer will most likely kill you because you will be able to figure out who they are. Once you figure out someone is evil, you must convince all the other players that the person is evil and must be hung. If you end up being hung or killed at night, it's not a huge deal because you can still win the game even though you died. Being an investigator means you are a good towns person. So if you guys clear out all the evil with in the town, everyone that is good still wins no matter if they're dead or alive. Are you still following? After the game ends you're brought to a screen that shows everyone's Steam name. This is great because if you make in-game friends you can add them! This game is also multiplayer so a bunch of you and your friends can play together, whether they are playing the game in browser or on steam! (visit "Price" for more information on this) On this screen you're also shown your wins/loses/tied games. You'll also notice your currency. You get currency no matter if you win or lose and there's a first win of the day bonus. Your currency is available for you to buy skins for your avatar, buy pets, buy new houses, or buy new animations for when you get hung.\n\n*Price: 10/10\n~~ (7/9/2015) As of today: $4.99\nSo.. Some of you may or may not know but.. The game is actually free. You can play this game for free in a browser. What you're paying $5 for is the steam achievements and support for the devs. This is basically like a donation to them to help evolve the game. They have goals they're trying to accomplish like bringing the game to mobile and creating new customizable content in game. When you do buy this game you are rewarded in game currency automatically so you can buy a skin or something before you even play your first game. If you played this game in browser you would have to play games to get the currency so you don't start off with the money like you would here. Long story short, buying the game is giving them $5 to their gofundme project and helping support them and recieving updates with the game more often.\n\n*Overall:\nI would totally in a heart beat recommend this game to anyone who:\n>Likes casual, simple games\n>Likes steam achievements\n>Likes strategic, detective, killing games\n>Likes to play with friends, make friends, or rage at people\n>MMOs","July 9, 2015","true","134.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(They don't necessarily have to be on Skype but usally people who do this says they are on skype)\n\nThe Sore "Quitters" - In this game people quit usally after they die not realizing that they could still win if their team (Depending if you are in a Costom game or not) wins. (A better chance if they help/trick the Medium. Another reason why they quit is because they simply don't like the role. (I understand if you get the same role over and over and over again but at least try to play along)\n\nThe "Townies" - *Sighs* This is the worst part of The Community,They automatically follow one person opionion without any real evidence acting like they don't have a mind of their own and is the main reason why Mafia/Sk/etc always wins.UPDATE:I GOT LYNCHED BECAUSE MY NAME WAS COOKIE!!!!!!\n\nThe Obvious - This inculdes people like Jesters and sometimes All of the Mafia vote someone guilty when they are obviously innocent which makes the game really easy.\n\n/repick - These are the people you will encounter mostly in Costom game lobbies they repick the Lobby Leader if you suit their "needs" perfectly or make one simple mistakes in the choosing this is unfair for mostly new players because mostly they get picked.I recommed if you are a new player just stick with normal until you get better at the game.\n\nThere are many more types of Trolls in this game but these are the ones I encountered the most.This is a really good game don't get me wrong but I wish The Community was a little better.","February 16, 2015","true","111.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","1"

Basically it's a kind of fun social/party game where each player gets a role as a town member, a mafia member or a serial killer role, and the objective of the game is to get rid of every player not in your faction. This is done mainly by chatting with the other players, sharing clues about their roles and accusing them for being evil. This in turn can lead the accused to be lynched during the day or bum tarnationed at night.\n\nThat's pretty much the main gist of the game and it includes so many variables that make this game pure genius. The only complain I can think of is that this game really feels like it should be F2P since it's a fairly simple browser game and it even has an in-game store where you can buy cosmetics and other kinds of different flummery. Nonetheless that doesn't make the game bad by any means and it's only like 6€ in the store anyways and I'd say it's worth every cent.

Why should i pay for it when i can play for free?"\nWell, first of all the servers are 10x faster than the brower version\n\nEvery single game you play is different, especially when you get roles like Serial Killer or a Mafia Member\nOn the other hand you can play boring and 1 time use roles like Medium or Retributionist (Ret. can bring one person back to life (But most of the time they get killed right after again))\n\nOnce you play 50 games, you can play ranked which i havent gotten to try out yet but im getting there\n\nTo sum all of it up ill do Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n- Variety\n\n- 3 Different game modes\n\n- 31 roles\n\n- you can play with friends (create a lobby)\n\n- Worth the 4.99 (Would recommend buying on sale ;))\n\n- Coins can buy cosmetics, houses, pets, death animations, and player skins/costumes (You can buy coins or earn them buy playing games over time)\n\n- You sometime get deals that are very cheap\nExamples: Vampire Deal: Vampire Skin, Vampire house, 1300 coins, etc. FOR ONLY 0.99!\nNOTE: The buyable things in TOS is basically hats from TF2 (Money Grabbers ;) )\n\n- STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS :)))))))))))))   (GO GET SOME AND SHOWOFF HOW GOOD YOU ARE)\n\nCons:\n\n- 3 gamemodes, im sure overtime they will add more gamemodes but for now what you get is what you got.\n\n- GAMETHROWERS, although these are rare sometimes you will join a game with a guy who will tell who the entire mafia is and ruin the game for everyone.\n\n- 4.99 coin packs for only 1500 coins, as i said before Coins are equal to TF2 Hats, they suck you in and steal your money. (If you lowered the price or gave more coins for 4.99 i would consider buying coins.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Town of Salem: Steam Version is an amazing game and you should support the developers!\n\n9/10\n\nPS: WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY THERE ARE NO POP-UP ADS!","January 7","true","13.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then, each player is given their role, which comes with a number of abilities and an allegiance to one of three ‘sides’: The Townies, who’s primary goal is to eliminate all evil roles, The Neutrals, who all have their own unique goals such as ‘Survive till the end of the game’ and ‘Kill everyone who would oppose you” and the Mafia, who’s primary goal is to eliminate the Townies. The game proceeds by to the actual game, which proceeds on a day and night cycle with many stages within.\n\nThe goal of the Town (or Townies) is to kill all the Mafia, and other hostile neutrals, such as the serial killer or arsonist. The Mafia's aim to kill all the Townies, and any hostile neutrals. The Neutrals have a variety of goals relating to their individual roles. Generally, the Neutrals don't have a particular side. Deception is a massive part of controlling and winning the game. There is what we call night and day, during the day you can vote on people to lynch them. At night people get killed by the mafia, serial killer, etc.\n\nPros and cons:\n1-Pros\n-Alot of roles which improve different play style\n-Fun\n-Playable with friends\n-Easy to learn\n-Good music\n2-Cons\n-Diying 1st night can be booring\n-Random lynching\n-Afk/Leavers\n-some lags\n\nConclusion :\nI really liked to play this game it's very addictif and i had lot of fun specially when i play with a friend we have to trick other players into believing us .\n\nTown of Salem is available on all internet browsers and Steam, for free on browsers and for  5$ on Steam.","April 24","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Dont get me wrong random people is also a fun experianse in its own right but usually i find that playing with friends leads to more comical events.\n\nanyways the game is about the townies vs the evil forces trying to kill them be it the mafia, the serial killer, whicked jesters, executioners, werewolves, vampires, etc. But your not alone. evil doesnt always play well against itself either. So deception is the name of the game.\n\nPeople can ask you your roll, and you can be honest, or deceitful. And just because you died doesnt mean thats the end of you. Your death note could point the blame at someone, You could tell who killed you to the medium, who will tell the rest of the townies. OR you can lie, just to mess with people. Your choice. :D\n\nThe Game is free on their website and is great for those times when you just need to kill some time.\n\nall in all I'd definatly recommend.","February 15, 2015","true","47.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun in a "Guess Who" sort of way.\n\nPretty much two teams of people (and some unaffiliated people) in a town trying to collect information or convince the others of this or that.\n\nNo one knows what anyone else is at first. Everyone chooses a name, the game begins, and you're given a random role which no one knows but you.\n\nThere's a buncha roles. With each having their own ability and goal. Some need to lynch or kill the enemy team. Some just need to survive to the end of the game regardless of which team wins. Some even win by getting lynched.\n\nRoles basically boil down to either collecting information, attacking other players, defending other players, blocking other players from performing their actions, or misleading other players. All of which are done in various ways.\n\nThis game has the effect much like Civilization. You keep deciding to play just one more game (or "turn" in Civ's case) but before you know it you've played 10 more games. Especially if you play with friends and laugh over the dumb names people use and the silly last-wills and death-notes they make.","March 5, 2015","true","93.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimcapslock/recommended/334230/","hiimcapslock","Shammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimcapslock/","836 products in account","Quickie Review: Amazing game. Available for free on browser, but I highly recommend buying it on here to support the developers. If you want to get a general idea about what this game plays like, I made a short video of me playing it with some friends down below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbOQCT5P6zM\n\nLonger Review: This game has been some of the most fun I've had playing games with friends in recent memory. The amount of deception, lies, debauchery, and betrayal make the game SO much fun. If you've got friends you can play this game with, I'd give it a 9/10 easy. Alone it's probably still about an 8.\n\nIf you don't know what the game is about, you're essentially trying to either lynch the serial killer/mafia members (as well as other roles depending on your gametype) or, alternatively, trying not to get lynched while you blame the innocent and kill them while they sleep. It's just a really fun take on an old party game, and a welcome addition to my Steam library and regular game rotation.\n\nThat's another thing, the wealth of gametypes that the game offers more than makes it worth the $5. There's something for everyone. I personally really like the "All Any" gametype, because it requires a lot more detective work and teamwork by the townies.\n\nIt's just completely different than every other game in my Steam library, so it stands out as something I really, really enjoy.","January 13, 2015","true","198.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the developers constantly adding content, the future of this game is looking bright.\n\nIf you enjoy deception, strategy and pixelated violence, this is the game for you.\n\nThe $5 cost will net you 1,200 game coins which will enable you to buy various skins from the store.\n\nIf you like CoD, or any other FPS, stay away from this game.

Well all i can say is it was the best money i have spent.\n\ntown of salem as the description states is like the game Mafia, no not the video game the Party Game wher eyou have to use deception or investigation to win the game.\n\nPlay it with friends and you will probably no longer be friends with them\nPlay it with strangers and laugh when you kill them all or lynch them\n\nYou will learn how to lie and lie convincingly. You will also learn to how to spot lies.\n\nSo down to the game:\n\nUp to 15 people in a game it is actually best with 15 and also the most fun, generally 4 evil roles (3 mafia and a serial killer), 1 executioner who is trying to get a town member Lynched, 1 jester who is trying to get lynched and 9 town members.  With less players there will be less roles available for both town and others.\n\nEach role will tell you what you can do but i would adviselooking up the roles and how they work on the main website before you play as there really is no tutorial on how to play. Custom games have more roles to choose from  and can be a lot more intresting.  You do have to have played 40 games before you can play ranked but that i guess id for the real try hards and i just enjoy playing it for fun.\n\nPros\n\n+ game is technically free you can play free version or pay up to 5 bucks on steam and get 5 bucks of in game cash\n+ earn in game cash for every win, first win of day and several achievements\n+ in game cash is used to buy skins, pets and basic eye cany stuff so you cant pay to win as it gets you nowhere\n+ seems like there is a ranked system and also custom game mode where you can set as many roles as you like\n+ you can kill your friends and laugh about it when you have lied to them the whole game\n+ you can get revenge on a friend who killed you in a previous game\n+ community is not so harsh on new players well not that i have seen anyway\n+ you can get killed or lynched and still get a win\n+ easy to pick up and learn on the go\n+ you can use a different name each game\n\ncons\n\n- lots of rage quitters people dc at start of game or when they get killed\n- no tutorial to tell you exactly how to play\n- you will loose friends if you play this game\n- you see the same names being used a lot\n\nwould i recomend this game oh hell yes this is not a game about high end graphics it is all about role playing and deception, have fun murder your friends,  lynch them, haunt them from beyond the grave, tell on them while you are dead, execute them while you have them in jail,  shoot them when they come to visit or just go and shoot them if you get a feeling  about them but heck you may not have any of those options.\n\nGive it a shot and have some fun it is well worth it.","June 21, 2015","true","87.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danepanda/recommended/334230/","danepanda","Pandapop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danepanda/","168 products in account","Town of Salem is massively enjoyable, especially when you consider how it manages to create mystery, suspense and strategic situations with so little. Each role (mostly) has an interesting thing to do, some roles are dull and are based entirely on luck and nothing else, but overall, you can develop your own strategy for each character and use it to the advantage (or disadvantage) of the group. Right, it is a really good game. Really engaged and good fun to play with...however...\n\nWhat ruins the game is the sheer level of cheating and bad form displayed by a lot of players. I've had the good fortune to play with some excellent players and have great games. But on the majority of occasions, I end up stuck with some really rude, bigotted, spamming and sometimes peadophillic people. I report them of course, but the next game or so, there they are again, and aiming to ruin the game for me because I called them on it.\n\nIn some games as well, people actually cheat by telling people IRL who did what. For example, N1 as SK I killed the escort. Escort did not leave a will, ya know, the main way of communicating after you die (less the medium) and I got lynched because another person in the game was sat in the same room as the escort, and the escort told him. After trying to defend myself, as you would if you want to try to win, I was labelled a '♥♥♥' and told to 'go cry yu f***, b***** die in a fire' and so on...as if I chose to be the SK and then was totally in the wrong for trying to escape a lynching!\n\nThis is the only element of the game I find completely offputting, that this is going on, and it ruins games and throws it into complete bias. Everybody should have a fair shot at winning, and not get screwed over so easily by people who use their own mechanics to swing games. Adding in the fact that you get personally attacked by these people for actually trying to play the game. I know that monitoring a chat service is difficult and rely's on the players reporting, but the report function is not sufficient, especially when you can't give a reason for the report. And I am aware that there is no real way that the developers can stop this from happening, same as WoW can't really do much against gold farmers.\n\nI would recommend it, but I do hope the developers are aware that this type of player ruins it for everybody else, and is, as such, the only, albeit quite seriously so, offputting part of the game.","June 22, 2015","true","240.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, here i guess. Town of Salem is a simplistic game where you click and type, easy right? If you said yes, you're wrong. This game is all about deceiving others, figuring out others plans and them revealing them to your side. Just gonna put it blunt, it F*cks with your mind, this game has a lot of tricks up its sleeves.... From surprising plot twists to last minute turn arounds, the games in this could go ANYWHERE.\n\nThe player customizer is spectacular, the options are just incredible and with new update every holiday and so often, you can never have enough skins or pets. It may be hard working for it, but you can't help but grin when you walk into that circle with a doge or a huge dark horse descending down on your fellow townies.\n\nSo now, why you should buy the game over playing in browser; No ads, Free money, Faster loading speed, another way of connecting with the amazing, mind boggling people you meet on the games and basically, overall enjoyment\n\nMy rating for this game is a mighty 9/10, this is because of the sheer enjoyment of the game, i have met several friends on this game and have played with cool youtubers like SquirrelsMK, because of the awesome party feauture, its certain that she can play with her subscribers and they can enjoy playing aswell, rather than just joining at the same time, hoping for the best. But, sadly, i can not give a perfect 10 for some games being ruined as of cheaters in the games, and i know its nearly impossible to prevent at the start of the game, but me and squirrels alike have had mafia, sk or just any games ruined by other mafia members or cheaters.

So it makes it more worth it in the end and to be honest they are not asking for much to help support the game, spare change I say going to a great cause :D\n\nThe text lags a little for me when writing but I can handle it and due to my own system not the game.\n\nVery much worth getting however I suggest testing the game out on the browser version before deciding to buy a faster version incase you don't like it.

I absolutely love it. I see a lot of people complaining about the ads, but as far as I can tell, those don't exist. Other people are complaining about scrolls, which is honestly a dumb thing to complain about because it doesn't affect the other players that much, unless there's like four people with the same scroll. In classic, if there's one person with a scroll, it changes the odds of everyone else getting that role from 7% to 4%, which isn't a huge dip. I've seen a few people complain about having to wait five minutes after leaving a game to join a new one, but since that timer starts ticking as soon as the game begins, those five minutes are hardly even a factor unless you leave on night 1 or 2.\nI don't really have anything I can complain about.

I found that I was more scared playing the Serial Killer as I feared being caught then I was playing FNaF (no surprises there). But it CAN be bad and frustrating if you join a lobby with a bunch of morons.\nE.g. I was playing as the sheriff, framer was dead and I had found the mafioso. I make my claim and the investigator backs me up saying that I was infact the sheriff. Instead of the mafioso going up, I went up as the investigator and myself were "the 2 remaining mafia, trying to get someone else killed".\nNow incidents like this don't happen that often but there will usually be an idiot or someone who just doesn't know how to play in the lobby which will REALLY get on your nerves. But otherwise this is a pretty solid game. Get a group of friends together and you'll have a blast\n\nRecommended - 7.5/10","October 27, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely love it. I see a lot of people complaining about the ads, but as far as I can tell, those don't exist. Other people are complaining about scrolls, which is honestly a dumb thing to complain about because it doesn't affect the other players that much, unless there's like four people with the same scroll. In classic, if there's one person with a scroll, it changes the odds of everyone else getting that role from 7% to 4%, which isn't a huge dip. I've seen a few people complain about having to wait five minutes after leaving a game to join a new one, but since that timer starts ticking as soon as the game begins, those five minutes are hardly even a factor unless you leave on night 1 or 2.\nI don't really have anything I can complain about. It's just a solid game that I've reccomended to all my friends.\n\nFinal rating: 9.6/10","February 26","true","95.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The town on the other hand has to try to eliminate the mafia members.\n\nThe game is pretty good and every round feels different, There is a lot of replayability in the game with all of the different roles and such all of the roles i didnt explain are, Amnesiac, Survivor, Vampire, Executioner, Jester, Witch, Arsonist, Werewolf.\n\nI Recommend this game to you guys trust me its a really good game you will spend a lot of time playing it and you wont get bored, But i do also recommend to play with friends to have more fun. Also if you want to try the game before paying the $5, Hope you guys enjoy!\n\n","February 23","true","208.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It appears ONCE every day and personally it's not anything that I think could annoy anyone. These "ads" are nothing more than what you would see when you open Steam, a picture that shows what deals are going on in the store, and an X in the corner so you can close it out in a fraction of a second...\n\nI know this isn't a real review, but really there's nothing more to say than the fact that this game is amazing and you should waste all of time playing it.","January 29","true","87.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a saying though; "don't judge a book by its cover," and this saying totally applies to this game. Although its first look to gamers doesn't really appeal to the eye, this phenomenal game will instantly change your mind with its gameplay.\n\nIn this game, you are a certain role, selected by random to ensure fairness, and fulfill that role to the best of your abilities. For some roles, your objective is to "lynch every criminal and evildoer," for others, your goal is to kill every player who opposes you or your selected faction, or even other "neutral" roles, whose objective is much different than everyone else. You'd never know who you will be friends or enemies with in this game.\n\nWith this in mind, you would think this is all that makes this game so special, but roles aren't what make it "all that". What does make Town of Salem a great game to play is the fact that there's so much variety on how to play it. Not only can you play it with your friends in the same lobby by making a party, not only can you buy different items such as skins, pets, death animations and houses to make yourself look like a pro, but you can also play in many modes which challenge your expertise on the game including a custom role mode, and what I call a mystery game in where nobody knows what your or anyone else's role is. Along with that, there are over 200 achievements to be collected throughout your game experience!\n\nIn conclusion, this game deserves more praise than what people think it should deserve, and in my opinion is a wonderful game to play with your friends during an online gathering or even by yourself if you think you're a strategic and focused player.","March 12","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

If writing this review to wean me off Town of Salem so I can go to bed.)\n\nBasically what we have is a 'Werewolf' style game but with none of the tiresome eye-closing/eye-opening and far less opportunities for cheating.\n\nThere are fifteen players in a game and each is assigned a role at random. The roles fall into three categories, Good Townspeople, Mafia and Neutrals.\n\n- Good Townspeoples' goal is to kill all the Mafia and the Serial Killer (a Neutral)\n- Mafia's goal is to kill al the Good Townspeople and the Serial Killer\n- Each Neutral has their own goal, specific to their role\n\nSome roles have the ability to kill other characters during the night, some characters are immune to being killed during the night but any player can be hung by hue and cry during the day if the majority of the town (including Mafia and Neutrals) agrees on it. This is where the real fun comes in. However well you deploy your role abilities, there's always the chance that you might be put on the spot and accused of being a traitor to the town. You often find yourself with little more than a few second to explain your actions (or tell a convincing lie) before the rope is around your neck. There's nothing more satisfying than talking yourself out of trouble when standing on the gallows. (Especially if you deserve to be there.)\n\nIn summary, buy this. It's not expensive and it's really good fun.","February 28, 2015","true","600.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well all i can say is it was the best money i have spent.\n\ntown of salem as the description states is like the game Mafia, no not the video game the Party Game wher eyou have to use deception or investigation to win the game.\n\nPlay it with friends and you will probably no longer be friends with them\nPlay it with strangers and laugh when you kill them all or lynch them\n\nYou will learn how to lie and lie convincingly. You will also learn to how to spot lies.\n\nSo down to the game:\n\nUp to 15 people in a game it is actually best with 15 and also the most fun, generally 4 evil roles (3 mafia and a serial killer), 1 executioner who is trying to get a town member Lynched, 1 jester who is trying to get lynched and 9 town members.  With less players there will be less roles available for both town and others.\n\nEach role will tell you what you can do but i would adviselooking up the roles and how they work on the main website before you play as there really is no tutorial on how to play. Custom games have more roles to choose from  and can be a lot more intresting.  You do have to have played 40 games before you can play ranked but that i guess id for the real try hards and i just enjoy playing it for fun.\n\nPros\n\n+ game is technically free you can play free version or pay up to 5 bucks on steam and get 5 bucks of in game cash\n+ earn in game cash for every win, first win of day and several achievements\n+ in game cash is used to buy skins, pets and basic eye cany stuff so you cant pay to win as it gets you nowhere\n+ seems like there is a ranked system and also custom game mode where you can set as many roles as you like\n+ you can kill your friends and laugh about it when you have lied to them the whole game\n+ you can get revenge on a friend who killed you in a previous game\n+ community is not so harsh on new players well not that i have seen anyway\n+ you can get killed or lynched and still get a win\n+ easy to pick up and learn on the go\n+ you can use a different name each game\n\ncons\n\n- lots of rage quitters people dc at start of game or when they get killed\n- no tutorial to tell you exactly how to play\n- you will loose friends if you play this game\n- you see the same names being used a lot\n\nwould i recomend this game oh hell yes this is not a game about high end graphics it is all about role playing and deception, have fun murder your friends,  lynch them, haunt them from beyond the grave, tell on them while you are dead, execute them while you have them in jail,  shoot them when they come to visit or just go and shoot them if you get a feeling  about them but heck you may not have any of those options.\n\nGive it a shot and have some fun it is well worth it.","June 21, 2015","true","87.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely love it. I see a lot of people complaining about the ads, but as far as I can tell, those don't exist. Other people are complaining about scrolls, which is honestly a dumb thing to complain about because it doesn't affect the other players that much, unless there's like four people with the same scroll. In classic, if there's one person with a scroll, it changes the odds of everyone else getting that role from 7% to 4%, which isn't a huge dip. I've seen a few people complain about having to wait five minutes after leaving a game to join a new one, but since that timer starts ticking as soon as the game begins, those five minutes are hardly even a factor unless you leave on night 1 or 2.\nI don't really have anything I can complain about. It's just a solid game that I've reccomended to all my friends.\n\nFinal rating: 9.6/10","February 26","true","95.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The town on the other hand has to try to eliminate the mafia members.\n\nThe game is pretty good and every round feels different, There is a lot of replayability in the game with all of the different roles and such all of the roles i didnt explain are, Amnesiac, Survivor, Vampire, Executioner, Jester, Witch, Arsonist, Werewolf.\n\nI Recommend this game to you guys trust me its a really good game you will spend a lot of time playing it and you wont get bored, But i do also recommend to play with friends to have more fun. Also if you want to try the game before paying the $5, Hope you guys enjoy!\n\n","February 23","true","208.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obviously this doesn't happen much in real life (unless you are a lawyer) but Town Of Salem takes it to an art form. Manipulation, deceit, trickery and misdirection all play a huge part in this online-only multiplayer game of psychology and basically being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWith a few different game modes to mix it up (as well as some custom ones you can host for others), the usual set-up is a town... the town of Salem in fact. This town has a slight problem. There are the good, honest, regular townies that live there... and then it seems that the mafia have moved into town and a serial killer is on the loose. The catch? Nobody knows who has what role in the town and they have to convince, lie, backstab and otherwise manipulate their way to living through each night, during which some unlucky sod will die.\n\nDifferent roles for all the factions (teams?) have different abilities which they use to further their side's goals, but who to trust and who to suspect. This leads to some very tense games and shock endings. Great fun alone or with friends :P","July 5, 2015","true","169.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpazmanianDevil/recommended/334230/","SpazmanianDevil","SpazmanianDevil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpazmanianDevil/","556 products in account","Ever since Steam recommended this game to me it's claimed a portion of my daily life.\n\nIt's a game that reminded me of Mitadake High (Pyrce High I think it's called now over on the BYOND webiste) except better mechanics and a helluva lot more orgainzed. There's light role playing to figure out who's who, who should be hung or killed and the ability to take notes, all in the name of trying to win the game. Whether you're Mafia, a Townie, or some non-denominational bad or good guy, The whole goal of the game is achieve your objective and win the game. That could mean tricking people into lynching you, setting people on fire, survive the whole game without dying, or a myriad of other objects as there are tons of roles.\n\nYou don't get to pick your role. It's randomly chosen for you. You're given a box that tells you what it means, what you can do, and how to win the game. The best part of this game, is you don't always have to be alive to win. For instance, if you are aligned to win with Town and you die but Town survives, then you also have won the game.\n\n"But I don't wanna sit around and watch a game I'm not playing." I might hear you say. But what if I told you that sometimes there's a Medium that can talk to the "dead" and you can give them info to help the living people win? But sometimes the Medium's Curse is strong and they get killed first night. So that can suck if you know exactly who killed you but you can't tell anyone.\n\nThis game is definitely a must have in my book. It's less complicated then it sounds and totally addictive. If you like RPG elements, sprinkled with a board game atmosphere and Whodunit mysteries, give this game a shot.\n\nP.S. If you don't want to buy it, it is free to play here: http://blankmediagames.com/  Though if you do buy it on Steam, apparently there are perks such as, there are faster loading times, $5 worth of town coins if you're into stylizing, the ability to unlock acheivements that give you more coins, and better compatibility with operating Systems.","March 25, 2015","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyways, this game is quite difficult to learn, especially if you are just starting out, but even then it' very addicting (Disregard my hours played). I would of course recommend watching youtube videos are tutorials about this game first, as would anyone. Just prepare, if you do buy this game, to be completely screwed over by your fellow town, nobody will listen to your claims, and if they do, they're working against you.

Just an FYI, by buying this on Steam, you're basically buying 1400 town points, as this game is free online. As for the game, I recommend it. However, it is a strategy game of lying and deception, based off of the forum/card game mafia. Getting started can be a little difficult, as you don't know what many of the roles do. I recommend reading the wiki a bit before you get started; it contains a lot of useful information and tips about the game. I've been playing this game in a browser for over 6 months and I finally decided to get it on Steam.

I haven't played a similar game before, even though now I know there were games like this before. What at first seemed like a small little time waster, soon became one of my most played games.\n\nIn this game everyone in a village of 15 players gets a role which has each 1 special ability. You have 2 factions like Mafia and Townsfolk and certain unique roles like Werewolf and Serial Killer etc. This game is all about psychology and lying to others and finding out who is who because nobody knows for sure who can be trusted and everyone could be the serial killer, or belong to the mafia. During night time everyone can use their special ability, which can be anything depending on the role (kill someone, transport someone, protect, investigate, jail, douse, revive a dead, talk to dead etc etc).\n\nEach day people can discuss about what happened, if they noticed anything etc. and then they can (but don't have to) vote to lynch/hang someone. But mind you, there is also a role called Jester, someone who's goal it is to get the others to lynch him.\n\nEach round you play feels fresh and is fun as you usually get a new role each match. (there are 32 roles currently). Most roles are pretty fun to play.\n\nI can only recommend this game. If you want to try it out for free there is a browser version free to play of this game. The steam version for 5€ is basically the same, but more stable since it's not browser related, no ads and you get 5€ of ingame currency for cosmetic changes like skins or pets etc.","December 18, 2014","true","548.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just an FYI, by buying this on Steam, you're basically buying 1400 town points, as this game is free online. As for the game, I recommend it. However, it is a strategy game of lying and deception, based off of the forum/card game mafia. Getting started can be a little difficult, as you don't know what many of the roles do. I recommend reading the wiki a bit before you get started; it contains a lot of useful information and tips about the game. I've been playing this game in a browser for over 6 months and I finally decided to get it on Steam. Being "good" at this game, it is easily one of my favorites.","July 12, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Townies are requiered to eliminate mafia and evil neutral roles, Mafia needs to kill all of the Townies (and evil roles that are a treat to the family) while each Neutral role has a specific goal, wheter it is to be the last man standing or simply survive until the game ends.\n\nAfter joining the lobby the match starts once 15 people are gathered (unless the hosts decides to start sooner with fewer people but please don't do that). You choose the name you'll have during that match, for each match you can choose a diffrent name, and after that you'll get assigned a role and a game can start. In game phases are divided in to day time and night time when each role, if able, performs its ability. During the day all of the players gather to share informations, talk, lie and acuse each other. At the end of a "discussion phase" players vote who to send to the block, and if more than half players vote someone out that someone is given a chance to defend himself. Players then vote if the acused one is guilty or innocent. If voted guilty he is executed and if not he is released. During the night time Mafia gathers to discuss their plans such as who will they murder next, who will be blackmailed, who will be framed and so on. But Mafia members aren't the only night owls, Serial killers, Werewolfs and other evil people are choosing their targets, Sheriffs are looking for bad guys while Doctors are visiting potential targets.\n\nNotable "mods" the game offers are "Normal" and "Chaos" mod. Normal one offers mostly predetermined roles, leaving only a few of them to be random, so you know what to expect in that match, while Chaos mod generates 15 random roles, making the match a lot less predictable, but in a way a lot more fun. There is also an option of joining a Custom made match where the host of the lobby chooses which role will be played.\n\nThis game puts your ability to lie at test, but also your ability to tell the truth, as sometimes you will have to convince people to trust you when you're actualy not lying. However if you pull too much attention to yourself you just may make yourself the next target of the Mafia. Connecting dots is the most useful skill.\n\ntl;dr: You like to lie without feeling guilt? You like to trick people? You admire getting tricked? This is a game for you!","November 23, 2015","true","339.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's light role playing to figure out who's who, who should be hung or killed and the ability to take notes, all in the name of trying to win the game. Whether you're Mafia, a Townie, or some non-denominational bad or good guy, The whole goal of the game is achieve your objective and win the game. That could mean tricking people into lynching you, setting people on fire, survive the whole game without dying, or a myriad of other objects as there are tons of roles.\n\nYou don't get to pick your role. It's randomly chosen for you. You're given a box that tells you what it means, what you can do, and how to win the game. The best part of this game, is you don't always have to be alive to win. For instance, if you are aligned to win with Town and you die but Town survives, then you also have won the game.\n\n"But I don't wanna sit around and watch a game I'm not playing." I might hear you say. But what if I told you that sometimes there's a Medium that can talk to the "dead" and you can give them info to help the living people win? But sometimes the Medium's Curse is strong and they get killed first night. So that can suck if you know exactly who killed you but you can't tell anyone.\n\nThis game is definitely a must have in my book. It's less complicated then it sounds and totally addictive. If you like RPG elements, sprinkled with a board game atmosphere and Whodunit mysteries, give this game a shot.\n\nP.S. If you don't want to buy it, it is free to play here: http://blankmediagames.com/  Though if you do buy it on Steam, apparently there are perks such as, there are faster loading times, $5 worth of town coins if you're into stylizing, the ability to unlock acheivements that give you more coins, and better compatibility with operating Systems.","March 25, 2015","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have had the Serial Killer and Mafia both die on the first day by trying to kill a Veteran and we won the match on the first turn after a Mafia was lynched and the other mafia left the game.\n\nHOWEVER, this game is also free in browser and you do not have to pay the $5 to buy it on steam. Paying the $5 actually doesn't get you many perks at all; it only gives you some coins which cannot actually buy you much.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrimReaperTom/recommended/334230/","GrimReaperTom","Grim Reaper Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrimReaperTom/","134 products in account","Imma start this off by explaining a couple of things.\n1. The 2 things that are REALLY important to the game is price OR a low price, This game is $5 (I got for $2.50 Steam sale) and I could play this for hundreds of hours\n2. I like to list PROs, CONs and RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nPROS:\n- Large amount of characters and content\n- Great art design\n- Great game idea\n- Cheap price\n- Although there is a lot to learn and you have to decieve people, it's not too hard to get a grasp on for new players\n- Lots of players\n- Many reliable servers\n\nCONS:\n- The login menu is kinda silly (Read recommendations)\n- They use a high price of IRL money for a low amount of ingame money (eg $5 for around 1300 gold)\n- Before logging in, there is no music volume setting, you have to log in to access it\n- When given a day duty (Jailor) it's easy to forget to do said duty\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Delete the need to login, make the account name the same as the steam name\n- Right before night, do a pop-up asking Jailor to choose\n- Lower the $ per Gold to around $1 for $2000. Although other games (CS:GO for example) are reliant on like $50 for a gun, this game will NEVER gain much from high prices for skins. It's more like the kinda game where people pay their $5, almost everyone has heard of it and only around 20% of your audience will STAY for more than 200 hours.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION\n- You dont want people swearing on your game, that's all fine and dandy but theres a better way not to expose your younger audience to bad language. Lemme put it into steps\n\n1. When the game is started for the first time ever, ask the player if they want to see curses or not\n2. - If YES, when someone swears the player will see the entire message\n- If NO, then the word will be taken out and replaced with *'s or spaces.\n\nWHY? This means that the adult audience dont feel the need to dumb down the F word to fak, ♥♥♥♥, fech etc. (thus infuriating them) whilst the children arent seeing the curse.","May 23","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a bundle of laughs and incredibly fun. I don't have the best patience but it really takes a lot of pushing to test mine in here. I strongly recommend playing this game for yourself on the browser first if you don't want to pay, if you enjoy the game, I strongly recommend buying it here. It's worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Unique game aspect\n- Colorful art and fun music\n- Most people are respectful to each other, even in game\n- Simple UI\n- Not terribly grindy to obtain gold\n- Regular sales making certain expensive packages super affordable\n- Several roles to play as\n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs here and there\n- Requires strategy, lot of people in Classic think pointing fingers on the first day is the best idea, it's not.\n- No freedom to swear, not a big deal but it sucks having to watch my own mouth\n- Can be difficult to maintain your role and your will at once, depending on your role.\n- Far too much marketing\n- Not enough gold rewards for playing the game\n\nAgain I strongly recommend this game, and if by some chance, my review led you to Salem, please use my name as the referal. :3 Name is kayanakoe in game. I would love to try playing a game or two with you guys as well.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention something, the game tends to be heavy on marketing so.. any gold income you would try to gain legitimately is low, 5 gold if, IF you win.

I would recommend this game to everyone.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over tohttp://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","May 20","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrimReaperTom/recommended/334230/","GrimReaperTom","Grim Reaper Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrimReaperTom/","134 products in account","Imma start this off by explaining a couple of things.\n1. The 2 things that are REALLY important to the game is price OR a low price, This game is $5 (I got for $2.50 Steam sale) and I could play this for hundreds of hours\n2. I like to list PROs, CONs and RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nPROS:\n- Large amount of characters and content\n- Great art design\n- Great game idea\n- Cheap price\n- Although there is a lot to learn and you have to decieve people, it's not too hard to get a grasp on for new players\n- Lots of players\n- Many reliable servers\n\nCONS:\n- The login menu is kinda silly (Read recommendations)\n- They use a high price of IRL money for a low amount of ingame money (eg $5 for around 1300 gold)\n- Before logging in, there is no music volume setting, you have to log in to access it\n- When given a day duty (Jailor) it's easy to forget to do said duty\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Delete the need to login, make the account name the same as the steam name\n- Right before night, do a pop-up asking Jailor to choose\n- Lower the $ per Gold to around $1 for $2000. Although other games (CS:GO for example) are reliant on like $50 for a gun, this game will NEVER gain much from high prices for skins. It's more like the kinda game where people pay their $5, almost everyone has heard of it and only around 20% of your audience will STAY for more than 200 hours.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION\n- You dont want people swearing on your game, that's all fine and dandy but theres a better way not to expose your younger audience to bad language. Lemme put it into steps\n\n1. When the game is started for the first time ever, ask the player if they want to see curses or not\n2. - If YES, when someone swears the player will see the entire message\n- If NO, then the word will be taken out and replaced with *'s or spaces.\n\nWHY? This means that the adult audience dont feel the need to dumb down the F word to fak, ♥♥♥♥, fech etc. (thus infuriating them) whilst the children arent seeing the curse.","May 23","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many different roles, different ways to win. It has a long learning curve but probably the best "lying/manipulating" simulator out on the market.\n\nHowever developers have decided recently to add more ingame ads. When you log in, you might see a ad. You may see a ad in the end of the game. There is nothing wrong with promoting your offers, the game is great and I really do hope developers do find a middleground where they earn what they deserve (alot) without scaring players away with annoying ads.\n\nWithout the ads I rated the game 10/10 - it truly is the best game in this genre in the current market.\nHowever with the current ad system it's 2/10.

Never had a problem with it, besides a person who gamethrows from time to time. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was free, but eh. This game treats me well. You meet good temporary friends for the time period that the game is going on, and the only problem I see is that there are things you could be improving on but just choose not to, like adding some new roles or making overall animation improvements, but besides that I'd reccomend this game. Just needs a little more balancing, censorship from curse words, and maybe easier ways to get coins without paying for them, like maybe you could get like 35 coins every time you get an achievement. You don't see too many games like this, and if you do they probably went out of development years ago. 9/10, would reccomend.","May 27","true","40.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finding other killers then getting them hung, earning the peoples trust. I used this trust to the point of me literally putting in the note I left after each murder that I had power over the people, enough to kill without suspicion. I was only found out when there were two people left, that was how I won as Hannibal Lecter. The best part about this game is the uniqueness of it all. Other games would probably turn this into a puzzle game. This game is a puzzle in itself. You either kill or be killed, the best part being that you can manipulate the town in the best ways! If I am the godfather. I simply have my mafioso do the killing. Then when I am investigated I show up as a town member. If the mafioso dies I simply walk in then kill them myself. I am immune to attacks at night like the serial killer and have power over an entire group. As a serial killer, I gain the townsfolk's trust, then I kill them all while using my  personall smarts to catch other killers! Never in my life have I had more fun then the rush of finishing off the entire town with my own brain. It brings a whole new meaning to 1v2/1v3.

Now that I've played it, I feel that I more than got my money's worth.  Town of Salem is an excellent game that's almost always tense and entertaining.  You need multiple skills to win, including luck, deception, and deduction, but even when you screw up it's a good time.\n\nI only have two real gripes about the game.  The first is the community; a lot of players are pretty offensive, both in language and behavior, and more than a few will quit at the drop of a hat if things start to go against them.  This doesn't include everyone, mind, but more players than I'd like.  The second is that lag, when it hits, kills the game, more than doubling play time, silencing chat, and preventing players from using their abilities.  It's not a common occurrence, but it's extremely frustrating when it does.\n\nStill, those complaints shouldn't deter one from a game that is, on the whole, a lot of fun.","September 7, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Purchasing this game on Steam does provide some ingame currency, and the currency can also be gained through playing games, or unlocking achievements.\n\nDeception is truly a massive part to the game, and it can be easily said, that those unfamiliar to the game may initially struggle when lying about their roles or actions, but overtime, it becomes second nature, with tricks such as fake wills, and knowing the town equivilant of a mafia role; consort=escort etc.  Every  single game goes a different route, even if you have the same role as the game before, which really adds to the replayability of this game.\n\nThe "ranked" system with point score was recently implemented into the game, where when a player has got a certain amount of wins, they can play this gamemode, against those who are similar to them- gaining or losing points which was not initial unlike the implement of the original system. A criticism of the system could be that if an amnesiac/witch/werewolf etc dies "night 1" to a killing role, this role loses the player points when they have done as good as nothing wrong. Due to this, getting a decent playable role in "ranked" can be seen to be the luck of the draw, but if a player does not like how the system works, they can always play the unranked gamemodes and see the pride as their win:loss ratio improves massively!\n\nTL;DR: Deception, killing players for their names, visiting Veterans night 1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunessence/recommended/334230/","Lunessence","Lunessence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunessence/","90 products in account","Yes, only purchase this game through Steam if you would like to help support the devs. Otherwise, go to their website at blankmediagames.com and play it free there. If you use info sheets and the ToS Wiki during the game like I do, press the ESC button to resize the screen when playing through the Steam client. You can then cycle through your needed tabs with ease.\n\nIf you like detective games you may love ToS. I've never played an in-person version of Werewolf or Mafia but I have tried other versions that were or are out there on the web. I keep coming back to ToS. The other ones are too confusing to navigate, have a stiff learning curve or you get in trouble by longtime regulars for having a new account by threatening to report you for just trying to play because you couldn't possibly be a brand new player. And their games typically last only about 5 minutes. While that can be a good thing, I find that it's just too quick for me to be as deceitful as possible in only a couple of minutes.\n\nEach game in ToS takes around 30 minutes to complete and I personally do not believe that there are any boring roles. Each role is unique and while some are more aggressive roles, that means there has to be a balance of more passive roles. But each role plays an important part when played correctly or creatively. The only thing that makes a role boring is if you die on the first or second night. Those deaths are usually just the luck of the draw. But, that's just part of the game. Join another one and try again.\n\nI love getting creative with roles. For example, when I'm Survivor I like to be as vocal as possible. When I'm Jester, I like to be as quiet as possible. It's all in how you want to play around with human psychology within the rules of the game. I've seen games with just two Mafia members win and games where seven Mafia lost (All Any mode).\n\nI've seen my fair share of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry ingame but the dev team cares about their community and are very responsive. There are now profanity filters that you can choose to have on and there has always been a report button for cheaters and the really out-of-hand players. Mostly, people are just playing a personality role while they are alive and if they stick around while dead, you can have some sane and interesting conversations.\n\nIn the end, it's just a game. If someone is being a ♥♥♥♥, /ignore them and move on to the next game when the time comes. Each game is different and that's what is so enjoyable. Just remember to have fun and play your part as best you can.\n\n"All the world’s a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\nThey have their exits and their entrances,\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts..." ~Shakespeare","January 6","true","143.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What is there not to like about this? Addictive and fun.\n\nPros\n\nGameplay interactions with other players\nTricking and decieving people\nEvery game and outcome is different\nScroll/odds rebalancing can stifle chances of certain roles\n\nCons\n\nHighly dependant on other players not ruining the experience\nAnnoying pop up adds whether you paid for it on steam or play it for free\n\nGameplay\nThis originally started off as a browser game, which proved to be such a hit with the people who played it, that they wanted to help support the creators to get onto Steam and Mobile - so it could become more well known. With a successful kickstarter and greenlight, the goal was finally achieved! Perhaps in the future it will make it to other platforms, too.\n\nDon't let my time here fool you. I have just a little over a thousand matches played at this point in time from the browser version. So, where to begin?\n\n\nWell, first off, this is a party game based on the likes of Mafia. It's played with up to fifteen people, though you wouldn't want to have any less in order to have the best kind of game. The current updated version of this game starts you with the ability to choose your name – which can result in some hilarious trolling, depending on your mood. You know something's happening when half of the players decide to call themselves after Game of Thrones characters, or someone has a name that automatically makes others hate them.\n\n\nAfter that, you have the role-wheel, which will select you your role for the game. This can be skewed in favour of those who have brought scrolls from the in-game shop to try and increase their chances of landing the role they want. For example, every role can have a 7% chance of being selected for you. If you use a scroll, it can increase the odds of the role you want to say, 20%, whilst decreasing the odds for everyone else – so they would drop from 7% to 4%. This can be annoying if you prefer to not obtain scrolls – but honestly, there is so many roles to choose from, it shouldn't matter too much. At some point, you will have roles you don't want, and roles you love. That's part of the fun of a randomised selection. The shame about this is that you will get pop up adds to entice you into the shop to buy things.\n\n\nAfter finding out which of the 33 roles you are, you then act as according to it for the game. Each game can be anything between ten to thirty minutes long. The main game is split into several phases. You start off with:\n\n\nDay One: discussion. Then night one. Then day two: Deaths. Then discussion. Then voting. Then discussion – this cycle repeats right up until the ultimate winner(s) are declared. Depending on your role, will depend on when you can preform your actions – if you have actions to achieve. With the voting phrase, if someone is voted up, they have to defend themselves, and the other players will vote guilty or innocent. Guilty votes will kill the defendant, and innocent ones will spare them.\n\n\nYou have three “sides” to speak of. Side one is town, or the “good” side. Town's main job is to oust the bad side before the bad side kills them. The catch is, Town has no clue who is Town and who isn't. So through discussion and usage of roles, they have to work out who is telling the truth and who is lying. You can get Support roles, Protective roles, and killing roles.\n\n\nSide two is Mafia, the “bad” side. Mafia's main job is to kill every town member and persuade them all the while that they're Town. Mafia's average number is three. Their advantage over Town is that the Mafia know who each other is, and can communicate with each other at night. You can get Deception roles, Support, and Killing.\n\n\nSide three is Neutrals, who all have individual goals that can either tie hand in hand with Town or Mafia, or just benefit themselves. You can get Benign neutrals, Killing neutrals, or just plain Evil ones.\n\n\nBecause there are so many roles, I will just mention around two from each “side” as a small example of the kinds you can get.\n\n\nOne role Town can get is an Investigator. During night-time, they can choose to look at another player to determine what role they have. A successful invest will reveal up to three roles the person can be. For example, someone could show up as Vigilante (Town Killing), a Veteran (Town Killing) or a Mafioso (Mafia Killing.) Through guesswork and questions, you can figure out if the person is good or not. Another town role is the Jailer. At daytime, they can choose to jail whoever they think is suspicious, or someone random. At night, they can then question the person in their jail to try and figure their role out. If the Jailer suspects their captive of lying, then they can choose to execute them.\n\n\nFor the Mafia, they can have a Godfather, who is the leader. He can kill someone at night, or make a Mafioso do it for them. Their advantage is that they can't be killed at night, so if someone shot them, they would be immune. The Disguiser for Mafia is someone who can take on the name, position, and face of someone who died. So if a confirmed Town player is chosen to be killed, the Disguiser can choose to “become” that Town, and people would believe they were still the same player.\n\n\nFor Neutrals, you can get an Jester, whose goal is to be hung by everyone else. They can do this by being annoying or throwing false information. If they are hung, they can choose to kill a guilty voter at night, from the graveyard. You can also get a Serial Killer, whose goal is to kill everyone – Town and Mafia. Serial Killers are also immune at night.\n\n\nSo, yes. There's a lot of roles. But really, the main selling point of this game is not the graphics, the music, or the diversity of the roles. It's the interaction with other players. Every single game is different because it depends on each player's ability to successfully do their role, and convince others of the truth, or their lies. It's a game about deception, and the feeling you can get when you pull off a tricky deception is just amazing. Imagine the Town's surprise when you convince them you're just a poor doctor who wants to heal people – and actually turn out to be the Serial Killer. Poor things. Maybe there's not a lot of good to be said about a game that teaches you how to lie convincingly, but trust me. This is fun!\n\n\nA very important things players need to do is write their findings or information down in their last wills. That way, if they die, the information can be read by everyone else, and hopefully benefit whoever needs the information the most. (For example, an investigator may have found the Godfather, but isn't sure, so they write it down. And when they die, people can see they suspected someone of being a Godfather.)\n\n\nYou'll get people who leave if things don't go their way, or people who game throw, so quite a few times, a game will depend on the personalities of those you interact with. I've had some frustrating games where people ruin it for others, and awesome games where everyone is doing what they should be doing – and injecting a little fun into it, too.\n\n\nI honestly think everyone should try this game at some point. It's free as well since it's still browser based. I chose to buy the game here because I loved it, and wanted to support BlankMediaGames. You have absolutely nothing to lose from trying this game out. And if you play with friends, you may end up damaging friendships, but that's okay. They'll forgive you … in time.\n\n\nGo play!\n\n\nWant moar?

Quick matchmaking and large community fills up the wait queues very fast. Roles are handed in secret, play your role and help your team wins. The learning curve is very manageable as most of the roles are intuitive enough.\n\nValue is not very clear here as the concept is a rip off from SCII custom map and the dev decided to add a cash shop on top of the game not being free to play. You can earn the rewards through enough grind and the rewards are mostly cosmetic except for an item which lets you pick a role.\n\nAll in all I have a lot of fun in this game, and everything that ruins other communities like immaturity and trolling end up reinforcing this game's concept, making the trials hilarious and all in all people really do want to play their roles and win so the competitive edge can be very present, and when things go wrong then it is comedy gold even when the reasons are a little dubious. If you find this in a bundle I would say you owe it to yourself to try this. However if you own starcraft II already you might find this version of the game is slightly underpar in comparison to the free custom map.

Placed in a town of 7-15 people, you must either try to kill everyone on the oposing 'groups' while lieing about your role, or try your hardest to get the rest of the town to belive you while trying to hang the killers of the town.\nWill you feel the joy of making it to the end unharmed? Will you feel satisfaction knowing that, despite your death, you were able to pull enough evidence to get the killer hanged? Or wil you just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the town fails to listen to your clues, and hangs you instead.\nBasically, its a fun game, but it can be a little frustrating when town members fail to work together. Its a simple concept, but it can be difficult to learn.

As i've already stated in my previous review, i'm not the "review-everything-i-bought" kinda guy. I only write review on specific games that really caught my attention, it can be either too brilliant or too toxic. So here we go.\n\nFinding out this game on steam was like the best thing i had in quite a while (it was actually my friend V.n who first told me about this hidden gem). It is simply a genius board game inspired by the traditional "Werewolf Game by Miller".\nIf you never heard about that game, it is basically a complicated version of TTT mode on Gmod: "There is a killer amongst you whom you should find out ASAP before he/she kills everyone including yourself."\nIf you love to play with your brain, read people's mind, gain people's trust, twist the way people think toward you or others, and finally make a "life-or-death" decision, this is definitely the game for you.\nHowever, this game is not as simple as a "murderer vs innocent" game. They have 30+ different roles that you must adapt with if you want to survive (check them out here http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Roles).\nThere are countless amount of possibilities in this game (there's never been a similar round which means one round will go differently than the other) to make this game less-boring.\nThe only negative stuff about this game is the UI bug. Sometimes it is hard to invite your online friends into lobby just because they dont show up on the friend list. Despite, i really recommend this game!\n\n*Note: you don't have to buy the game on steam as there is a free version via web, but consider buying it to help supporting the devs and as a form of appreciation toward their work :)","May 21","true","52.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

I get that it costs money to keep such a popular game running but the game freezes and it is incredibly frustrating if you've won or nearly won and then have to leave the game before it is over. The community is awful and toxic from most of my experience as well.\n\nA lot of people complain about the daily ads as well, which I don't really mind, but they always pop up mid game which is very frustrating.\n\nOtherwise it is very fun and a great idea, I just wish it was better executed and that they would spend more time fixing the glitches and issues and less time adding MORE roles/ buyable items.

Most people I have introduced the game to have immediately gotten addicted to it. It is a simple clicking game; however, it does involve a lot of thinking. It is a who-did-it type of game. There are a variety of game modes. You can play as many different characters, good, bad and neutral. Also there are coins earned in game that you can use to buy new skins, pets, and other features to customize your game experience.\n\nI recommend playing it for free on the browser first, before you purchase it on steam so you are sure you don’t waste your money if you feel like you don’t like the game. The difference between the browser version and the steam version is that you can earn 220 achievements on steam. It also says that when you first purchase the steam version you get extra coins, although I’m not sure if that is still active or not.\n\nYou should definitely give this game a chance. Playing it with friends makes it even more fun.","June 16, 2015","true","174.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Rin_/recommended/334230/","_Rin_","￪μ￬ Aurora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Rin_/","74 products in account","My Review/Thoughts On Town of Salem (ToS)\nKey Points     Gameplay\nControls\nCommunity\nMy Personal Opinion\nOverall Thoughts\nGameplay:So to start off, as the game information mentions there are a total of 31 unique roles for you to play as all with different ablities and perks. There is the Town, the Mafia, the Serial Killers, the Arsonists and the Neutrals. Within those are the mentioned 31 different roles.\nYou can start by playing a pretty good ammount of gamemodes when you start up the game. The ones you can play are Normal Classic, Custom Custom (pick from any 31 roles), Custom Rapid (faster times), Chaos All Any (Any role can be given), Chaos Rainbow (roles that make the rainbow), and Chaos Vigilantics (Vigilanties vs Witches). There is one more gamemode you can play call Normal Ranked however you need to play at least 50 games to start playing ranked.\nOnce you're in a game you have the option to make a last will, this is basically where you can store your information during the night and it stays. The will is essentail to the game because it could make the differance between a loss and a win. If/when you die your will, will be shown to the town. During the day time you can talk with the 7 to 15 players  (the dead cannot) and discuss what happened over night. At the end of the "discussion" time you have the option of voting someone, if you have no proof of them being what they are acused of then this is a random lynch and those are annoying af.\n\nControls:It's almost like a point and click game, although there is a chat for you to talk to people in the game as well as message friends. Honestly the chat is pretty important as you will be needing it for every game. There's really not much to the controls I guess.\n\nThe Community:Oh boy where to start with this one.... Hm ok, so some people are very nice and some are salty af. Most of the time you will find a nice lobby with pretty decent people. Other times you have trolls who don't care for the game or gamethrowers who just annoy everyone, there's also this other group called the afkers and they don't do anything all game (this mostly happens to people who dont get a good role). Recently the devs and other people who work on the game are working on something to help crack down on people like this. On a side note if you're new people are going to get mad at you because you didn't do something right. I suggest taking a look at this: Town of Salem Roles.[www.blankmediagames.com] There are also people who just love to random lynch and it honestly makes no sense to me.\n\nMy Personal Opinion:Let's start from the start. I started playing because I played one game on someones computer, and from then I was kinda hooked. Right after that match I went and bought it here on Steam. I was new and if you read my warning about new players you know how the first match went down. As I started playing more and more I learned the roles and what to do. You need to learn which roles are divided into the different groups so you can avoid lynches. I'm not calling myself good or anything of the sort, but I've aquired some skill.\nAbout the roles now. To start off here I shall go into possibably the best role to be; the Mafia. Why the mafia you ask? Well the Mafia acts as a team and if you're working together and play your cards right it's very hard for people to even notice whats happening and by the time they do you the Mafia have won the game. Serial Killer, Vampires, Werewolfs, Arsonists, and Witches are probably the next best thing to be. Werewolf and Vampires are sort of like the Mafia, but they don't have fancy roles, they just do the same thing. And if you're not one of those classes I am so sorry.\n\nOverall Thoughts:So what are my overall thoughts? I honestly love this game and I think it's worth it, one thing worth addressing is that yes this game is on the internet and is free, but if you buy the game on steam you get $5 worth of "Town Points" which is an ingame currancy used to spiffy up your character and such.\nMost of the time when you launch the game you will be given a pop up upon logging in with your steam account of your browser account. This just offers you bundles and things of the sort (If you sign in with Steam you can use Steam Wallet money for purchases).\nDepending on what time of day you play and other factors you can get a decent lobby with some nice people, or it could be the complete oppisite. I've found the community to be very likeable and funny, the people that manage the ToS Twitter account are also very interactive with the players who tweet at them for help and other things so don't be shy!\n\nIn the end I give this game an 8/10.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you pick up a copy of Town of Salem!","February 1","true","17.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

The devs need to do something about the immature and offensive names that players choose.

People who join a lobby and wait until the timer is at 2 seconds and then leave just to troll everyone else.  Not to mention in game quitters who leave before the game even goes to the first night because they don't like the role that they got.\n\n3. Town members who are killed that quit.... something needs to be done about that as well.  It screws over the medium's role.  What point is there in having a medium if everyone who dies leaves the game because they are sore losers?\n\nThis game is meant to be fun for everyone who plays it.  But lately I have had the fun sapped out of it because of the above problems.  The devs keep claiming that they are going to impliment features that punish people who quit and use offensive names... but nothing has been done yet.

We played the browser version virtually non-stop for a couple of days. When I heard there would be a steam release I knew I would be getting it free or not. I was happy to contribute to the development of the game as it is still in early stages.\n\nHowever, the community in the game can be considered the downfall of the game. There are some trolls, cheats and people who hate newbies, but after being open to these people many times before (in all sorts of games) I can tolerate their abuse. Most of thime the community will be joking around and having a jolly old time and these matches with trolls don't occur often.\n\nMy advise for anyone thinking of buying this game on steam is to first try the browser edition (that is free) and get a feel for the game first and if you want to help them develop this game then you can either purchase the town points in game of through steam.\n\nTips: Always be involved in the discussion if not you will be deemed suspicious and lynched instantly even if there is no evidence. Choose a different name each game to keep an interest and if playing with freinds keep you identity secret. Also try to be comical with your name or reference something (I tend to reference to things I like e.g. Game of Thrones, Monty Python, WWE ,etc.\n\nTake this game for what it is, not what it isn't and you will enjoy it.

The smell was so intoxicating that I decided to do it again the next night, and the next.  Then on the fourth night I was playing with a lighter thinking how wonderful it would be to see them all go up in flames... so I lit em up.  I knew the town would probably catch me, but I thought, hey the flames are worth it.  But that night there was an even bigger inferno than I expected.  It turned out half the town was burnt to cinders.  And they all left the same death note... which wasn't mine.  Somehow the townies caught on to the other arsonist and lynched him good, and then they thought 'good, we're safe now, we killed the bad guy'.  So I bided my time and doused some quiet ones until there were just four of us left.  I had doused 2 of them already, but I knew the mafia would know who I was the next day if I didn't kill them.  So I took the chance and lit them all up.  And low and behold, the mafia had decided to kill that very same fourth person who was left, leaving me all alone, Queen of the Fire.\n\nSeriously this game rocks, you can play it over and over again and no two games are the same.

That said, as someone who rarely-to-never plays multiplayer games, I was hooked from the moment a friend made me watch him play a match.  This is a game that would be impossible to do single-player, so give it a chance.  Now then:\n\nIt's a little hard to describe the fun of Town of Salem in words.  A match goes roughly like this:  First, you pick a nickname for yourself, so that each player can be anonymous.  Each player in the lobby is then randomly assigned a role.  Each role has different abilities, objectives, and victory conditions.  Some roles are teamed up with each other, some are lone wolves, and some are "neutral" roles that can win with other teams surviving as long as they complete their stated objective.\n\nAt night, players use their abilities (i.e. serial killer murders people, jailor restrains people and interrogates them, investigator can see some others' roles).  Then, during the day, there is a discussion period, then a voting period where the "town" members (i.e. the good guys) try to figure out who the bad guys (killers, mafia, etc.) are and lynch them.  The difficulty and intrigue come from a few factors: A) If you publicly state that you are a powerful town role, you become a big target for the serial killer, mafia, etc.  So, people are very reluctant to give out revealing info the first couple of days.  B) There are roles whose objectives are basically to stir up trouble (ex. the jester's objective is to actually get himself lynched, but then he gets to choose someone who voted him guilty to kill; the executioner wants to get a specific innocent townie lynched, etc.), plus the bad guys don't want to be found out and will happily lie or frame others to keep suspicion off themselves.  So, it's tough to know whom to trust, and careful observation skills (and leaving a detailed will for others!), as well as an understanding of psychology and the game mechanics will make or break you in this game.  My advice is to read up on the roles before playing, as knowing the specific ins-and-outs of each role is very important.\n\nAs with any multiplayer, chat-based (the discussions take place in basically a chat room) game, your enjoyment and success will be largely based upon the personalities and intelligence of the other players in the room, which can be both good and bad.  Also, some people cheat by Skyping each other outside the game, which defeats the whole purpose.  Even with that said, though, the game is still a ton of fun.  The closest experience to it would be (as it says in the description) some sort of mystery party board game.  Each round takes probably 20-30 minues, but with a bunch of roles and game settings to play with, the replayability factor is enormous.  As of writing, I've put about 16 hours in, and I've only owned it for a couple of days.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you like fun!","July 2, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Town of Salem is honestly hands down the best game around the genre of Mafia and Werewolf. With alot of customizations and different unique roles bring a life to the game and it has a decent amount of players.

Your role could be part of the town, like a doctor or a veteran, or part of something much more evil, like a serial killer or a mafia member. The game plays like a metaphorical game of cards. You could be the doctor, and be pressured by everyone else into revealing yourself; if you do, you could become a target for the bad guys, and if you don’t, the town could decide to lynch you.\n\nEach game consists of a day/night cycle. During the day cycle, the players discuss the night’s happening and share their suspicions or evidence an evil character. During the night, everyone’s ability is used. Some abilities kill other players, while others simply block another person’s ability or discover a player’s role.\n\nIf the majority of players agree that a player is evil, then they could vote to put him on trial. When the trail is in progress, the accused can plead a case: then, the town votes if they believe the player is guilty or innocent. If the player is found innocent, the town can vote to put another person on trail. If found guilty, the player will be hanged and the day will immediately end.\n","August 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That said, as someone who rarely-to-never plays multiplayer games, I was hooked from the moment a friend made me watch him play a match.  This is a game that would be impossible to do single-player, so give it a chance.  Now then:\n\nIt's a little hard to describe the fun of Town of Salem in words.  A match goes roughly like this:  First, you pick a nickname for yourself, so that each player can be anonymous.  Each player in the lobby is then randomly assigned a role.  Each role has different abilities, objectives, and victory conditions.  Some roles are teamed up with each other, some are lone wolves, and some are "neutral" roles that can win with other teams surviving as long as they complete their stated objective.\n\nAt night, players use their abilities (i.e. serial killer murders people, jailor restrains people and interrogates them, investigator can see some others' roles).  Then, during the day, there is a discussion period, then a voting period where the "town" members (i.e. the good guys) try to figure out who the bad guys (killers, mafia, etc.) are and lynch them.  The difficulty and intrigue come from a few factors: A) If you publicly state that you are a powerful town role, you become a big target for the serial killer, mafia, etc.  So, people are very reluctant to give out revealing info the first couple of days.  B) There are roles whose objectives are basically to stir up trouble (ex. the jester's objective is to actually get himself lynched, but then he gets to choose someone who voted him guilty to kill; the executioner wants to get a specific innocent townie lynched, etc.), plus the bad guys don't want to be found out and will happily lie or frame others to keep suspicion off themselves.  So, it's tough to know whom to trust, and careful observation skills (and leaving a detailed will for others!), as well as an understanding of psychology and the game mechanics will make or break you in this game.  My advice is to read up on the roles before playing, as knowing the specific ins-and-outs of each role is very important.\n\nAs with any multiplayer, chat-based (the discussions take place in basically a chat room) game, your enjoyment and success will be largely based upon the personalities and intelligence of the other players in the room, which can be both good and bad.  Also, some people cheat by Skyping each other outside the game, which defeats the whole purpose.  Even with that said, though, the game is still a ton of fun.  The closest experience to it would be (as it says in the description) some sort of mystery party board game.  Each round takes probably 20-30 minues, but with a bunch of roles and game settings to play with, the replayability factor is enormous.  As of writing, I've put about 16 hours in, and I've only owned it for a couple of days.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you like fun!","July 2, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

When your account is linked to steam you are able to leave games without getting penalized in-game currency and it really sucks because some people ruin games this way by rage quitting when they are given a bad role.\n","April 8, 2015","true","172.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I remember playing this type of game with my friends back in primary school, it was called Mafia. Anyways on with the actuall review, Town of Salem in steam is just as good as the browser version, but I am sure that the Steam version will be even better. At first I was quite sad and unsatisfied that the Steam actually cost real money, but when I bought it I didn't expect there to a reward for buying the game, which was 1500 Town of Salem funds, which costs the same as the game, so you basicly buy some funds and you get an improved version of Town of Salem. However all the good stuff aside, I am a little unpleased by the lack of new features, I hoped for an exit button to use while in a game.s","December 25, 2014","true","148.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
