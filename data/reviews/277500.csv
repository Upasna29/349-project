You'll setup fields, till them, plant crops, wait, pesticide, harvest and market them. Then repeat the process over and over. There are frills like buildings that let you have animals and others that turn your produce into better products like canned goods. Its all a nice system, but its just monotonous. Even though there is a 100x speed up, there is a lot of downtime during the winter if you don't have 12 month produce.\n\nThe game menu is pretty easy. It consists of options, buy menu, land agreement menu, market menu, contracts menu (which I didn't need once), statistics and the bank. The menus feel click heavy. When you open one menu you need to click close to put it away instead of being able to click something else. The mouse wheel doesn't scroll the game menus. The main screen has a nice ticker at the bottom that tells you when things have finished. The top of the screen has a nice array of your capacity for equipment, storage, cooled storage and grain storage.\n\nThere are three modes to chose from, tutorial, campaign and freeplay. Each one of them starts you off with the same farm. I've played the tutorial three times and somehow never finished it due to the game not recognizing that I did exactly what it asked me to. The campaign and free play are identical except the campaign has a 'rival.' A computer run farm that up until 5 hours in, I never knew it existed. Its not an emphasis. Its just there. There's no competition.\n\nBoth modes have you select the country, difficulty and color of your machines. Then you just play until you lose. If you fall into debt you can get a loan from the bank and the terms you'll repay it. If you can't repay it, that's a game over. If you have no money, you can't hire workers to harvest your crops. The bank will only let you get one loan at a time. The campaign\n\nOn the surface it looks like a Farmville game, but after almost five hours of playing, I'd say its worse. There are fewer clicks in a Farmville game. Luckily in this game you can increase game speed. You can setup a field and make the size of it. Then you need to buy or rent the land for your field. After that, you need to click the field, click to till the land. The game will ask you if you want to buy or rent the equipment. If you have the money, always buy the equipment. If not, renting is cheaper. There seems to be a flat rate for renting. After that, you'll need to fertilize the field and rent or buy the equipment. Once that gets done, you'll need to plant the crop. Luckily you can hire an advisory for a week, but just read the stats on each of the crops. There are dozens of crops to chose from and you'll see how long each of the four life phases take. From a seedling to maturity. The game shows you how much water, temperature each plant needs. If you don't have the conditions it has a ! next to it. Meaning your crop isn't geared toward success.\n\nOnce you select the crop, you need to buy or rent the equipment. After that, you need to wait for the crop to grow into a different phase of its life. You can click to auto water crops that drop below 50% water. If you don't auto water, you'll be clicking over and over again on each field to water it. Then you can use pesticide on it. The choice is yours, organic, or synthetic. Each has its own success rate. The market wants organic, but there is less protection. Then when the crop has entered its next phase, you can use a second dose of pesticide on it and buy or rent the equipment. Eventually, the crop will mature and you'll see a percentage grow and grow. That percentage is how much of the crop has matured. If you harvest at 50% you get 50% of your crop instead of 100%. If you planted your crop too late in a season, it might freeze. So that's the challenge. Finally, you hire workers to harvest the crop. What I mean by hire, just click on an icon and poof it goes right to work harvesting. To harvest a crop, you need the warehouse space. If you don't have the space, buy a bigger warehouse.\n\nNow that you have harvested a crop, you can click the market tab where you sell your crop by sliding a bar and clicking the sell icon. Everything you sell, whether its crops, milk, meat or produce has a market value, which fluctuates like it does in real life. So its a slight gamble. If you want more money, you will have to construct buildings. Fruits and vegetables can be canned or juiced. Flowers can be put into bouquets at a florist. Grains can be baked into bread. Meats can be butchered. Milks can be processed into dairy. Stuff like that. Each building can turn one thing into another thing. Then you sell those things at market.\n\nYou can rotate your crops and have two crops or more per year. Some need to grow from the start spring til the end of summer, so you can fit in a different crop in the fall until the winter freeze. Over the winter is where the waiting comes in. Sure you can grow crops in frigid weather and have most of them die, but you can also wait. When waiting, you can speed things up to 100 times as fast, but at the every month, there is a finances popup that requires you to close it. This seems unnecessary. I should just have the money put into an account. It just makes a long waiting process even longer.\n\nLike crops, you can have livestock too. Horses, cows, chickens, goats and cattle. Construct buildings for them, then highlight the buildings, and select the type of animal to put in there. There's no extra cost for a milk cow building vs a horse stable. Its all the same building, which seems like a forgotten detail. Thankfully you can autofeed animals like you can autowater fields. When the animals get old enough they begin to produce milk and eggs. You can also sell them at that time as well. Animals will mature and grow old where they won't produce, nor will they be as valuable when you market them. The only problem with animals is the fact that their fences break. You'll need to find which building has a broken fence. If you have 10 buildings with animals, you need to click on all them to find which has the broken fence. It happens once a year to each animal building.\n\nOnce you get the rhythm down you can run a successful farm pretty easy. However, with it so successful on a small scale, I didn't feel the need to keep increasing the size of my farm once I was making $100,000 a year off lavender, carrots and milk.\n\nThe game offers a nice sort of progression with stars. For every filed you harvest, you get a star. These stars get used to unlock everything. Better equipment, better workers, plants, animals, buildings. Everything needs to get unlocked. The game starts you with a few stars so you unlock what you want to. Its a nice system, but there's no need to unlock everything when you're making so much profit per year.\n\nWhen you run out of storage, silo or garage space, you'll have to buy more buildings. The game lets you unlock bigger buildings. You can even unlock better machinery and workers. They work faster and have slightly higher percentages, but if the default is 90% efficiency. The cost of stars isn't worth having 100% efficiency even if they work twice as fast. Everything already takes a day. Perhaps giant farms might need that.\n\nWith all that said, the game is just dull. It works well enough, but I don't feel the need to make my farm bigger and better. It lacks scenarios or any variety to make one playthrough different than the next. The only replay value I can think of is your own choice. If you decide to have goats instead of cows. It is a functional game with no frills. No rivals, no challenges, no diversity from one year to the next. The fences will always break. I will always till, fertilize, plant, spray, spray 2x, wait, harvest, market. Over and over. The more fields just means the more work you have to do.","November 21, 2014","false","5.1"," 94 of 108 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","94","108","0","0"

It plays in "real time", but EVERYTHING happens at noon, so there's no point in any other time of day.  It's not even like there's so much to do that your tractors might not complete a field in 24 hours, either.  When the requisite time has been fast forwarded, you punch the "harvest" button, and the picker hoarde zooms through your fields, and you make freakishly large amounts of money.  Rinse and repeat forever.\n\nMany of the game features don't even work.  There are "contracts" where you can take functional missions to supply specific amounts of product by a specific time... but the button to actually complete a contract was never implemented.  There are "rival farmers" you are supposed to "beat", but they basically decide by throwing darts at a chart of options blindfolded.  Basically, all you do is plant crops and harvest, and use the money to buy more fields you can plant more crops within.\n\nThere are also features that exist, but serve no particular purpose.  There is a weather system, with supposed storms coming through (although you can't actually SEE any storms, there are no effects whatsoever but that your crops mysteriously die) but you can't even tell without looking at the weather report menu.  Since there's literally nothing you can do about the weather anyway, though, there's no reason to do anything but fast forward through them.  There is a star-based unlocking system, but that only serves to make sure you have less variety in your game than you already had.  You get stars by harvesting crops, which is the only way you make money, so there's no reason it couldn't have been based upon money, anyway.  It only exists this way because Farmville did it, even though it serves no purpose here. Worse, it hides what the actual money price of something will be until AFTER you pay the star costs.  Hence, you have to plan your management of your farm around having to pay construction and upkeep costs on a factory whose real costs you can't see until AFTER you invested something in it.\n\nThen there are critically lacking features, like being able to see the prices of crops so that you can strategically plan what you are going to sell before you have actually invested all the time and money into growing them.  Yes, that's right, it's a game about picking what crops to grow for the maximum profit *WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA AT WHAT PRICE ANYTHING COSTS OR SELLS*.  The statistics page is utterly useless, as it shows you absolutely nothing of value, like what fields cost what amount of money to grow anything (you have to track that by hand), and what the crops sold for when you did grow them. You have factories that let you turn raw fruit into canned fruit or other similar intermediate or finished products, but there's no comparison of overhead to finished product and raw material selling prices.\n\nThis is a management game where you have nothing to actually manage.  There is no strategy here, all land is basically the same (even fertility differences are just papered over with punching a button to "fertilize field"), the whole map is one flat chunk of arable land, no matter where in the world you set up, and climate, once picked, basically ensures you will spend the whole game raising strawberries or potatoes or corn or whatever ad infinitum.  No thought, just micromanage those buttons to keep sending out tractors to plow, plant, spray, or harvest before fast-forwarding to the next time to do more of the same.\n\nUltimately, the game is like playing Candyland with yourself.  You roll the dice, have random crap happen to you that you can't do anything about, and then eventually progress further down the board and maybe declare "you win" when you get bored... but this game lacks the finish line, so...","November 27, 2014","false","8.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

It has a very noticeable lack of economy compared to other business sims.  This leaves it with only so much depth.  The realism of crop growth is also non-existant.  Maize/Corn for example does not grow well in America.  But what the game lacks in realism and depth, it makes up for in micromanaging!  For crops, you buy/rent a plot of land, plough, plant, choose to pesticide or not (not sure the point of pesticiding in this game), and wait several minutes on full speed for the game to go through a couple months until you can tell it to harvest the crop.  Then you can goto the market and sell it for a seemingly rock bottom price or hire the salesman to sell it for a slightly higher price, but then it might not sell, or take over a year perhaps.  Then you do the same to the next field and so on, don't forget to plough and order seeds again after harvesting, nothing is done for you.\n\nI think the animals are bugged, at least I hope it's a bug and not part of the design.  You have to 'raise' them from infants to adults, and then butcher them or just out-right sell them.  They seem to continually grow, or rather keep their numbers up even during the butchering, but if they get too old you're stuck with them for a few years without anyway to sell them short of demolishing the entire building, which is certainly an option.  I'm not really sure the point of the animals in this game but they sure do bring in money.\n\nIt's hard to say if this is a finished game, hopefully they're still working on it since it feels more like a pre-release alpha game in development.  I was hoping this would be a remake of an old classic, but sadly it isn't even close because of the lack of complexity.  It's more like a game you would expect to see online but with a total lack of quality graphics.","July 8, 2014","false","12.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I'm sure that most anyone who's considering this game has read the other reviews- which nullifies my two cents...but... I have to warn potential buyers anyways. I honestly think Farming Simulator 15 is a better purchase. But all this opinion is useless if I don't say why. So, let me start off. I got this from the Humble Bundle (despite this, still a wonderful organization, I recommend it totally.) Which means I paid what I wanted for it. It wasn't even worth it if I paid a single cent.  The only redeeming factors was that I got other better games from the bundle.\n\nOn a first glance, looks interesting. A nice little farming simulator. I figured I could have some fun, set up some automated chains, so on and so forth until I built a budding farming empire. I pursued this dream for as long as it took to install the game, run it, and then play a bit of tutorial and freeplay. Then, having gotten bored from waiting for my crop to grow, watering it, picking a random pesticide because the game asked me to, and then watch a little harvester make it vanish, and suddenly I had some crops, which I could then click a button to make them turn into money. Maybe...just maybe that would've been acceptable...if that wasn't the entirety of the game. There was no point in doing anything past that. Money was pointless. I could make a new building for something or other, but there wasn't really a reason to. I could try to make more money just for the point of having it, but it's not fulfilling in the slightest. Instead, I'd wish for my time back.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is, the most satisfying thing this game (and from what I've seen, the company in general) can give you is the satisfaction of uninstalling it, and never bothering to install it again. I've not checked the developers forums, or anything of the like, but I see no signs thus far of any developer response to the community, no updates to try and make the game better. Just a quick cash in with a cheap boring game with no substance.\n\nHowever, all that said, all the malice I have for the game said and done, I'm happy to change my opinion and review if the developers provide something to respond to the community- anything to prove that they actually care about the game and its players. Otherwise, don't waste your money on this game. It doesn't deserve it, and its just sending the message that this game and other cash cows can get away with giving the consumers nothing of any real value. It's sh*t, and it's not even good enough to fertilize the cash crops its supposed to bring in.","February 11, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","13","21","3","0"

The first annoying thing you will notice is the camera is lacking. You can't zoom out very far, cannot rotate view, and even on the closest zoom you will strain your eyes just to see your people working. It's not a very flawed game though, and if you like this sort of genre you will definitely have a lot of fun. But, seeing how it borrows heavily from previous farm management sims, you will probably wish you could play those again instead. This game sports some unique features, but at the same time you will wish it had some that were available in older games of this type.

Showing visually how much of a crop is dead or ready to harvest was good, and some of the other informational displays were simple and efficient. But... just not fun.\n\nLots of bugs. I have played for three hours, and I got corrupt ostriches that would not reach maturity as they had a negative number of days to go, a massive field of tulips that were harvested and then disappeared so I couldn't sell them, a missing icon on my field so I didn't know what was planted there, and divide by zero errors everyday just before noon so had to quit that game. Also, whenever I grew animals, there was 0.1 tonnes of meat available but the slider to choose how much to sell confusingly let me choose about 10 values of "zero tonnes" at different prices.\nDistinct Lack of shortcut keys. Was disappointed that the landscape and set up of the initial farming village was identical in UK and USA scenarios.","December 6, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
