Those ideas aren't that special on paper, but the strange mix of climactic locations, fitting music and hand-drawn graphics makes this title not only joy to look and hear, but makes so much impact on the player that after you finish the game you will know that is one of the best indie games out there yet to be recognized by most of gaming community.\n\nThe story is simple, but it is told extremely well by the voice of the main protagonist as you play the game. It starts out interesting, but it ends up strongly heart-touching. The plot is slowly revealed through the game and the next surprise around the corner will be bigger than the former. Also, in my opinion, Naija is one of the best written female characters in video game industry up to date.\n\nAquaria is an open world and you must figure out most of the gameplay mechanics all by yourself. Some tactics for beating some bosses are kind of tricky, so this isn't the game for people that are not so fond of the more exploration-oriented games. The start of this game isn't as fast as you would want to, but if you will give it some time you will be hooked straight to the finish. Game is around 12-20 hours long and there are lots of non-mandatory things to find. This is not a small game by any means.\n\nAquaria had a bad luck that it came before the Braid's indie games boom. Don't miss this one. It's a powerful gem hidden in the sea.","November 25, 2013","true","49.2"," 102 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","102","108","0","0"

Aquaria is a stunningly beautiful metroidvania indie game published back in 2007, but it's still a pearl! I literally dove into it from the moment I started and I really had a blast. I'm very thankful to Jaws for not only trading it with me, but also for recommending it. If you like metroidvanias, indie games and pretty 2D graphics, don't miss this one for nothing! Oh, make sure you play it with a controller, since it's a lot better (except menus, which are easier to navigate with a mouse).\n\nPros:\nOh, where to start....\nVery interesting mechanic, where you can transform into different forms, each with its specialty and abilities that unlock more and more of the world\nA HUGE world for you to explore and swim around\nHas a great, deep story that pushes you to keep going\nLots of treasures, costumes, energy boosts, pets, songs, ingredients and food recipes for you to collect\nI think it's safe to say that its difficulty level is absolutely perfect--not insanely hard, but don't be fooled by the cute graphics, this game is not a walk in the park either\nVery interesting boss fights--while they depend on your skills, they're first and foremost puzzles\nBeing able to fill the map with customizable markers is not only a great feature, but also necessary if you want to master the game without looking (too much on) FAQs\nAbsolutely gorgeous 2D graphics\nAwesome BGM with many different great tracks\nGreat voice acting, even if you compare it to mainstream games\nIf you're into it, there are even some interesting mods, mainly Sacrifice (a story-driven prequel) and Labyrinth (a small sequel focused on, you guessed, a labyrinth map)\nCons:\nAquaria's world is so huge it might take a lot of time when you have to backtrack to explore old areas after acquiring new forms/abilities. There are travel turtles that carry you around (also seahorses you can ride for faster shorter movements), but I think there could've been at least twice as much turtles for a world that size. Also, being able to choose your destiny instead of having to cycle through them would be great. I didn't have to use them a lot, but it was kind of boring when I had.\nControls for when you're out of the water are a bit too clumsy for me. Of course they should be a bit clumsy, since you're supposed to live in the water, but they could've been better.\nBought on / for: I actually traded for another bundle key/link I had.

It’s magical, large and full wonderful things to discover. I have no clue how I got here or why I am the only one besides the normal sea creatures. I am Naija, a beautiful mermaid-like woman, trying to discover the past and find out what happen to everyone else.\n\nAquaria is a 2D underwater adventure where you need to recover your past and find out what happen to everyone else. All other intelligent life seems to have been wiped out and you can’t remember anything. What discoveries and treasures will you find on your large adventure?\n\nYou will discover songs that will give you special powers to help you on your journey. You can get one that will shoot like a fire blast, another which will let you swim against strong currents, or one that will let you light up deep dark caverns. You can earn these by fighting bosses or finding them in hidden caves. You will also need to learn recipes that will help heal you and give your powers a boost. These are all found when dropped from defeated enemies or plants you can pop by certain music tones.\n\nIt’s a beautiful world of varieties of sea creatures that range from friendly to violent. Everything looks really colorful and vibrant. The world under the sea is very large and when you think you’ve discovered everything you discovered another huge area. You’ll have plenty of backtracking to find all the hidden secrets in the old-school Metroid style. Get a new power and go back to a previous area to access new areas.\n\nThere wasn’t really any problems with the game in my opinion. I do wish the final fight was a little better but it wasn’t really an issue. I also wish I was able to zoom in on the map a little more as sometimes it was hard to see where I needed to go. Those are minor issues though and never pulled me out of the experience.\n\nAquaria is a low priced indie game that is superb and wonderful to play. You have a good story with a twist, beautiful world to explore, fantastic music, and many hours of enjoyment. I sank 24hrs into the game and enjoyed every minute of it. There’s also some mods you can download to add more to the game if you’d like.\n\nBear Rating 9.5/10\n","December 9, 2013","true","24.0"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","39","43","0","0"

The truth is, this is my favorite indie game of all time. Minecraft, Gone Home, Bastion, Transistor...nothing can compare to how falling in love with this game felt when I was a young lad.\n\nThe User-defined tags should tell you everything you need to know about the gameplay: Metroidvania-styled level design, 2D underwater adventure, the works. But that's not why I love this game so much. This game is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. From its hand-painted graphics to its organic sounding music, from its triumphant title screen to its emotional ending, from the belly of the whale to the top of the Veil, from its simple controls to its hidden depths, from its quiet emotional moments to its larger-than-life boss battles...everything about this game stirs something within me, something that no game has really ever managed to reach before or since.\n\nIf you're jaded about the glut of early access ZombieSim Survivorsims, artsy-fartsy walking around simulators, blocky beep-boop bullet hell shooters that anyone could make, you owe it to yourself to play Aquaria.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/24420/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: Beautiful medroidvania-style exploration action-adventure in a mysterious aquatic setting with moderate combat system and fresh-feeling story.\n\nWorld of wonders\nAquaria is a hidden yet rough gem: it's got a beautiful shell that sweeps your legs off, overwhelms you with its enormous world and then drowns you in to its wonderful setting. Frankly, I was unaware it even existed before I started seriously playing through my Library to discover just hidden gems like this. I wonder how it could have flown under my radar for so long. On with the review:\n\nIn Aquaria you play as Naija, a barely feral humanoid sea creature with magic singing powers and vague memory of her earlier life. Curiosity gets hold of her and she heads to the outside world to see its wonders. The world proves to be both a beautiful and a grim place. Aquaria plays like a medroidvania but (almost) entirely in an aquatic environment, thus requiring none of the usual platforming skills.\n\nFor starters, the game is astonishingly beautiful, in both cut scenes and in-game. Aquatic environment is a tranquil place, full of weeds, plants and critters, many of them malicious. Soundtrack is nice and fits the theme marvellously. Voice acting is surprisingly good for a game with (almost) only the lonesome main character articulating by herself. It is used excellently to set the mood of mystery and wonder. The game encourages you to just hang around in its calm, alien world. Sometimes, an eerie, malicious laughter in the distance breaks the illusion of tranquility - who is that and why is he laughing?\n\nJust about everything about the storyline and setting is tightly knitted into the lore and many things only become clear close to the end. The intro cut scene itself is confusing as its significance only becomes apparent late into the game.\n\nSo much to see...\nIn the beginning a while is spent simply exploring the limited area and trying to figure out what to do. The ever-present exploration aspect is both cool and dull: while the environment is pretty and contains a lot of interesting features and stuff to find, the whole scope of it is initially overwhelming. It takes a while to get through the slow start. Fortunately there's a map and you can easily mark interesting/unreachable areas.\n\nLike expected in a good medroidvania, it takes a while to find out how to use the environmental features to your advantage and find a means to proceed into the areas previously unreachable. This makes returning to the known areas rewarding.\n\nTo reach those areas Naija may learn to take different forms that grant her special abilities like shooting homing fire bolts or fitting into tight spaces. The forms (and a couple of spells) are accessed through singing magic, though there are keyboard shortcuts for the numerous forms. The special abilities are used also in combat.\n\nSo much to fight...\nFighting is simple, almost to a point of dull: shoot until enemy dies, sometimes removing/destroying the shield first, and avoid getting hit by projectiles or touched by enemies. It works but it sure could use some twists. The enemies are invariably sea creatures of various kinds but bosses are sea monsters or downright fallen gods of enormous size.\n\nBoss monsters (which are a dozen) usually require one to make them expose their weak spot in some way and then shooting it as fast as you can. In effect fighting some bosses is more like a puzzle into itself as you look for their weak spot and study their attack patterns, which are just 2-3 per boss. Many bosses have also a fascinating background in the lore, though some are just nasty creatures who want to kill you.\n\nThe later bosses are better and more challenging (even difficult), while the earlier ones might be killed simply by dodging or blocking their bullet storm-like attacks and shooting like a madman. The later bosses may take several tries to survive, especially the final boss who has several forms and no saves between.\n\nThe scarcity of save points is a major fault: with the long distances between areas and the menacing world one would hope for frequent saves but there's usually just one per area. While death does not happen too often, when you do die you lose all progress since the last save, which can be infuriating if it was a while back. It also forces for rather long game sessions since you don't always know when you can save the next time. Food crafting, i.e. cooking, can be used to create healing and buff items that can sometimes help through the most dangerous situations to avoid losing progress.\n\nIt's not a perfect place\nThe world of Aquaria is an enormous place with several biomes from amazing reed forests to fallen aquatic cities to pitch-dark caves. Several times I would just stop momentarily and enjoy the marvellous vista.\n\nWhile mostly placed underwater, there are a couple of less-than traditional platforming sections later into the game. Wall-jumping is unfortunately way unreliable, especially since the same mechanic is used to travel on land. There's no way (that I could see) to control the strength of the pounces, making it hard to judge where Naija would land. Good news is that these sections are mostly optional and sparse.\n\nAnother qualm but a stupid one at that: it took me over an hour to get the first achievement, granted for reaching open waters. Aquaria could well have been more generous with achievements, especially in the beginning but also at the end, where you e.g. don't get one for beating the game or seeing the secret ending.\n\nYet it is graceful\nNevertheless, after 20 hours I had completed the game and found all the secrets, though a few treasures remain hidden (why no cheevo for collecting them all?). Game had three instances where I unfortunately needed to use a walkthrough because I had totally missed the sheer existence of the puzzle despite them hiding in plain sight.\n\nTo be fair in two of the cases I felt like a fool afterwards for missing them. Perhaps in a less hectic age I would have had the patience to loiter around and eventually figure them out myself. The third one, however, was well put by the guide I read as "one of the least obvious puzzles ever" and I doubt I would have ever come across its solution except by sheer accident.\n\nThe atmosphere was tranquil throughout and I found myself being relaxed in all but the tensest of situations. The storyline (with the secret ending) was surprisingly grim and contains a cliffhanger. Unfortunately, a true sequel is unlikely since the devs have gone their separate ways, but the mod community is producing a spiritual sequel[www.bit-blot.com].\n\nReminiscent of some beautiful adventure games of old, after the slow start I enjoyed it tremendously despite its flaws. I encountered only a couple of crashes during the whole playthrough, both after several hours of playing. Game has aged well (being 8 years old at the moment). Though there are good sales for it one might even get it for its current full price (10 €) - it is only a shame it doesn't have Cards since I would gladly create a badge to show my support.","November 18, 2015","true","20.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quintlindwurm/recommended/24420/","quintlindwurm","Quint the Globular Springtail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quintlindwurm/","324 products in account","A quite expansive underwater adventure, with a gameplay emphasis on exploration, and an aesthetic focus on atmospherics, which are done very, very well.  You play as a lone character who seeks to uncover the truth about her past and the secrets of the world around her.  Her characteristic ability is being able to sing magical songs that grant her abilities.\n\nThe game is very well-designed under the vein of letting the you, the player, figure things out on your own, and make your own discoveries.  There are many features that are not outright explained, but are revealed to you if you wish to discover them, and this includes both narrative and gameplay features (e.g. decoding the Aquarian script, and riding seahorses).  This arrangement fits very well with the narrative.  The game also works well as a pick-up-and-play experience, with little needed in the way of previous genre or gameplay experience, which is nice (and also fits with  this of gradual discovery).\n\nThe narrative, a story about gradual discovery of the past, the truth, and the meaning of one's own life, is also very nice.  It's not too wordy, which is appropriate for a story like this one that's introspective.  I felt the story was a little weak at the end, but the music and art made up for it.  In any case, the game serves well the principle of "show, don't tell".\n\nThe soundtrack is very brilliant, beautiful, and memorable.  For music theory geeks like me, it may be a little sparse on diversity of tonalities, but there's a reason for that, and that's to make the music match up to the singable tones.  Fun fact: if you can recognize keys, you might also catch when Naija sings different tones.  For another fun activity, pick out the leitmotifs.\n\nThe art is very detailed, and also very beautiful.  Most of the areas are simply gorgeous to look at.  You might even find yourself sitting on a chair or a rock and taking in the scenery and soundtrack.  Character animations may be a tiny bit stiff at times, but that is a negligible issue considering the sheer beauty of the art.  It unfolds like a fairy tale...\n\nFor those of you who feel that there ought to be some more combat in the game -- well, there certainly is; one of the earliest abilities you get is a combat ability, and there are certainly many enemies to fight later on, including several pretty difficult bosses.  Though you may find yourself asking philosophical questions about the role of combat, as I did...\n\nThere's also an item crafting system wherein you can "cook" ingredients to get food items that can do healing or temporarily boost abilities.  It's also quite extensive, and has many opportunities for discovery through experimentation if you're interested in that.\n\nBacktracking in this game is a little tedious at times, but you later on get abilities that allow faster movement, so I suggest waiting on backtracking until you get those.  Keep in mind that the map allows you to set multiple colored markers indicating features that you'd like to return to -- which is a really, really nice thing that I actually haven't yet seen another metroidvania game do.\n\nTL;DR much to explore, much to discovery, brilliant top-notch atmospherics.  Definitely recommended.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Humble Introversion Bundle.)","April 13, 2015","true","38.4"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","33","38","2","0"

The two big achievements you need to keep in mind is the achievement for exploring all areas of the game and learning all recipes of the game. I'd recommend working on both from the start since otherwise you will be on a very long hunt at the end of the game to figure out what you missed (I did this, and it took me ages to narrow down what I needed).\n\nTime to 100%: 15-20 hours","February 2, 2014","true","26.4"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/recommended/24420/","strangemodule","strangemodule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/","339 products in account","**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS**\n\nFlawed. This game is flawed as hell. Aquaria does a lot of things excellently, but also flounders on principle gameplay mechanics. For these reasons, I find it very difficult to decide if I want to give this game a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down.\n\nUltimately, I will say Yes to recommending this game, but before you buy this, you need to ask yourself a few things. Do you enjoy the Metroidvania subgenre? Would you get great enjoyment out of exploration and appreciating the varied and well-done aesthetics? Would this enjoyment mean you could tolerate very long travel times between places you need to be while doing simplistic, shallow combat? If this sounds appealing to you, then buy Aquaria. $10 is a bargain.\n\nAlright, down to the specifics.\n\nI'll start with what I liked about the game, which is primarily the aesthetics. Aquaria, bar none, blows every other game I've ever played in my 20+ years of playing games out of the water when it comes to underwater levels. The game boasts a huge variety of marine biology, both plant and animal life. Each major area of the game has its own unique feel and theme, with unique sealife to match. I don't think I can recall any enemies that looked like an iterative version of an earlier one, even if some enemy's behaviors are similar. This game simply wows when it comes to the underwater places you'll go.\n\nThe music, while not quite the best I've heard for an indie game, gets the job done nicely. Each track is pleasant to listen to and generally fits the theme of the area you're in, even if they can be a bit too upbeat at times. Boss battle music feels a bit too quiet, but it's not the worst I've heard.\n\nNaija, voiced by Jenna Sharpe, impressed me with her consistently good voice work for the game. Although the majority of the lines involve the main character talking to herself, she puts forth enough emotion to stop from sounding bored, and gives enough conviction to the more stressful moments for Naija to sound believable. Considering how bad many video games' voice acting is, this voicework was a breath of fresh air.\n\nUnfortunately, Aquaria frustrated me when it came down to its gameplay mechanics, or at least the "feel" of them. The game, being a Metroidvania, primarily involves exploring and fighting things. Neither of these felt great to me, and it's for a few specific reasons.\n\nExploring the game's areas, as well as figuring out where to go, became tedious for me quickly and didn't really stop until the end. Aquaria, like many games in its subgenre, doesn't tell you exactly where to go next. Naturally, that means both wandering and using process-of-eliminiation to find your next desination, and those are big draws to playing games like these. However, this game makes those very tedious to go through due to both the huge size of the zones as well as the twisty, maze-like caverns that connect them. The minimap zooms in too much to the map, so I had to keep reopening my main map in order to not get lost. Furthermore, many times I sighed in frustration as I realized I'd have to cross a huge, enemy-filled zone in order to check if one spot on my map would lead me to somewhere relevant.\n\nNormally, this wouldn't be too big an issue, if the game provided fast travel. Well, Aquaria does, but it involves finding turtles who will take you to another turtle's position, and you have to find at least two of these spots before you can use it. The turtles are spread few and far between, and often off the beaten path of a zone. Therefore, there may as well not be any fast travel present for the majority of one's time in the game.\n\nAs for the combat, unfortunately I found it lukewarm. Early on you get the ability to shoot lasers at enemies, but enemies have so much health that swimming past them is typically a better solution. This gets especially annoying when you have to deal with enemies whose projectiles chase you down until you do a 180 so they disappear or crash into the wall, or have enemies who will chase you down and can actually keep up with you. Combine that with the game's lack of health items early on and it's very annoying. As a side note, using said ability doesn't really feel nice either. The attack has a very quiet noise, and enemies simply disappear when they die. It's not very satisfying at all.\n\nThe one exception to this I have is during some boss battles. Although most bosses are puzzle bosses (where you have to do a certain action to do damage to the boss), the all-out combat bosses were pretty fun! They felt like a bullet hell or SHMUP that involved both shooting endless amounts of projectiles at the enemy while dodging their deadly attacks. Honestly, it got quite intense and I enjoyed those moments a lot.\n\nThe other boss battles though...it depends. As I said above, the other ones are primarily puzzle bosses, which means they challenge you to figure out how to damage the boss or make it vulnerable to attack. No spoilers on this, but the bosses ranged from "I had to think about this for a few minutes" to "how in the world am I supposed to figure that out?". Have no shame if you need a walkthrough for these, as the clues for what to do on them are very vague.\n\nGranted, I say all these things as someone who doesn't typically play Metroidvanias. Considering the high amount of positive reviews this game has, I imagine people haven't found these to be as serious issues as I, or disagree with my interpretation of them. Regardless, please note that if you buy Aquaria, you're going to be going into it for the atompshere and exploration, and the combat is mostly passable.\n\nIn the end, I'd say if you find the game interesting and you enjoy Metroidvanias, I'd say try it. Perhaps this game is not my typical "cup of tea", as the phrase goes.","May 12, 2015","true","12.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","2"

That means you are free to roam around, but full exploration is only possible through finding upgrades that will allow you to get through certain obstacles that you couldn't before. The world is immense and there's a lot of backtracking to be done but the gorgeous graphics and different themed locations, not to mention the masterfully crafted soundtrack, do a great job at minimizing the tediousness. The upgrades themselves are pretty cool, though their usefulness vary and some feel underwhelming compared to others, even though the same can be said about the parent games of this genre. The controls are very responsive and all of the character's moves can be done with just the mouse if the player so desires. The combat is very energetic and being underwater allows for a ton of dodging, which you will have to become proficient at to get through this game since the screen can get quite busy with projectiles and enemies at times and your character can't take a lot of beating. This difficulty can be severely mitigated by the ability to cook many kinds of food, as several of them heal your character, increase her defense capabilities, or even both depending on the kind of food itself. There is a plethora of secrets to find (some useful like cooking recipes and pets that will fight for you, some just aesthetic like costumes), the rarest of them often protected by optional bosses, all of which will very well push the playtime past 15 hours if pursued at a normal pace.\nOverall it's an excellent game in my opinion; It hits the right notes in all technical aspects, has an interesting story and a very satisfying amount of exploration and content.

Much better than your typical "girl gets kidnapped guy saves her and kills antagonist".\n•Lots of hours of gameplay. The first hour or so is kinda slow, but from there on, I loved it every second. As far as I can tell, you'll get about 18-24 hours.\n•There's forms, and forms are always good. Sing songs to go into different forms and beat stuff up!\n•Soundtrack's great. Self explanitory.\n•Graphics are good, I'd have had no idea that it was made in 2007 if I didn't check when I saw it on the store.\n•I'm not gonna say the game's easy, but it's not entirely hard either.

I encountered maybe a single bug max throughout the entire game, but it was only involving an achievement, which then unlocked when I killed another boss. In short, I'd say it's almost like a mix between Zelda, Metroid, and Castlevania.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/24420/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","What is the reason we fall in love with a game? Is it the visuals that are aesthetically pleasant and utilize some original style? Or is it the world, the story, the characters? Maybe the biggest thing is gameplay mechanics, or if we speak about metroidvania genre in particular the complexity of the vast map and its clever design, which makes nearly every path valid and interesting? That matters a lot if a developer can not only make a bunch of interesting locations separated by obstacles that require special abilities or items to pass them, but also performs a miracle of guiding you through it without showing direction with a giant red arrow on the map. Feeling not lost, but intrigued like a true discoverer traversing unknown grounds — that matters a lot. And Aquaria has all of that and more. It has voice and sound. Beautiful and soothing voice of the protagonist narrating events throughout the game being as clueless as the player. And a truly amazing soundtrack, which is not just some “accompanying music”, but a masterpiece on its own. It stands out like a pearl lying on the ocean’s floor shining against the background of dull sand.\nAnd it has one fatal truly hurting me flaw, which makes me love this game even more. That must be stupid — to love something because of the defect, one might think. But this one is special. Aquaria ends on a high note with a cliffhanger of such enormous proportions, that the fact that sequel most probably wouldn’t happen ever makes me sad ‘till the present day. A craftsmanship of just two guys, it came out in 2007, and it has been 7 years since then. Bit Blot studio is effectively defunct. Derek Yu created wonderful Spelunky, and Alec Holowka composed a lot of wonderful soundtracks for a number of games and collaborated on various projects, ultimately launching the successful Kickstarter campaign for a Night in the Woods, which looks very promising. To tell you the truth, the story of an underwater journey is still very much satisfying, it closes script arch in a wonderful way, with a proper resolution and sensible ending. It’s just that final little itty-bitty glimpse, that promises more of Aquaria to come, that sticks to my brain. And I can’t let go. Among hundreds of games that I played it’s the one I easily can name as one of the most beloved.\nBut obviously that moment in the end wouldn’t irritate me if the game itself was mediocre. So let’s talk about it for a moment, instead of grieving the never-happening-sequel. You play as Naija. You can call her a mermaid, I suppose; except she doesn’t really have that fish-like scale tail and looks more like a green-skinned girl with flippers and strange ears. So, she breathes underwater and even is able to “sing”. This is actually the main form of interaction with the world. For the most part the heroine can’t affect game objects directly. Different tunes perform different actions like lifting or shielding. But they all change “form” of Naija giving her offensive, defensive and various other abilities. In order to perform a melody the player has to select the right order of color-coded tones. Technically you are bound to do it only once, when learning it for the first time. After that you can use it with a hotkey, but then you’ll miss the one tiny detail: tones actually change depending on the region you are in. And that may not be the exact detail that makes Aquaria so great, but it is a great example of how vast the game is. Honestly: you can’t just point a finger at a single thing here and say, that it’s the most important — they all are. From the glorious warm waters of near-surface areas to the chilling thrills of deepest abyss this game just doesn’t stop to surprise. A very simplistic beginning that reflects Naija’s life as “a simple creature” in her own words transforms and grows like an underwater life itself becoming more and more complex, throwing in more mechanics, more songs, more pieces of backstory. It simply isn’t possible to draw a line here. Where does the story end and the gameplay begin? Where does the world transform into a form of a narrative? It’s just one whole engaging thing. I guess this is the best possible result for metroidvania, especially the one which starts with a phrase “The Verse binds us, narrator and explorer; my story will become your own, and yours will become mine.”\nBut you don’t know what The Verse is yet, do you? That is the force that runs through all the Aquaria (yes, game’s world has the same name as the game itself), every living being contains small part of this power, and it can be guided with rhythms and music. This seemingly peaceful concept can deceive you in the beginning into the feeling that all of the game would be careless joy and swimming around looking at the beautiful scenery. Well, in a way it is, but as you path goes down into the darkness closer to the ocean bed the grim secrets of game’s world become uncovered. What starts as seemingly aimless journey started out of curiosity turns out to be an epic tale about extinct races, gods gone mad and ultimately finding out what this all was about… except that last tiny bit, of course, but you already know that, and it shouldn’t bother you for now. Because there’s a whole world ahead of you, don’t miss an opportunity to visit it.","June 30, 2014","true","15.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/recommended/24420/","fortheussr","chairbender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortheussr/","342 products in account","While not without its merits, this game has lots of problems that make it an overall unpleasant experience. I ended up quitting my playthrough at the clay golem boss (the one that the ghost child creates).\n\nART\nFirst of all, the art is probably one of the most impressive features of the game. All of the different areas are very beautiful. Unfortunately, the effect of this is lessened by the less-than-stellar pivot based animation style. A lot of the scripted movements of the characters (for example during cutscenes) look very awkward and unnatural, which hurts the beautiful aesthetic that the art tries to convey. Even some of the movements during normal gameplay just don't look believable. It just looks like characters are sliding around on the screen instead of propelling themselves through the water (which is one of the things that makes aquatic life so interesting to look at in real life).\n\nBut what really matters most in a game is whether the gameplay is fun, so I'll focus on that now.\n\nEXPLORATION\nThe game is called a "metroidvania" in the sense that, while it is a platformer, it is designed so that you spend your time exploring the environment and not being "on rails" playing through "levels". I can understand how someone who spent time playing games like Metroid would enjoy the nostalgiac appeal of that design, but I just think that, overall, it's not a very enjoyable way to spend your gaming time. The root of my complaint with the exploration is this: there's so many games out there that provide a constantly enjoyable experience, so why would you spend valuable hours of your life wandering around with no clue what to do when you could instead be playing something where you're constantly feeling engagement and enjoyment. Can you honestly say that you had fun swimming through an area that you've already seen, having to fight the same enemies, and hearing the same short music loop over and over again? If I spend an hour trying to figure out what weird action I need to do to advance the story, that's an hour I could've spent playing something more consistently fun (like Tetris, in my case), especially if the emotional payoff for advancing the story isn't very high.\n\nI'll go into more detail on the issues with exploration in this game. A lot of the things you need to do to progress seem very cryptic, and not in a clear-cut "puzzle game" sort of way (like trying to slide blocks around to get to an exit, for example), but in an ambiguous "guess what the devs want you to do" sort of way. At the beginning of the game, it's pretty straight forward and I don't really have anything to complain about. You essentially get new abilities which act as keys to get you to areas that were previously locked (the Bind ability lets you move stones, the Energy Form lets you open Pearl gates, and the Beast ability lets you swim against currents). The way that the map works makes it obvious to you which areas you haven't explored yet, which means you don't waste much time wandering around. However, after you get all the various forms, it starts to go dowhill. Throughout the game, though, there's times where you'll waste time having unknowingly taken a turn towards an area you're not supposed to get through and having to waste time backtracking.\n\nI only was able to tolerate the exploration by occasionally referring to a guide to make sure I was going in the right direction. I didn't want to waste my precious hours of game time taking a wrong turn to an area I'm not supposed to be at yet and having to backtrack and take a different turn towards some other area. I envy people who feel they have so much free time that they can enjoy an experience like that.\n\nMUSIC\nThis game was praised for its music, but I'm not quite sure that the praise is that deserved. If you listened to the soundtrack by itself, I'm sure it would be enjoyable. But, in the context of the game, there's several key issues. The root problem is that the design of the music causes listening fatigue (which basically means that the music gets annoying and hurts the enjoyability of the game).\n\nFirst, most of the song tracks are quite short, meaning you're going to hear the same song over and over again as you explore an area (which will happen a lot, because it is an exploration game). Second, music is played pretty much all the time. There's few moments where you are only hearing the peaceful ambiance of the water, and they are quite pronounced because they're such a relief in the face of constant, repetitive songs. Finally, the songs themselves are "loud". I mean this in the sense that there's not many moments where there's quiet parts or sparse, ambient parts in the songs.\n\nCOMBAT\nCombat is generally frustrating. Many of the boss battles are nothing more than "swim around and shoot them and hope the many projectiles on the screen don't hit you, and eat healing items and hope you win". There's nothing really fun in that except a sense of relief when you manage to get a victory. A few bosses require you to use your various forms and abilities, and that's okay, but they still tend to be frustrating in a way that has you complaining about the design of the game and not analyzing your own tactics to prepare for the next attempt. I ended up quitting where I did because there was a bug where a projectile you needed to fire to defeat the boss wouldn't move in any direction and would just sit there where you initially fired it (instead of traveling where I was aiming), combined with a weird issue where my camera would start going crazy, and a poor design that made it so you had little window to avoid the bosses attacks. Also, you had to go through a pointlessly lengthy sequence where you build the boss every time you want to re-attempt it, which isn't fun at all. Why not just let me save before the boss is completed? Why would anyone want to waste their time doing that?\n\nThroughout the game, the combat with the enemies isn't very fun either. A particularly glaring issue is that the screen doesn't show enemies that you need to see in order to avoid them. Some enemies will be firing fast projectiles at you or jumping at you from the edges of the screen, leaving you no time to dodge them. Simply zooming out or not having enemies attack you when they are a certain distance from you might've helped this, but there really isn't much to be done for a combat system that just involves swimming around and right clicking a bunch. A lot of the enemies take a lot of hits to defeat, so you'll be right clicking constantly during combat. Due to how movement works, dodging enemy attacks isn't very easy, even if you know what you want to do. You have the ability to do a quick dash, but I feel like the cooldown on the dash isn't enough to make it possible to avoid damage when there's a group of enemies attacking you. Precise control is also difficult using the mouse and keyboard - you either use the mouse and sacrifice precise stopping and starting, or use the keyboard and sacrifice fine directional control. Movement feels generally sluggish due to the considerable acceleration, which further hurts combat.\n\nOverall, this game just has bad fun/minute when compared to the variety of options we have in 2014.\n","October 12, 2014","false","6.8"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","46","83","0","7"

For some reason, I had the idea that it was some sort of casual low-key exploration game. But actually, after finally playing (and finishing) it, that couldn't have been any further from the truth! Aquaria is actually a semi-hardcore game in the classic "Metroidvania" style... and this couldn't have made me happier, as Metroid is one of my all time favorite series, and I am also fascinated by all things "underwater", which is where the vast majority of Aquaria takes place. So take it from me, if you have ever played and liked a game like Metroid or Castlevania, this game is a no-brainer. Seriously, just get it. I was also extremely impressed by its quality (art, design, music, scope), especially for being made by such a small team.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/recommended/24420/","TormakSaber","[LUE] TormakSaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/","509 products in account","Aquaria is a beautful underwater game that feels very much like a mixture of Ecco the Dolphin and Super Metroid. If you're not familiar with the Metroidvania styele of game,s it involves  avast, open world where the player is given, generally, very little direction of where to go, with the only obstacles being environments or passages thta the player cannot explore due to needing to unlock abilities, find items, leanr amgic, or what have you.\n\nAquaria does this through songs, which lets you transform into other forms giving you new abilities, like energy blasts, faster swimming, or the ability to project light into darkness. The world is larger than I expected, and comprised of several distinct areas that run the gamut from the Kelp Forest, to a Sunken City, to the Veil, which should be seen in game to be properly experienced. Luckily, the game lets you put down as many checkpoints as you want, to let you mark down places you can't quite get to yet, or areas you might want to come back to later. If you want to collect veeyrthing, you'll be backtracking quite a bit.\n\nMusic is a focal point in the game, and so it's not surprising that Aquaria has fantastic music. The graphics are pretty for what they are, and the bit of voice acting in the game is good as well. Most of the songs seem to ebe a variation of the game's main theme, which becomes a point touched on in the game's plot later.\n\nThe game has tons of optional content, areas, and bosses, which lets you find either new optional forms, new costumes for Naija, the adventurer, or simply little trinkets that sit in your home that make the place look nicer and sometimes add little creatures to the area. The little touches like thsis bring the game from being good to much better.\n\nCombat gets very 'shmupy/bullet helly' at times, and sometimes boils down to chugging healing items (which are made through a very robust recipe and cooking system - actually pretty neat!) and blasting away as fast as your right mouse button will let you click.\n\nIf I had any qualms with the game, it's that it feels like the fast travel is just few and far enough between to where you do a lot of swimming around, but if you get good at wall-boost chaining (and you will) a lot of this is mitigated. There's also a few moments where how to proceed is not immediately apparent, and it's only after i tried everything that i realized what the hint telling me what to do was actually supposed to be. The game also runs off of a save-point system, with no checkpoints in between, so a feath can force you to replay a bit more of your previous progress than you might like. This isn't a huge issue typically, though there is one optional boss that's quite a trek from a save point to get to, and isn't very easy to top it off.\n\nFinally, the last problem: The game ends on a huge cliffhanger, and we will never see a sequel, more than likely. Oh well.\n\nFantastic game, and I would heavily recommend it","November 28, 2014","true","15.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/recommended/24420/","TheDarkStorm","๖ۣۜR3BORN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/","346 products in account","Aquaria is a 2D action/adventure "platformer" (for lack of a better word), that blends stunning visuals and fluent controls with an incredibly emotional storyline about one girls journey of self discovery, newfound freedom; and her self motivated journey to find the existential answers to her questions about life: about who she is, what she is, and why she exists.\n\nAquaria dazzles with it's vibrant and artistic underwater setting, beautifully realized locations such as post-civilization ruins, coral reefs, trenches, and open stretches of water - complete with all the signs of life one would normally see, albeit life full of fantasy elements. Aquaria's atmosphere exudes despair, hope, and the sense that not all is as it once was, or should be...\n\nIn the end, Aquaria is a glittering gem of a product, a perfect example of what two very talented and passionate developers can do with their hard earned time away from reality, and is a result well worth every penny of it's current asking price. I highly recommend Aquaria for it's excellence, and all the praise I can muster for it's creative duo at Bit Blot!","February 1, 2011","true","24.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Its fun, it has a variety of things to do, lots of bosses and minibosses, plus a beautiful world to explore and all kinds of things to find.  Ive played it through a few times and each time i find a hidden something i missed before.  I also would like to express my love for the music and sound fx.  I feel like someone put a lot of time into that part of the game.   The game itself progresses very well if you keep up on your food and cooking.  I do wish i could have stored more food in my inventory though.  It forced me to keep stopping and cooking so I would not be picking up drops for nothing.  I think that is intentional though.  I can think of a few reasons it might be that way, still frustrating.  Over all this is in my top most played games even though its a simple sidescroll game.  Good animation, good progressiveness, neat story.

I entered the gaming world later than most, & wasn't expecting such freedom. The music, artwork, & sheer amount of room I had to explore & challenge foes entranced me. I put over 50 hours into the demo without a second thought, despite the fact that it only allowed me access to two forms & a few areas. Everything from the battle system to cooking items to regain health & create effects was new to me, & I adored every moment of it.\n\nThe work that has gone into this game's artwork (much of which is done in watercolour) & music creates an environment that can shift from carefree to ominous in moments. Nadja's form, the environments she explores, & the creatures she battles are unique & beautiful-- & sometimes terrifying.\n\nI own both the computer version & the iPad versions of this game, & the switch from keyboard controls to touch is seemless & inspired. I highly recommend the iPad version for individuals who want to connect with the game kinetically.\n\nWhat stands head & shoulders above all other elements of this game, though (in my opinion), is the soundtrack. Each song is crafted to evoke a sense of wonder, fear, or joy with exceptional results, to the point that encountering silence creates the sense that something integral to the game is absent. To this day, I haven't encountered music that fit so well with a game's surroundings & personality. Above all, Aquaria's music is what creates the atmosphere I keep returning to, even years later.\n\nWhile the developers have moved onto different projects, & don't plan to make a sequel, mods exist that expand the game's areas, making it worthwhile to download them. I'll always want to see a sequel, but part of me acknowledges that any follow-up to this game would likely fall flat in comparison.\n\nMy final recommendation is that you should buy this game, especially if you have a soft spot for atmosphere & exploration, And of course, incredible music. Aquaria's kept me entertained & inspired for years now, & never disappoints.","April 17","true","32.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On your journey you'll explore a vast world with a wonderful map system and great variety of environments, dungeons and creatures.  Many challenging boss battles, with a final battle sequence that's one of the best I've seen in an indie game, await you.\n\nYou'll fast travel across a vast ocean on turtles, explore islands in the sun and a seemingly bottomless abyss where the light doesn't reach.  Discover seven other forms to shift into at will, which allow you access to additional combat and utility abilities, new areas and secrets.  You'll race on seahorses, find pets, meet a companion and unearth treasure to wear and decorate your home with. Minor enemies drop components used for cooking, which is how you'll heal yourself and boost your stats.\n\nThere's a singing system for shifting forms but you can shift instantly with the number keys once the novelty wears off.

The overall serenity and sense of isolation of Aquaria really makes someone like myself stop seeking to patent a solvent spitter (patent pending) to ponder. “Be grateful to have those who love and care for you; such a thing is often rare and those who’ve never felt it grow weary and unfulfilled,” says a voice in your head. “What? I was distracted by the thought of brown ‘n shootan with my bros later today,” you say, never to hear it again until a new generation just wished you would die because you’re increasing National debt to pay your expensive medication (Good job on that, by the way).

I wasn't really a big tablet/phone gamer, but Aquaria looked fascinating, and I love me some Metroidvania, especially when it's done right as so many devs fail at. I was never really into PC games until I found out about Steam, i loved the idea of having an Xbox Live Arcade like system, and I had always heard of it but never knew what it was until recently. I was surprised to find how many games I loved that were on here, and when they do deales on things, it can make you want to buy a bunch of stuff. I HAD to buy Skyrim Deluxe pack even though I have it on 360 and with all DLC, I wanna see what kind of improvement my new PC will make.\n\nAnyways as for Aquaria, if you like Metroidvania games, this is the game to buy, it takes place underwater but like any real Metroidvaniaa style game you have to power up and collect items to get to certain areas you've passed. It was so easy to control on iPad, I imagine the PC would be just as easy if not more so.","June 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm not sure if this is because I've only played a short time and haven't unlocked a lot of things, but I just couldn't stay hooked on it.\n\nThe actual gameplay and controls are different to most games, and a little average at times when I found myself clinging to a wall when I didn't want to be there.\n\nAnother downfall of the game is the mostly black area that surrounds your screen and the game world a lot of the time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/24420/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","Aquaria, the other indie game by bit blot, is a 2D Action Adventure game that has the feel of a Zelda game.  What I mean by having the feel of a Zelda game is that in this game there is a large open area that allows the player to go anywhere that you can go providing you have the proper unlocks or tools. In this case it is her [Naija’s] Song forms. These allow her to do different things needed to get to certain parts. One of the downsides to this is that this game doesn’t really give a clear direction of where to go. You start at a certain point and you are told to just go. In a way I appreciate the game for not hand holding me like so many AAA titles of recent but on the other I got bored at times trying to swim around and find where I needed to go next.\n\nThe main character in this game is called Naija but in the beginning that is all she knew about herself, her name. You travel on through the world of Aquaria trying to find what happened to everyone else. In the process you slowly learn that the “Creator” created different races and for whatever reason became jealous of them and destroyed all of them but those races Gods. Each time you find the different Gods you find out a little more about your past and who this “Creator” really is. Eventually Naija comes across Li, who I can only assume is a human, that when she pulls of his helmet she has to kiss him in order to keep him alive and learn about him. Naija keeps mentioning that she is finally not alone but several instances of him being kidnapped by the Creator gets her angry and fights towards an inevitable final confrontation with him, the Creator.\n\nThe gameplay isn’t too much different from that of say Darksiders or Zelda: Majora’s Mask where each form of Naija’s gives her unique abilities and allows her to progress through the game.  But unlike in those games in order to change forms she has 8 notes that when she sings a certain set of them it changes her into one of those forms. I would say this is a pretty unique gameplay mechanic if it wasn’t for the fact that you can just hit 1-8 on the keyboard to change forms as you learn it. Though this does make it easier it also takes away from a unique mechanic that could have really added to the game. However there are certain times where you need to either use songs you know or songs that appear in the game to progress including games of Simon Says.  Her different forms include Song form (her standard singing form), Energy form(She can fire energy to combat enemies),Beast form (allows her to swim through strong currents and eat creatures),Nature form(Opens big blue and red bulbs on the map),Sun form(allowing her to see in the dark places of Aquaria),Fish form (small form that allows her to slip past enemies and travel fast), Spirit form(pretty useless, allows her to pass steam vents) and the most powerful form Dual form. Dual form combines Li and Naija into one. Li’s version of it fires very powerful charged up shots that when he kills 3 enemies with it allows Naija’s form to scream and kill just about everything on the map. On top of her different forms another nice mechanic is the crafting/cooking system. In the game there are 52 cooking recipes that have all sorts of different effects that include healing, stat enhancement and even boost attacks/skills. In order to get the materials to cook however you must either kill the creatures (some of which will fight you some won’t) or harvest them out of song plants. Song plants are unique “chests” that in order to open them you need to sing the note corresponding to the color of the plant.\n\nI’m going to mention to talk more about the art than the actual graphics. I absolutely loved the art style of this game, everything all the way down to the plants and small creatures were well drawn and looked amazing. Each area was unique and looked nothing like the others. I will say though just like in every Zelda game, Aquaria did have its own “Water Temple.” That really annoying mechanical temple that had several puzzles you want to forget about. On top of that the sound was really well done too.  Each area in the game had its own music playing and even most of the bosses had unique music for the different stages of the fight. I will say that the music really added to the last couple of levels and made that part feel really awesome as I was fighting through hundreds of enemies to get to the final boss.\nMy final thoughts about the game is that this indie game isn’t one you should miss. I really enjoyed the game even if some parts were tedious and difficult to find where I was going. The graphics/art and sound was top notch and it even had an ending song with vocals that was really well done as well (felt kind of like Enya’s song at the end of Fellowship of the Ring).  The difficulty of the game wasn’t too hard and wasn’t too simple. Your amount of health you had was very similar to that of a megaman game that if you were hit perhaps only 5-10 times you were dead if you didn’t use any health items. I had a lot of fun fighting the unique bosses and figuring out how to beat them.\n•	Story  - 5 out of 5\n•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5\n•	Graphics – 5 out of 5\n•	Sound  - 5 out of 5\n•	Fun – 5 out of 5\nAn overall score of 4.8 out of 5, so far out of my reviews this is the highest rated game. I feel like this is a must play for any Action Adventure lovers out there.\n","December 3, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics for the most part are super detailed and varied, the soundtrack gets you into the right mood efficiently, and there are a lot of powers, enemies, and bosses to keep the gameplay interesting. I don’t even know where to start with the problems. The biggest one is probably that you don’t know what you’re supposed to be doing in this game in a very minor and large ways. I spent an hour just swimming around because I had no idea where I needed to go or what I needed to do. Then some bosses have a very specific way you have to beat them and the game never tells you even how some of the steps necessary are possible. You just have to keep guessing and dying and hopefully not give up. Some of the puzzles are like this, too. You know what the answer is going to be like, but you just have to keep guessing every possible combination of possible answers to finally get it right. That’s not fun or engaging. One of the more minor complaints is that the writing is pretty awful. I couldn’t help but to roll my eyes over and over to some of the narrative because it just sounded so childish and maybe what an immature writer would consider poetic. Also the animations look cheap but that’s the key thing to remember here is that to make them better would’ve probably extended the production time of the game by years. Indies are cheap due to a lack of a huge budget so I’m willing to give that one a pass. They did the best they could. Over all, if you think you might enjoy the concept of the game and some interesting ideas in a metroidvanoia type of setting, I’d give this game a try.","November 25, 2013","true","12.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/24420/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/05/aquaria.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nAquaria is a robust, independently developed adventure game.  I was originally planning to review it as part of Indy April, but in order to diversify the titles covered, I elected to include a different production created by Derek Yu, Spelunky.  This game features a huge area to explore, a variety of available powers that must be used to reach new areas, and an item system with over 50 recipes.  Given the underwater setting, the normal platforming elements of this sort of adventure game are transported into the weightless environment, instead utilizing the mouse and keyboard together to swim and interact efficiently with the environment.  Most of all, the environment itself is captivating and complex, with an exciting array of sea life en encounter.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThe basic controls of the game are very simple and well explained.  Movement can be achieved with the mouse or keyboard, and most actions are taken using the mouse.  I find that precision movement is easier with the keyboard, while dashing or jumping about is easier achieved with the mouse.  Once new forms are unlocked, they give you new powers, most of which follow the same basic formula where the controls are concerned.  Overall, while movement can be a bit strange, especially the few times you venture out of the water, it has an extremely fluid feel once you get used to it.\n\nFrom a challenge perspective, Aquaria is rather hit and miss.  Many times, being caught off guard against a regular enemy or running into a few damaging obstacles can be just as deadly as fighting a boss, if a bit less urgent.  This can be especially frustrating given the spacing between save points.  However, farming a good amount of healing items before you go exploring and paying close attention to your current health can actually make the game rather easy by comparison.  As far as a goal goes, Aquaria is very open ended and encourages exploration.  This can be frustrating at times, given the size of the world and the number of dead ends you will likely encounter that cannot be addressed until you unlock a new power.  Personally, I got as much satisfaction out of the exploration as I did from moving forward in the game, and there are often rewards for leaving the beaten path.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nAquaria is a beautiful game.  The sea life is recognizable, ranging from colorful fish to terrifying eels, and each area seems to have slightly different creatures appropriate to the area.  The backgrounds are colorful, vibrant, and living, often featuring crystals you can move behind or grass that moves as you swim through it.  The environmental effects such as sunlight and darkness, and the constant water effects that are hardly noticeable until you leave the water and return to it, all add a great deal of depth to the already rich graphics.  The designs for all of Naija’s forms and costumes are creative, reflective of the creatures they mimic and the powers they bestow while still maintaining her own appearance.  The cut scenes are simple but elegant.  The music perfectly reflects the various areas of the game while being subtle enough that it never feels invasive or repetitive.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nAquaria is most of all a game that celebrates the environments it creates and encourages players to explore those environments.  For me, the pinnacle of this exploration was the first time I reached the surface of the water, exploring either The Veil or the Frozen Veil areas.  While the surface of these areas had very little to offer in the way of hidden treasures (although the few treasures I found are definitely good), there is something deeply satisfying about jumping over rocks along the surface like a dolphin, swimming up waterfalls, and shooting monkeys out of trees while flopping along the surface.\n\nI do not mean to undermine the more serious parts of this game in naming my casual playtime as the best moment.  The bosses are interesting and often require you to utilize your powers in creative ways.  There are other great environments like the Kelp Forest and the darkness of The Abyss to explore.  The cut scenes and story are gorgeous and well told.  For me, the fact that I could have so much fun doing nothing productive in this game shows just how great it is.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nIf you have a computer and the time to spend exploring Aquaria, this game is worth checking out.  The strange controls and lack of direction require you  to have a bit of dedication getting started, which may cause some more casual players to lose interest, but once you get started you will likely find yourself addicted to the adventure.  Aquaria is available on Steam and iOS.","November 28, 2013","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/24420/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","I love this game.  It's a Metroid-like with an underwater setting, utilizing a simple crafting system to create powerups.  It uses fantastic hand-drawn art and great music to set the mood, and even has very good voice acting which is rare for an indie game.  It has a pretty sizable world to explore and a lot of optional areas and secrets for you to find if you're able.  There is a LOT of cool extra stuff you can find by searching around and by defeating optional bosses.\n\nOne of the main game mechanics is music where you will need to mimic simple melodies or play certain notes to resonate objects in order to progress.  While it may not sound that fun, it works really well and blends perfectly with the the style of the game.  The combat system is very fluid and quite fun and the craftable powerup system meshes very nicely.\n\nMy only complaint is that some parts of the game don't make it entirely clear what you're supposed to do.  I'd recommend having a guide handy for when you get stuck.\n\nIt's pretty rare to find a game that's this...perfect.  This is definitely my #1 indie game of all time, and I can't see that changing anytime soon.","December 14, 2012","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphical presentation is nice too (OK the animations could be better, but it still feels OK). Technically the game is pretty bad; it has long loading times and the in-game performance has same very bad fps drops (the worst is when some of the doors open, than I get around 1 FPS).\nThe biggest downside side however are the controls, the 2 button layout might sound simple at first, but it just isn't intuitive, I always forget which button has what action. Controlliing this UI with a gamepad properly is nearly impossible and some actions seam to be even not executablle with a gamepad. Sadly one of the most important ingame actions (singing a song) doesn't work well on my gamepad, as especially hitting the rightmost note is nearly impossible, it seams the developer has set the threshold for hitting it to 100%, which is a very bad decision for a analogue stick. It just frustrates me and I have to give up on this otherwise very interesting game with a very intersting concept and a great athmosphhere,\nMaybe the game is more enjoyable with a mouse (which I am pretty sure the game was made for in the first place), but putting in a half-finished gamepad support was a poor decision.\nIf this gamepad stuff would get fixed, I would definitly recommend the game, but in it's current state it*s just not satisfiyg.","June 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cs_z/recommended/24420/","cs_z","CS Z","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cs_z/","251 products in account","I didn't beat this game but I got close enough to the end to feel like I completed the game.  This game is incredibly challenging but for all the wrong reasons.  I spent about half the game wandering around trying to find the next location and hoping I didn't wander into areas I wasn't ready for (despite the fact having to pass through some hard locations to get to the correct destination at times) all the while wrestling with the controls to get the character to do what I wanted it to do.  For example, I'd press the buttons to swim up and right and the character would either not move or move up and to the left.  The controls are already wonky in the water but exasperated out of the water.  I spent an inordinate amount of time repeating the same action over and over again just to get to my objective because the controls are pretty much non-responsive.  In addition, the world map is a giant mess, poorly labeled, and nearly impossible to navigate.  On the plus side, the world is absolutely huge, varied, open, and beautifully drawn.  The minimap was utterly useless compared to the world map with big circles that didn't actually help locate anything useful.  The minimap was probably a "radar" map at one time but never shows enemy locations so there is actually no need for it.  These things made for a really frustrating experience.\n\nThis brings me to the boss fights.  This game is loaded with unique boss fights.  Every boss is carefully crafted and requires ingenuity to beat - something that the PC platform rarely sees and, as such, is really awesome.  However, the infuratingly frustrating controls drove me nuts.  Several of the bosses have huge mobility gains over the main character and so the ability tell the character to move to specific positions on the screen quickly is important.  After putting 15-ish hours into this game and getting to the last boss before the end-game boss, I had enough.  I just wanted the game to be over.  Looking up a game guide (I just wanted to know how much further I had to go) I found out that the final boss had twice as many phases as the Chrono Trigger final boss.  I'd already had my fill of this game at that point so I stopped playing rather than spend another 10 to 15 hours wrestling with the controls in more boss fights.\n\nThis brings me to in-game cooking.  I was mildly entertained by the fact that, in the middle of a boss fight, I could pause the game to cook up some healing poultices.  "Hey, I know you've almost eliminated all of my health and you still have 50% of your health left, but do you mind waiting for a few moments while I cook a meal to heal myself?"  "Go ahead.  I'll, uh, read a book or something."  What's more annoying is that the player has to remember to cook regularly because the character can only carry 8 of each type of item but will make items disappear upon touching them rather than leaving them lie around when the limit is reached.  There really shouldn't be a limit at all.  If I want to carry 100 healing poultices into a battle, so be it.  Let the player play the game the way that they want to play it.  Cooking is a little gimmicky as well.  I frequently wished the recipe book would just let me click the item I wanted to make and then let the game figure out how to make it and automatically cook it for me.  Dragging and dropping individual items is a massive waste of time.\n\nFinally, the forms that the character can take defeats the likely purpose of the original form.  The game starts out with the main character learning to "sing" to do things.  However, I spent the bulk of the game in the second form (Energy Form) so I could shoot enemies and collect items for cooking.  This turns the first form into a gimmick when it should have been an adventure/puzzle game, which it still tries to be at times.  Such a wasted opportunity to make a truly unique game!  The only thing the first form ends up being good for is getting past certain points and moving a few rocks here or there.  The game could have done without all of the peons (annoying little enemies), stuck to puzzle solving with the various forms, and also kept the boss fights and it would have been a pretty sweet little game.\n\nOverall, this game has a number of interesting concepts but it isn't worth your time.  If the control issues were fixed, the limit on the storage of items eliminated, the world map overhauled to be usable, and the radar/minimap improved or removed entirely, it would be a huge improvement (all fairly easy things to fix).  As it stands though, I can't recommend this game.","July 15, 2014","false","19.8"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","20","41","0","0"

In the end, it was far too much backtracking with nothing but tedious combat to pass the time travelling. Some better pacing might have made this an absolute gem, but it takes such a long time for something to actually happen in the game that I lost my motivation to keep playing and after it's been sitting idly in my library for 2 years, it's safe to say I won't touch it again.","February 22","false","17.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

There's a variety of different, pretty environments and a nice soundtrack, and a pretty darn big world map as well. The movement is solid enough and the length of the campaign is just right. A few things I will say though; the game's stunningly linear for a metroidvania, very rarely can you stray from the set path laid out in front of you, leading you to spending a lot of time looking for the next place you're supposed to go. Also, the bosses have too much health and deal too much damage for how clunky the combat is. Fortunately you can get plenty of health items to counteract this, but it's still a pain. The final boss especially is just... way too long for a game that has nothing but manual saves. Really, the manual save system really discourages exploration in general and I could really have done without it. The powers all also don't tend to affect much except for the "puzzles" you need to solve with them. There's also some obscure, kind of dumb puzzles that I looked up because I couldn't be bothered. I don't think the game is great but it's okay, worth checking out if you need your metroidvania fix but not a game I'd recommend heavily over other indie metroidvanias or exploration-focused games. Just alright.","September 19, 2014","true","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At face value it looks tame, possibly even froofy, but once you get past the first couple sections of the game, it evolves past that very quickly, earning its place as a true metroidvania game. The story itself is just dark and twisted enough to be intriguing, the gameplay is satisfying and even challenging, and the boss fights are delightfully epic.\n\nThe only real downside I could mention is that the game never actually tells you the songs are all autobound to the number keys, so instead of trying to slam out five songs in a row note by note in the middle of a boss trying to eat you, you can just poke number keys as needed. Realizing that is major gamechanger.\n\nOh, and it's going to make you crave sushi, frequently.

You guide the protagonist through an open world unlocking bits of lore and piecing the story of Aquaria together, and also unlocking various forms and abilities that allow you to unlock more and more of the world areas.

Man, this game is old")\n- grinding required to craft healing items\n- map system is not very well designed\n\n\nRecommended for any fans of polished indie games and fans of knytt underground. This is an indie game from the pioneering days of steam's indie game community and also one of the games in the first humble bundle. This is a perfect example of what indie games were like in those days and as such it is significantly more polished than the indie stuff you see these days. However, due to it's age, it lacks a few conveniences that you'll find in indie games made these days, there is no way to quick heal for example, using special powers is more tedious than in the latest indie games, the map is badly designed, but the game still outshines modern indie games which are being cheaply produced now. Pixel graphics became for a short while a popular art choice, especially after super meat boy gave players so much nostalgia. However now, with the sole exception of shovel knight, timespinner (not yet released), and binding of issac, pixel graphics have become nothing more than an example of lazy programming and most games with pixel graphics should be avoided (I still think giving binding of issac the pixel art treatment was a stupid decision but whatever, it's a great game worth every penny). This game comes with excellent gameplay that subtly leads the way for you while respecting you to make your own decisions and not treat you like an idiot as games like CoD tend to do.\n\nDo I recommend this? yes, but if you want a discount you will have to buy the game from somewhere else. This game never goes on sale on steam.\n\nBy the way, if you like this game, you absolutely must buy knytt underground if you don't have it already. It is exactly what you are looking for next.","March 26, 2015","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/recommended/24420/","SJones","SagaciousJones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SJones/","612 products in account","Aquaria puts a creative spin on the Metroidvania genre, set in a world of undersea ruins and featuring an original gameplay structure for your aquatic character. Naija follows the direction of your cursor, allowing you to swim freely through the 2D environments, dash and spin, and propel off walls. You also utilize a song mechanic, activating a wheel of notes that correspond to specific shapes and colors. Singing activates powers and transforms Naija into different forms, each with their own distinct abilities. Some forms favor combat, which feels novel at first due to the swimming mechanics but quickly grows repetitive— except for the inventive boss battles. Other forms facilitate exploring the beautiful, expansive undersea landscape. Each of the diverse areas, such as the lush kelp forest or the deep-sea abyss, builds a compelling story of the rise and fall of aquatic civilizations and their gods. Naija herself provides narration, though her dialog is rather flowery. Both the story and the large amount of optional content, such as cooking and many collectibles, are effective at driving you to discover everything the game has to offer. Aquaria’s fantastic visuals, unique gameplay, and engrossing mystery make exploring its aquatic world a genuine thrill.\n\n4 / 5 – Really liked it.","April 12, 2015","true","22.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It’s a Metroid/Castlevania (metroidvania) type of game where you start with basic movement and as you play through the game, you get more powers that make you stronger and also grant you access to areas you were not able to enter previously. There is also an RPG mechanic where you would have to cook food with ingredients you find in the world and consume them later for a period of stat boost or health. The art style is so beautiful, with the world being set underwater but still managing to incorporate a varying style of architecture and enviorment.The gameplay is also quite polished with lots of varying monster and sea creatures to gigantic boss battles.

If you're the impatient type that hates to wait for things to go anywhere, stop reading here and don't buy it.\n- Aquaria is not an easy game. Nothing tells you what to do or where to go after you completed an area. You're on your own and have to find all of that out yourself. If that's nothing for you stop reading here and don' t buy it.\n- Aquaria has a couple of Bosses that have a rather cryptic way of dealing damage to them. In at least 2 instances you're most likely going to have to look up what you need to do in order to damage them on the internet.\n\nIf you can say for yourself that you can look past these isssues however, I recommend you to give Aquaria a try.\nThis has quickly become my favorite game of all time for farious reasons.\n- The main Character herself. Naija is not just a cliched bland Character with only one deffining Character trait. She reacts to the events accuring to her in a way a real human being probably would and is able to pull of a wide variety of different emotions according to what's happening around her.\n- The Music. Aquaria pull of a soundtrack composed of many diversed themes. All of them matching the different environments you traverse. As far as I'm concerned: Aquaria is still worth getting even if you'll only end up enjoying the music.\n- The non-linear Gameplay. If you like to find out things for yourself, if you like to discover hidden treasures and if you like to explore everything a world has to offer you're most likely not going to find a game that gives you a larger and more beautifully crafted World to do so.\n- The Story. Naija herself is the big focus. She'll learn a lot, grow as a Character and discover things about herself the same way you discover more about the mysterious underwater world.\n- The attention to details. Especially the little things really stand out in this game.

The first time I played it I found it a little too slow, once I picked it up again and reached my first boss encounters and realized how much more this game had to offer I couldn't put it back down. For a game that visually appears to be casual it's actually surprisingly difficult, in a good way!\n\nPros:\nIf you grew up playing Metroid or Ecco the Dolphin then you will probably love this!\nGreat controls with or without a controller.\nBeautiful, captivating sound track.\nChallenging boss fights that keep you coming back for more if you're defeated rather than have you rage quit.\nLOTS of collectables.\nNaija's form changes are a lot of fun and essential for some boss fights.\nAquaria's environments are immersive.\nPlenty of surprises - I didn't expect it to get so chillingly dark in one particular area.\nCons:\nSave points are few and far between, it can be frustrating making a small mistake and having to restart miles away.\nIt's easy to get lost at first with such a large overworld.\nSong UI can get frustrating in boss fights whilst trying to attack, sing and move at the same time.\nUnusual difficulty curve - enemies you encounter in the environment are generally easy to defeat when bosses can be outrageously difficult in comparison until you figure out the correct strategy.\nThe crafting system is somewhat boring.\nI found the voice acting to be very reminiscent of Lara Croft, this unfortunately threw me off every time I heard it as I couldn't help but think it was her narrating rather than Naija!","January 1, 2015","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Those searching for a quick pick-up-and-play title bursting with energy and excitement may feel somewhat let down by the game's more relaxed pace.\nIn the end, Aquaria is the perfect game to play at the end of a long day.  It's hand-drawn visuals and underwater melodies are sure to draw the player in, given the proper time.  Ultimately, your experience with this game depends on your play style.

It’s a Metroid/Castlevania (metroidvania) type of game where you start with basic movement and as you play through the game, you get more powers that make you stronger and also grant you access to areas you were not able to enter previously. There is also an RPG mechanic where you would have to cook food with ingredients you find in the world and consume them later for a period of stat boost or health. The art style is so beautiful, with the world being set underwater but still managing to incorporate a varying style of architecture and enviorment.The gameplay is also quite polished with lots of varying monster and sea creatures to gigantic boss battles. Would definitely recommend it at even full price as it is that good.

If you're the impatient type that hates to wait for things to go anywhere, stop reading here and don't buy it.\n- Aquaria is not an easy game. Nothing tells you what to do or where to go after you completed an area. You're on your own and have to find all of that out yourself. If that's nothing for you stop reading here and don' t buy it.\n- Aquaria has a couple of Bosses that have a rather cryptic way of dealing damage to them. In at least 2 instances you're most likely going to have to look up what you need to do in order to damage them on the internet.\n\nIf you can say for yourself that you can look past these isssues however, I recommend you to give Aquaria a try.\nThis has quickly become my favorite game of all time for farious reasons.\n- The main Character herself. Naija is not just a cliched bland Character with only one deffining Character trait. She reacts to the events accuring to her in a way a real human being probably would and is able to pull of a wide variety of different emotions according to what's happening around her.\n- The Music. Aquaria pull of a soundtrack composed of many diversed themes. All of them matching the different environments you traverse. As far as I'm concerned: Aquaria is still worth getting even if you'll only end up enjoying the music.\n- The non-linear Gameplay. If you like to find out things for yourself, if you like to discover hidden treasures and if you like to explore everything a world has to offer you're most likely not going to find a game that gives you a larger and more beautifully crafted World to do so.\n- The Story. Naija herself is the big focus. She'll learn a lot, grow as a Character and discover things about herself the same way you discover more about the mysterious underwater world.\n- The attention to details. Especially the little things really stand out in this game. The 2 developers even included 2 fish that look distinctly like them as an easter-egg.\n- The weight and importance given to the world and the Life-forms in it. The very first Boss is set up as a Creature that's been worshipped by an race of violent Warriors as nothing less but a God, simply titled "the fallen God". And he's given a theme most normal games wish they'd have for their final Boss.\n...\nI could go on, but to make things short:\nIf you don't mind a game focussing on Story, if yo're willing to wait patiently until it gets going, if you don't mind being challenged a little bit and love exploration based gameplay ... deffinitly give Aquaria a try.\n\nIf you're however impatient, don't like having to search for anything yourself, if you're not willing to put time into a game and don't care as long as there's not a lot of action especially early on I doubt that this is the game for you.","January 9, 2014","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music and graphics of this 2D, sprite-based game are lush and beautiful and really draw upon the heart and soul that made some of the Golden Era of Gaming from the SNES-Playstation 2 time period truly golden.  The only real negative I can cite on this game is that it seems almost certain there won't be a sequel, and in an age where those seem a constant to games that *don't* need them, this one truly would have been spectacular to continue.  Nonetheless, I can't recommend this one enough, especially for the low price they're asking.  Pick it up, take it for a swim--you won't regret it.

Taking cues from Metroid and the Sega classic Ecco the Dolphin, you play as Naija on a quest of discovery. You never know what's around the corner, and the beautiful world of Aquaria invites you to discover its many wonders. Your primary means of interaction are through Naija's songs whose use ranges from combat to puzzle solving.\n\nThe only tarnishes to this gem are some flawed controls in a few specific instances, like wall jumping, as well as some unforgiving difficulty spikes in the later parts. Also, some of the puzzles in the later game are much harder than you'd expect to find in your average Metroidvania game, necessitating a walkthrough for the trickier parts and puzzle boss fights. However, if you're able to get past those, you'll hear beautiful music, see incredible sights beneath the waves, and go on a great adventure.\n\nIf you love Metroidvania games at all, this is one you don't want to miss.","September 4, 2013","true","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each area of the Metroid-like map has its own superb atmosphere, from The Kelp Forest to The Veil to The Abyss. In addition, all of the moving sprites have the same high-quality as the environments. At some points, it was difficult to tell what I could interact with and what was part of the background (which is not a bad thing).\n\nYou play as Naija, a humanoid sea-creature. Her primary ability is singing, which can allow her to interact with the environment or transform into other creatures. Where is really shines is how well, she harmonizes with the background music. All of it together is magical, and a showcase of great sound design.\n\nNaija herself is a good example of how to do a proper female protagonist. Her journey is akin to an archaeologist. As she progresses, she learns more about her origins, as well as the rise and fall of the sea's various lifeforms. Later in the game, a romance spawns between Naija and another character. This romance manages to not be cheesy (something that can't be said about most video game romances), and it actually introduces some gameplay mechanics.\n\nEverything about this game is so strong, it's hard to find something to complain about. However, I found that the cooking/crafting system was clunky when trying to make a bunch of items at once.","July 28, 2013","true","18.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This goes for boss fights as well, put on your thinking caps or be ready to look at a FAQ.\n\nThe music is very fitting - gentle and elegant much like the ocean you explore, and chaotic when you encounter those nasty foes.

As metroidvanias go this one was one of the most open, never steering you in one fixed direction.  The game has only a light story in the beginning and leaves it to you to explore in any direction you choose until you come across the various temples and bosses of the game.  Bosses and upgrades don't have a strict order to be obtained, though some areas will require certain upgrades to access like any good metroidvania.  The story does flesh out a bit later on but never does anything engrossing or epic.  The game is fully voice acted, and the voice acting and music feels very high quality.  Graphically the game is 2D with nice crisp textures even at high resolutions.\n\nOne of the big reasons I didn't enjoy this game much was that the upgrades weren't terribly exciting.  The major upgrades in the game come in the form of new forms you can transform into.  Each form usually has one big trick, like shooting, or casting light in dark places, or being able to remove obstructions.  As focused as the game is on combat I would have preferred the upgrades to be more combat in nature.  The first one I received I used for almost the entirety of the game for combat, with only the last form added something I felt was "more powerful" to the mix.  There's only a few health upgrades, and the rest are just decorations for your home and different costumes.  Some of these are useful such as one that restores your health to 50% over time when worn, but most are just decorative.  Instead the key to success against the bosses comes from cooking, which is a simple crafting system that combines enemy drops to make various dishes.  Unfortunately the reliability of drops and later areas of the game being very barren for materials made this annoying.  Couple that with the fact that dying takes you back to your last save as opposed to the beginning of an area or boss, and many frustrations moments were had.\n\nMy other issue with the game was the controls.  You can move around with either the mouse, keyboard, or a combation of the game.  As far as actually moving these controls are great.  Transforming is done by playing songs with a mouse radial wheel, but there's also keyboard shortcuts (1-8) for transforming that are absolutely crucial to being able to finish the game, but the game never tells you these are there in the tutorials.  Beyond that as a game set in the water precision movement was difficult.  WSAD felt better than the mouse for dodging in boss fights, but it still felt very sluggish and sloppy, and things like wall jumping were more challenging than they needed to be.\n\nIf you're looking for a metroidvania this one will fit the bill, and there's lots to explore and many things to fight, but I would recommend Waking Mars if you want to explore something beautiful, and something like Cave Story+ if you want a good mix of exploring and combat.","May 13, 2014","false","17.4"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

Once you get the fish form you move much faster. If you miss that (which i did for a long time) it really sucks to be moving so slowly.\n\nShmups style combat but dodging is nearly impossible for the most part and shooting has homing. Thats basicly like no combat just randomly dying not very fun. If you get the armour that heals you when your health is lower than a certain point that makes it pretty easy to stay alive if you use it properly. I don't remember where it is but i got it pretty late.\n\nOther annoyances of interest include INVISIBLE passageways that lead to secrets. The cooking system, which as far as i can tell is impossible to figure out for yourself. You have to walkthrough to get the other half of the useless foods (for an acheivement) that you can't just find.\n\nI found the final boss long before most of the secrets, missing most of the extra health and the regen armour some of the final sections were a bit difficult, but were made easy by slowing down a lot and some eating. When i was ready to fight the final boss (When i got all the acheivements -- there wasnt one for beating him). I had 6 "Arcane potices" which return you to full health and many other healing items but I mostly used the regeneration off my armour since he doesnt even attack fast enough to kill you before you heal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/24420/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","In the first two hours, Aquaria is extremely uneventful and uninteresting. You will feel as though the music is bland and repetitive, the art is adequate but not unique in any way, and the game play is tedious. There is really not much going on in the game world or around you in the beginning. All you are doing is maneuvering the main character around the screen with very simple controls. Because the game play is so dull in the initial couple hours, this may deter many gamers from continuing. After you earn a couple special powers, Aquaria becomes something almost entirely different than the initial experience. It is a mixture of Ecco the Dolphin, Metroid, and Castlevania. The singing mechanic is elaborate and well thought out even if it takes a little getting used to. The cooking system is also fresh and unique, giving the player access to various combinations for producing food items and power-ups with special temporary effects. Combat is interesting and the controls are decent. At times it is a bit confusing since there are often sections of the map that you do not have access to as you go past them at first, which gives the player a feeling of having missed something. In addition to this, you will reach areas of the game world that attempt to give you direction, but end up being ambiguous and cryptic, making your progression unclear. This problem means that several aspects of the game will force the player to seek help through FAQs and guide maps. The save system requires the player to go to certain specific areas that are not widely available in order to save your progress. This means that if you die and haven't saved in a while, everything accomplished and explored since your last save must be done again, as if it never happened before. These save areas are often very far from each other, which adds severely to the problem. Once you adapt to this save system shortcoming, you will be prepared to backtrack just to save your game. The world map gets extremely convoluted and disorganized because some sections often overlap others. This can cause confusion and disorientation as you travel around the world. The enemies design is often interesting, albeit predictable, as you can imagine many of the creatures you encounter are from the sea. The different forms and abilities you will learn during the game are creative and fun to use, making them the highlight of Aquaria. Some instances during the game seem too cryptic and if you accidentally pass these areas by without noticing, it is possible that you may go through the rest of the game without certain items and abilities because of this design flaw. Some things happen in the game without any explanation whatsoever, which leaves the player, once again, disoriented. In addition to the forms and abilities you will learn, the other interesting and fun aspect of Aquaria is in the exploration of this large game world. The bosses are challenging, well designed, and fun to fight against. The mechanics required to defeat them make sense and puts all your skills and abilities to the test. Accomplishing some of the needed tasks in this game is so unintuitive, obscure, unclear, and unobvious that there is simply no way to figure them out on your own without seeking help with a FAQ. There are some parts of Aquaria that requires you to be out of the water. This brings some of the worst platform jumping controls I have played in any game, but all is forgiven as these instances are rare. Forgiving the save system and the occasionally extremely unclear and ambiguous progression, Aquaria can be enjoyed thoroughly.\n\nAquaria is good.","March 20, 2014","true","29.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'll list a few:\n\nThere are no indication on map of important findings, some key objects you found to unblock another area is not marked in anyway, even the door/switch itself is not marked on the map. Makes it harder with larger world.\nYou would spend majority of the time toggle between main and fighting form, but you have to sing a song to turn into fighting form and key press to revert. But why not just let people toggle it?? To me this is the biggest fail, it's super awkward to tyr sing a song just to turn into fighting form, and with semi hostile world, you spend majority of time in it. And while you are in fighting form, you can not lift object(another song) and doing other things. I think the spell system doesn't really fit this type of game really well. Imaging that in Castlevania, you have to input konami code just to cast a spell? I wouldn't like that.\nLast disapointment is it's very predictable, so much so that it makes sense why they don't want to do the map indicator thing for you. One of the highest voted positive review said he spend 20 hours with only a few secret left to be found, if they design the map tighter and mark it properly, you would probably spend less than 20 hours to finish it.  Even with the overlay style of map construction, it does not feel the scale of Metroid or Castlevania. It also does not provide you the sense of progression(Metroid once you unlock ability you get to travel in different way that makes it easier/faster. Castlevania you can just travel through portals. Imagine this mechanism is added into the game, it will become even shorter and to many people "shallower" experience. But it is what it is.\nIn conclusion, decent art for it's release year, but gameplay wise you can better spend your time somewhere else.\n","January 18","false","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lwright3/recommended/24420/","lwright3","Mr. Tumnus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lwright3/","509 products in account","I Initially purchased this game as a part of an indie bundle back in the day, and initially downloaded the DRM free version which apprently didn't sink to my steam account. I lost interest sometime during the sun temple,  because the games "open world atmosphere" is really more of a minimal plot, large map with areas blocked off until you get a gimmicky power up.\n\nMy interest/ desire to complete the game was reignited upon watching The Indie Game movie, where it was featured in the end credits/ the extras, and the interview the creator was apparently the inspiration to make a full fledged documentary about indie games. I had forgotten why I had stopped playing this game, but I quickly remembered why.\n\nI just rage quit to write this review. My breaking point came in the ice veil, while trying to stair jump up a cliff side. Movement outside of water is broken. Like... QWOP broken. You can't jump backwards, and you're stuck in your parabola from the moment you start your ascent. You might stick your landing, or you might slide all the way back down. Of course, when reaching a floating bubble of water, because why not, ♥♥♥♥ physics, momentum is not just conserved, no, you freaking accelerate. So you fall down, all the way back to the beginnning, to start another infuriating round of special olympics rock climbing. So you better hit the brakes (no stop button, you have to continuously click, like in Dota, to get anywhere). And in order to do that quickly, you have to "boost".\nBoosting in general is a crapshoot, because if you hit a wall you stick to it and grab on, because you totally need to do that... for nothing. Occasionally you can grab onto larger enemies and ... ride them. Still haven't figured out how to do that with the sea horses though, which might be helpful, although the fish form is supposed to be decently speedy on it's own.\n\nThe map is an uninformative mess. You can barely scroll in, leading to the persisting question "is this a map for ants?". Due to the litany of secret passages that don't become more noticable when crossing them, or screwy pocket dimension spaces, the map is all sort of overlapped on itself, which makes decyphering it a chore. Landmarks are few and far between, so hopefully you remembered to mark any weird areas on your map that you might want to come back to. I don't recall seeing a legend on the map, so it's just a bunch of meaningless symbols until you figure out what green testicles marker means (apparently if you throw a seed at them they open up). They do have an option to place markers, but really, that should be done automatically. Quest markers would have been nice too, I detected a tell tale shimmer of purple on the second level, why didn't that continue? That was obviously a mechaninc that just didn't get implemented, at least give me a hint as to where to go.\n\nThe sound track is repetitive to the point that I think it might have been initially designed as an enhanced interrogation technique. Most of the "music" is two or three measures long, and on an endless loop. No songs can be described as catchy, just mind numbing. At no point did I want to explore the attached OST, nor do I know of why anyone would want to subject themselves to that.\n\nFarming items, which is necessary after every boss fight, is a massive hassle. You can't trade/ buy items (there aren't really any NPC's beside you and your deaf/mute boyfriend) and there is a maximum amount of each item in your inventory, so you can't stock up past 8 of anything. Most items have maybe one or 2 recipes they can be used in, with the exception of some stock items that you will be in continuous short supply of (leaves, eggs, and occasionally oils). Cooking is repetitive, you can't just macro it and make 8 of the same item, no, you painstakingly drag each ingredient. You need to conult the fan made guides to get recipes to cook, because if you do it blindly, you'll waste ingredients. Instead of just saying recipe not found, or having a system whereby you learn recipes ahead of time (you sort of do that when you find cooked items in the field), you can attempt to mix things together, but usually you end up with something useless. Most of the cooked items are useless to begin with. For instance, shroom soup. Let's mess with your screen to the point the game isn't playable and make sounds like your dying, because we're edgey but don't know the effects of psylocybin.\n\nMost of the forms/ powerups you obtain are gimmicky and useless, and you'll end up mainly using the energy form. The song form can pretty much be replaced by hotkeys, although the urchin armor (armors apparently can only be worn by your song form) can be used to break the octopus boss. Beast form is unweildy, the lunge has a long recharge, you don't get items dropped by enemies that you kill, and for some reason you don't get health returned from eating the enemy unless it's a certain jellyfish, that usually drop health when you kill them anyway. Nature form can open some doors and avoid damage from certain environmental hazards, but the spiky flower cactus thing has a long charge time making it kind of useless for anything. The light form barely works, and can sort of be replaced by the glowing octopus pet, but both are pretty crappy to begin with. You can charge it up to make the area slightly brighter, but useless in combat. Fish is sort of fast and is used for gimmicky passages, same with the spirit form. There is an item so you can attack with the fish, but honestly, you might as well use energy form constantly, except when you need to bing/ move something, which is the one thing I haven't found a hot key for. Hot keys for everything, including spinning in place, which has so far been used in one location. I guess if bind had a hot key the song form would be totally redundant.\n\nThe forms are mainly used to chase gimmicky collectibles where aren't needed in the least. Their sole function is to slightly spruce up your crappy grotto home, in the same way that a "hang in there" poster would make your skid row apartment not make you want to hang yourself. Which is to say, barely. The pot of meat/ bag of seeds do speed up the farming bit a tad though, although it would be nice when pulling out plants, which you need to bind every single time, to not have a randomized loot system with dud options. I don't need small bones (I like how recipes call for "any bone" or "any shroom" or "any berry", as there is just one of each type), or better yet, small enemies that attack you. It just makes farming that much more of a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThere is no quicksave option, there are no menu options to save. Just irregularly, semihidden save crystals...? That you have to be mindful of when exploring. Hopefully you don't get in over your head, or your time will have been wasted, because if you die, all your progress will have been lost till your last save. Which I guess is good if you just blew through all your items on a boss fight, because that's a real possibility, but kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you just had to make a trek to fight the boss in the first place, which quite a few bosses require.\n\nThere isn't much character development of the main character aside from painfully acted lines about this amateur fantasy world the creator has developed, in a mid atlantic accent from a cringingly badly named protagonist (Naija?). Your... boyfriend? that you almost killed because you had a rom-com introduction where you nearly drowned him then kissed him which magically made him breath in water/ want to eat raw fish never speaks, does minimal damage, and doesn't distract the various enemies, and gets stuck so often you're given a song to summon him, but can't dismiss him if you wanted to. It became a bit of a problem when trying to do the simon-says boss, when the protagonists decided to make out and float around freely while I was trying to keep up with another rage inducing bull ♥♥♥♥ gimmicky optional boss.","October 24, 2015","false","23.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

The game really shoehorns you onto a specific path, and you can't get anywhere without gathering specific powers first. And the things you need are so spread apart, and the world is so unreasonably big with so little to do that going from place to place just becomes a chore. If the combat system was better it would be bearable, but it starts to feel like boring, monotonous clicking after a while.\n\nThe story is alright, albeit somewhat pretentious. It becomes a little hard to follow, since everything is spread so far apart and you spend so much time swimming, that by the time you find another plot point you've already forgotten the last one.\n\nThe music was good though.","January 15, 2014","false","12.7"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","14","37","0","0"

It started off great, though, which makes being a quitter all that much more disappointing.  Finding and crafting items was fun-ish at first but it became more of a chore as the story went along.  I still could have dealt with this, but for the items you needed to really help with boss battles you had to trek a long way to get to a bigger stove required for crafting certain items.  And the story really only progressed when you beat the bosses.  In between them it was just swimming from here to there and farming items needed to craft other items.  Yawn.\n\nI might-could revisit this game in the future.

Still using a save point system nowadays is one thing, but putting one per map is another. Dying and losing 20-30 mins of progress because you took a wrong turn and got bodyblocked into unavoidable death (because of poor controls and low invincibilitiy frames) is not anyone's idea of fun, regardless of your target audience or platform. The levels are mostly 1-way mazes scattered with monsters and puzzles that have little to do with the end boss... Bosses are unintuitive and require too much guesswork to solve considering the sparseness of save points. The story is boring, cliched (amnesia, really?), and forced inbetween the boring 1-way zones and frustrating bullet-hell mazes of monsters. It's only saving grace are the pretty environments but even they are zoomed out most of the time.\n\nDon't bother with this and just go replay Super Metroid because 17 years later and still no one can do better than it.","October 18, 2011","false","10.1"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","9","28","0","0"

If that's not already a reason enough to avoid this, read on.\n- The controls suck.  Naija moves entirely with the mouse.  You hold LMB to move and click LMB to boost.  Therefore, you have to STOP before you can get a speed boost.  While you do go faster, it's just really bad design because I'm constantly slowing down to go faster.\n- The game advertises itself as an indie 'metroidvania'.  Again, another red flag for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.  This game is nothing like Super Metroid.  The controls aren't even the same.  Super Metroid is a platformer while this is a point-and-click adventure.  I wonder if this game was 'inspired by Earthbound' as well.\n\nI'm a bit biased because I don't have the patience for stories in games and I don't care whether the graphics are 8-bit or have extreme doses of chromatic abberation.  I care about the gameplay, which in this game is non-existent.\n\nAlso, the music is really awful","April 5, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","7","25","2","2"

I don't to spend it on a game that might be better after that time.\n\nIt's said to have a huge world. And the average game play time is about 20h.

This game could have been great, but it feels like the creators lost focus and just started working to finish the game. Other than that the environments are beautiful, and the ideas are solid.

Very good conccepts. A well made of its kind.\nHave to say again and again. This game makes me remember so much of castlevania symphony of the nights.\nThere aren't much of this kinda game well made like this.\nIts a very rare stuff. Despite it maybe girlish its gameplay makes it worth to be played by all as just as castlevania son, simply because the mechanics of the game.\nIts a collection of the simplest actions that adds little by little to be a more complex play style kinda game. This makes such mechanics make the game rich and resourcefull to be played.\nAnd i didn't even mentioned the stages, its big map to explorer....lots of chambers to find, which you will find bosses, items, skills or story pieces.\n\nFeels like edgeless on how to move the character around. It is very smooth. There are many actions and there are about every kind of action you might need to get around. The game is progressive in such way as more you play more skilled you will become which will make the feel more flexible and resoucefull as powerfull.\n\nI recomend the use of controller, for all games of its kind. Don't say i didn't warned! But this one if fine to be played with mouse and keyboard especially because with the keyboard you can transfom in the many types of metamorphs with each number from 1 to 9. So yes its kinda cheating, makes game much easier because in this game the thing is that you must sing a tune to transfom to each type and to change between them you must revert to normal and then sing the type you want. The short cut makes this transitions instantly to one type to another.\n\nAnd well i wished the game had lvl ups, stats and stuff like that. But this game is awsome as it is. There aren't weapons either or to be put in better word, you are the weapon....you and the power to transform yourself!, each form with its unic skills and powers from a spike of green to a bolt of fire.\n\nCastlevania Symphony of the Nights sure!!\nSo yes i use the game as a base comparation to all others of its kind.\n\nAnd Aquaria deserve all the attention.\n\nIf anyone who knows any other game as rich as this one pls tell me.\n\nI very wish from the bottom of my heart that more games like those were made.","November 3, 2015","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However I find most of the mechanics to be cumbersome, whether it be activing abilites or cooking useful powerups/health items.\n\nI wouldn't call it great because of some of the tedium, but it's good enough for what it sets out to do.

The narrative and the music are triple A class.\nUnfortunately, it's also very bad everywhere else. Controls are clunky, frustrating at times. The hud and the overall ergonomy of the game is just terrible.\nI am not against hard games but Aquaria does a terrible job at explaining what you are supposed to do. You can encounter bosses you are totaly not prepared to fight. This actually would be fine if it wasn't such a pain to backtrack through the huge map without fast travel.\n\nI really like the game story for the time I played but I wish the terrible ergonomy wouldn't have stoped me in my progression.","November 17, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing you need to know about Aquaria is that it was made by two guys whose lifelong dream was to make a great game. The second thing you need to know is that it is an absolutely beautiful, wonderful, intelligent, amazing game that is a legitimate contender for my pick as the best game of all time, even though it has a lot of things that I usually hate in video games [no multiplayer, little direction given to players, slow access to game content]. What Aquaria gives you more than any other game to date is the chance to discover everything about the world. It demands that you be clever and observant about the world around you, but unlike many similar games, it's carefully crafted to give you the tools and chances to be clever in great ways. You're given a beautiful world, and everything about it is intelligent and engaging. That's what makes this game great. Buy it.","July 22, 2012","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Low points are that you can only save at a save crystal (multiple times I died after exploring for a half hour beyond the last crystal — frustrating) and the map overlapping itself in some areas and not allowing enough zoom.  I spent about 50 hours with this game getting all the achievements and collecting everything.\n\nAnother strong offering from the first Humble Indie Bundle!","May 6, 2011","true","55.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quest for new abilities, to unlock more areas, to learn more new abilities. There are a few areas which get a little tricky enough to challenge even seasoned platformer players. (Most of these involve water bubbles in the air, so fair warning when you hit these areas -- they can get a little bit frustrating.) There's an interesting cooking mechanic which lets you synthesize monster drops into healing items, and those healing items into more powerful ones. The story starts a little thin, but definitely builds as you progress. The music is great, which is nice since that's one of the major themes and one of your primary abilities.\n\nI wish it was a little easier to get a gamepad working, but mouse and keyboard will control the game just fine.

The game just plops you down at the start with no explanation of anything other than a few tooltips on how to move around etc. and leaves the rest up to you. It's hard to stay motivated to play when you have no idea where you are supposed to be going or what to do, but if you get some quick hints from a guide or are fine with just aimlessly wandering with LOTS of backtracking as you gain new powers etc. then the game can be very rewarding. It plays in the "Metroidvania" style of moving around various areas to collect powerups and eventually unravelling the plot.","December 30, 2011","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely one of the highlights of the indie bundle I got it in (forgot which one).\n\nMy only 3 main gripes with it are...\n1)The size of the map and the backtracking aspect kinda interfere with each other leaving you spamming 10 min. spamming m1 to get back to that one dungeon.\n2)The controls, learn and use the keyboard controls... a million times more reliable and quicker than the mouse stuff.  They kindly leave out that fact that instead of having to come to a near stop just to change forms in front of a boss, that instead of playing the "move mouse in this pattern game" you can simply hit the # keys.\n3)Reading up on it it seems like there won't be a sequel anytime soon which is a bit annoying considering the cliffhanger.\n\nWith all of that said I'm wishing there was a sequel, there's something great about this world and I'm wishing I could go back to it for more.","December 19, 2011","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good conccepts. A well made of its kind.\nHave to say again and again. This game makes me remember so much of castlevania symphony of the nights.\nThere aren't much of this kinda game well made like this.\nIts a very rare stuff. Despite it maybe girlish its gameplay makes it worth to be played by all as just as castlevania son, simply because the mechanics of the game.\nIts a collection of the simplest actions that adds little by little to be a more complex play style kinda game. This makes such mechanics make the game rich and resourcefull to be played.\nAnd i didn't even mentioned the stages, its big map to explorer....lots of chambers to find, which you will find bosses, items, skills or story pieces.\n\nFeels like edgeless on how to move the character around. It is very smooth. There are many actions and there are about every kind of action you might need to get around. The game is progressive in such way as more you play more skilled you will become which will make the feel more flexible and resoucefull as powerfull.\n\nI recomend the use of controller, for all games of its kind. Don't say i didn't warned! But this one if fine to be played with mouse and keyboard especially because with the keyboard you can transfom in the many types of metamorphs with each number from 1 to 9. So yes its kinda cheating, makes game much easier because in this game the thing is that you must sing a tune to transfom to each type and to change between them you must revert to normal and then sing the type you want. The short cut makes this transitions instantly to one type to another.\n\nAnd well i wished the game had lvl ups, stats and stuff like that. But this game is awsome as it is. There aren't weapons either or to be put in better word, you are the weapon....you and the power to transform yourself!, each form with its unic skills and powers from a spike of green to a bolt of fire.\n\nCastlevania Symphony of the Nights sure!!\nSo yes i use the game as a base comparation to all others of its kind.\n\nAnd Aquaria deserve all the attention.\n\nIf anyone who knows any other game as rich as this one pls tell me.\n\nI very wish from the bottom of my heart that more games like those were made.","November 3, 2015","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls sometimes feel stiff and they probably didn't age that well (the game is from 2007!), but the overall experience is not bad. The crafting system is great and not too much complicated, very balanced.\n\nThe map is big and well constructed: you can be immersed without necessairly get "lost" and frustrated. The art is good but a bit repetitive, except some good levels and boss fights.\n\nWhile I cannot say if the story is any good (I've left the game WAAAY before finishing it), I have to admit that I didn't feel like it mattered that much. It starts with the protagonist mermaid trying to find out her past and what happened to its civilization, but it soon starts feeling more like a plot device than a real story. I know this may apply to EVERY story ever told in a videogame, but on the other side this might just be me.\n\nOverall, yes, it's a good game and I would recommend it to the fans of the genre. Sadly, even though I really wanted to like it, I didn't feel invested enough to complete it or even to go through a very big part of it. When I stumbled upon the lenght of the experience (12 to 15 hours) my mind just yelled "Yeah, not worth that much time".\n\nIt's good, anyway!","October 24, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/recommended/24420/","tonakai","Tonakai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/","293 products in account","I remember when I first found out about this game, I thought of it as dumb. I was still a raging teenager only thinking about how manly I should be, as a man. Why would someone as manly as me play something clearly designed for little girls? A mermaid singing in caves of - ugh! - COLORFUL FLOWERS!!! In the beginning speech, the mermaid's speaking like she's reading a poem! What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Also, this bacon slab is hella manly and tasty!\n\nOkay, that's an exaggeration. I did think of Aquaria as something dumb and girly at first, but I still decided to try it. I can no longer remember why, but I'm sure it was simply that Aquaria did, indeed, look very interesting. Before that point I had only played games without thinking about them too much, so I had a rather shallow image of video games.\n\nI remember when I started a new game. I remember the feeling after the opening speech, how Naija was sitting on the rock, how the light was pouring down from the cracks at the ceiling... and, oh gods, the music. A piece that is like a lullaby for a baby, yet it indeed does give a feeling of emptiness, of loneliness. And as basic human instincts decide to fight these feelings, I went on to the other side of the cave to find something, anything that would make me feel whole.\n\nHow shameless of the muscular me. It was as if I was living in Naija's world! Quick, pass me the protein shake and my weights.\n\nTo sing, you hold the right mouse button down. A circle of 8 symbols will appear. The lowermost symbol is the highest pitch you can do, and the one to the immediate right is the lowest, and all the other symbols inbetween clockwise are the rest of the tones. So, to sing, you simply move your mouse atop one of the symbols while holding the right mouse button down. A bit later in to the game you'll get "songs" to sing that make Naija do all kinds of stuff, mostly transforming into something else such as the energy form that shoots blasts of energy, or the beast mode that allows you to eat other fauna.\n\nThat's the way you'll be doing combat and solving puzzles. You're also (obviously) underwater, so you can move to all directions however you wish. Under these gameplay mechanics a world was made, which is yours to explore. You'll be going in a kingdom with a necessary castle-like building for its rulers, overrun by disgusting creatures; to the surface to feel the sun's warm rays for the first time in your life; and to the depths of the sea, the abyss. Aquaria may not have a procedurally generated universe, but that's what it makes amazing - all the areas you see have been carefully crafted, their enemies placed where they belong with many secrets hidden around. In each area there's a lot to explore, and there's even a whole area as a secret! For your first playthrough you may even miss a large amount of content.\n\nWhat wonders will I find in the light ahead? What kind of horrors will appear around the corner? Aquaria changed my mind about what games can really be. It was an indie game before the time of Kickstarters or Greenlights... I can only imagine how much the developers had to go through to get the game out the way they wanted while making profits of it.\n\nI still see Aquaria as something that has yet to grow mold compared to the newer games. The gameplay is still fresh and graphics are beautiful... although admittedly, the animation are rather awkward and clunky at times (everyone who's played through the game should be reminded about the final boss' death scene about now). But that's a minor offence compared to everything else amazing in this piece of art.\n\n- Beautiful graphics and music blended to one, as if a painting dragging you into its world, both visually and mentally\n- A huge world to explore. Not the procedurally generated kind that roguelikes and other up-and-coming exploration games do, so whatever you find in this game is definitely worth its time.\n- An interesting combat system with many enemies bosses to test it on. However I must admit that some bosses felt too much like puzzle bosses\n- But also fun and well thought-out puzzles that aren't bosses! Using the singing system, obviously.\n- A coming-of-age story, in a way. Filling the emptiness inside via traveling and finding the wonders (and horrors) of the world\n\nNow, after I've written this "review," I notice that it's more like me simply being reminiscent. I hope you don't mind, Aquaria means a lot to me as a gamer. Still, I assure you that it's not simply nostalgia or favoriting, I'm sure if you're an avid gamer you'll be enjoying this game a lot.\n\nP.S. I actually was a scrawny teenager with non-existent muscles and a girlish face, and I didn't (still don't) like bacon by itself","October 27, 2015","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/recommended/24420/","tonakai","Tonakai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/","293 products in account","I remember when I first found out about this game, I thought of it as dumb. I was still a raging teenager only thinking about how manly I should be, as a man. Why would someone as manly as me play something clearly designed for little girls? A mermaid singing in caves of - ugh! - COLORFUL FLOWERS!!! In the beginning speech, the mermaid's speaking like she's reading a poem! What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥! Also, this bacon slab is hella manly and tasty!\n\nOkay, that's an exaggeration. I did think of Aquaria as something dumb and girly at first, but I still decided to try it. I can no longer remember why, but I'm sure it was simply that Aquaria did, indeed, look very interesting. Before that point I had only played games without thinking about them too much, so I had a rather shallow image of video games.\n\nI remember when I started a new game. I remember the feeling after the opening speech, how Naija was sitting on the rock, how the light was pouring down from the cracks at the ceiling... and, oh gods, the music. A piece that is like a lullaby for a baby, yet it indeed does give a feeling of emptiness, of loneliness. And as basic human instincts decide to fight these feelings, I went on to the other side of the cave to find something, anything that would make me feel whole.\n\nHow shameless of the muscular me. It was as if I was living in Naija's world! Quick, pass me the protein shake and my weights.\n\nTo sing, you hold the right mouse button down. A circle of 8 symbols will appear. The lowermost symbol is the highest pitch you can do, and the one to the immediate right is the lowest, and all the other symbols inbetween clockwise are the rest of the tones. So, to sing, you simply move your mouse atop one of the symbols while holding the right mouse button down. A bit later in to the game you'll get "songs" to sing that make Naija do all kinds of stuff, mostly transforming into something else such as the energy form that shoots blasts of energy, or the beast mode that allows you to eat other fauna.\n\nThat's the way you'll be doing combat and solving puzzles. You're also (obviously) underwater, so you can move to all directions however you wish. Under these gameplay mechanics a world was made, which is yours to explore. You'll be going in a kingdom with a necessary castle-like building for its rulers, overrun by disgusting creatures; to the surface to feel the sun's warm rays for the first time in your life; and to the depths of the sea, the abyss. Aquaria may not have a procedurally generated universe, but that's what it makes amazing - all the areas you see have been carefully crafted, their enemies placed where they belong with many secrets hidden around. In each area there's a lot to explore, and there's even a whole area as a secret! For your first playthrough you may even miss a large amount of content.\n\nWhat wonders will I find in the light ahead? What kind of horrors will appear around the corner? Aquaria changed my mind about what games can really be. It was an indie game before the time of Kickstarters or Greenlights... I can only imagine how much the developers had to go through to get the game out the way they wanted while making profits of it.\n\nI still see Aquaria as something that has yet to grow mold compared to the newer games. The gameplay is still fresh and graphics are beautiful... although admittedly, the animation are rather awkward and clunky at times (everyone who's played through the game should be reminded about the final boss' death scene about now). But that's a minor offence compared to everything else amazing in this piece of art.\n\n- Beautiful graphics and music blended to one, as if a painting dragging you into its world, both visually and mentally\n- A huge world to explore. Not the procedurally generated kind that roguelikes and other up-and-coming exploration games do, so whatever you find in this game is definitely worth its time.\n- An interesting combat system with many enemies bosses to test it on. However I must admit that some bosses felt too much like puzzle bosses\n- But also fun and well thought-out puzzles that aren't bosses! Using the singing system, obviously.\n- A coming-of-age story, in a way. Filling the emptiness inside via traveling and finding the wonders (and horrors) of the world\n\nNow, after I've written this "review," I notice that it's more like me simply being reminiscent. I hope you don't mind, Aquaria means a lot to me as a gamer. Still, I assure you that it's not simply nostalgia or favoriting, I'm sure if you're an avid gamer you'll be enjoying this game a lot.\n\nP.S. I actually was a scrawny teenager with non-existent muscles and a girlish face, and I didn't (still don't) like bacon by itself","October 27, 2015","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VioletRosefall/recommended/24420/","VioletRosefall","Vi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VioletRosefall/","123 products in account","Good game, I quite enjoyed it! I suggest it to people that want a metroidvania type of game as long as they can tolerate some repetitiveness (especially on terms of the music).\n\nGame length is aprox. 9-11 hours if you are aiming for 100% completion (getting all collectibles, extra bosses, achievements, etc). Far more if you go in blind without using a guide.\n\nPros:\n+ World size and design. The map is massive and while yes most of it is underwater locations (ex: underwater caves, sunken ruins, the deep sea abyss, etc.) they all present a beautiful and proper design, each zone even has several unique sorts of flora and fauna that don't even attack you or serve any big gameplay purpose, they are just there to make the world feel alive and it works.\n\n+ The story. It is not the best ever, but it works for the game and is good enough to motivate you on keep playing it.\n\n+ The song system. At first it feels kind of useless since its mostly used for very easy puzzle solving but about halfway through you find yourself using it more often and becoming more adepts at performing the proper songs in order to quickly switch abilities/forms/attacks in the heat of battles.\n\n+ Naija. The character you play as does start as the usual cliché of "amnesia case" deal but luckily that's not really the main focus or the big motivator for the adventure to start, rather more the fact she just wants to see the world and understand it. It also helps a lot that the voice actress really nails it on expressing the way Naija feels, thinks and evolves as the game goes on.\n\n+ Boss fights. The first ones are simple and easy, which is fine, but as you go on you will find each boss requires more specific strategies and plays with all of your forms and abilities in order to beat them. Some of them can even have you sit there wondering how to beat them for a long time if you go in blind and don't use a guide.\n\n+ Price. Considering the amount, quality and length of content this game has, I think it is entirely worth its full price, I'd even dare say a bit more than that.\n\nCons:\n- The general combat. While on boss fights you will see each one requires very different and fun strategies to beat them, the rest of the enemies, the common mobs you will run into while exploring the map most of them are either pointless to fight and easily skip-able or just punching bags you spam the energy form bullets on. This also leads to another letdown because while Naija can get several forms and most come with an attack of some form, most of the time you will find yourself just using the "energy" form since it is the most effective (homing bullets) and easiest to fight with.\n\n- The food/cooking system. Not really a very bad thing but it felt pretty dull. You are meant to go around farming for ingredients to make food, which is the only way you can heal on battles or to give you temporal buffs, while collecting lots of recipes as you explore the world... but not only there are a lot of pointless recipes and ingredients on the game, some of which you will probably never even use, but I never found myself in need to farm for ingredients or to cook food much, heck I only cooked food at the start, near the mid and right before the final boss.\n\n\nOther:\nThe soundtrack is... a hit or miss. Half of it is different versions/mixes of the main theme song which even has a story importance, and if you like it cool, but If you don't like that one theme... well, yeah. (Hint: watch the trailer video here on the Steam store page of the game. That music on the first minute or so? expect to hear it and similar versions of it for about 50% of the game) Mind you, the music fits the theme of the game and the zones and I liked it, but it repeats so much it can be a bad thing for a lot of people.","January 14","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
