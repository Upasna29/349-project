The majority of puzzles are solved by requiring you to discover a gravity technique that you haven't yet learned or needed to use, and I enjoyed that kind of exploratory-based puzzle solving.\n\nIt's a pretty short game at around 10 hours, with some added value in terms of the challenge mode, but the slick presentation, story, and uniqueness of its puzzles makes Attractio worth the purchase.","January 23","true","13.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Now imagine that it grew up to be a conniving, sadistic, evil Gameshow Host. Then you have Attractio. These puzzles get HARD, in most games I dance through chambers with ease, but no, not in Attractio.\n\n"Here, have a cube" says Attractio, "Cube press buttons"\n"Okay, easy"\n"Coloured buttons affect all things of that colour"\n"Waaaaay ahead of you Atrractio"\n"Oh, really?" Attractio sneers, with an evil glint in it's eye. "Try this on for size!"\nAnd from there you're hit with a barrage of absolutely brilliant puzzles that will have you scratching your head (or banging it against the desk in my case) for hours.\nJust when you think you've got the hang of it, Attractio mixes it up once again, and back to the headscratching we go. Was that puzzle really suppossed to be so complicated? Probably.\n\nThings couldn't get much better for puzzle lovers, but they do.\nAttractio features a story that will have you hooked. I am currently still making my way through some tough chambers, so I am unsure of how much there is, but with each chamber that goes by, the story unravels, and that half hour it took me is worth it.\n\nQuick Pros & Cons:\n\nPros:\n*Intuative Puzzles\n*Clear graphics\n*Challenging & lacks repetiton\n*Many Puzzle-Solving Gadgets\n*Great graphics\n*Pick ups adding to the story, found in challenging locations.\n*I can't think of a "Cons" list\n\n\nNotes:\nThis game requires a LOT of patience & thought\nYou WILL (probably) get stuck for a while on at least one puzzle.\nRemember to look up.\nI would expect, and more than happily pay, a price tag of at least £25 for this game.\nBuy this game; it's an absolute bargain.\nBuy this game; support these incredible devs.\nBuy this game; so that, one day, there may sequels.","January 19","true","7.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

It's interesting and challenge. The fisrt-half of this game is somewhat easy because devs want players to familiarize with its play-style, the secand half become challenge and enjoyable. Final puzzle take me half hour to solve it. This is the first game features GRAVITY-oriented puzzle experience, original and creative. You can change the gravity direction of a box, make it fly upward to press a button on ceiling, or change the gravity direction of yourself and walking on ceiling. The graph is gorgeous but somewhat poor-optimization. I very surprised that this interesting game is so unnoticed, where the hell those guys vote on greenlight?

The game uses smaller layers throughout to slowly make things more and more advance.\n\nCheck points. Not only can you quit and start rooms, a lot of rooms also have save points within them allowing you to save your progress in that current puzzle. Moved that box? Well you can save it there, then kill yourself in every random way you could imagine to try and figure stuff out.\n\nCons:\n\nGraphics. Not sure what causes it, but at maxed out settings the lighting is a bit harsh. Staring anywhere near a light source can be a bit blinding and a lot of things give off light.\n\nDialog/story.  It is suppose to be a reality show, but, it gets pretty cringe worthy. I guess this shoudl be a middle ground thing since you could like a bad story/dialog mix.\n\nLoad times. Even on an SSD it takes it a few minutes just to load up every stage. If in windowed mode you could just do other stuff while loading though!\n\nThe last two stages, I'm not sure if I did the second to last stage correctly, but it just kind of enforced a trial and error until you get it right, with a very small window of success. And the finale is a "boss" which gives you no hints how to beat it.\n\n\nOver all I would say they could have done a lot more with this game if they had ditched the ending and just kept making more puzzles, after all one of the last things you get to play around with is Zero-G, but it was really only used for the boss, and one or two other puzzle rooms.\n\nFinal words on the game and TLDR If you have twenty bucks, want a puzzle game. I would suggest it.","January 20","true","15.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

As you progress through the levels (spaceship) you are faced with many puzzles and death situations in which you must use your brains to escape/pass the puzzle.\n\nPositives:\n+ Graphics are really nice\n+ Cut scenes are really in-depth and have great detail behind them\n+ Audio really adds to the atmosphere\n+ Challenge mode to test your skill\n+ Beautiful lighting effects\n\nNegatives:\n- Controller does not seem to work on the main menu\n- Sometimes I could get stuck on a puzzle and it would get me a little annoyed. (Maybe there could be a hint system in future for the easier modes?)\n- Game can take a long time to load\n\nI had a lot of fun on Attractio. Fans of Portal would definitely love this game too. I happened to get stuck often though and it really did challenge me to use my brain (what I have left of it) – I would most definitely recommend this to gamers seeking a challenge and a game which is pretty in-depth with the cutscenes and story. The game also has a challenge mode in which you can go over the levels you completed and try to beat the times for Gold, Silver or Bronze respectively.\n\nI feel the price is fair but it may sway a few individuals. For the majority I recommend a purchase. If you feel the price may be too steep then I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale. This game is definitely worth a purchase down the line though.\n\nScore: Buy it","January 25","true","1.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Each of the three characters you control all have different strengths which will require you to use your head in puzzles that require you to do different tactics.  The physics in the game are solid throughout, and the Challenge Mode does provide a little extra fun for players that beat the game.  In regards to flaws, the story and characters aren't very memorable, and the game's presentation is hit and miss.  However, as a puzzle game, it's competent and anyone that loves a good puzzle challenge will definitely get their money's worth.\n\nRating: B-","January 20","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
