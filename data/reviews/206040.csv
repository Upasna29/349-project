This game certainly ought to please hardcore RPG players and veterans with a sense of nostalgia, however there's nothing here that you haven't seen many times before in countless games.I would really like to see the folks at Spiderweb software be given a big budget and let loose. Otherwise their games will continue to be mediocre like Avernum 5. I'd give it a 6/10.","April 22, 2014","true","3.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Its very deep stat system and occasionally interesting challenge areas and boss fights are quite good, but ultimately these highlights are overcome by extreme linearity, way too many trash mobs, next to no plot, and one of the worst cases of hitpoint bloat I have ever seen in a game (late game there are some random enemies with 4,000 hitpoints. Given that the average character can do 50-100 points of damage per turn, you can work out the problem here). I really love spiderweb games, so I hate to bash this, but this is probably their worst.\n\nOf couse I still forced myself to finish the whole thing on torment difficulty, but that's only because I'm a total OCD, power gaming, masochist (and for all the game's faults, it is refreshingly difficult). Normal people who demand things like "enjoyment" and "entertainment" from their video games (novel concepts, I know) need not apply. Or better yet just play one of the other Avernum games (most of which are way better).","July 2, 2012","false","128.4"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

While Avernum 4 was super difficult and some what hard to follow, in this iteration you play as Empire's scouts, and then the fun really begins.\n\nThese games are difficult, combat wise you'll get your teeth kicked in if you're not careful or prepared. I had a warrior, an archer, a mage and a priest. Having this setup was instrumental to  my easier playthrough.\n\nYou must be aware of what you pick and their stats, as experience may be gained or lost and handicaps and advantages can make battles hard.\n\nExploration was just supreme. It's the best part of this game. Stumbling upon a crypt or a thief's hiding hole and the brief description was the most enjoyable aspect of this game. So many times did I just clean out the entire map to get the best items and supplies (and really, you'll need to!).\n\nThe choices in this game are supriginsly abundant and there are some nice rewards depending on your stance. You must be careful, because some choices may make settlements hate your guts.\n\nThis game does drag only because the combat is so difficult and punishing. Never did I feel like I reigned supreme until I started abusing the game specifically to give me an advantage. When I finished the game, just over forty hours came up and I felt exhausted. It will be a while until I move on to the next one.\n\nComparing it to 4, I'd say there's a bit more to take care of and the characters and enviroments (well everything looks pretty plain so lets call it regions instead of enviroments) were much more interesting. The challenge areas were far more challenging then 4 and there was a lot of super ancient evils to give the blade.\n\nThere were also a lot of well written quests and dialog. I remember a band of bandits that use a woman to lure you in and after you slay them all she begs for mercy. If only she was so lucky, and when I sealed her fate she burst into tears, and into gibs as she took fireballs to the face.\n\nFor the value of this game, I'd say as long as you can tolerate the archaic graphics, controls and resolution (I had to play on a smaller resolution on my 1920x1080 - you'll be in for one treat.\n\nThere is also a great walkthrough online for this game, and dont be afraid to cheat so long as it makes you progress the story.","November 8, 2015","true","41.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

For those who are only interested in fast pace action, then this is not for you.\n\nBut for those who like a game that is remarkably refined, has a driving story, and a vast open world to explore, this is the game for you. Do not automatically be driven off by the rudimentary, this is a very fun game that will have you glued to your seat!","October 5, 2014","true","13.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The hints to the next chapter are nice and the characters pretty well structured as usual,  However this  episode loses an important ingredient, which made Avernum a game so beloved by its fans: the sensation of free roaming. Normally it's the player deciding in which direction going and how to proceed the story, which has several main plots. This time instead the player is obliged to follow a single path, made by consecutive areas until the final one. The torment difficulty is praticable until a certain point, which I don't reveal to avoid spoiling, but then you are practically forced to switch to a lower difficulty not to be trapped in the middle of the game. In any case a must of those who followed the full epopea, but in my opinion the worst chapter so far.","November 16, 2014","false","25.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then this game wouldn't have come out yet, but it would probably fit in if it had done so because it is that sort of game.\n\nIncidentally, that means it is fantastic.

I played a lot of rpg titles, from classics like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima 7 and Infinity Engine games to newest games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and although Avernum does not have fancy graphics, I still think this series is one of the best rpgs ever.\n\nAvernum has great setting and story, great playability, decent length (about 100 hours) and many sidequests and secrets. Leveling up system is balanced and nowadays almost forgotten turn-based combat is a welcomed change from flashy action oriented battle systems. An old-school rpg which proves, that doesn't need "ultra high detailed" graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. Highly recommended.","August 5, 2015","true","95.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 17\nAvernum 5\nPurchase Date: 7/11/2013\n\nSpiderweb Software makes a particular kind of game.  You can think of it as a spiritual successor to old school roleplaying games like the early Ultima games.  All of their games share this in common.   Over the years the engine has changed somewhat between their games, but the core gameplay and inspirations are pretty much unchanged.\n\n\nIf you've never played a Spiderweb Software game before, this probably isn't the best game to start with.  Each chapter of Avernum is independent, but will contain references to earlier games.  So you won't be lost starting with Avernum 5, but you'll miss some background by doing so.\n\nFor those who have played Avernum 4, you won't see many differences with Avernum 5.  The Rebel class is gone and replaced with Scout, but it looks like this was simply a name change, as the class role still looks the same.  Fighter classes will have a little more to do in Avernum 5, as they have added Battle Disciplines to complement the Mage and Priest spells.\n\nAs with Avernum 4, everything continues to be presented in a 2D tile-based isometric view.  The UI components are laid out the same way, the only difference being a couple of extra buttons.\n\nAs with the prior Avernum, the game starts by having you create a party of 4 characters.  You can select from a list of classes, spend some initial skill points, and optionally select traits.  You can also select from a list of portraits for your character.  The list is pretty limited, but does include male and female options.\n\nOnce your characters are created, you'll get a quick series of static pictures and text to setup the starting point of the story, and explain how you've ended up in Avernum this time around.  As the game begins, Avernum will give tips to remind you how to do the basics like moving around, interacting with objects, and using abilities.  The game ensures that you get yourself equipped with some basic equipment before getting you into your first combat.\n\nCombat is turn-based, with each character having a limited amount of action points to be able to move and optionally perform another action like attacking or using an item or ability.  The combat is easy to pick up, and Avernum does a good job of easing you into things to start with.\n\nSpiderweb's games are not for everyone.  If you are that person who plays World of Warcraft who skips all of the quest giver's dialog to hurry up and accept the next quest, then this game will bore you to tears.  Likewise if you prefer your role playing games to have cutscenes and voice acting, then you won't be impressed here.\n\nPersonally I enjoy these games and will continue to recommend them.  For $5 this is a fantasic deal in terms of the amount of hours you will spend playing the game.  In fact, I take this a step further and just recommend the complete pack of Spiderweb Software games.  For $45 you can get 13 games to keep you gaming for a long, long time to come.","June 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Avernum V for the first time in the series you play as the Empire soldiers, which are sent to Avernum to hunt assassin of the Empress Prazac.  The gameplay feels almost exactly the same as previous parts of the game (which is awesome), the whole plot is great and fun old style turn based combat is really entertaining.  The game offers also a whole new big region to discover The Northern Frontier, which is really new thing in the series. There is also a really deep stat system, alot of (hidden)skill and spells, plus some basic alchemy and crafting system. The only cons i find, is the really small max resolution and kind of linear story, which is unusual for this series. Anyway i highly recommend this game for every old-school RPG fan, you wont be dissapointed.","June 2","true","90.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
