It is subject to change!\n\nDo you perhaps remember Unreal Tournament 2004's "Onslaught" mode? Initia shares the same underlying concept - defend your core and capture interconnected nodes. Initia, however, transports this game mode into a beautifully stylized fantasy world and adds a few twists to the gameplay. By having the player choose his skills and abilities (in a classic "action RPG" fashion), custom classes are created that make for very dynamic and versatile teamplay. The primary objective, of course, is to destroy the enemy base.\nRight now, not even 24h after release, there are very few players around to actually have larger online matches. However, my first impressions so far were quite positive. This game is quite evidently a homage to the classic era of good arena shooters while boasting enough individuality to feel like far more than a simple knock-off. I would very much love to see this game evolve and grow a steady player base.","April 30","true","3.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Its listed as a being similar to unreal tournament and I got more of a FPS Moba feel. I may be wrong but I was unable to find out as I searched for players in US-East/West and on the Europe servers and only ever found me. I would imagine because it just launched and is still early here. I may try again later and see if I can find a match.\n\nSo there was some neat things here, the shop system was a good feature and allows you to create your own play style. Visually its nice could use a tad bit of love, the sounds are pretty solid.\nMy one concern is the price I understand its a indie game and they have bills to pay also but 20$ is a little high.\nId say if a solid player base grows this game would be worth buying.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UJ5XNaAeWWE","April 29","true","0.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Very reminiscent of having a huge variety of spells and combinations like in early Elder Scrolls games like Morrowind or Oblivion. However, it's not without flaws, as it is still in Early Access. I'll go into a more detailed description below, but for brevity's sake:\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n- Combines many different aspects of element manipulation reminiscent of incredible games (Teleportation - Dishonored, Speedy magic attacks - Elder Scrolls, Invisibility/Stealth water powers)\n-Dedicated team of developers that are working hard to grow fan base (giveaways, promoting) and improve the game\n-The competitive modes are objective based and seem like fun!\n-Simple interface, and very beautiful soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Lack of players (probably won't find a match)\n-Higher level graphics require a decent computer and video card\n-Lack of tutorials or control guides\n-No single player mode (you can play against yourself in what would be competitive multiplayer, but no bots)\n\nExpanded:\n\nThis game has a very unique concept. As someone who's main experiences with online multiplayer have been console Halo and CoD (I was young, please forgive me), it was startling to see such variety in choice for character abilities. And it's only scratched the surface! Floating as a ball of light to navigate treacherous floating islands, teleporting between locations, activating invisibility on command, creating tornadoes... and that's only scratching the surface.\n\nIn order to get the game to play decently on my bootcamped Mac, I had to turn the graphics to low. Even still, it was glitching and making it near unplayable. However, I turned on V-Sync and the game proceeded to run much better! Keep this in mind.\n\nAt the moment, it's biggest flaw lies in it's lack of users. If there were even a handful of players on, this game could be great! But as it is, it's very difficult to find a match. I'm hoping to join one of the planned games later in the week, so we'll see how that goes!\n\nYou also need to be willing to learn the controls solo, in a map all to yourself. They're mainly self explanatory, but there are a few tricks worth experimenting to find (double tapping space leads to a neat jump/sprint that took a while for me to learn).\n\nThere's also a limited number of maps (2), and only 2 multiplayer modes I could see.\n\nHowever, despite the above, I have extreme confidence in the development team and their ability to turn this into a polished product. I've watched them try to increase the user base through giveaways on steamgifts, and working to publicize the game.\n\nEven with the limited elements in the element shop, combinations can produce magnificent results! It makes you feel like a truly nifty wizard (no Harry Dresden, but close) by combining new abilities to flutter your way around the map. I flew across islands as an invulnerable ball of light, then was able to drop and immediately go invisible and sneak around! If my imaginary enemy were there, they'd be trembling in fear.","May 4","true","0.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

But i coulndt play coz the match making is like taking forever. Trying to search for a server but so far no luck at all, so I'll just have to test the game by creating a game with just 1 player.( that's me of coz>.<) Tested with controller, it would me nice if you can change the speed when u are turning around, if you are just going to get killed with the super slow turning around speed >.<.\n\nP.S. Will be updating accordingly~ its really seem like a promising game after all.","May 1","false","2.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"
