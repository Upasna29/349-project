"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fireballcarwar/recommended/416380/","fireballcarwar","fireballcarwar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fireballcarwar/","606 products in account","Great game that deserves alot more exposure. Lots of care went into enemy placement and patterns instead of just flooding the screen with bullets. 12 stages in Arcade mode, which is 7 more than you will typically find in this genre. 4 ships to start with, I've unlocked 2 extra so far from playing through everyones Story mode. Feels like a fusion of new shmups and the old Caravan shooters from the PC Engine era like Star Soldier. Has a much faster feel than other games, more focused around avoiding bullet patterns entirely instead of dodging them which is really fun. There's a primary and secondary weapon system, your main gun always stays but you can change your secondary, which is usually good to use against larger enemies and bosses. There are initially 3 different secondary weapons and I've unlocked two extra, one of which, the TT Drill is AMAZING. I unlocked them by playing the Story mode with the 2 hidden characters.\n\nThis game is also a good start for beginners to this genre as once you kill enough enemies it charges up energy for a shield. The same energy for your shield is necessary for points though, so getting hit can seriously ruin your potential score. New players to this genre don't care about score, but expert shmup players do, so you have a really cool mechanic that is appealling to both beginners and pros.\n\nThe scoring system is based around letting off a bomb (Which you charge up by killing enemies) when there are tons of enemies and bullets on screen, which turns them into stars that you collect and then your ship becomes a mini-black hole and you smash into as many enemies as you can to do massive damage and get more valuable stars from those defeated enemies before a timer runs out. I think the amount of stars you picked up in the first phase dictates how long the second phase is. This is really enjoyable and kind of reminded me of Crimzon Clovers Break Mode a little bit, or even the bullet absorption mechanics of Mars Matrix and Giga Wing.\n\nThe Story mode was interesting but a little verbose, if you want just pure shooting action then play Arcade Mode. Every character has their own Story mode to play through and you get to see the events of the game through their perspective with completely new dialogue from all characters. They did a good job of making every character unique, I loved the banter between Miho and Tatiana the best, I found the insults they slung at each other hilarious. The two hidden characters had a nice dynamic in their Story, with one acting as the straight man and the other a goofball. They also managed to make Pushpa and Thoreau sympathetic characters without going too overboard. The Story is based around a joint mission between nations to Investigate the Varstray: A giant hurricane thing in the middle of space that could hold the key to defeating self replecating machine things. It managed to keep me entertained and made me want to find out more about the world, which is what Sci-Fi is supposed to do.\n\nI highly recommend it from what I've played so far, it's really well done. This game was unfortunately not featured on the front page of Steam so alot of people don't even know it exists. It deserves your support and way more attention than it got.\n\nAlso the game now has online leaderboards, full screen option and V-Sync thanks to a recent update.","December 23, 2015","true","24.3"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","40","43","3","2"

There is no need to use nice VGA like Nvidia and ATI. Just using Intel HD graphic should be enough.\n\n- Great sound music and effect, so it doesn't make you feel bored.\n\n- Story is ok but not bad, each of dialogue are different when you play every character.\n\n- Compatible opearting system with 64-bit. No problem with that.\n\n- A lot of enemy wave, but can be challenging and it should be easy to shoot them :)\n\n- Avoiding bullet can be lucky sometimes (even if you try in difficulty advanced) because you had shield protection that's depending from remaining called "Baryon" meter when you get hit. And even you can through avoid bullet in very small area and very tight.\n\n- Getting a lot of score (if you lucky to get a lot) when you unleash power from "Baryon" meter. It's fun and exciting :)\n\n- Power up your weapon is standard but useful in this game because you can shoot at back if you powered up a few while you busy shooting.\n\nCons:\n\n- Boss repetitive same design every 3 stages. It just only add some rocky machine and size mostly :(\n\n- Always start window mode with resolution 1280x720.\n\n- No configuration controller with keyboard, which is you have to use your stick controller if you want to play flexible, and it will be difficult to find button "start" when you first time to play this game whether you use a keyboard or not.\n\n- Every character story you play will always at same stage.\n\n- Some of dialogue can be vulgar sometimes, especially Miho :D\n\nOverall, not bad this game, I just like the way of mechanic this game. Worth to buy this game although the price can be a little expensive but its not to regret to buy it.\n\nVery recommended\n8/10","December 31, 2015","true","3.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spoose/recommended/416380/","Spoose","Spoose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spoose/","1142 products in account","An extremely fast paced shmup that seems to blend bullet hell gameplay along with some caravan aspects. Namely extremely destructive weaponry, along with TONS of enemies on screen. The game's incredibly fun to play, but it still feels somewhat unfinished in its current state due to lacking online leaderboards, replay support, and a practice mode along with some other features that are usually in games like this. I'd still recommend the game, but you'd be better off waiting for a sale if you're unsure.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYP5WxbzXq4","December 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jodwin/recommended/416380/","jodwin","Jodwin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jodwin/","209 products in account","This is a seriously good shmup.\n\nHurricane of the Varstray might seem like an odd mix at first: It looks like a bullet hell game, but it actually plays more like a traditional shoot-em-up. It retains the tiny, pixel-perfect hitbox of usual bullet hells, but throws away slow movement and more intricate bullet patterns in favor of fast paced action. Similarly the enemies and their bullets move faster than you might have come to expect from Touhou or Cave, for example. In return, you get recharging shields and bombs to help you deal with the ridiculous onslaught of alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe stages are well put together, although with the high paced action it's hard to tell them apart. Boss design is a little lackluster for a bullet hell game, but stays more true to Varstray's shmup roots. All in all, if your favourite early 90's shmup and a modern bullet hell game had a love child, Varstray would be that game. On crack.","January 3","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Clearing the game will only takes you few tries, so for survival matters, this game is really easy, even on its harder Advanced mode. So the whole point of this game consist of its scoring system which is VERY addictive and simple to understand.\n\nFew thing I must add:\n\nThe leaderboard does not seperate the difficulty mode, it's all in one bag, that you play easy or hard mode.\nReplay isn't working and it's not even possible to select it, even thou it is on screen, same for the challenge mode. Really weird...\n\nMusic is excellent in this game, not the usual euro trance Dojin game can deliver.\n\nIf you are into modern shoot them up and love to get tons of flashy items such as a Cave game, you might like this one, even thou it's very different than the usual shmup genre. I recommand it, it's a lot of fun !","December 28, 2015","true","14.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Was a bit weary and wishlisted it to come on sale, but after only getting 10% off, I feel it was a very fair price. Says DX11, but looks like DX9.0c to me. Not a bad thing, just an observation. I love you shooting your ememies to power up your shields, a fun and unique style of play. 12 fairly long levels, but bosses are just too easy. Have played early access titles that feel more finished, but it looks like the developers are on the right track with constantly updating the game. Did have problems setting the game to fullscreen from the options menu, would get a black screen and game would lock up, forcing me to restart my PC. Not sure if its because of my ultrawide screen(2560x1080), but if I press ALT+ENTER, it switches to fullscreen and windowed mode just fine. Something that many older dx9.0c title do with Windows10, but this is supposed to be a DX11 title, so I am a little baffled. But if you are sitting on the fence, I can highly recommend this game to any shmup fan, its well worth the asking price..  But don't let the little things like that stop you from buying this title, its an AMAZING game! Its got XBox360 written all over it, really looking forward to see what updates the developer has in store for us, because they have added quite a bit of content from the time it was released until I bought it. And they just added score attack today. The developers are really trying! KUDOS!!!!","February 28","true","8.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","4"

Space lesbians! (kinda maybe?) A story! Mostly fun gameplay/mechanics!\n\nOn the other hand...you can't slow down your ship like in Cave shmups and etc., the translation is kinda wonky, and, well....\n\nSo the game has this mechanic where you build up a bar by shooting enemies and when the bar is full you can shoot screen-clearing beams that turn enemy shots into medals. The game is kinda built around this! The problem is that when I say 'the game is built around this' i mean 'i hope you like the screen near-constantly being saturated with bullets in the later levels with no rhyme or reason!' Even with a little wiggle room ('cos you have a shield) I went through like three continues in the last two levels alone. :v\n\nThat said, it's still pretty neat, just.....y'know, maybe get it on sale if that last part sounds overwhelming.","January 18","true","1.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
