Especially the idea of converting basebuilding into augmenting nodes on the map, which need to be captured, justifies some praise. Adding an alternative victory condition by letting you assault the enemies fleet in space and allowing to spare ressources to convert neutral armies are good ideas.\n\nNegative\nEtherium is a Multiplayer-Title. You see your rank displayed on the main screen. I can not tell much about that. It might even be good. The problem is, that the game has barely any singleplayer. There is a campaign-like mode that lets you assault and conquer the AI on several planets, but it is basically just playing the same mission over and over with adjusted difficulty. It is basically the same structure, that "Emperor: Battle for Dune" had. Unfortunately, the campaign, althou having much more random events and tactical possibilities on the macro-map, has nothing to offer on the actual RTS level, which is the playing out of planetary combat. There is no story, there are no cutscenes, there is nothing but the unit descriptions and a short faction intro. The factions themselves also play rather indifferent for my taste, but that´s debatable.\n\nResult:\nIf you are into Multiplayer RTS and seek for  some new twists on the genre for a good price, then this game is for you.\nIf you are looking for an old-school campaign-RTS, I recommend you Grey Goo. (Which would be my decision.)\n\n4/10","March 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 390 of 486 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","390","486","15","15"

You can focus on making decision. And having only a limited set of options makes every choice count.\n\nSo it doesn't sound to bad, right? HOWEVER as I initially stated Etherium is obviously built with Multiplayer in mind. You have only a lackluster "skirmish vs AI" - campaign mode, your "rank" is displayed in the main menu aswell as a button to enlist in matchmaking... If only pressing that button would do anything!\n\nBecause YES, Etherium is dead already. I strongly advice to look it up on steamcharts.com, should you have any willingness to buy it left in you. With a peak of around 15 (!) players per day this is a multiplayer title with no one to play with.\n\nIt should come as no suprise to the devs, that people will not pick up their game, if they fail so hard at raising awareness. Etherium is yet another failed attempt to create a low-budget title that stands on multiplayer alone, but just doesn't have the content, quality and appeal to get enough people to actually play it.\n\nConclusion: Steer clear of this game and save yourself the money. Neither the Singleplayer nor Multiplayer are worth the price tag.","May 7, 2015","false","8.8"," 220 of 283 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","220","283","12","7"

Etherium brings in a dynamic weather system where you HAVE to adapt to situations by selling units before they get blown away by hurricanes,crossing icy rivers for flanks after a big old blizzard,running away from a volcano that's about to blow up and steamroll your troops and more. AI's are perfectly fine on my end, medium AI's aren't that stupid,easy AI's are,hard AI's are challenging. The gameplay is also great but some of the controls are a little bit odd,you'll see for yourself when you buy the game. Conquest mode isn't online yet as of the current time and date of this review which is... 1 PM pst 3/25/15.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe only thing that I'm left wondering about is....What happened to the multiplayer? Multiplayer's dead on my end,I don't see any rooms in the lobby and there's no chatroom system whatsoever so it's a wee bit hard to connect to other peeps and make sure that it's not you who has a glitched/bugged/dead multiplayer system. Overall,it's a great game, they just have to fix the multiplayer system. Lots of people can't get multiplayer to work. Hopefully,they'll add more content to the game. $30 isn't too high or too little of a price for this game. ESPECIALLY if there's more people in multiplayer.\n\nCores for RTS games.\nWhen you look for an RTS game,graphics are a nice plus but it's not ALL about the graphics. The graphics are great for an RTS. If you wanted an RTS that has a loooooot of graphics go for SC2 if you want to take a risk and plunge into a game filled with potential and support the developers,here you are. The gameplay's pretty much a SC2 and Company of Heroes mix. Gameplay is a major plus for a game. Putting all of the big Plus's for RTS games or just adding some innovation/improving the ideas for RTS itself is another big plus. Multiplayer database is ANOTHER big thing in ALL RTS games. If an RTS doesn't have a big multiplayer base,it's a goner. This RTS is suffering in that direction.\n\nEdit:Conquest is on! Ratings have been updated. 1:20 PM pst 3/25/15\nEdit: They really need to add some lore into the game though. That's also another big problem in the game that I hadn't bothered thinking about because of the lazers flying across the map on the battlefield. Regardless, still a fun game,just need a bit more content. Ratings have been changed as of 3/25/15 10:14 PM pst.\n\nOverall rating:7/10\nGraphics:9/10\nContent:6/10\nMultiplayer's dead/not showing up?:3/10\nMusic:8/10\nAI mentality:9/10\nBuyability mentality?:YES,and yes. The game's ready to go,just a few slight flaws,a fix needed for multiplayer and some actual lore to be passed down into the game.Also need a bigger multiplayer base.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Haven't played this in a while, back when it first released we didn't have the problem of the game crashing but now the problem's been introduced now for some unknown reason. Don't know how they screwed the game up. Game's great if it's not crashing but regardless, don't buy the game until the problem's fixed. It has a lot of potential and can still be a developed game.\nUpdated 5/26/2016","March 25, 2015","true","14.3"," 116 of 157 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","116","157","13","0"

Clean up the bugs, add more narrative, more cinematics, unique armies and you can make an okay game.\n\nPROS\n1. Weather\nMagnetic Storms (prevents units from moving), Blizzard (freeze water), Hurricane (kills air unit), Lava (damages land units). I love how it changes the gameplay.\n\n2. Secondary Factions\nVery interesting stories. Guardians (Robotic Security System), Raiders (Pirates) and Parasites (Giant Insects).\n\n3. Cover\nI like how you can place units in trees to prove cover. Reminds me of the COH2 system.\n\n4. Space View\nVery interesting. Building a fleet to attack is semi-satisfying. The ships are very boring but combining the Political Cards and the fleet makes for an interesting game.\n\n5.Political Cards\nVery useful and fun.\n\n6. Air Transport\nI love how units just get deployed from an airship insteading of just appearing out of thin air.\n\nAir transport for 50 etherium is quite interesting. I would suggest an immediate air drop of units from the moment you build them. E.g. Comms unit in a transport, instead of dropping a Comms unit, transport and fly.\n\nCONS\n1. Bugs\nGUI is buggy. You can't click on the ships in the space game. Planets do not appear until the AI approaches them. You can't open the reputation window in Conquest Mode.\n\n2. AI\nWay too slow while they compute their turns. Space battles take so long to finish.\n\n3. Tech Tree\nIt is redundant and very annoying. Having to unlock troops through tech points slows down the game in an unfun way.\n\n4. Incomplete\nThe story is incomplete. No explaination of the Palaces, why certain planets are important, no end game cinematic for a faction.\n\n5. Boring Armies\nThe armies are cookie cutter copies of each other. Units are so boring. They don't have abilities or special functions. I would suggest some form of asymmetry and some narrative for each unit.\n\n6. Number of Slots\nIt is really silly to have to capture multiple territories just to get supply, tech points , logistics points, Command Points, etherium refineries etc etc... What if you want to tech rush? If you sell the tech centre, you lose the technology point. This form of balancing and limiting your choices is horrible as it doesn't add anything fun. I would suggest adding more slots for each territory e.g. 3 slots minimum. This will accelerate the game immensely.\n\n7. Map\nBland. Weather is good though. I would suggest some architecture.\n\n8. Abilities (CP)\nAn orbital bombing experience is odd. AI automatically moves away so you know that you save it for structures. Sure, the AI is smarter in this manner but it's not very satisfying.\n\n1st 3 abilities are copies of each other. There should be more abilities to showcase how unique each race is.\n\n9. Buildings\nWhile having one Command HQ is easy to control and upgrading control points is efficient, it is boring. Other RTSs have different structures E.g. Barracks for Infantry, Workshop for Vehicles, Air Field for Air Units. I would suggest visual upgrades to the Command HQ at the bare minimum.\n\n10. Deployment\nThematically, you are deploying units from the space fleet. You should allow them to deploy in sectors you control.","July 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","53","63","0","10"

The graphics were appealing at first and gave the game a unique look. I finished the tutorial skirmish and decide to load up a conquest game tutorial. An enemy fleet appears and I am instructed to attack it. I was expecting a space battle or atleast a cinematic but instead was greeted with 4 shots from each ship being fired in a system ressembling a dumbed down $5 DS game I played once.\n\nCrash...\n\nI reload the game and assume that it must be a bug in conquest mode so I start a skirmish game and I am introduced to the factions. These showed little inginuity: You have your typical corrupt or oppressive human empire, a technologically advanced alien religious zealot and a group of aliens who sacrificed their entire race in order to live inside war machines. The last one was the first bit of creativity in this game that I found worth the effort. 3 minutes in and my screen freezes for a moment then my fleet decides to fly off and it says that I am defeated. confused I try another skirmish game.\n\nCrash...\n\nBeing a modern game I expected it to run smoothly on windows 8 with 16 Gigs of Ram and a higher end graphics card.\n\nAfter finally playing through my first few unbroken skirmish games I am incredibly dissapointed to find that this game also suffers from over-balancing. All but 3 of the units and buildings per faction have incredibly similar stats to each other within the faction and share projectiles, names and descriptions withe similar units across the faction.\nThe symmetry means that what faction you play as has little to no effect on gamplay other than visuals (Unless you go as the incredibly over-powered alien faction and their light walkers that dominate early game.)\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10\n- Buy it if it's on sale or if you crave a simplistic RTS or symmetrical gameplay could be so much more.","September 4, 2015","false","2.7"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","5"

Etherium comes at a time where we have very few good real time strategy games around. The last one I played was mechs and mercs black talons which was a woefully bad game in every aspect. Rather than base building, Etherium core mechanic focuses around control points called monoliths. Instead of base building, one you have captured a monolith you can add extensions to it. These extensions have different functions such as a Etherium refinery for improved Etherium production in that zone, to a spaceport allowing you to deploy troops for that location.\n\nEach zone must be connected in some way to your main base to function properly. Should the enemy take a middle zone and split your territory. Buildings and more importantly Etherium production will go offline until reconnected. Speaking of Etherium, its the only production resource in the game and is aquiced every minute. Some regions will have Etherium spheres to harvest which are valuable zones to control and others won't.\n\nThere are a variety of units available in each faction and more can be unlocked via the tech trees. Units each have strengths and weaknesses and through combat can be promoted in battle to become stronger. Etherium has a decent mix of infantry, tank and air units. My issue with them is that each factions is very similar in appearance to the next not just in aesthetic but in gameplay too. You also have turrets available to protect your bases but you are limited to three per region.\n\nOne thing I love about the game is the indigenous sub factions on the planets. These sub factions can either be ignored, destroyed or even rallied to your cause in battle. By converting the necessary extension you build up points with a sub faction over time once the bar is full you gain control of these powerful ally's which can literally turn the tide of a battle. The enemy can also rally these sub factions to their side and it can often be a race to gain control of them.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen you can see several abilities known as command skills. These skills are different for each faction and use up command points in battle which replenish over time. Command skills come in handy in a variety of situations, such as the orbital barrage which can be used to destroy units or buildings quickly.\n\nAnother great feature of Etherium is the environmental hazards in battle known as climatic events. Depending on the type of planet your on you'll get a timed weather event that can have different effects. An example of this is a volcanic planet having eruptions that destroy units or electromagnetic storms that play havoc with your ability to use command skills. These events can hamper your battle plans but can also be used to your advantage.\n\nBattles are pretty fast paced which is something I like to see, it doesn't mean matches can't be long but it does mean than your kept on your toes often. I personally enjoyed that there is a variety of tactics to employ in battle and of course to ultimately win. I was also pretty impressed with the enemy AI as on the harder difficulties it was a serious challenge to compete.\n\nOne to four player online multiplayer is available too which can be very fun. The fast paced nature of battles and with all the skills, environmental effects and sub factions in play, multiplayer can be a lot of fun. It certainly adds to the longevity of the title and I feel without the multiplayer component the game would not be worth the price tag.\n\nIn all I feel that Etherium provides a good competent RTS experience. It's complete focus on macro-management rather than micro management leaves it feeling somewhat without the depth of other more renowned RTS games. It certainly has lots of room to improve, I think a larger conquest mode would have been better allowing for a longer campaign. Like I have mentioned I would have also liked to have seen more diversity between the factions units and play styles to give the game more replayability. However that being said, it is in my opinion one of the better RTS's to have been released in recent years.\n","March 25, 2015","true","8.3"," 74 of 111 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","74","111","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/245370/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Etherium Review\nDeveloped by Tindalos Interactive (known for Stellar Impact) and published by Focus Home Interactive (Cities XL Series, Trine 2, Farming Simulator), Etherium is a daring new multiplayer RTS game looking to pump fresh energy into a slumbersome genre. Not since Starcraft 2 has there been such a relevant sci-fi entry for a 4X multiplayer game. Tindalos is a small, independent studio so much credit is deserving for even attempting such a monumental task.\n\nIn Etherium players will choose one of three different factions, each with their own unique abilities. These factions battle across multiple maps for control of a precious resource called etherium either against other players in multiplayer games or against AI players in single player skirmish mode and conquest mode. There are a multitude of units and upgrades available and units can level up through combat. Aside from the main factions, some maps also include a neutral faction which can advantageously be swayed into aiding your cause and be a nuisance for your opponents. The maps offer a variety of terrain features and can be used to your advantage as well. Additionally, Etherium contains a weather element based on terrain that can greatly impact battles and strategies.\n\nEtherium gameplay will be similar to most other RTS games of the genre and easy for veteran gamers to become familiar with early on (there is a tutorial included for newcomers), but in a much more direct approach. Instead of expansive base-building elements, Etherium introduces the idea of dividing the maps into zones with a central node where players can build a multi-functional "control structure" to gain control of that particular region. Each of these structures have a variety of upgrades and expansions available, offering a lot of flexibility in your strategic approach. This stream-lining concept allows for more focus on the combat element of the game while still offering a full compliment of benefits and options for your faction.\n\nWhile the graphics aren't going to leave players with that "Wow!" feeling, they are solid and more than get the job done. Zooming in will show some greater detail but is wasted since a game like this requires players to have a broader visibility of the map. There is a good soundtrack and the cut-scenes offer up a back story of sorts, which is good since (for unknown reasons) the developers chose not to include a lengthy single player campaign. The different factions are well-balanced, which is important for a mutiplayer combat game. This game has low system requirements and runs smoothly on most systems even using the highest visual settings. The AI is very intelligent and the combat is very direct so players can fully expect to be challenged even in single player skirmishes.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Balanced and unique factions\n+  Variety of units, abilities, research improvements\n+  Challenging gameplay\n+  Various maps, terrains, weather elements\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Multiplayer Combat w/ Leaderboards\n+  Quality Graphics & Sound\n+  Smooth rotating camera with simple controls\n+  Comfortable UI\n+  Moderate replay value\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  No single player campaign\n-  Combat units lack intelligence/must be controlled directly\n-  No combat formations or advanced control functions\n-  Graphics are dull & un-interesting\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========While Etherium doesn't reach its full potential and may fall short in comparison with some of the most renown 4X Space RTS games of our generation, it is still a solid game and offers many hours of entertaining gameplay. Everything this game does, it does well and could be the building block for a successful series with a few tweaks and additional improvements. Time will tell, but for RTS fans who have been neglected by the genre for a long time, this game is one you definitely want to get your hands on. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 13, 2015","true","41.7"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","38","53","3","3"

Probably geared towards the 20-40 minute match duration popular in the oh-so-modern MOBA genre, matches are not only on the short but also on the simple end. To provide jolly ol' strategic diversity, there's even a way to turtle your way to victory by defending a few structures that damage the enemy's Magic Off-Map Life Force for ten minutes.\nUrrrgh.\n\nIt doesn't help that in my second game, it first crashed for my friend, and then after about a minute crashed for me too.\n\n\nPick this one up when it's in a bundle.","July 18, 2015","false","1.1"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/245370/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Etherium is an interesting Sci-Fi, Real Time Strategy game. It feels like a lot of other RTS's out there and doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table. It has a playable tutorial which makes the commands and controls easy to learn. The story in Etherium doesn't really shine through in the tutorial and seems fairly generic. It isn't a bad game, it just feels like a lot of other RTS's lately. I would have liked to see more base building in this game and felt that aspect was very limited. It didn't seem like there was a big difference between the different factions, but there were special abilities you could unlock once you expanded a colony with the technology center, and those were sort of neat.\n\nAll in all, I think the game could have been a lot better if they had some diversity with the factions, and allowed the bases to be more expandabe. The game does offer single-player campaigns for each faction, as well as Skirmish mode, and Multiplayer Mode, but there appear to be long waits for some of the Multiplayer games.

Nope, it is not!\nMaybe around 5 or 10 in a sale.

(The skybox is also amazing!)\n-There is more combat and less base building.\n-Great in-game features that can change the game in seconds. Such as secondairy factions you can take controle of and weather effects.\n\nThe many bad things:-It crashes alot!\n-Gets repetitive after a while.\n-Bots can either be really smart or crap.\n-Factions are not very different from each other. Sure, there are some different units and abilities for each faction. But compared to other RTS games. That's nothing! Each faction is basicly a re-skin from each other.\n-The player base is dead.\n\nYup, I couldn't find any players online!\nThe game developers left the game like trash. Etherium could have been so much more!\nProof: http://steamcharts.com/app/245370\n\nMy opinion:So please take my advice. Yes it is fun to play with friends and all that.

Here's your details.\n\nThe tutorial is largely overbearing and will barely let you do anything outside of it's very specific order of events. It will also crash when its finally over. Because why not, we're already thrusting towards whatever planet we're attacking so lets not leave the job half-cocked.\n\nThere's multiple things in the interface that don't have any information about them because tooltips are non-existent except where they used arbitrary bars instead of numbers. Because those are always great, especially when the bars are different but the numbers are the same. What did I say about "useful"? Yeah. This is the polar opposite.\n\nAre you going to tell someone new to your game why that unit/category is locked? Maybe what these seemingly meaningless icons/"buttons" on the screen are? Apparently not. Weather might as well have been background noise because the game certainly wasn't telling me what it did, a great candidate for using the UI.\n\nControl groups are the only useful hotkeys they put in the game. Meanwhile they declined on adding them for anything related to construction or training. Which for an RTS of all things, means you might as well not have them. Trying to play SC2 on my Intuos4 was more enjoyable than this.\n\nThere isn't an indicator for the space a unit will take up for placement. Coupled with the bright idea of not displaying where incoming units are, flares are nigh meaningless. Even for indicating somewhere is invalid because of terrain, the best you get is a different cursor. Why is there even manual placement for such a miniscule valid area again? Anyone? Was it not skillful enough?\n\nThe crashing was also rearranging hotkeys at random. It's easily the worst RTS I've personally played. It took all the lazy routes to design from hard counters to RNG snowballing veterancy and feels incredibly half-♥♥♥♥♥. Maybe they should've tried figuring out what the good parts were of all the games they took a scalpel to.","July 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","27","43","0","9"

The game has some really interesting concepts, but overwhelmingly fails to provide a rewarding experience.\n\nAt $30 the game simply doesn't pack enough content to be worth the time.  An average RTS game is going to be worth hundreds of hours of gameplay, this one might not pass the 20 hour marker.\n\nBalance in the game is pretty awful with one faction just being overwhelmingly better than the others.\n\nWhat the game does offer is a unique take on base building giving you a lighter version of it.  Your home base can build a number of attachments.  Logistics allows you to build more units, tech allow you to build better units, and refineries allow you to earn more money.  Then there are more specialized buildings that can be used as part ofa strategy, like the military industrial complex which reduces costs from losing units.\n\nOn the map are various points that need to be captured.  Each point will build 1 or 3 attachments.  Building with only 1 attachment can build a refinery.  Ones with 3 cannot.\n\nThe main problem of the game is that things sort of snowball out of control fast.  Holding on to an extra base gives you a definitive advantage over your opponent in which case it's less likely you'll be able to come back from a loss.\n\nThe game also features the option of buying out neutral factions.  Neutral factions will only attack you if you attack them and are place in areas that would eliminate a potential flank.  Buying out factions is a huge investment and honestly... a waste of time.  The advantage is gaining a few extra units that don't count towards your unit cap.\n\nIt's a very disappointing game in a poorly planned series.  Hold off on buying this one indefinitely.","March 25, 2015","false","3.1"," 70 of 123 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","70","123","4","6"

There are two major problems:\n\n1. Lack of cutscene/campaign. Some of us strategy gamers like a story with their RTS, this doesn't have one. It's just a bunch of skirmishes.\n\n2. The more important problem, repetitive game mechanics. The opposing players always, always attack your base every turn, like clockwork, 2 attacks per ship, with 2 players attacking.... That's a minimum of 4 battles/turn before you can do anything..\n\nAnd it's always the same deal with that, build the biggest, strongest X unit in the biggest Y number in every battle. Then, when its your turn, land grab 2 territories per ship. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. If the game is minimized, or not in focus. It likes to crash, meaning you can't pause, and it only auto saves once in awhile...\n\nso... I wouldn't bother buying this game, your better off playing Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3, at least that game has fantastic fan service shuffled inside of a awesome RTS with a STORY, and minimal bugs.","May 7","false","168.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The egg, it's always the egg, there's a perfectly good planet floating around minding its own business when "Boom" a ruddy great egg appears on its surface, no sign of the Madrith, just the egg, it's always just the tasty, tasty egg.\n\n\nEgg and Soldiers\n\nThese particular giant eggs are far too valuable to be left alone whilst nature takes its course,  they're so valuable in fact, that when they start appearing once every thousand years or so, the whole galaxy gears up to fight over them.\n\n\nFree Range Spicy Tiberium Alternative\n\nYou see, these eggs contain a unique and amazing resource, a minute quantity of which can produce enough energy to power a large colony and enable vast vessels to travel through space at the speed of light.\n\nThis eggy gas is so valuable that the three dominant races of the galaxy, in anticipation of a visit from the extra-dimensional Easter bunny, build up their forces and the millennial "Egg Wars" begin.\n\n\nEggs-plore\n\nLuckily for us, the  Madrith are creatures of habit, they always lay their eggs on six "deposit" planets, each with their own varied environments, ranging from" Hoth-like" Ice Worlds to "Tatooine-like" desert globes, each environment provides its own challenges, it's own weather events (which is a nice touch) and each will require a different strategic approach.\n\nTo get to these planets you're going to need to construct fleets and park them in orbit, from there you can clear out any enemy fleets before sending the troops down for the ground war\n\nDon't expect a "Distant Worlds" or "Sins of a Solar Empire" type experience here though, this is a simplistic "space layer" used primarily to select which planet to fight on next with a little espionage and research mixed in for good measure.\n\n\nEggs-ploit\n\nWhen you've selected your battleground of choice, you'll be treated  to a cut scene showing the seed of your first colony drop down from space and establish your initial base.\nYou'll quickly want to sniff out some eggy goodness and start gathering its Etherium, this will be the resource you'll be using to build units and structures in the game.\n\n\nEggs-pand\n\nEach planet is divided up into territories with each territory having a monolith which you need to take control of.\nThis is achieved by building a "Comms Infantry" which you can send out to establish an outpost at the monolith site.\nThese outposts can then be expanded with a choice of extensions, each of which will provide a bonus regarding Etherium production, research, number of units you can control, etc.\n\nYou can also build a limited number of turrets to help defend your interests in each territory. There are a few different types to choose from, each with their own particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nEggs-terminate\n\nThey say that attack is the best form of defence and that certainly holds true in Etherium.\n\nYou're going to need an effective war machine to remove any unwanted intruders from the map and there are plenty of units for you to construct, providing you've had chance to research them, the command points to control them and the Etherium to pay for their construction.\n\nThis research mechanic does  make the initial combat encounters of the game a slightly shallow affair as you'll only be churning out basic infantry until you've managed to build up a few research points to unlock the more interesting units.\n\n\nEgg-stra\n\nIn addition to the three dominant powers in the game you also encounter three minor races.\n\nYou can steam roller over these and wipe them out or if you want to be a little more subtle, you can try and bring them round to your side, this is achieved by converting some of your Etherium refinery improvements in to a black-market service which will gain the minor factions favour, you might even benefit from a unique unit or two if you take the time to play nice with the little guys.\n\nThere are also a bunch of special abilities you can utilise to give you an edge on the battlefield, these range from temporarily dispelling the fog of war in a certain place on the map to blasting the hell out of an area with an orbital cannon (which is hugely satisfying!).\n\nThere is also a political card mechanic which you can play in the space layer of the game between battles, these could help you ally with one of the previously mentioned "little races" or maybe even force an enemy to miss a turn. This is a welcome addition to add a little more depth to the game.\n\n\nFaberge\n\nLike a Faberge egg, Etherium can be quite pleasing to look at initially, holding the right mouse button down lets you look around the landscape, you can even look up to the sky where you'll see ships in orbit taking pot shots at each other.\n\nHowever, the more you look  at a Faberge Egg, the more you realise it's just a glittery egg, the same can be said of Etheriums graphics, once the novelty of the right click free cam wears off, the graphics themselves begin to look a little mundane, not awful, just not as special as you'd initially hoped.\n\n\n"Cut" Scenes\n\nDon't go into this game expecting rich cut scenes and a detailed narrative thread interwoven between the battles or you'll be disappointed, the fight for the eggs premise is about as deep as the plot gets, which is a little disappointing, I've always viewed little narrative cut scenes in RTS titles to be a reward for winning the preceding battle.\n\n\nHello, Anyone There?\n\nEtherium also really wants to be a multiplayer title, which is fine and probably explains the lack of narrative, but online play does seem a little on the quiet side, especially for such a new game, that's not to say that by the time you read this a healthy community won't have built up around the multiplayer experience....  I hope so because it's needed to increase the longevity of the games appeal.\n\nHowever, the single player campaign and skirmish modes whilst not dazzling  are perfectly entertaining in their own right and the AI seems competent which is always a huge plus for an RTS title.\n\n\nEgg-erium\n\nEtherium is a competent RTS and it ticks a lot of the right boxes, if your looking for a straight forward no nonsense experience you could do a lot worse, the downside is that whilst its a perfectly playable RTS it doesn't really bring anything new to the breakfast table.\n\nIt's like an egg, it's nice, you know what to expect, if you're in the mood for it then you'll probably enjoy it, but sometimes you want something more than an egg for breakfast.\n\n\n\nFor the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com","April 11, 2015","true","4.6"," 41 of 70 people (59%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","59","41","70","40","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/245370/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","Etherium plays like a slower paced RTS-lite with a focus on resource management and control in conjunction with unit management. There are three interesting and visually varied races with their own uses of the resource, and the units, structures, assets and graphics in general are pleasant to look at, but combat is mediocre, gameplay is bland and gets very boring very fast and when considering the frequent crashes and problems, this might well be worth completely passing by. I feel like the developers have tried to emphasize the battlefield as a whole and the player choices and routes to different areas, and have tried to strip the standard building/production mechanics down to a minimum so that the players' focus is more general and overviewish like in, for example, Supreme Commander, but it hasn't worked very well and honestly results in the game feeling bland as a whole.\n\nThere is no focus on single-player other than a very lacklustre vs A.I. Skirmish series which doesn't offer any story or anything you'd expect from the big players like the Age of Empires', the Starcrafts, etc. I understand that it's a smaller title with a lower budget, but the lack of single-player element really is a big turn off.\n\nSo then the focus is on the multiplayer, which has its own problems. All there is to let you know how you're doing overall is a rank in the top left, and with no stats or information on your matches or even your games as a whole, it's basically a matter of finding and playing games for their own sake, which sounds fine in theory, but in reality is another bland, boring aspect of this game.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the fact that multiplayer is essentially dead. It took me 12+ minutes to find a game, during the free trial no less, and there was no alert or notification that I'd joined a game, but that didn't matter because my opponent was apparently afk anyway. For a game focused entirely on multiplayer to have so few players and nothing to encourage team-building, tournaments or improvement is simply an appalling failure.\n\nHighlights\nThe visual styling and art styles of each of the three races are mildly interesting and generally pretty good. The maps are all fairly varied and the map assets are interesting. In general, all the visual elements are fairly good in Etherium.\n\nNode management is very smooth and quick. The ability to replace or move a Spaceport across the map for example, takes just two clicks and 2 seconds.\n\n* Despite the games many design issues, the gameplay as a whole can be fairly fun when against evenly matched opponents.\n* The different routes to victory are interesting and add a little depth that could've otherwise been missed.\n\nMistakes\nThe main problem with Etherium, at least at the time of review, is technical. Unexplained and seemingly random crashes are very frequent and even completing the tutorial for me involved 3 crashes and re-openings of the game. With no patch notes from the developers this is simply unforgivable and means buying this game is a risk. Though there are user suggested fixes in community posts. There are also a number of smaller problems that bring this title down.\n\n* Units are very basic, and provide hard counters to other units. There is no real depth of combat strategy, it's more about area and resource management, which is fine, but something more than rock/paper/scissors would've been appreciated.\n* The U.I. is very unintuitive at first, and takes too long to figure out, and the tutorial, while polished, does a poor job of keeping things simple, especially when continually crashing.\n\nRecommendations\nI've given this a fairly hard time, but at the end of the day the game would actually be an average to above average RTS title if the Multiplayer existed. Unfortunately the genre has far better options at better prices, and for £14.99/19.99€/$19.99 at the time of review, it's just not worth it unless you're an RTS fiend. Had the multiplayer been a success, this would've been a fair choice and average+ game but for now, there are better options on Steam and elsewhere and you're better served passing this by.\n\n* Looking for somewhat similar but more solid RTSs' on Steam? Supreme Commander Gold Edition is equally priced, has far more content and does the world overview feel much better. Supreme Commander 2 is also worth checking and is cheaper and more highly rated. Grey Goo also focuses on decision making and resource management but has much stronger story and single-player, but it's twice the price of Etherium.\n* A seemingly successful fix to the after-game crashes has been posted on the Community","July 16, 2015","true","8.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoninsect/recommended/245370/","neoninsect","NeonInsect","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoninsect/","99 products in account","Etherium is a great new RTS title. It's good balanced for an initial release, and the AI is really challenging. So if you're used to smash the hardest AI in other games, try ths one.\nYou can choose between three factions. Each faction has a unique bonus (one has four slots for units, the other four slots for turrets...)\n\nIt is not a classic RTS with basebuilding. You basicly conquer the map and upgrade your mainbase and the facilities for each sector, which makes it simple to get started and still is interesting because you still have to make the right choices or even be capable of change the choice and your strategy.\n\nThe units are well balanced. For each unit of the enemy you have a unit that can fight it, as long as you have enough Etherium, as long as your techlevel is high enough. And that's where the difficulty starts, in a positive way.\nIt also has potential to become an entertaining esports game. But...\n\n--------------------------\nUpdated 31.03: Soloplayer Campaign Review:\n\nThere are three "campaigns" for each faction. After you've chosen your faction, you'll get introduced by some pictures and voiceover/text to the motives and backgrounds of them, which is interesting, though it could be implemented better (cinematics would upgrade this alot). Then a little tutorial and the thing starts. You can imagine this as sort of a round based board game, with 6 planets.\n\nEach round, you can make your moves with the fleet, upgrade your techlevel based on the techpoints you hold. Per round you have general action points and fleet specific actionpoints.\nWith the general action points you can buy cards (you get a card each round), play a card/cards, spy the techlevel and missions of your opponent, or - if you can - buy a new fleet\nWith the fleet action points, you can shoot the enemy fleet which is in the same orbit, repair your hull, conquer/attack a sector of a planet. Goal of the game is to hold at least 12 winningpoints for one round, or - I'm guessing now - to hold the most points by the end of the last round (I think it was like 16 rounds). You get those points by completing missions and play the cards giving you those points.\n\nResumee: I really like this gamemode. It will be a different game everytime you play it, especially with the tough KI it won't bore you too much. Though the fights are always the standart fights. I hope for more diversity in future and I also hope for a real story campaign and addons for this conquest mode.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo the negative points:\n...I believe the distributer and the developers made some big mistakes.\nFirst of all: You can't throw a game on the market without having made anything in terms of advertising. I just heard about it one day before it is meant to be released. I know more about the smallest indiegame starting on greenlight - no joke - because of twitter. You probably wanna try this one too.\n\nSecond: I don't understand, why the developers say "by the devs of Stellar Impact". It's nothing you can be proud of. Not because it is a bad game, because you left this game alone and still sell it, though you can't play it without others. You should have make it f2p, if you do not want to shut it down. Guys, this is your second chance. If you mess it up, I will never ever buy anything made by you guys again.\n\nA last negative thing: It is hard to find anyone in matchmaking. But this is of course because it has a low playerbase. So buy this game, give it a try and change it. It's worth the 30 bucks.\n\n-------------------\nIn a previous version of this review I critizized that the game's Solo Campaign isn't released. This was  a bug I experienced.","March 29, 2015","true","21.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","7"

Including making an army of colossi and completely wiping everything off on your way to the enemy HQ or (teleporting/transporting with dropships) your army of infantry straight to the enemy palace.\n\n-It has a few unique features, such as dynamic weather events that can destroy you or aid you in your battle.\n\n\n\nAs for the negative things though...\n\n-It lacks content, although it has every unit specialized for everything.\n(and it has 24 maps, only 6 of which can be played 2v2, also approximately 22(at least for Intar) units for each faction)\n\n-No mod support\n\n-Random crashing after battles(only during 1st session and then super rarely) and a few corrupt, unedited files\n\n-A few annoying glitches, such as being unable to kick players from your lobby if they joined while you were ready, unless you manually fix that by swapping the player's place with someone else.\n\n-Semi-poor tutorial that still leaves a lot of content in the game unexplained.\n\n-Impossible to cancel connection, forcing host and other players to wait for someone to disconnect because someone crashed(or is lagging)\n\n-Doesn't display the latency of other players,.. At all.\n\n-The AI is very stupid and annoying, completely focused on rushing. First it goes with a weak bunch of infantry units straight to your HQ, then it keeps pounding you with tanks and slowly expands while you already probably took over 75% of the map. Keeps repeating assaults(sometimes organized ones though) until you completely demolish them with something strong, like 2 war colossi with a support vehicle, covered in shields.\n\n-The OST gets repetitive after a while, but you won't notice it much because you'll be focused on figuring out how to get rid of the rushing enemies most of the time.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, the "Air Fortress" thing isn't really a fortress, it's just 2 bulky-looking dropship-like bombers with lots of health. 10/10 would get disappointed again. If you want to see a real aerial fortress, play Supreme Commander|Forged Alliance with mods or Supreme Commander 2.\n\nSorry, I honestly can't recommend this game, it's only enjoyable while it's free to play or super cheap, as long as it doesn't support community mods.","July 19, 2015","false","28.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

Personally, I am a pretty big RTS fan and I am always looking for fun, new strategy games to spend a bit of my limited free time on.\n\nThe game is interesting in that it is easy to get into but offers a surprising amount of depth. The emphasis on direct unit counters and map control is appealing and presents different opportunities for both micro and macro strategy. Furthermore, resource management is very important and learning to make compromises between units, buildings, and turrets is important.\n\nAnother thing I would like to point out is the AI. Its kicked my butt quite a few times. I lost my first 4 skrimish games against a medium AI, and I didn't win until I conceded that I have more to learn and dropped to the easy difficulty. Its pretty good and there is certainly enough challenge for me.\n\nOverall, I find the game to be both fun and satisfying. I would definately recommend it, although I would caution to anyone who purchases, to be patient with a few bugs and optimization issues (which the developers are already working on).\n\nHere is a breakdown on my thoughts:\n\nGameplay: 7 / 10\nStrategy: 9 /10\nGraphics: 7 /10\nSound: 5 / 10\nFun: 9 /10\nChallenege: 8/ 10\nReplayability: 7/10\n\n\n","March 25, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

I can even replicate them at will.  Steam really lowered the bar on aplha.... WHAT? IT'S BEEN FULLY OUT SINCE MARCH?  I guess they decided to skip all the testing and QA phases.\n\nRead below or pretty much any of the other reviews that aren't obvious shills and you'll see.  With bugs like these this game should be considered a Beta right now at best, and it doesn't look like the dev's are still working on it.\n\nSTEAM, PLEASE PULL THIS GAME UNTIL IT IS NOT BROKEN.\n\nWhen the game works, it plays a lot like Empire At War and has command weapons ala Red Alert 3.  The bots are smart and the board-game style galaxy conquest, although not unique, adds some replayability.\n\nThere is no actual campaign other than the galactic conquest.\n\nMultiplayer has no public matches option (either that or shows no matches by default and you can't search for "").\n\nIf the game worked and had real multiplayer and a campaign it could be a really polished title.  However, even getting passed the crashes, the game is a mess.  Here's a few reasons why:\n\n- AI goes from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to genius between Easy and Medium.\n\n- Badly designed load screens (press to continue after match loads will press itself after a few seconds)\n\n- Unbalanced species\n\n- Bulky and poorly laid out UI (keyboard shortcuts suck by default too)\n\n- Important messages disappear quickly and/or get replaced by useless information (like letting you know your division is under attack during this firefight that's been going on for the last 5 minutes rather than the volcano is about to erupt)\n\n- No save game option during matches (so, when it crashes at the end of a match, which it will, you have to start that part of the conquest over again)\n\nOverall there isn't really anything unique about the gameplay itself.  Between command and conquer, starcraft, empire at war and supreme commander, it's all been done before and better.  The only originality I see is in the galactic conquest - kind of like the EAW version only with trading cards and no space battles.  If you see me playing this in the next 3 days (free), it's because I want to finish ONE conquest before I uninstall it forever (right now certain territories crash after I beat them so it's a mini-game in itself.)\n\nDO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS. - INSTALL FOR THE FREE WEEK ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BE FRUSTRATED","July 15, 2015","false","16.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

You start out in space, build your space fleet in your home planet, and you invade planets with it, sending down invasion forces down on planets. Your fleets can battle other fleets in space, and your on-planet base can be upgraded to be able to attack the enemy fleet in space.\n\nThere are two paths to victory: Either destroy the enemy on-planet (their main base) or send their fleet packing, abandoning its forces on-planet.\n\n\nGraphics are not too heavy. Should run well on most PCs. Music and SFX are eh.\n\nI suppose it is fine.

It looks very nice, sounds alright too, but feels rather dry.

Things you can do in the campaign do not work in the tutorials. There are some really bad things, like you can not save during the enemies turn (space turn based section) and the game tends to crash after you play the Real Time Strategy fights. These fights can last up to 30 minutes easily per fight. With multiple enemies attacking one or multiple worlds, means you can spend hours defending territories after you use your turn for whatever you want. At any given point the game can crash and you have to undergo the entire enemy turn again. So even if you have defeated 3 invasions and are working on your fourth, you win it and just as you are supposed to return to the turn based space view, it crashes and you are back to the start of the enemy turn and have to repeat all the fights. Really makes it unplayable. Other than the obvious problems of this games programming, there are other options which are clearly lacking.\n\nMany of the standard options you would come across in games these days like easy to control rally points or grab all military units commands are not readily available. It leaves a lot to be desired and that is good in a beta but not in a completed and packaged product. A lot of the concepts are well thought up and fleshed out but don't really make for a very entertaining section. Maps having lava cut off ALL avenues of attack for minutes at a time or weather features that randomly will take out your army and leave the enemy completely unscathed. Most of the options are pretty useless and smaller maps are really just a fast build up.\n\nThe speed of the game is a bit slow but that is really personal preference. Most of the options are just not worth it.","November 30, 2015","false","11.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I decided to give t a go anyway, something that I did regret in the end. The game doesn't run very smoothly and I am experiencing quite a bit of lag. In addition to that, there is (at least in my game) a thick layer of fog which I find uneccesary because all it does is limit your vision over the map to a level where the game because nearly unplayable. With these two things combined, it is impossible to play the game properly since the ai has a huge advantage because of this. The combat overal is very rock-paper-scissors like: Each unit has an obvious counter unit, which can be interesting when there are loads of classes, but this game has three main classes. I also find it dissapointing that there are no space battles implemented. When you attack a fleet, it's just dice roll mechanics.\nWith all this said, I think I would reccommend the game if it's on sale and you want to play some RTS every now and then, but if you are an RTS fan and you want an awesome in deth sci-fi RTS experience, stay far away from this game.","January 16","false","5.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Clever ideas and ways to introduce people to the RTS genre without bogging them down in tactics and mindgames ultimately mean nothing without a community to stand on, and it seems that Etherium's playerbase has all but vanished. Though it may sacrifice some tactical depth for the sake of making the game more accessible, other changes to a tried-and-tested formula are far less defensible. Hopefully Tindalos has learned that relying solely on multiplayer doesn't always work, particularly when you sacrifice other content for it.","June 5, 2015","false","4.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","2"

Expansion is important in the game if you want to have an edge over your opponent. Your units spawn via dropships which I most definitely like, as they are transported down from the fleet itself and do take some time to be transferred to the battle zone... reminds me of the game "Ground Control". This also goes for reinforcing your divisions of units when they are in need of re-instatement.\n\nThe resource system is pretty basic: send your communications infantry to the (suspiciously Necron) monoliths and build up a couple of colonies or outposts and start harvesting that Etherium to be sent up to the fleet.\n\nGraphics are OK... don't really have a fuss about them.\n\nHowever, Etherium looks like it is specifically made for online play and doesn't focus so much into the single-player campaign, which I presume is "Conquest". Three factions to pick from in Etherium, all have their pros and cons... utterly futile if you get hit by the early-game tank "zerg rush" which I kind of figured out the hard way. Adaptations in certain scenarios are usually complex when under the stress of being over-run early game but most of the time you'll be able to recover quickly as resource income can be given quickly.\n\n7.5/10. Shows potential but Etherium just feels a bit out-of-reach with some of the controls and the HUD system. Gameplay can be slow to build up, but it looks worthwhile in mid and late game when in a match. Looks a bit unstable due to minimal crashing on some matches. However, I find it useless to be given tech centres when there is literally nothing you can do with them early on in conquest mode... so it's just a waste of funds until you actually get tech upgrades.","April 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That aside, the game still remains buggy, crashing for me after each mission. So minus major points there.\n\nGraphics-wise, I'd be impressed if this was the early 2000s, but I wouldn't complain so much. Graphics in games, well, the units in the game collectively act as a squadron, which means each unit has to be animated, and controlled, while reinforcements do come in to replenish fallen squadmates.That mechanic, quickly gets boring and, since reinforcing fallen squadmates don't take resources, it's easy to defend, tough to attack.\n\nSo what's it like? Well, Etherium is kinda like leading campaigns on a world map (galaxy map), targetting specific planets to gain territory. Unfortunately, I've only played less than 2 hours, and I fail to see the appeal here, as more planets should automatically mean more resources to bring to war but to avoid unbalanced the developer didn't put too much into it. Once you've selected a territory to attack, it enters this real-time strategy mode, where its the basic gather resources and pump units and attack. However, the battlemap is divided into areas where you control via building outposts, sort of like the WarCraft III ziggurats of the Undead, where you just expand your territory, while the enemy expands his.\n\nOn the early onset, there's some early skirmishes, where the faster units start harassing certain locations of base. However, after a while, it drags on into this sort of trench warfare with the AI, which sends units forth, your defense leave them running, and they go back to their outpost which heals and reinforces the squads, and rinse, dry and repeat.\n\nVictory comes either by quickly overruning the opponent and sapping his resources in the early game, pulling out a technologically superior unit or taking control of one of the various neutral spawns on the map. I find myself overrunning the opponent with a mix of heavy tanks, and long range mortars.\n\nHowever, because of the "tech tree"is in the larger world map, instead of the ingame battle map, you gotta choose which tech tree to upgrade in your war against the opponent. Fine, this means that if you got rocket infantry, while the opponent chooses to upgrade only his air units, you got him beat and overrun, and it would take many turns before he will have sufficient tech points to muster a counter. This would make for some painful games.\n\nLearning curve is steep, the game has too many mechanics to overcompensate for its lack of tactical debt, and one of my biggest annoyance is the unit voices.

Expansion is important in the game if you want to have an edge over your opponent. Your units spawn via dropships which I most definitely like, as they are transported down from the fleet itself and do take some time to be transferred to the battle zone... reminds me of the game "Ground Control". This also goes for reinforcing your divisions of units when they are in need of re-instatement.\n\nThe resource system is pretty basic: send your communications infantry to the (suspiciously Necron) monoliths and build up a couple of colonies or outposts and start harvesting that Etherium to be sent up to the fleet.\n\nGraphics are OK... don't really have a fuss about them.\n\nHowever, Etherium looks like it is specifically made for online play and doesn't focus so much into the single-player campaign, which I presume is "Conquest". Three factions to pick from in Etherium, all have their pros and cons... utterly futile if you get hit by the early-game tank "zerg rush" which I kind of figured out the hard way. Adaptations in certain scenarios are usually complex when under the stress of being over-run early game but most of the time you'll be able to recover quickly as resource income can be given quickly.\n\n7.5/10. Shows potential but Etherium just feels a bit out-of-reach with some of the controls and the HUD system. Gameplay can be slow to build up, but it looks worthwhile in mid and late game when in a match. Looks a bit unstable due to minimal crashing on some matches. However, I find it useless to be given tech centres when there is literally nothing you can do with them early on in conquest mode... so it's just a waste of funds until you actually get tech upgrades.","April 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Most matches take anywhere from 20-60 minutes to beat and if you're playing "conquest", expect to be at it for a while...not because the map is large (it's in fact only a few planets with 3 locations on each), but because the AI attacks the same spots/locations over and over again.  This can get very tedious, especially when there's no auto-resolve button.  Like Grey Goo, I was disappointed with the skirmish options (1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2) and honestly miss the Warcraft II days where I could do an 8 player FFA.  Everything else is fairly interestering, taking ques from both Star Wars Empire At War and Company of Heroes.

Whoever did the graphics for this faction needs to SERIOUSLY take a moment to reflect on their overall level of effort. Quality wise, it's Vectides>>>>>Consortium>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Intar\n- No articulated parts on tanks and many other vehicles, i.e., tracks that don't move, units that literally glide over the terrain = painful to watch.\n- Units do not emit any type of munitions, for example a multiple rocket launcher - never truly fires a rocket, everything is supposed, no rockets ever leave the tube.\n- Maps, horrible looking, think red, red, red - everything, the one world where it's supposed to look somewhat similar to earth, more red. Everything is flat, meaning there are minimal shards of vegetation, you'll see things that look like grass, though they are lifeless, as are the planets themselves. They have a low resolution cell-shaded appearance.\n- Sound has static throughout at random times.\n- No way currently to offset teams, 2 vs 1 etc. everything has to be equal.\n- No save game function in skirmish mode.\n- No advanced movements, formations etc.\n- Units will not engage often unless directly forced to, your base can be under assault and your units unless they are directly in the enemies line of sight will not engage.\n\nThat said, I really like this game a lot, would love to see a fourth faction via DLC and some more maps offered.","April 18, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Although, in the game, I have noticed that the developers have not fixed the crashing problem and limmited the ammount of units you can have on the battle field, along with other limmitations. It is an excellent game, but the game no longer has anyone playing it any more. It would be better if more people would battle/play on multiplayer.

The outpost system, limiting units, limiting structures and a dumbed down way to upgrade your tech level (ways to unlock more powerful units/turrets) just dont mesh well here. Add to it the minor factions that may or may not be on your map, and its a game that tries too much, and fails.\n\nWith limited access to units, you are left with either expanding rapidly, or build turrets to attempt to slowly turtle forward to new outposts. However both methods have major disadvantages.\n\n-Expanding rapidly leads to issues with making the ideal unit comp. With so few units possible to command at one time, you either have to guess at what you will be fighting or move forward with a very generalised comp.\n\n-Crawling foward has the issue of being low on resorces. Since you need to expand to increase income, slowly moving forward leads to being potentially left behind in tech level and unit production. That is an issue because of the limit on turrets per outpost (territory under you control). With only three turrets to defend with, you must (again) guess at what is going to be thrown at you, or generalise.\n\nUltimatly, the game has interesting ideas but is crippled by the extreemly limiting population caps. Going forth and hoping that your comp will be relivant when you enter combat is never fun. Add to it the limited locations that you can call units from (you CAN get them to your front line faster, but that has major drawbacks depending on where the front line is), and sending in your few precious units to get instantly destroyed can become extreemly costly.","July 14, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tech tree is short and to the point and unit variety consists of basic infanty, heavy infantry, scouts, light tanks, heavy tanks, artillary and air to air and air to ground air craft.

The graphics are pretty and the games conquest mode is a mix between a Total War game and a Civilization game. The main gameplay is fun and involves capturing points on the map and upgrading those points with various 'plug-ins' that increase a player attributes, such as resource gather rate or unit capacity.\n\nHowever, the game lacks story except from a motion comic art style intro cinematic and a brief intro for each faction that is nothing more than a few scrolls of narrated text and still artwork at the start of each conquest(even though the art is pretty!). This leaves the player very little context to whats going. The music is amazing!

If I can't play through a tutorial before it smokes itself, then I can't be bothered to play it with more than a hundred games in my Steam Library. #PCMasterRace\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous. The scaling in and out is perfect and works well with the resolutions, and I picked a medium-sized 2058x1128 or something with Maximum-everything. #LoveMyR9290X\n\nThe gameplay is a bit clunky and slow-paced, from what I managed in the tutorial after it ends and allows you to finish the level out. Building troops is meh and there's little instruction in the tutorial on the slots per command post (some have 1 and some have 3), however its your call once you discover that a slot can be filled with tech, repair, more troops, etc ... but these aren't covered in the tutorial.\n\nThe vagueness of the tutorial is also irritating. There's no indication that once air transport has lifted comms troops, and you move them, of how to drop them. So you're looking all over the map, re-reading the directions of what to do next and eventually you'll find the drop-circle over the air transport. Seems obvious, but there's 1000000000 buttons on the HUD for every little thing and you're clueless as to what everything does in the beginning.\n\nSuggestion: Grey them out for the Tutorial until they're usable. A bit overwhelming.\n\nAnd in the end, I got Raiders to join me, picked up some little rocket buggies, orbital struck the enemy base for ... 0 damage, pretty much, like the tanks, a bit depressing when it comes to tactical firepower and then you just overwhelm the base with like 30 troops and the game crashes.\n\n</the end>\n\nMy windows manager showed that the game was taking something like 2M K of memory at the time of crash (on 8 cores with 16 GB of RAM isn't much, but I digress) and tried to freeze up my system.\n\nNot sure why. Nothing is out of date. No explanations. And in reading the forums or community board, only morons claiming that "your PC is a potato" is the answer for crashes and you have bad drivers. To him I say, "Blow me, trollfays. Your nubile PC is no match or comparison for my Kingslayer. Uninstall." ... or something nerdy like that.\n\n\nStick to old C&C if you need your RTS-cravings satiated.","July 17, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","2"

Expansion is important in the game if you want to have an edge over your opponent. Your units spawn via dropships which I most definitely like, as they are transported down from the fleet itself and do take some time to be transferred to the battle zone... reminds me of the game "Ground Control". This also goes for reinforcing your divisions of units when they are in need of re-instatement.\n\nThe resource system is pretty basic: send your communications infantry to the (suspiciously Necron) monoliths and build up a couple of colonies or outposts and start harvesting that Etherium to be sent up to the fleet.\n\nGraphics are OK... don't really have a fuss about them.\n\nHowever, Etherium looks like it is specifically made for online play and doesn't focus so much into the single-player campaign, which I presume is "Conquest". Three factions to pick from in Etherium, all have their pros and cons... utterly futile if you get hit by the early-game tank "zerg rush" which I kind of figured out the hard way. Adaptations in certain scenarios are usually complex when under the stress of being over-run early game but most of the time you'll be able to recover quickly as resource income can be given quickly.\n\n7.5/10. Shows potential but Etherium just feels a bit out-of-reach with some of the controls and the HUD system. Gameplay can be slow to build up, but it looks worthwhile in mid and late game when in a match. Looks a bit unstable due to minimal crashing on some matches. However, I find it useless to be given tech centres when there is literally nothing you can do with them early on in conquest mode... so it's just a waste of funds until you actually get tech upgrades.","April 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So minus major points there.\n\nGraphics-wise, I'd be impressed if this was the early 2000s, but I wouldn't complain so much. Graphics in games, well, the units in the game collectively act as a squadron, which means each unit has to be animated, and controlled, while reinforcements do come in to replenish fallen squadmates.That mechanic, quickly gets boring and, since reinforcing fallen squadmates don't take resources, it's easy to defend, tough to attack.\n\nSo what's it like? Well, Etherium is kinda like leading campaigns on a world map (galaxy map), targetting specific planets to gain territory. Unfortunately, I've only played less than 2 hours, and I fail to see the appeal here, as more planets should automatically mean more resources to bring to war but to avoid unbalanced the developer didn't put too much into it. Once you've selected a territory to attack, it enters this real-time strategy mode, where its the basic gather resources and pump units and attack. However, the battlemap is divided into areas where you control via building outposts, sort of like the WarCraft III ziggurats of the Undead, where you just expand your territory, while the enemy expands his.\n\nOn the early onset, there's some early skirmishes, where the faster units start harassing certain locations of base. However, after a while, it drags on into this sort of trench warfare with the AI, which sends units forth, your defense leave them running, and they go back to their outpost which heals and reinforces the squads, and rinse, dry and repeat.\n\nVictory comes either by quickly overruning the opponent and sapping his resources in the early game, pulling out a technologically superior unit or taking control of one of the various neutral spawns on the map. I find myself overrunning the opponent with a mix of heavy tanks, and long range mortars.\n\nHowever, because of the "tech tree"is in the larger world map, instead of the ingame battle map, you gotta choose which tech tree to upgrade in your war against the opponent. Fine, this means that if you got rocket infantry, while the opponent chooses to upgrade only his air units, you got him beat and overrun, and it would take many turns before he will have sufficient tech points to muster a counter. This would make for some painful games.\n\nLearning curve is steep, the game has too many mechanics to overcompensate for its lack of tactical debt, and one of my biggest annoyance is the unit voices. Storyline is uninteresting, and only meh.\n\n4/10\n4/10 with rice.","July 14, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although, in the game, I have noticed that the developers have not fixed the crashing problem and limmited the ammount of units you can have on the battle field, along with other limmitations. It is an excellent game, but the game no longer has anyone playing it any more. It would be better if more people would battle/play on multiplayer. I see over 800 people in the game but none of them are in multiplayer!\n\nAlthough, the only thing that I suggest to the developers are these:\n\nIncrease the number of units you can have on the battle field, increase the numbers of turrets you can place in a territory, add more units, modify the building layout to allow the players to build where ever they would like (this would mean changing the entier way of how the game will be, such as location of colonies, ammount of colonies, and more), add a way to upgrade the main control center to a "Palace," add more structures such as walls, and a game play mode where the player/players can battle in space! :)\n\n","August 20, 2015","true","29.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

Instead of making one that players could really sink their teeth into, we are given conquest mode which is similar to what Planetary Annihilation and Star Wars: Empire at War use for their single player "campaigns".  For those that haven't played either or those games, you get an overview of a universe to play on (sounds good so far right?) but unfortunately rather than having unique maps with a story to go with them, you find yourself being plunged into skirmish after skirmish.  I assume that skirmishes don't have fleet actions (colonize/conquer, attack enemy fleet, and travel to a new planet being among them) but those really don't change much in my opinion.\n\nThat aside, the graphics are quite impressive to say the least.  The (seemingly) random nature events (such as volcanic eruptions and tornadoes) provide a pleasant challenge that is absent in far too many strategy games these days.  We all know how we have to fight and beat our enemy to win but when was the last time when you had to actually be aware of the very map you fought on?  I think there were one or two missions on StarCraft 2 that had something similar and Sins of a Solar Empire has random chances of things like solar flares but other than those?\n\nFinally let us look at the AI.  I for one can't believe it has taken as long as it has for a game to get AI right again.  All too often you have ai's that you either walk over or that have to resort to cheating (bonus resources, build speed, etc) in order to gain the advantage and even then once the game has dragged on long enough, even those boosts don't make enough of a difference.  I find that Easy mode in Etherium gives a good example of what the computer controlled enemy is capable of.  The use hit and run tactics, air lifts, they reinforce wounded squads, make use of terrain, they upgrade outposts.  The only things I haven't seen them do is try to earn the favor of the neutral teams found on the maps.\n\nAll in all, I would say Etherium gets a passing grade.  It may not be A++ worthy but I could understand giving it a 6.5/10 to 7/10 score.  I hope though that if the makers see this and are already thinking of making a prequel, sequel, or expansion pack, they will take the time to make a decent, in-depth campaign.  It doesn't need cinematics before, after, and during every mission like the Command & Conquer series gave us.  It doesn't even need to have communications feeds (intercepted or otherwise) like Supreme Commander 1 gave us.  But it should have a story that evolves with the game rather than just the little blotch of lore that we get about the faction we choose on Conquest mode.  Would I recommend this game to others?  That would depend.  If you are like me and you like to have a story integrated with the game, I would advise you to save your money for something better.  Put this on your wish list and maybe somebody else will buy it for you but don't spend your own money on it.  If however you aren't like me and you don't really care if the game has a story, if you are just looking for a good rts game to challenge you or to play with a friend, then this would be a good option.  There are better choices if there are more than just two of you but I believe this would still give those choices a run for their money.","March 26, 2015","false","29.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","9","19","3","0"

Then you probably have seen everything worth seeing in Etherium already. The biggest issue with RTS games nowadays (and other "dead genres" being "revived" lately) is that they try to get away with being just "good enough". There is nothing groundbreaking, nothing creative or inventive, no new game design ideas present here and, despite having its release pushed back multiple times, feels like instant bargain bin fodder during a genre drought.\n\nOutside of the mandatory multiplayer, you have a campaign with convoluted rules (with each side having their own secondary victory conditions) and a skirmish mode. The campaign is very frustrating because of simple oversights, like not being able to save during your opponent's turns and a star system UI that doesn't provide enough information. I spent easily almost two hours defending my territories during opponent's turns simply because quitting the game meant restarting the opponent's turn. This is of course on top of all the issues present in the actual gameplay...\n\n...of which there is little to mention. The main objective (and single game mode) is to either destroy the other player's main base or deplete their tickets by bombarding their mothership with turrets high in the tech tree. Regions of territory are strictly defined and can have only one base inside for adding upgrades onto. The problem with the territories having a fixed size is that smaller territories only allow smaller bases. This creates claustrophobic maps, with clearly defined chokepoints that force you down a corridor to your opponent's base. Most of my campaign victories were from converting the neutral factions on the map and attack-moving them into the enemy's main base.\n\nThe absolute bare minimum went into Etherium's factions and their unit design. Units for each race have creative names like Standard Infantry, Siege Vehicle, and Bomber. Races share all the same units (!) with each having only 4 unique units. This might be acceptable in a turn-based strategy game where you have 20+ factions or dozens of units, but here you only have about 6 different units for each unit type. Each race also shares 3 of their 6 faction skills, similar to Dawn of War's faction ability system. Everything about the races just feels very cut-and-pasted and bland and makes me wonder why this game's release was pushed back multiple times.\n\nI am ashamed to have fallen for the hype for this game. If you are thirsty for a good (or great or amazing, whatever) RTS, then revisit an old one instead of wasting money on this. This game couldn't be any blander or generic if it tried. If a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter could eventually type out the complete works of William Shakespeare, then this game is proof that they can code a video game too.","April 25, 2015","false","11.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raven800/recommended/245370/","Raven800","Raven800","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raven800/","642 products in account","as gameplay goes, I can best describe this as "RTS for Newbies" as it takes a semi streamlined style of RTS base building akin to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War 2. Not an amazing game, but it was easy enough for me to pick up and play. Though I must say it does feel a bit incomplete at times and the tutorial leaves much to be desired and the HUD is a bit chaotic and hard to follow. Once you get into it though it gets a little better, but it still leaves much to be desired.\n\nDo I recommend this game? yeah i think it's worth a play if you like Dawn of War 2 and COH. The gameplay might get old rather quickly, but I still stand by what i say. It's fun to kill time with. You have 3 factions each with their own special units and their own special off-map abilities with different types of economies and population growth. For example one factoin starts off with 4 "Division" (unit) slots and a special unit that specializes in tactical espianage while another faction starts off with 3 "Division" slots, requires a research level 3 to access their Special Elite units but in the mean time has an off-map support that allows a player to rabidly promote basic units to higher, more effective levels so as to outclass enemies in the battlefield. The three factions are easy to learn but difficult to master and and you can choose 1 of 4 different maps from up to 6 different environments, each with their own unique environmental hazards that can make or break unit deployments. during key points in your skirmish.\n\nSo yeah, I can recommend this game for the price that it is now ($20.00). It's not the best RTS I've ever played but it's more certainly not the worst. Some good effort was put into making this game and it shows.","October 10, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Zero movement in rankings. Good game, bad marketing, ugly reviews. It's like everyone in modern world has the right to vote: kids at their 18-teens, housewives who produce nothing; former prisoners and just arrived imigrants. For most people RTS is just like Windows solitaire: they're are playing on scripted maps to achieve 1 single result set by designer(s). They don't know what competitivness is, but they do write reviews. Anyway, if you wanted to play a game with complex build-orders like SupCom (not degenerative ones, like in CoH2) and much more than 5-phases-escalated gameplay(it's very very parallel), then your chance is lost (but wait, you could always play with me and some of my friends, if you don't mind, because community is dead too).\n\nAnd if it's proper for me to advise, don't buy Grey Goo instead of this. It's primitive. Felt like 2003-'s. Not bad, but worse than warcraft3, generals, AOM, any successfull title of the past. And yes, it was made by Petroglyph, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, who was kicked off after Emperor:BFD has failed, (was a good game, actually) and the greatest game of C&C serie was made without them. They made that Universe at war instead which I still want to refund.\n\n***\n\nIt looks like the game designed not in a way that favours the most. Well, units aren't individually voiced and graphics could bear some amount of detail ) But game do have it's rich side, it's internal design - mechanics. Conventions is complex and at the same time wouldn't terrorize you with extensive detail.\nCan't say a word about the singleplayer, but may bring you a tale from the past: C&C3 1.03, crashing on start, F-U most of the WinXP users\n- So, where is everybody now?\n- Playing campaign.\nIf you think this game is not good enough for it's money, think again: there was that Planetary Anihilation thing, and someone pay for NO current orbital bombarment and NO current planets collision, like, 49,99£ or 49-99$ (personally took it on the zommer sale for ~ 29zi). And somehow, PA by now got Postive user reviews, while Ethrium is currently Mixed... At the very least, you'll get complete game with no dropped features, balanced and stable.\nConsidering bugs. The only one I had was when the game randomly redefined my control keys(pretty strange and was only once). And yes, there is a good connection on the multiplayer, and, looks like, no lag-compression(or it's tuned just fine; anyway, no missing orders here).\n\nGood-made RTS. Took what is needed from the genre and expanded it with it's own content. Not a revolution, of course, but may be a good start for a new serie.\nIf you are fan of RTS, getting bored of your current rank, or just in search of smt adequately new, this game is for you.","July 26, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a Realy fun gamemode!\n\nIf i had to rate this game i'd rate it a 100 out of 10!","May 6","true","46.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the maps feature big fixed obstacles which forces you into a very specific mode of play, attack here - defend here kind of thing.  Which is frustrating when coupled with the early limitations on unit sizes and tech trees.\n\nSpace combat - yeah six planets.  You can dart between locations and point and click at an enemy fleet or the ground.  No actual graphic intense combat scenes ensue.\n\nA lot of the intro videos allude to much more in the game, but sadly there isnt.  The developers have made a very good AI and if you do play the campaign you'll find the only way to successfully hold your own is to mercifully squeeze every resource and exploit possible.\n\nIt is what it is, but its not what they selling it as through their videos.  Can't compare this with Planetary Annihilation or Empire at War, if thats what you want - buy Grey Goo at twice the price.  Because this is not comparable.\n\nAlso: not being able to exit to desktop from any level in the game.. ?

It is mainly a little title, because for the price asked, 29.99$ on launch, it simply doesn’t pack enough content to be worth the hassle. Outdated graphics, lazily-created assets and the lack of innovation bring this title down to the rank of a mere husk of what similar titles in a similar price range can offer. Etherium does actually sport some innovative concepts, such as differentiating between macro management of a full-scale interplanetary invasion with some table-top gaming features and singular battles or dynamic weather changes across the maps which require players to adapt in order to survive, but these are executed so blatantly that any sign of innovation gets lost in a sea of repetitiveness, and in the general lack of originality this title seems to ooze. Were players able to look past the lack of lore, the unoriginal factions and gameplay, they would be stuck with a brain-dead AI, which will do stupid things such as walking their units straight into an orbital bombardment or a volcanic eruption, randomly stop playing by simply amassing resources without creating any units or, especially on Easy difficulty, stubbornly try to do the same thing over and over again expecting things to change, while retaining the ability to become a great challenge if set to the hardest difficulty possible. All of this makes Etherium, in its current state, a game that should not be bought. If looking for an RTS experience, players would be better off buying similar but more fleshed out titles or, in any case, direct their attention elsewhere.\n\nRead the full review here: http://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/etherium/","March 25, 2015","false","9.5"," 40 of 87 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","40","87","5","5"

I prefer deeper and slower games like Supreme Commander and Wargame, so I don't recommend getting this.\n\nNote to TA/SupCom fans: I bought Etherium because of that one review claiming it is similar to Supreme Commander. I was dissapointed.","March 27, 2015","false","2.2"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","10","25","3","1"

When you start getting to the point they have two or even three fleets in orbit of one of your worlds and each fleet can attack twice thats a LOT of battles to fight without an auto-resolve and since most battles take 30-40 minutes for me...

If you can get it for 5$ like I did via the Steam sale, and are craving an RTS game to just jump into and mess around with, then go for it.\n\nHowever, if you're expecting any depth from this game, you won't find it in Etherium.  It's a game of many missed opportunities, and for me I wonder why they missed them at all when the game itself is so bland and simple.\n\n- No space battles, which could have easily made way for some nice variation in the Dawn of War: Soulstorm style Conquest mode, or even made for an interesting co-op mode/campaign where you have one player fighting on the ground for resources and the other fighting in space putting pressure on the fleet to disrupt reinforcements.\n\n- No real campaign/story mode to really acquaint you with the races aside from the faction introductions, I would have loved for some sort of story driven campaign to really integrate you with your faction of choice, as well as the other factions should you so choose, and give you a better scope of what the game's central premise is about in full.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty fun, I enjoy the battles and the way everything develops with the amount of unit variation/entrenching of postions, but the lack of faction uniqueness as far as unit rosters were concerned kind of took away from that for me.\n\nI can only hope they decide to add story driven campaigns and space battles in future DLC content, assuming they even have plans to do this, but if not that's pretty unfortunate as this game definitely has the potential of being so much more.","September 6, 2015","false","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the beginning of the game, I've felt some lack of units. There is only 4 units to choose from and even upgrading the tech level, other units are blocked. I've felt that it is quite simple too. The upgrades are made with a simple logic of building tech centers and done. There are no unit upgrade.\n\nI didn't like the IA, thought. If some random unit comes close your territory and you have 10 units, but only one have the enemy unit on their line of fire, only this unit will attack. So, it's really weird to see 9 units watching 1 unit fighting alone and dying.\n\nI'm old RTS fan and I do enjoy low-paced games, but I need some time to enjoy it, to play it.

You capture zones and use them to house certain extensions that can bring down troops, repair them, or even make your legendary units more powerful.\n-command points: use these to call down orbital barrages, spy on the enemy, or even make your units more powerful.\n-Squad-based "divisions": The units are organized into divisions which are grouped together in groups of either 10, 5, 2, or 1. These divisions can level up Halo Wars style and even become legendary, which gives a massive increase to accuracy, dodge, and health.\n-Colossi: Colossi are massive walkers capable of levelling entire bases or armies. They are the super-weapons of this game, and are certainly cool.\n-Multiple ways to win: you can win by destroying the enemy's base or their fleet with orbital cannons.\n-Fleet gameplay: A fun, fleshed out experience in conquest mode.\n-Secondary factions: Sway these powerful factions into your favor and you may just get some sweet allies.\n\nCons\n\n-Multiplayer: The userbase is rather small, and therefore, the multiplayer is usually hard to find matches on.\n-Crashes: This game sometimes crashes after certain battles, and you may have to replay them.\n-the different factions are rather ssimilar\nTL;DR\n\nThis game is fun and rather well made. It has some refreshing ideas, but the multiplayer and crashes are definitely disheartening. This game is a very fun game.

In highest settings it performed pretty well though but i gave up on it after losing ingame progress several times attempting to actually play the game and i rarely give up on technical difficulties, until i could fix them on my own but i couldn't.\n\nIf i had bought it, i probably had asked for a refund, since the last update was 2 months ago, it's safe to say they are done with it development-wise and not seeing a single dev in the forums for the whole week, knowing they may get a decent income of new players and possible customers, was a big letdown for me, it shows there is no official support for the game whatsoever.\n\nI had a bad experience with it, i can't recommend buying the game because it has serious crash issues and may or may not work on your current system configuration and the issues may never get patched out in the future.","July 17, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didn't go over the basics of what is on the screen like what do these various icons do? All it did was list a few things I could do and how to do those things. Thumbs down on the manual and tutorial.\n\nI also didn't see an obvious way to pause the game to be able to see what was going on without pushing the 'esc' button and that put me to a different menu.\n\nI couldn't get into the game. It had more of an arcade feel than a strategy feel though it certainly had strategy elements. Maybe if there was a good manual, a good tutorial and an obvious pause button (I may have missed it), I might have been more interested in going further.  It was a target of opportunity on a Steam free play period.\n\nIt also had the feel of a small unit tactic game, rather than a strategic game.\n\nThe game maybe fine for people who are more interested in the genre than me. I wish there was a neutral rating so I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and go with a thumbs up particularly with the note below.\n\nOn the plus side the game could run on a machine with a smaller video card than that listed under requirements.  It said it needed a 1024mb card when I have a 256mb card. The tutorial ran fine.  I didn't bother getting beyond that though I don't see any reason why smaller scenarios wouldn't run OK as well.","July 14, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This RTS will NOT be one of my favorites. The problems with this game are far from few. The game struggles with an easy HUD interface. Next, the games controls overall are poorly mapped as well. The game is far too challenging for entry level players and is NOT balanced what so ever. The texturing isn't half bad and neither are the audio samples and in game sounds. However, this doesn't aquate to a meal of commands that has been vomitted by some coder. Now, I am not a coder myelf. However, I do understand that user interfaces are USER interfaces and should be USER friendly. This game is far from that. With few units and a far too simple resource system, and an overcomplicated section control "system", and a standard tri-team pick it yourself, and with... and so on and so on.

Further, you have so few units at any one time that the levels feel empty.\n\nThere is no single player campaign, it's only a narrative free (save for the intro) battling across several worlds.  Each faction feels almost the same and the AI plays them similarly.\n\nAn interesting / different take on area control than similar base building RTSes but feels like it borrows on a mechanic long since superceded in qualtiy.  If you're interested in seeing another method that could be used for RTS, take a look, but fun it is not.","June 5","false","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said,\nfirst the CONs:\n- no story, just a bunch of skirmish maps\n- stupid campaign AI (just read the comments below)\n- game crashes, frequently\n- races are realy the same, remindes me of WarCraft 1, just subtle differences.\n- absolute repetative gameplay\n\nPROs:\n- nice graphics, if you can live with jagged edges (yes, like games in the 90s)\n- great sounds\n- nice maps, some environment effects\n","June 5","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
