Here is a serious review for a change.\n\nFirst of i wanted to say that now i have only done Rise's route and it was amazing. (Will update once i've done more) (Have finished it but I'm to lazy to update, If you got any questions feel free to add me and ask or just comment below)\n\nSo where to begin... Well this game is a Visual Novel that has humor, drama, love, and some serious stuff aswell.\n\nThe jokes in this game are fantastic they made me laugh out loud and brightend my mood from the serious matters. Beatiful art AND soundtrack. This game also has voice acting, and not just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting. It is really good. It took me 18hours to complete Rise's route and that is good time for a route imo (i consider myself a fast reader so it might take longer.) I dont really know what more i should say it's really good, in 2days i played it for 18hours (amazing? nah i should just get a life.) The length of this game is quite impressive as stated before and that to me alongside everything it is worth the price, dont let the price tag scare you. The only negative thing i can think of is there aren't many choices but they aren't really needed just feels kinda weird is all.\n\nAand if you are 18+ and want a copy of the 18+ version you can buy it from here (you also get a steam key for the game) http://www.mangagamer.com/detail.php?goods_type=1&product_code=117 (NSFW, NUDITY ON THIS PAGE)","March 29, 2015","true","46.8"," 196 of 217 people (90%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","90","196","217","19","12"

It’s based around the protagonist, Masaya, being accepted into a school of all girls, as a test for possible gender integration. It made it fun to read and enjoyable from start to finish.\n\nThe storyThe story itself, including individual routes as well as the common, was well written. It flowed nicely, It's a pretty lengthy story, and it felt worth the price.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsThe audio and visual elements were great, It sets the mood and feel like it belongs in the situation and the environment, especially the heroine themes. The backgrounds and CGs were beautiful and detailed.\n\nThere  full Japanease audio for all of the girls, and side characters combined with a well fitting soundtrack. The game also tends to use alot of French words for naming stuff, but there is the option to click on them and get a detailed explanation for the meaning.\n\nRoutes and PathingAs for the routes/heroines, they all felt different from each other. They all had their individual quirks that made them stand out and likeable. Their routes all had happy moments and depressing moments. It’s hard not to get invested in a character emotionally when they have so much detail put into them.\n\n\nTo sum upPrincess Evangile is well worth the money. The characters are likable to keep you interested in the game and wanting to finish their routes, the story is silly to grab people's attention fast, and the H-Scenes are well tied to the story and didn't feel out of place.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","October 12, 2015","true","241.7"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","56","60","0","1"

I thought this would be another "One Bloke, Fifty Ladies, Massive Orgy" game, but it actually wasn't.\nIf anything, it's actually trying to get them to like you that's difficult, mostly because your character is some ♥♥♥♥-faced ♥♥♥♥in' never-spoken-to-women-before ♥♥♥♥ that likes to be borderline socially handicapped when it comes to women.\nWhich is funny, because he somehow ends up getting into some all-girls Christian school in China. Wait, is it Japan? No idea. Whatever.\nAnyway, when he goes in, to my horror I discovered that the entire facility was filled with nothing but Extreme Feminist Students and a Headteacher / Camp Kommandant that hates everything with a ♥♥♥♥♥.

The answer to that is subjective of course, but I generally say that a game is worth it if I get 1 hour per dollar. I know that's a bit of a cop out answer, so here's my actual review\n\nIs the game good?\nYes\nIs the game great?\nDebatable, visual novels are somewhat different from most games in that the order you do the routes in them actually does have a significant impact on your experience. I did Ayaka's route first which made the other routes suck by comparison.\n\nThe game has a good sense of humour, and made me really laugh, like laughing hard enough for my head to touch my desk funny. That humour is one of the selling points. This is a feel-good VN, there are some darker parts to it, but for the most part it's supposed to make you smile.\n\nThat is an issue in some respects though, the game was enjoyable and entertaining. It was not however terribly touching (except one part of Ayaka's route brought tears to my eyes... her route is the best by far). Of the four romances:\n\nOne was cheesy (Ritsuko's was too ridiculous to ever take seriously)\nOne was pure vanilla extract (Rise's route... of course hers was also the funniest because they openly made fun of how over-the top vanilla it was. The drama felt a little forced though, and the romance overall felt unrealistic.)\n\nOne was good (Chiho's route was fairly standard, but had an actually realistic romance progression, [ it took two ♥♥♥♥ing months after declaring undying love for eachother in Rise and Ritsuko's routes for the first kiss] and was fairly exciting)\n\nOne was very good (Ayaka's route had stellar character development, she seems like an interesting character and winds up being interesting in ways completely different from your expectations. All development is explained logically and I felt this was the most realistic route due to the interal conflict and difficulty they had expressing their feelings... I mean come on, it's not easy to ask someone out, let alone confess your love to them before the first date).\n\nDo I regret buying it, since 2 routes weren't my cup of tea?\nNo. Rise's wasn't bad per-se, it just wasn't to my taste, some people will like it, and some people even liked Ritsuko's route, in this kind of game, there will always be some contention when ranking routes and saying what was subjectively better. The forums do seem to agree that Ayaka's route is the best though, and it is.\n\nRitsuko's route was kinda like Mega Pirhana, one of those cheap ♥♥♥ Sci-Fi channel movies that are just hilariously bad. I couldn't really tell if the dev's were taking it seriously or not, but I wound up laughing during the climax (of the plot... the game is censored, but they did a really good job of it so I'm not complaining) which makes it a failure in my book.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I got my money's worth, and would buy the fandisc if it came to Steam (assuming it was at or under $15)\n\nAs I mentioned before, order matters, I would reccomend Chiho's route first, then Rise/Ritsuko and end with Ayaka for maximal enjoyment.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7.5 / 10\nWorth playing, but not the best thing since sliced bread.","April 22, 2015","true","41.6"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","36","40","3","0"

Recommended.\n\nPrincess Evangile is primarily a dating simulator, this can be quite boring if it's not what you're looking for. In terms of a visual novel the story is amazing, each route will throw you into a violent rollercoaster of emotions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't cry at each one, both for happiness and despair. The music is wonderful and the whole story is good. Each route is different yet so gripping you won't want to stop.\n\nThe stories are evil, they will twist your heart in ways you've never known before.\nRitsuko-chan for best waifu.\n\nVery recommended.

My only complaint is that I did not realize for $10 more I could see boobies and get a steam key for the cards as well.\n\nEdit (finish Ritsuko Route): Even without the adult version this is very good. Takes ~45 hours from start to finish running on auto. I went with the Ritsuko route and it was very good and well worth the money. *must avoid manly tears over Ritsuko's love*.

For two months this place has been like a second home, filling my nights and weekends with the joys and sorrows of youth.  After the toughest and longest days and weeks at work it was always there waiting for me, never asking too much but providing so much in return.  We have been through so much together.  Knowing this is the end, that there is no more, is really sad.\n\nI bought the 18+ version on mangagamer.  None of the 18+ scenes really alter the story at all, so the steam version should be just as fine without them.  The story is linear with four main paths, but at 26 chapters it is quite lengthy.  I am a little disappointed that you cannot date the cutest girl in the game (Mitsuki), but there's a lot of variety to the story in the paths that are there.  In my dreams, there is a special edition of the game that opens up more paths, but since that won't become a reality I can just hope the alleged sequel gets localized as well.

That experience has changed my life forever..."\n\nIn all seriousness, the game isn't too bad with the pervy scenes. Think Hayate no Gotoku taking place at an all-girls school (even though Hayate is pretty much the only guy in that series anyway). I have both versions of the game, so I don't have much playtime on the Steam version (all ages), but I have played through one of the routes already (18+).\n\nThe game is good at getting you involved in the story, but this is certainly not a game which you play for H-scenes. That isn't to say that the artwork isn't good; it's actually quite amazing. But know that you are meant to get into the game for it's story, so don't buy it if you only want something ecchi.\n\nI'd say the game is about 40 hours long, so it is a lot of reading. In the route I did, the first and last H-scenes were written into the story (as in, they were actually kind of crucial for the story/character development). I actually feel like the other H-scenes kind of ruined the flow. I believe this is a game in which the All Ages Version could be just as enjoyable as the 18+ one, but I would have to play through it to know for sure. It actually may lack the character development the first H-scene allowed.\n\nThere are 4 heroines total, so it's possible you won't find any of the "routes" attractive to you, but if the game sells well, then Mangagamer might localize the fandisk which has a bunch of the side characters available in it. Also, there aren't many choices in the game, and it's obvious what to choose when you get to each.\n\nGo check out Lost Pause on youtube if you're still debating it.\n\ntl;dr:\nPros:\n-Great Artwork\n-Good Story (at least for one route)\n-Can be quite funny\n-Panterbell is awesome\n\nDebateable:\n-Game builds itself as a harem, no harem route\n-No Panterbell route\n-Player choices are scarce, so the story is largely the same until you go down specific character routes, which is a long way into the game.\n-Many religious themes or references; I felt as though they were in good taste, but some people might find it blasphemous\n\nCons:\n-Only four routes\n-I want the fandisk now, but have to wait\n\nRitsuko is best girl!","May 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","12","13","4","2"

I have mixed feeling about this game. How many of my visual novels reviews started this way? Way to many, probably. Still, before angry mob of men (and possibly women) that absolutely adores this game gets me, let me explain a few things. First of all, as you can see, it's still a good review. Why? Well... Because there isn't neutral option. But in all honesty I must admit that it's one of better made visual novels on Steam. Second of all, I'm surely not the target audience for this one. I'm a woman and I'm not big fan of anime, so the whole "so kawaiiiii!" thingy is rather... well, beyond me. So I can see how this game would be perfect for someone who enjoys this sort of stuff.\n\nPros:\n+ length - Yes, this game is very long. I would be lying if I said that there weren't tons and tons of unnecessary scenes that took waaay too long than they should, but still, there is no doubt that with this title you get a long gameplay and not something that will end abruptly after hour or two, as many visual novels.\n+ writing - There were things that I didn't like (I will write more about it in "cons" section), but still, it's pretty solid.\n+ premise - You know those games/stories where boy need to attend all-girl school for some obscure reason? Those are usually very silly or just plainly stupid reasons, but here explanation was actually interesting and it make sense.\n+ graphic - Yepp, pretty much all of girls looks like they're less than 15 years old, but hey! Graphic is still very nice. CGs, backgrounds, characters - all well done.\n\nCons:\n- protagonist - Again, maybe I'm not the best person to judge (since I'm into girls), but I didn't see a single thing that makes him an interesting character. Sure, he's a nice guy, that is overly lucky, despite not that lucky past, but sometimes... I remember a scene when they were talking about why one of the girls (I think Ritsuko) was elected and he went with something like: "Because you're beautiful!" and then another, where his explanation for something similar was: "She's beautiful and have a big breasts". Come on. Are you seriously thinking that this is the main reason why someone get elected in all-girls school? That's the first thing. The second thing is, if you're in company of girls and that's how you want to win them over... Well, you're doing it wrong, sir! So once again, I don't see what makes him so great and awesome that pretty much all characters are attracted to him.\n- decisions - this is the biggest flaw for me. Let's start by saying, that I don't like kinectic novels. I want to have the feeling that I, as player, actually have impact (so you know - I'm PLAYING the game), rather than just reading the story. So I hate when "visual novels" (riiight) does that trick, when there are few decisions and almost none are impactful. Seriously. The only decisions that had any impact (and they were obvious) were the ones where you picked the girl you want to pursue. There's nothing more to it, really.\n- humor - Yepp, I know there are people who just loves it. For me it was silly. Yeaah, cat stole my coupon, and all girls are fighting over me, but I don't see it because I'm stupid apparently, and oh, I just walked into the room where girls are undressing... Yeeeeah, so funny... Nope.\n- rather cliche female characters\n- overall sweetness - So sweet, oh so sweet. I know that the main target for this game are men and boys, but the girls here are all so sweet and lovely and innocent that it just makes me cringe. If you're dreaming that all girls-only schools looks like that... Well, they're not.\n- enemies - Goons. Right. Not scary. Not truly dangerous. Only two. Once again, why are the protagonist so deadly afraid of them when he keeps defeating them by pure luck time after time?\n\nLike I've said, these are my issues with the game. For some people they may be a good things. I still have Ritsuko route to finish, but I don't think I can force myself to go after any other girl, so no route-specific part of the review in the near future (or ever).","January 17","true","9.6"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","0"

I'll just write a simple one then, The Story? Your a borderline unsocial jackass went it comes to girls (seriously there are moments so cringy on how he did not realize what the girls were talking about) that tries to save an all girls school  from going bankrupt by changing it into co-education, sounds hard? Yes it is. With me playing 30 or more hours into it just means you are in for a ride. The characters (Main or even Side characters) they all had influence into the story, not just blatant side characters that just appears for chit chat and random moments, no they all actually have a point in the story. The routes are only 4 from this one. Im not complaining since each route really has a touching story to each girl, whether it being your old friend, your saviour, your enemy, or just a seductive older women that likes to tease you alot. The plot twists are incredible in it aswell like truly "a holy **** " moment. And then there was the ending. I cried. Seriously i did. Just to put it simply the drama ride you took and it ends all in perfect climax, it just hurts right in feels.\n\nSo should you buy this game?\nYes, preferably on sale\n\nIs it a great game?\nIt is for me.

It has those usual cliche's for main characters, but looking past that I honestly liked it.\n\nI have a few complaints, one being that there are only 4 candidates for choice, and there's another girl within the story who I wish was a possible candidate...\n\nSecondly, there seems to be only 4 endings to the game, in which you only "pursue" one of the four girls. The game will also provide you with an early ending when you make a wrong decision towards a bad end, so too bad you don't get to see your love life 100% spiral out of control.\n\nIs it worth the price? That depends on your tastes. If you're not into reading visual novels with a lot of text, and character portraits, you should probably wait for a sale, $20 at best.\n\nIs the adult version worth it? uh...\n","January 19","true","8.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","9","11","5","0"

He meets people he knows there thats why he has friends he is mostly hated at first by majority of girls but yea through character development and plot it shines to light.

All character are very charming and likable and some are just too lovable like asako and ruriko.

Ahem, now lets get to the review\n\n\nI have only completed one route in the game and it took me a very long time to do it, despite being a very fast reader. I finished it in 15-20 hours. I can't give an exact time as steam doesn't keep track of your time in non-steam games. I would reccommend this to anyone who likes Visual Novels.\n\n\nThe story line is really amazing as it doesn't focus on the whole eroge genre of it. It takes almost the whole game for you to reach any girl. I think it's worth a 9/10 for now as I've only done one route in terms of the story.\n\n\nAs for the art and animation, its a simple design, some scenes have motion all the time, while others only change the characters posistion/eyes of them. I would've really liked full motion in the game for the price I paid, but its still good. 8/10 on that part.\n\nChoices in the game are really simple, they ask you to pick who you want to go after outright. They aren't as often as you would think which I really liked as it added more indepth information about characters. I actually had to go back to a previous save after picking a girl, realizing when I had more info about one of them that I'd rather go that route instead. 10/10 on that part.\n\n\nOverall this is the best Visual Novel I've read, giving it a solid 9/10 even a 10/10 perhaps when I finish all the routes.","July 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACriticalHit/recommended/344630/","ACriticalHit","Ｃritical Ｈit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ACriticalHit/","313 products in account","Male Shaming Simulator; With a side order of romance and drama\nConsidering you got 26 Chapters, full Japanese Voice acting with a believable, yet emotional story. If you sit there and listen to it all, it'll easily last you for 40+ hours and you know what? This game's worth the price (to get the Adult Version, get it from MangaGamer as these files are encrypted).\n\nWhile I can't help that the main and minor female characters you interact with all fall into a hard stereotype blended into their personalities, it's at least done with style. While the school life adventure has been done numerous amounts of time, this one shows promise and delivers. It balances some romance, humor, drama, and the in-betweens of an adolescene well, and it executes those themes brillantly. This particular visual novel also left me with a color pallete of many emotions. At the same time, because of its drawn out length, this visual novel will have some holes that I will critique it for. There's also the 'version' debuncle that I want to cover as well.\n\nCharacters\nFor those that are curious about the character 'archetypes', it goes something like this:\n\nYou see, you got Miss "Rise"-and-Shine, Tsundere "Chiho", The Tsumugi of K-On! "Ruriko", GOTTA GET THE LATEST SCOOP "Tamie", the perky loli "Konomi", the comic relief-and-tease "Ayaka", the mature younger sister "Ritsuko", a well respected student lead "Marika" with her right hand lady "Mitsuki" who have an undying passion of righteousness.\n\nWhat is the Deal with All Ages vs. Adult Only versions?\nWhen I did some research, it seems as describing and showing 15-20 minutes of sexual content is defined as an Adult game and will not be allowed to sell according to their Steam Representative (source). The Adult Only version technically has more content than the All Ages version. Kudos to the developer for handling the PR aspects well as it was outside their control. Steam wouldn't allow the release of the Adult version nor a post-game patch (HuniePop is a grey area that was allowed a pass since the content wasn't as sexually explicit as this game is.)\n\nHowever, the MangaGamer store will offer you the All Ages key if you buy the "Adult Only" version on the website. Kudos again, developer.\n\nCriticisms\n- The branching paths you can take in this game are limited to one girl at a time, and even then you can't explore some of the side characters.\n- The jokes in this game are actually pretty funny only if you haven't been exposed much within the Japan culture.\n- The music can get repetitive very fast, especially going over 26 chapters... Oh no...\n- The 'Summer' chapters run like a typical episode in an anime/manga where it's summer break and the characters do their... Cheesy shenanigans.\n+ However, the 'Main' chapters are executed well and each of the character's backstories are thorough and verbose. You are able to connect to everyone (whether you like them or hate them).\n? It has a lot of male shaming in it. Whether this is your fetish, or you'll get annoyed at considering it sounds similar to an uneducated feminist rant. That's up to you for interpretation.\n\nFinal Verdict\nWith a legnthy game and a fair share of shortcomings, it still has some questions to answer.\nIs this a fun game? Definitely.\nDoes this game motivate you enough to explore the other options? It sure does if those archetypes caught your eye. Otherwise it can be debateable.\nIs it a masterpiece? For the school-based Visual Novel junke, it's high up there.\nBut the price! It's so much! I understand the complaint. You do get a lot of chapters, full voice acting, and the art's pretty nice to look at.\nIt's also a nice bonus that the Moonstone developers do reply.\n\nIt is safe to say it's a high recommendation from me. Now, go out there, be man shamed and enjoy the experience.","October 4, 2015","true","24.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels like it was written by a 14 year old school girl. With antagonists confessing to their nefarious deeds in front of a crowd of people (thanks lady!) to an overreliance on chance solving the protagonist's problems at every turn that will make you cringe. The protagonist is 'practically perfect in every way' to the point of boredom. What makes Princess Evangile worth reading are the girls. Marika's self righteousness, Ruriko's innocence, Chiho's uncertainty, Ritsuko's faith, it's sad that they're not all available to 'win'. The endings are cliche, the scenes are contrived, the only surprises are what you'll learn about girls who have no contact with men. I imagine the writers had help from sisters or friends. It's the type of game you play because you like visual novels, you enjoy the art of Moonstone, and you want to enjoy a pleasant experience relaxing with friends, all of whom are girls. Overall I would recommend it to those who already like moe visual novels or anime. It's not a beginners visual novel but it's worth the read.","April 8, 2015","true","71.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Seems to have good reviews here and elsewhere. The game description should have warned me away. Ultimately I assumed this would be more like a certain manga about a "commoner sample". Technically speaking there's nothing wrong. Nice art, decent bgm, good UI (some VNs seem to really skimp on the basics).\n\nMy problem is mostly with the story. The girls aren't just sheltered. Their naive to the point of being born in a cabbage field. That is to say they seem to know so little about males that I'd assume none of them had fathers or brothers. It's storyline is a contrived romp through anime/manga tropes that seems to be for the lulz. Except I think it takes itself a little too seriously.\n\nThe MC is almost as bad with a naivety of a different kind. Considering his background you'd think he'd be a little quicker on the uptake. Most of the conflict in the common route begins with him blundering into it.\n\nWould not recommend unless you're really into by-the-numbers, cutesy, coming of age, slice of life, romcom with more rom than com (I found most attempts at humor a little groan worthy).\n\n*edit* I finished all the routes now. Opinion has gotten worse if anything. By the end it seemed there was common theme or reason for most of the conflicts and it got old real quick.\n\nRitsuko complains her life is on rails, well so is this game.","January 30","false","94.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"

Every charater has their own story and is likeable in their own way. I easily grew attached to each one as they were introduced one way or another. This novel also holds a hefty 25+ chapters, making it one of the longest novels I've read. There's also some aspects of a "choose your own adventure" story in here at certain intervals. While not too many of them are present in the story, they're placed at important intervals that can change the story in unique ways. I also must say that the writing in this novel is astounding. I found myself smiling, laughing, and even crying during many points of the story. Princess Evangile is one of those stories that's well worth the price, as well as also reading over for its four different endings. And yes, I said FOUR ENDINGS...","October 13, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The choices come maybe once or twice a chapter but each one plays something new and its amazing. 40$? i woulda payed 90$ for a game of this quality. The artwork, voice acting, scipt, everything.

For example Ruriko who appeared more than Ritsuko, isn't one of the choices, that somewhat saddens me. Although ''W Happiness" version, which is not on steam, will have the other girls as well as the 4 current girls\n\nAnd make sure U Always choose the girl you want because at chapter 16, its sort of a deciding factor whether u will lose the game or not..","January 18","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found it entertaining very well put together. Though, it does get repetitive in each route from time to time, but it also adds unique elements within them too.\n\nBasically, this visual novel is about a teenage boy (Masaya, the MC) who pretty much grew up on the streets with his deadbeat father. They accumulated a large debt over time from the local yakuza/mafia and have been on the run for years. The father one day disappears and pushes the debt onto Masaya, who has been working months and months just for some extra cash. So, now Masaya has to find a way to clear his debt... while doing so conviently running into a rich teenage girl and conviently winning the lottery, thus clearing it up. After he clears his debt, the girl invites him to be the first and only male at an all girls highschool as a sample for future integration. Here on, lives his whole year within this highschool, falling in love and getting into trouble.\n\nSo, if you like cute, slice of life, school, romance kind of stuff, then I suggest checking this out. Whether it be the Steam version or the patched 18+ version, it is still a very good visual novel.","February 2","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
