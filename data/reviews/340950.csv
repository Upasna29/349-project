You have a tree that you place branches on. Branches with leaves on them grant life to the tree that fills up a meter. Once the meter is filled you complete the level. One of the challenges to the levels are flowers and mushrooms below the tree. Flowers need sunlight to grow and stay alive and mushrooms need shade. So there is a little strategy to where you place things.\n\nAfter a few levels I got bored of playing. It's not something I'll come back to and finish up. I also think the price tag of $7.99 for it is a little high. Might be better at say $3 to $5. I can't recommend this for those two reasons. There are some positive reviews for the game but for my opinion it's a no.","July 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

There's a game called "Tree Simulator," but it's fake, not a game really, whereas "Let There Be Life" can be rightly called "a tree simulator." It features picturesque graphics, relaxing pleasant music, and free of tension or mental strain, zen-like gameplay. The game isn't very long and lasts just enough not to get bored. Maybe its target audience are primarily kids, but you can use it if you need "the flower therapy" or something like that :-)","February 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I would recommend to people that are looking for something to wind down to. However, I feel for its simplicity and brevity, the game is a bit overpriced. Especially on Steam, where one can get games like Terraria that offer hundreds of hours of gameplay for nearly the same cost as this, which delivered merely 4 hours (of relaxing and unchallenging gameplay). It was a cute game, but I look forward to updates that make the purchase a bit more worthwhile as the developers continue to improve the game version.\n\nSome suggestions may be to allow players to place flowers along with the branches, more levels, the ability to rotate pieces for less restrictive placements, perhaps levels with clouds (providing areas with natural shadow to work around), and maybe a wider range of creatures like squirrels, bats, spiderwebs, or even exotic themes with a whole different cast of animals, flowers and tree types.","February 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

But this one offers little to no enjoyment. Each level makes you do the exact same thing: add new branches, and new branches, and new branches, avoid casting shadow on flowers, more branches, and add more branches...\n\nDon't get me wrong. If you like branches, a lot of them, this game is for you. But if you don't care about them so much, you'll find this game pretty repetitive and simply boring. Some say Let There Be Life is relaxing, but there are plenty of other relaxing games out there on steam. That's why I'm not recommending this one.","January 28","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a very simple puzzle game, based on the mechanic of shade.  The game is engaging without being particularly difficult, and a relaxed playthrough will give you 4-5 hours of play.  This is definitely something that you will pick up again and while away time with once completed.\n\nThe placing of tree branches works well, and despite my best efforts to the contrary, the devs have done an excellent job enabling you to end up with something that does look like a tree.\n\nThe animals do a really nice job making the scene really alive, and the sound effects work well, even the butterfiles, which have the sound of laughing children.\n\nThere are one or two minor annoyances with the music.  The background music is short loops of tracks, and some of them don't loop too well.  While the soundtrack is not too bad, it definitely gets a bit annoying after a time.  The music is simple versions of well known songs, so is not too much of an issue to lose.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, to while away some time, something that will engage your brain, and senses, without putting too much strain on the grey matter, pick this up.\n\n8/10\n\n","July 3, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
