The plot tried to go a lot of places and consequently went nowhere. The reader is shown a lot of interesting characters and are only really able to get to know a very small subset. The endings I've encountered all felt abrupt.\n\nEven though I played the previous game in the craftverse I still found myself with a bunch of information unceremoniously dumped in my lap and I found myself still consulting the little codex on the system screen halfway through the game.\n\nYour character, despite being a whole new one who's personality is largely subject to your whims, is once again a craftswoman/man working  for a morally ambiguous organization.\n\nThe atmosphere has gotten a  Western touch up, whether that is a plus or minus is up to you.\n\nThough I bought this at 25% off right when it released I'm still not happy with it.\n\ntl;dr maybe get it if you wanna support CoG in general. If you haven't played Choice of Deathless just do that instead.\n\nLet's cross our fingers for the next Heroes Rise.","October 24, 2015","false","2.2"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

I struggled for a bit to make two particuar decisions in the game, that I did regret to some degree, regardless of the outcome.

It's an extremely rich world building, that can be a little difficult to get into - but if you have played the first game (and even better, read the Craft Sequence book series) you will enjoy being a Craftman/Craftwoman a lot.\n\nYou work for a huge company trying to get water for a metropolis - which usually involves bankrupting farmers. You can be a good samaritan, a merciless but devoted professional, a selfish scheming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - and all of your decisions have an important impact that will lead to several different endings. As in all Choice of Games I've played so far, your character can have any gender and sexual preferences, and is also defined by your charm, conviction, craft mastery and cunning, which let you solve every situation by many differents ways,  giving an excellent replayability.\n\nOne of the best Choice of Games I've played so far, and I strongly recommend it (as well as the first Deathless game, and the book series).","November 5, 2015","true","4.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There's no technical shortcomings to the game, and it's proficiently interactive where you can enact your will on the game quite visibly (Though it was a tad bit on the short side in terms of length.)\n\nMy problem is more in the way that the game is written in a way that's not friendly to people who are unfamiliar with the craft sequence world, of which I have not read a book of. It's intimidating and complex, and it doesn't ease you into it, or explain itself enough. If you've already played through the other game in this series, "Choice of the Deathless," without issue, then this won't be a problem either, as I can say my experience with that was very similar to what it was here.","October 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

But Craftverse is very interesting and unique, while it may be complex, it's still very enjoyable. You may get lost at first, but once you get how the games work, the stats, soulstuff, the system, then it's easy to play. Max gladstone's writing is great, too. If you're a fan of his you should buy this game. Also, while some of the game's system are similair to the first one, the stats here mattered more, the romance is better too in my opinion. But there are only two RO AFAIK which is a shame.\n\nit's worth the money, especially now. I recommend you to buy it while it's on sale, if you end up not liking it it wouldn't cost you too much.","October 25, 2015","true","22.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Again, you're a demonic lawyer working for a somewhat morally ambigious firm -- though this time around, the stakes are much higher. You're working to arrange a water supply for your city, or rather the city your law firm is situated in, to keep it from drying out. However, this might only be done at the cost of the lives and prosperity of surrounding villages and communities. Not to mention the scorpion demons running around...\n\nThe game felt less personal and more political to me, as you suddenly have the ability to decide on the fate of a large community of people (all while either not trying to anger your bosses OR deliberately work against them). It's a big mess of groups of people with different angles and motivations working against each other, and you're caught in the middle. At times, I didn't really know which choices to pick, and which choices would land my character their preferable ending.\n\nDeathless: The City's Thirst also expands on the world and the setting, but that didn't necessarily make it easier for me to follow. There is a lot of information and a lot of new terms, and I only realised afterward that the Deathless games are actually part of an existing universe which is part of a book series by Max Gladstone! Whoops, so that explained why I couldn't just understand everything right off the bat...\n\nPros+ Interesting setting and world/lore expansion\n+ Murder mystery solving!\n+ High stake choices\n+ Interesting romances options & plenty of opportunities for one-night-stands\n\nCons- No save points or skip options\n- A little disjointed, lacking depth here and there\n- A lot of glimpses of new demons/monsters/concepts, but nothing fully explored\n- Stressful political situations where you feel you can't make informed choices\n\nIn the end, I would certainly recommend that you play Choice of Deathless first. I felt that was the more coherent, fun, and well-written game of the two games that take place in this same universe. I still enjoyed Deathless: The City's Thirst, but it was a little too disjointed and stressful for me when I compare the two. Still, it's a good game at its core, and if you enjoy the setting and magic system, then you'll probably enjoy this one too!","February 7","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shewolfoffrance/recommended/410910/","shewolfoffrance","SheWolfOfFrance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shewolfoffrance/","12 products in account","This game was not in the least bit what I expected. With selling points like "Look for love in extremely wrong places!" I thought I was getting into a highly excentric and humourous tale--instead I got a political and stressful hot mess. Don't get me wrong--I actually really enjoyed this game. But damn. I was not prepared to make some of those choices. Would you rather save your city from a drought at the price of displacing a whole farming community or see prices sky-rocket causeing economic destruction to defend the land-rights of a small village? Even if the choice is easy at first, characters will spend the game guilting you and telling you how wrong you are. Unless you adapt a pure evil attitude, the decisions you make will not come easily. The game does well with giving situations that are not black and white, but rather have both rewards and consequences. The plot and characters are interesting; you are sometimes thrust into relationships and sometimes have them grow slowly. Your integity is constantly tested, and it seems impossible to remain humble.\n\nNow I do have a few qualms with the game-- the story doesn't always flows easy, certain situations feel disjointed and take you a while to understand because you didn't choose the opption that gave a thourough explaination. The politics of this fictional society can be outright confusing, and the game won't always spell it out--so occationally you make choices based on what you *think* is happening, simply because you don't quite understand. Despite this, I still enjoyed the story. The second problem I have is that the stat system seems rather pointless--perhaps you see more benefit with it with multiple play-throughs, but otherwise it doesn't seem to do much.\n\nAll in all, I think its fun. Well worth its low asking price. It took me nearly three hours to get through. It can be very funny at points, its quite engaging, and it definitely makes you think.","November 26, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And, above all, set in one of the most fascinating and original fantasy settings I've had the pleasure to explore. The replayability value is also enormous - it's not just ending up with a different romantic interest or choosing the other side of the conflict, it's big damn choices that really matter. Big enough that my first character actually decided to run away from it all because of the sheer weight of the choice he was confronted with.\n\nAlso, do check out Choice of the Deathless, which was just as great!","October 26, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Differing itself from its sister game The City's Thirst (TCT) is more detective noir paired with western cowboys (at least in my first play through) then the machinations of mystical lawyer life. Wonderfully told with a fabulous breadth of stories, TCT elicits many possibilities from the intriguing setting, human (and inhuman) characters, and even the personality of the player. Are you just a negotiator trying to make sure everything is square in the never ending slog of city governance? Or perhaps a war torn vet sexing, smoking, and drinking your way through day after day just trying to forget? Either way, I can see I'll have more fun to gleam from this lovely title in the future and I cant wait for my chance to do it.","November 11, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how the story and themes are up for your interpretation but this doesn't deviate the flow, still allowing things to go full circle back to its beginning. It's well written, a bit more mature than the previous Deathless, I continue to feel like an active component in the story, and to my pleasant surprise definitely has a portal franchise sort of ending to it. I shed a single tear at the way my first runthrough ended. In the end, how did this story resonate with my beliefs and values? Truly beautiful.\n\nImagine a corporate sort of movie with a cast of highly respectable characters (two of which are George Clooney and Morgan Freedman) all with their own agendas trying to balance themselves and the greater good.

The decisions I made felt well thought out and consequential with the story completely changing depending on actions I took several chapters ago. The game functions as  series of seven self contained scenarios featuring literarture staples like the detective story, the tough negotiation and the rescue mission, all tied together by the overarching theme of balancing the cities needs for water with that of its sorroundings. Some earlier reviews have talked about the difficulty of approaching the game without prior knowledge of the craftverse and also the somewhat overstretched nature of the storyline. These faults are not difficult to miss but I think that the game is well worth buying, especially if you enjoyed the earlier deathless games.","March 29","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
