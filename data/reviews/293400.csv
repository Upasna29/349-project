When we ask for help on the forums we become banned as if the Dev's do not want potential users to see their problems. Seriously i bought this game and cannot use it or ask how to fix the problem.   This game closes in under 1 second I had to click play 400 times to get the total 5 minutes in game time to even write this review.

Somehow the developers took it literally and decided to really solve them before weekend.\n\nSome aspects of the game are still slow paced and give a browser-based game design feeling, like the rank requirement, or the several days long timers for crafting some items that aren't even something you'd actually desire enough to wait that long. Although you don't need to spend the waiting time in game and may have lots of stations with separate assembly lines.\n\nBut the game is playable and if you're into universe exploration and a bit of management you can have fun with the game. Most bugs are the kind you'd expect from EA and relogging will fix.\n\nThe missions still have ridiculously low rewards (worse than shooting trash to sell scraps). But, unlike many other mmos, they're not the main source of money until you're able to work the player market. And the npc ran stations are not the best way to get anything other than fuel. You can pretty much scan a planet and find the $10mil ship.\n\nI'm keeping the original review and the patch I noticed the problem solved.. but do look for videos:\n\nIf you're still making up your decision on whether to buy this or not, make sure you watch gameplay videos.\n\nThe game seems to have a lot of potential, although it is not likely to ever be a mainstream game. But as for now, it would only be worth buying if it was on a 95%-off sale. Of course, this is early access and the team actually seems to be working, so it is possible that next week most of the problems will be solved. To be fair I'll try to update whenever I see any change.\n\nPlaying this for 6h, I haven't experienced any sign of lag, only seen minor bugs and got disconnected a couple times.\nThere's only a few problems... have you ever played those browser games where you'd click a few buttons and come back 6-24h later to click a few times again? I had the impression that I was playing one of those. Except that I couldn't just wait the 6-24h. I actually would have to navigate for countless hours to get $4000 and repeat until I make a few millions to get an upgrade on anything.\n\n[v7.6.1] After you log in, you get dumped in the middle of nowhere with a ship that will make you wonder if you shouldn't just get out of it and fart your way across the universe to see if you go faster. And, the answer is yes, you would have a much higher chance of reaching something before you die than using that ship. Unfortunately, it's not possible.\n\nAlong with your space exploring snail, you get a message that seems to be a sketch of a tutorial quest. The problem is that the quest will pretty much tell you to go around the universe looking for stuff and to bring them to someone somewhere. Yes, you have to figure out by yourself where are the stuff they asked for, along with who and where are "us" from the message. And you'll probably die in real life before you figure out how many of those you could have found.\n\n[v7.6.1] That's about when you'll figure out that other players might be able to help you.. so you decide to give the chat a try. Then you'll hit enter to start chatting and say hi... it won't work.. so you'll try to say "testing"... then the chat willl open with "esting" and you'll find out that the developers decided to innovate and T is the hotkey to start chatting. All fine until you notice you're going in a random direction for a while and try to move your ship. Then you'll notice they innovated even more and the escape button doesn't close the chat... all you can do is say "wwwwasdadsdwasdaswddsdawdsdawsdwomfg how do I close chat?". Then someone will tell you to send an empty message to close it. Still all fine.\n\nThere are some players that will really be helpful whenever they can, and some that will tell you to go play CoD. And you'll probably be directed to the wiki. Don't go. You might feel scammed if you see the part that reads "We currently have 113 articles about the free-to-play MMORPG set in an Infinite Universe". It didn't feel very free-to-play when I bought it here in steam.\n\nAnyways, after a while you'll feel lost and unsure if you did complete the tutorial mission or not. This will be solved a few hours later when you figure out what the mission dude meant by checking your PDA and you'll see that they actually wanted you to deploy a station. It wasn't just if you wanted a challenge. That was the mission.\n\nThen you'll feel desperate because you have no idea how to accomplish that. And at this point anything seems to take at least a couple weeks of non-stop gameplay to be accomplished. Then you find out that the little triangle button is where you get missions from. "So that's what the chat people were talking about! Holy Crap! 17x323?????". Yup, the best paying mission is offering you about $4000 to travel 340 sectors. It takes a bit more than 2 minutes to cross 1 sector. Which seems perfectly reasonable given that it would only take like 13h of gameplay each direction and you only need about 5 million to get started. So.. if everything goes well.. you should be able to grab a cargo ship in about 3 years of gameplay (rl time). Then you can start gathering assembly parts to work on a station and complete the tutorial mission.\n\n[v7.6] That's when you decide to just enjoy the environment and fly around exploring the universe. You're almost starting to enjoy the game and you suddenly stumble upon an unknown planet! You can name it! Or maybe not. The game asks you to "donate" in order to be able to claim objects (to name planets and stars). What in the seven hells do they mean by donating after you just spent so much for the early access of the game (which might eventually turn out to be just for the early access if the wiki is right). I have no idea. No one online was able to explain. But it seems like it means exactly what the text says... after you purchase, there are parts of the gameplay that will require you to make "donations".\n\nIf you pretend you didn't see that and refrain from deleting the game immediately, you might stumble upon the "wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Nebula". That was the apex of the gameplay for me. I couldn't stop laughing when I imagined the player wondering wtf was wrong with the ship that wouldn't move because the game was setting the name for the nebula instead of controlling the ship.\n\n[v7.6.. still can't place orders, but the npc stations have purchase orders so you can sell some of the stuff you find] Then you might decide to go to the trade hub people were talking about and make some profit out of the stuff you looted. Only to find out that "You must own this station to place orders". So... you need a station to get the money to buy a ship to get the pieces to build the station you need. Either that or you can spend the next few years holding the space bar to save fuel and navigate around the universe on quests that pay nothing.\n\nThat's about it. This game is not slow paced. This game is too slow to even see something slow paced. It's a slower version of a browser based game adapted so you have to actually spend the countess hours in-game instead of clicking and coming back in a few hours/days. And the extremly slow speed made no sense to me given that the universe is infinite.\n\n[turns out that the bug wasn't about having no station, but the map won't show up the edges of the sectors when zoomed out. The station exists right in the border of two sectors and it's pretty tricky to find unless you imagine that zooming in would allow you to see farther.] Other than that, no one was able to explain to me why the game said I claimed a sector but had no station or deployable units on it and couldn't deploy the units I found there because "someone" had claimed it. I'm just guessing that's a random bug and the game shouldn't have said I claimed it in the first place.","May 8, 2014","false","220.2"," 161 of 185 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","161","185","0","11"

I really liked the concept of this game as I've played several similar games but this game suffers from the same pitfalls of most space games.  That pitfall being way way too much empty space and slow travel.  Nothing is going on in this game still just you and  empty space.  There needs to be a lot more npc type ships and aliens roaming space communicating  with you or attacking with you.  Needs to be a waypoint systems to warp between points.  None of this just you and a slow moving ship in a colorless game because it's space as told to us.

I bought it because everyhting about it appeals to me.  I'm sure that if I was able to play the game, I would enjoy it thoroughly.  The problem then, is that despite repeated requests for aid in circumventing a bug which prevents me from logging in at all, the devs have simply stopped responding.  Quite a few of us are simply unable to play the game that we paid for.  No one has su[[;ied us with a fix, nor suggested that one will be available in the future.  So, this is a gamble.

You have no idea what to do, where you're at, or where to go. So you wander around for a while (with your limited fuel). I got lucky and found a fuel station, but with your fuel only showing a % you have no idea how much it takes to refuel your ship so you buy one, but then have to undock from the station to check your fuel level % and redock if you need more.\n\nI kept playing because it's like watching a movie that you heard was supposed to be good. Then it starts horrible, but you keep watching thinking in your head, "this has to get better." The game starts you with 1,000,000 credits. I found a shipyard  and saw a better (better pretty much only meaning faster in this game so far) the Ship was 1,000,000 and I had 1,000,120 at that time. I clicked to buy the ship to assemble it and it tells me "insufficient credits".. so now I can't buy anything with my over 1 million credits..\n\nIt gives you a task to build a space station.., What parts do you need? Where do you get those parts? Can you carry those parts or do you need a special ship like in the X series? The Wiki helps a little, but it's out of date, it says your starter ship doesn't have a scanner and it does, but I've scanned dozens of things and never get anything out of it or maybe it really doesn't have a scanner and the button an animations work, but it's not really doing anything, I have no idea. That new ship I tried to buy says it has a scanner..to bad 1,000,120 is insufficient credits for a 1,000,000 credit ship...\n\nI don't expect a game to hold my hand and show me everything, but imagine going to sleep tonight and waking up on a spaceship with no sight of any planets or other people or space stations. If the game was realistic, you would die of hunger or asphyxiation before you found anything.\n\nThe universe is infinite, but who needs an infinite universe when it's empty and nothing to do? If you want a game like this (although it's single player) I recommend Space pirates and zombies (S.P.A.Z.) and it's only $10\n\nI would have recommended this game actually if it was $5, but it's $30... This is the first time I've felt a little swindled on these early access games. I understand, alpha's, beta's and early access, but I was expecting a lot more for $30. If you want to donate the money to the games developement, Throw down the $30 and hope they make something out of it, but you probably won't be playing it.","May 11, 2014","false","10.7"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","61","72","0","1"

When I first started playing I was very confused on what to do. This was mainly because the game doesnt tell you the controls only that you should go and scan everything. Well this is true, to get any loot worth your time you need to fly into the far reaches of space and scan things. There you will find good loot like ships. Now that I know how to play this game seems fun. Right now I can't recomend this game due to it's $30 price tag and it's lack of tutorial. This game is on early access so things are bound to change but at this point in time, I can't recommend this game.","May 10, 2014","false","26.7"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","60","72","0","0"

I tried refueling and I didn't have the credits, so the station's I'm guessing mafia stole all my hull(health?) ammo and fuel I had remaining.\n\nNever met a single person, in-game, or in-chat.\nGameplay felt pointless as the first ship has no way of making any amount of money to buy other ships. (Think of getting 20 ore per haul. Each haul takes an entire fuel tank that costs 22$ a piece, each ore is worth 1-5$ and to even sell it you have to buy more fuel. Let's also say if you wanted a new ship, they cost 50,000$ minimum.)\n\nTL;DR Might as well be just Epic Space: Empty Beta, No progression, No where to go, nothing to do.","September 27, 2014","false","2.9"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorK/recommended/293400/","IgorK","Gary Dozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgorK/","557 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCan't recommend the game.\n\nThe game is currently ifested with lots of bugs. Most of the features are not documented. Have fun studying guides and forums trying to understand how things work.\n\nThe game has awful user interface and controls. The space is not seamless. It is divided by sectors into grid and you have to travel between sectors by reaching the edge of the sector. Very bad mechanics. Especially for PVP. You can dive in and out of a sector to evade fire. Sectors are pretty small, it takes several seconds to cross one on full speed.\n\nThere is no map for sectors beyong the core. Even if you will travel beyond the core you have to draw your map of outer sectors by yourself. The game won't help you.\n\nThere is no minimap of the sector. You will find it very inconvinient to navigate inside the sector.\nNo ship customisation or modules. No base building. You just put a station into space and that's it.\nThere is only crafting in the game. Space factories do not produce anything. They only give you some station specific bonus if you will craft something inside it.\nCrafting is mostly useless, you will loot or buy items much faster than craft them.\nThe only interesting activity in the game is scanning resource nodes for loot. But there is only one ship suitable for this task - Falcon.\n\nThe game is sadly pay to win. You can buy in-game money and capital ships for real money on official site. I don't know why anyone would want to waste money on this. The game has several serious duping glitches. Eventually there will be a wipe.\n\nThe worst problem is absence of any mechanics that will regulate sector ownership. If you will claim it you don't have to do anything, it will always be yours. With station assembly duping most of the sectors are already claimed.\nSimple ships can't damage stations. The only way to lose a sector is a capital ship attack using torpedoes. And cap ships are only available for real money.\n\nIt is not massively multi-player online game. It's massively single-player online game. You won't see anyone there, though there is only one server in US that lags a lot.\n\nAll in all the game will be a stillborn or it will be dramatically changed and released in 2 years.

No.\nThe game is quite liturally full of bugs right now. The sprites are ripped off from much much older games, and the game is lacking any real depth.\n\nWhat happens when new players join in a years time and the only way they can start a faction is to fly for 4 hours in one direction? Who knows... There are far to many un-answered questions.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll be placed in a neutral sector where weapons fire is disabled. This will give you some time to get to grips with flying your ship, and what to do.\n\nYou'll no doubt like me, start exploring straight away, but you'll soon be bored and fear running out of fuel, so you'll head back. I spent quite a long time pondering how I would make my first 5mill to get my Falcon. I would need this ship and 20 levels to be able deploy my first station. Soooo I check out the market, sell some items, but wait one second!! Did I just scan some nebula and find a falcon ship? Yes I did! Infact in 1h of doing some scanning I ended up with 3 ships, 3 stations, and a whole heap of crap.\n\nLike a giddy school kid, I go grab my new ship, create a faction (Eventually after trying to work out how to do it) And then find a sector of space to deploy it in. I deploy my station, only to have it completely bug out. It's my faction, it's my station, but I cannot name the station, and I cannot set home. Apparently I need to do this at a station that's in my faction land... Ermmmm.. Guess I should tell the game that's what i'm trying to do.\n\nThe grappling hook at times has a mind of its own. Sometimes thrusting me miles without me even pressing a key. At times my gun just starts ripping at anything infront of me, and half of the time other ships appear doubled, or jump around like crazy frogs. My ping being in the UK is about 130, however I shouldn't not be able to see a 2D graphic run smoothly across my screen. It makes combat practically impossible.\n\nThe concept is great. But it's not been very well put together. There are very few ppl online at anytime, and apparently they've had to upgrade there servers to handle the new load. They boast one server, one universe... But at the moment, it's looking very unlikely.\n\nHold off on this game till it's free to play. Buying now for the extra 1mill is NOT WORTH it. In 1 hour, I had 15 mill sat in my cargo bay just waiting to be sold.","May 14, 2014","false","20.9"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","34","43","0","2"

There is a similar flash game called Flash Trek Broken Mirror, that this game hasn't even taken basic notes from, it mostly feels like a small arcade shooter. The system for leveling, seems redundant, waiting for the first of every month to actually gain a rank. Ships are limited, and you start with a very small fighter type craft that is pretty much useless. As you level up the individual ship, through scanning and discovering objects, your ships fuel, cargo, and health go up. Again to me, this seems pointless as simply adding ships to buy would be much more encouraging to actually go out and do things.\n\nMaking money and leveling up is repetitive, and boring. You are given no direction from the start other then, "Scan things, make money." Thanks to the Infinite system, you will not bump into any players, which actually takes the point out of a multiplayer game. You'll come across vacant station left by alliances, but the only thing to do there is "Sell" random resources you get through scanning items, that and refueling. Other than that you'll just be floating and chatting, it might as well be a chat hub with a space ship in the back round.","August 2, 2014","false","2.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

To start with like all sandboxes its not for everyone and needs some patience. As an early access game it is still a work in progress and currently lacks a decent tutorial but it is on developer's to do list already. The project has a lot of potential and despite right now it has a small fanbase I think in due time it will become quite active","January 2, 2015","true","67.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","1"

Sure the game play is a little clunky and slow but it is early access.

The other being Face of Mankind.  Both games have border line terrible graphics, but it's not in the graphics that make this game good, it's the content.  All I've really done is exploration, but let me tell you... it's addicting.  Just finding new things in different sectors... I give this game a +1  I will update this later when I play a little more.  However, before I go I should probably say that you can place space stations and fight over sectors with other factions, interesting stuff.","May 5, 2014","true","63.7"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","0"

DO NOT BUY!\n\n***************************\nWhat is epic space online? An action filled space fighter game? No! (not yet at least, with the next update it will feature some promising pvp). What it is is basically an empire building / exploration game. I will discuss both aspects seperately.\n\n1) Exploration: What should an exploration game feature?\nIn my oppinion, three things:\n\n1st: Plenty of space to explore, featuring the "lone explorer alone far away from civilization feeling". Epic Space delivers, since it's a procedural game with an infinite universe. - 10/10\n2nd: An incentive to exploring. Ideally some kind of loot, which may be valuable artifacts or derilict ships or something like this. In Epic Space, you have a lot of variety in loot from scanning celestial objects you discover, most of the time it's relatively worthless stuff, but you can find ships, deployables, even station asseblies. Or the jackpot, Pioneer Letters, which sell for a large amount of ingame $ to NPCs. So I am fully satisfied in this regard, too. - 10/10\n3rd: Variation. There should be different kind of objects to discover, maybe alien races to interact with, or npcs. Or something else. Here Epic space offers differnt kinds of celestials (Asteroid belts (which can be mined for ore), Planets, nebulae, etc.) however they all feel quite alike atm. There are no alien races yet, and the only NPCs are the rare pirate outposts players can find, which are defended by stationary flak turrets and often yield rich loot. However they are no challenge, since a player can shoot further than them. So all in all, this aspect still has room for improvemt. - 5/10\n\nSo for the exploration aspect, i would rate this game as a 8.3/10 in total.\n\nEmpire Building:\nFrom an Empire building game i expect the following aspects:\n1st: The ability to build a huge empire, without any unnecessary restrictions. Here Epic space delivers due to it's procedural nature, allowing you to control an infinite amount of sectors. - 10/10\n2nd: Incentives to do so. Why have a big empire in an infinite universe? Well in ESO, there currently are 3 reasons:\n1) The monthly payout: Each sector will pay a given amount (which changes, haven't figured out yet according to which pattern) to each member of a faction. This amount is small for a single sector, but if your faction controls hundreds (which actually doen not take long to achieve) it will be several million $ per month per member.\n2) The Faction Ranking. Everyone wants to be #1, easy but effective incentive ;)\n3) Resources. You can only set up harvesters (deployable mining stations) in sectors your faction controls. So sectors which have many different ore belts are rare and valuable.\nSo i'd also rate the Incentive aspect as 10/10\n3rd: Empire Control. In a good empire building game, I'd expect some good control/managing featurs for controlling ones empire. In this regard, ESO still disappoints. There is the possibility to transfer sectors to other factions, but that's it. No map, no advanced features. No global controls for faction npc-turrets - in fact only the faction leader can program them, and has to visit each one individually (my faction has A LOT of such turrets). So empire control gets a 0/10.\n\nThis brings me to a 6.7/10 in Empire Building.\n\n3.) Other Aspects.\nWhile I believe in rating a game for what it's trying to be, there are those side things that really make you stick to a game and like it. So I feel i have to include them, too.\n\n1 - Combat System. Combat is very basic in ESO. You point your ship in a direction and fire, and it shoots in that direction. Things are a little bit more sophisticated with missiles and torpedos. But basically it's a simple yet robust combat system, and actually requires skill and not only stats to deal damage, especially hitting moving targets isn't easy. It atm lacks variation, though so i rate it 8/10\n1a - PVE. The onyl pve atm is shooting stationary NPC turrets guarding pirate outposts yielding loot. I am always excited if I find one, but that's really not much PVE...so 4/10\n1b - PVP. I have not yet shot another player, there will be dedicated pvp arenas coming with the next update. Thus i won't rate PVP atm.\nThus, combat - 6/10\n\n2- Community. While outstide of the developers control, the community is an important aspect of a game. I have found the ESO community to be extraordinarily friendly and helpful - 10/10\n\n3- Crafting. ESO has a tech-tree like crafting system that allows for manufacturing of every item in the game. At the moment, not all resources are harvestable however and can only be found by scanning objects in space. This makes the crafting system pretty useless as of now, but it is a good system in principle, and will allow for a diverse industry and market once all resources can be harvested.  Still, atm it has only little use. Thus 5/10.\n\nSo my "other aspects" rating is 7/10. This brings me to my conclusion...\n\nOverall I think Epic Space Online is an awesome game, which kind I have been waiting for. It is however not for everyone, since it is extremely slow paced (like glacial). Atm it still lacks content, but basic functionality for many aspects of the game is there, enough to make it enjoyable to play - it got me addicted, i haven't played another game in 3 weeks (I was spending far too much time working, but still...). If you think you'd like a blend of a "strategy" browser game you can actually fly around in, and the exploration aspect of the "4x" games, AND are very patient, then you will like ESO. My overall rating, under the premise that this is primarily an Exploration/Empire Building game is  7.3/10 for a game which has a lot of potential but still needs much more content. (Yes this is Early Access. I however believe that something which is available for money in a store counts as "released" and thus should offer a worthwhile experience and should be measured by the same standard as any other game. Supporting the devs is all nice and fun (and i invested quite a bit in ESO) but this is steam and not kickstarter)","July 7, 2014","false","165.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
