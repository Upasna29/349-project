I especially like the hand drawn art. the music fits the game perfectly. The only thing I could think of that would make the game better is if the characters said more instead of the same voise track over and over. There is nothing wrong with them, there just should be more.","December 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
