Let me explain. I love point and click adventures, I like horror/mystery genre and the art on the front cover definitely promised a sick and twisted journey, but the actual screenshots on the back appeared as completely unappealing to me. It's black and white, character models looked just plain ugly and the environments didn't look interesting or detailed. The game wasn't that expensive so I decided to give it a chance.\n\nDuring the first few minutes of it I realised that I really misjudged this little game. It's creeping on you even after you quit it and leave your house, it has a truly breathtaking atmosphere, manages to create great tension and catches you off guard most of the time. You go in thinking that this is going to be a bland story about ghost hunting in a "there's something off about this" village and it's inhabitants, but what you get is something more unique than you think. Frightening and eerie sound, dialogues that you wouldn't want to skip through and a whole lot of spine-chilling moments. As soon as I saw that it's available on Steam, I knew I just had to write a positive review so people won't make a mistake having prejudgments like I once did.\n\nIf you're a fan of suspense and atmosphere that's so strong, you have to pause the game to gather your thoughts together from time to time, I'd strongly recommend getting this game.","June 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 104 of 111 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","104","111","0","0"

However, since there are (at time of writing) so many reviews and comments heaping praise on this game (and even calling it a masterpiece), I figured a negative rating would probably get more people to read this review and consider some of the poorer aspects of this game before buying it.\n\nFIRSTLY LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE THE GAME'S FINER POINTS. The artistic design is excellent. The stylistic grey and white with splashes of colour is a great device for delineating supernatural vs ordinary events. It makes use of the night vision camera all the more spectacular. The setting of an isolated english town steeped in history and pagan beliefs is very good too. In fact, as a premise for a game the whole thing sounds perfect; explore a spooky town with ghostbusting gadgets, solving mysteries and vanquishing evil. What could go wrong? A fair amount, it turns out.\n\nFor a start, it's slow. Painfully, bloody slow - even for a point and click. You can double click for quicker movement but it doesn't work everywhere and you have to sit there and watch the player character, Nigel, slowly glide across the screen or perform an animation at a slugs pace. Meanwhile, you're sitting there grinding your teeth in frustration. It also takes a while to get the ghost-hunter gadgets so I reckon a lot of people may probably give up before the game gets interesting.\n\nOh, have I mentioned that Nigel comes across as being stupid. Well, he does. He just seems to react (or not react at all) to things so strangely. He's like those characters in horror movies that trip over things that aren't there and you're kind of glad when they get killed. He's also voiced poorly (by the game's creator) so his response to characters, ghosts and events in the game can be so odd and jarring that he is quite unlikeable. For example, there are a couple of times in the latter part of the game when pebbles are hurled by ghosts at his head and hit the camera - absolutely no response! I wanted Nigel to die. I really did.\n\nThe game also isn't scary/spooky enough. There are one or two genuinely creepy moments and a couple of jump scares but that's about it so it really shouldn't be described as a horror title.\n\nLook, I don't want to completely trash this game and dissuade people from playing it. I repeat, it's not bad, just flawed. Just take my criticisms under consideration. If you're ok with slow games and/or love point and click adventures, then grab this game. Maybe wait for a sale!???\n\nOne last thing; some STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS are buggered (they certainly didn't unlock for me) and according to the discussion forums, you may need to tamper with the game files to get them to unlock.\n\n","November 6, 2014","false","24.0"," 103 of 151 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","103","151","3","7"

Such tales - particularly if they are well-delivered - can raise the hairs on your neck and send chills down the spine. The Lost Crown: A Ghost-hunting Adventure is steeped heavily in the folklore intrigue of the spirit world rather than the full-on gore and flesh eating creatures found in horror games, but it still delivers a winding story full of scary moments and interesting twists. It's a creepy game that dabbles equally in aspects of ghost-hunting, searching for ancient treasure, and old fashioned detective work. If you're into ghosts, you'll love digging into this haunted adventure mystery set on the fog-laden coast of England.","November 8, 2015","true","22.3"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

The ghost hunting adds interesting new gameplay elements to the traditional point and click adventures.  The oddities throughout that things aren't what they seem is really well done.  Puzzles are mostly logical and interesting and tied in with the great underlying mysteries of the story.  The game definitely has some issues.  Even with fast travel (I imagine it would have been all but unplayable when it was first released without that), getting around town is annoying.  Voice acting is mostly good, but the main character frequently seems to put the stress on the wrong words in sentences as if the actor is reading the dialogue for the first time, which is bizarre since the creator of the game plays the main character.  A few of the achievements seem to be broken.  Some of the puzzles near the end are pretty terrible -- two (two!!) puzzles that require musical expertise and wandering around a maze trying to spot one elusive clue -- and there are a number of times where it can get frustrating trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done to trigger forward movement in the story.  All the negative issues are comparatively minor, however, compared to the strong points.  If you like adventure games, this is one of the best and a must play.","February 1, 2015","true","28.0"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

Definitely top 3. Unlike anything else entirely.\n\nAbsolutely to be forgiven of such painfully endearing floors as 'poor' voice acting, obtuse puzzles and slow animations. If you like adventure games play this on a week off school/work and preferably with a friend. Turn off your phone, minimize distractions, have snacks/ready meals on standby and settle in.\n\nIts floors (which are definite by any objective standard) make it loveable and unique. It is somewhat slow, misshapen and brutally clunky... but this is a one-man band we're talking about! Jonathan Boakes has done a singularly fantastic job making this game. I cannot stress enough how worth it this game is.\n\nIf I had never played this I would pay around £15 on a punt to see if it was worth it because I like the genre. After having played it I would gladly pay £100 or more because it is honestly unparalleled (okay, that sounds rediculous, but it's honestly true.)\n\nI will not give away anything about the game because saying anything about it at all would be unfairly taking it out of context, something to which this game is vitally important. I will say however that the voice acting is preposterous, the opening cutscene is cringeworthy, and the constant appeal to 'what is scary', dumb - but none of this matters. The 'bad' points about this game become almost instantly charming; the atmosphere will win you over.\n\nThe story is for the most part intruiging, the puzzles a mixture of challenging and twee, but the atmosphere... oh the atmosphere. Scary? Yes. Creepy? Certainly. Beautiful? Absolutely!\n\nYou will be greatly rewarded for sticking this game out. A true independent masterpiece for anyone who is even tangentially interested in adventure games.\n\nP.S. The best part is, Boakes is already a decent way through making the next game in the series and there's an interim installment in the series called Midnight Horror!","November 9, 2015","true","40.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eevilauntie/recommended/291710/","eevilauntie","eevil.auntie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eevilauntie/","189 products in account","Creepiness level: a couple of very mild jumpscares, some gore and animal cruelty, a whole lot of suspense and oppressive atmosphere. Most of the spooky stuff is conveyed through hints in dialogue and text fragments, as well as through environment and sound design, so there's not a lot of on-screen violence or anything.\n\nDifficulty level: I think there are only two timed puzzle/action sequences, you can take your time with everything else, and you can't die in this game. The slow pacing and easy point-and-click mechanics are perfect for anyone with slow reflexes or coordination problems. People have complained about Nigel's slow walking - the Steam version allows double-clicking for faster screen transitions, which minimizes the time spent just watching Nigel trudge around. It's still not a game for fans of fast-paced action, but personally I found myself deliberately slow-walking through many scenes, to better immerse myself in the atmosphere.\n\nOnly minus point for tiny cursor and no hotkey for highlighting interactable items - in some scenes I had to check a walkthrough to see if there was another item a couple of pixels apart from items I'd already clicked through (and there usually was). The directional arrows are also sometimes confusing.\n\nAs a completist gamer I'm also grumpy about the problems with the Steam achievements. I spent a lot of time trying to unlock everything, but had to give it up as a lost cause (there was nothing more I could try short of playing the entire game through in German, which apparently fixes the achievement bugs).\n\nI've previously played Jonathan Boakes's Dark Fall trilogy, and while I enjoyed those, The Lost Crown is superior both visually and in maintaining a consistent atmosphere. By now I've come to the conclusion that as a writer, Boakes excels in creating mysteries you want to keep following through, and that makes the games very addictive. He's not good at endings, though. All four games of his I've played so far have ended in a way that's abrupt and anticlimactic. But that used to bother me more than it does now - the endings are unimportant compared to the interconnected worldbuilding underlying his games. The layers of mythology, science and science fiction, different time periods and recurring themes really start to pay off once you've played several of his games. I'm looking forward to Boakes's future projects and to finding out more about the mysterious Hadden Industries.","December 12, 2014","true","27.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

This game will give you nightmares if you let it. You will become involved with the story to the point where you feel emotionally tied to it. This game is not for an action junkie, its not for the average gamer either.

Its not a simple point and click game, you'll need to use your clues and your wits to decide what happens next.\n\nIf you enjoy horror or mystery and you would like to enjoy a story that will leave you satisfied. You have to look no further.\n\nA word of warning! Do not get bummed out if the first hour of the game isnt scary, listen and look for the clues and hang in there, it gets really interesting after you get to saxton.\n\nP.s.

It's not perfect, there are definite flaws, but overall I find it a great addition to my library.\n\nOn the plus side:  graphically beautiful, with photo-real settings in monochrome with occasional bright dashes of color that really enunciate the scenes.  Character graphics may be considered a little dated now, but nothing terrible.  Music and sound work well.  Voice acting overall is good and believable with the exception of Nigel, who has a sort of strange Shatnerian pace to his lines which could also be the result of botched sound editing rather than strange voice acting.  I've heard people complain that the voice acting is bland overall, but I disagree; I like that the characters have believable tone and cadence rather than hamming it up (melodrama ruins immersion).\n\nThe biggest plus is naturally the story, which is deep and compelling and doesn't spoon-feed information.  There is a lot of opportunity for the player to form their own theories and explanations for some of the strange events; however, if you are the type that prefers definitive black-and-white explanations, you may be frustrated by some of the questions that are only loosely addressed and left to you to form your own opinions on.\n\nThe ghost-hunting part of the game with a full Ghost Hunters set of equipment is really fun in my opinion, but I also suck up episodes of GH and Ghost Adventures like some people drink water, so I could be biased there.  I really enjoyed snapping pictures and listening to EVP playbacks, which ranged from blatant clues to added plot points.\n\nThe neutrals:  the pace is slow.  The story, like many point-and-click adventure games, doesn't rely on fast action and jumpscares to progress.  Rather, it slowly builds the story (and substories) into a cohesive narrative.  I don't find the pace too slow, personally, as I prefer having the crap scared out of me in a slow, chilling way instead of a jumpscares-constantly-cause-startling-people-is-fun way.  However, if you like fast action and immediate gratification, you may not like this one.\n\nThe negatives: going back to pace, your player character, Nigel, moves GLACIALLY slowly.  There is a doubleclick-to-move-faster option that works most of the time, but you do have to wait for him to get "in position" on each screen before moving to the next even with the doubleclick.  Since this game utilizes a fairly huge game world, this gets irritating relatively quickly.  For me personally, it doesn't break the game, it's just an annoyance to keep in mind.\n\nSome puzzles, as in most point-and-click games, are not as intuitive as you might want, but if you're a fan of the genre, you won't have too much trouble.  Puzzles are definitely less abstract than some other games I've played.\n\nThe other complaint I see is about the broken achievements; while most work, there are a handful that only work in the German language version of the game.  There are directions in the forums for how to access these achievements with a minimum of fuss if you're a crazed achievement hunter (like me!).  While this is a definite negative, it does not in any way impact actual gameplay, and won't affect you at all if you're not "into" achievements.\n\nSo overall, I recommend the game.  The negatives aren't negative enough to overwhelm all the positives, and the $10 asking price is completely reasonable given the substantial depth and length of the game.  I've played through twice since purchasing and will likely return to it again in the future for my scary, ghost-hunting fix.","May 30, 2015","true","41.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

It packs just the right amount of horror and story to keep you interested, with just the right mood to keep you clicking along. The story is rife with a number of twists, surprises, and yes, sometimes, scares, though for the most part the scares aren't of the jumpscare variety.\n\nI will say though that this point and click game is not for everyone. The black-and-white aesthetic is hit and miss when it comes to graphic capability, but that's the design choice the game runs with, and doesn't factor in as much as whether or not you find the characters or story intriguing. I won't lie, as someone who voice acts and has voice acted in at least one game on Steam, the voices leave much to be desired, and sometimes you learn details that you shouldn't have learned until later, or you never figure out the story behind a certain character or plot point. The scares are all quite decent- the ones in Harbour Cottage and especially "The Room" are particularly effective in that regard, but the game equalizes it with the fact that you're supposed to be looking for these scares, which, for the most part, are simply ghost sightings through your camera. However, capturing all the secrets the town of Saxton has to offer, unearthing all the spirits and trying to uncover all the mysteries has its own charms, especially with the myriad of subplots brought in.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Decent storyline and gameplay mechanics.\n- Nice allusions to the Dark Fall franchise, including the main character Nigel Danvers having been a character from the first game.\n- The scares, when they are effective, are very effective, even when they don't register a "jump" or "shock" value. Sometimes it's just really good at building dread or nagging suspicion.\n- The characters all have their own personalities, and while most of them are two-dimensional, they really do stand out on their own, especially in comparison to other point-and-click games.\n- The gameplay mechanics of using technologies and pseudo-sciences, old and new, to hunt down, record, or figure out how to repel ghosts is a fairly novel one.\n- Really good game length, it truly can go on for a while.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The voice acting leaves something to be desired. Especially with Nigel... pausing... during every other word... like this.\n- The characters' two-dimensionalities can be pretty apparent at times.\n- The main character sometimes can just be downright unlikable.\n- If you're into jumpscares, I can name about three that happen in this game. The rest is dread, disturbing imagery, or unnerving implications.\n- Walking around everywhere, especially since Saxton isn't the biggest place around, sometimes gets a little repetitive, and you have to complete every single task on a given day to progress to the next.\n\nAll in all, I like it. It's a wonderful horror point-and-click game, and it's got a very nice story behind it, too, with an ending that brings Twin Peaks to mind. All in all, I can't wait for the sequels, but I do know that it's just not for everybody. But if you like point and click and want a little atmospheric horror goodness in there, it's not a bad game to pick up and try out.","August 17, 2015","true","7.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The main character is a bit dense at times, "A crown. A link to the legend!", but every character in the game has their own personality and quirks.\n\nFiguring out the mysteries of Saxon through whatever means such as listening to your own EVP recordings and the peculiar stories of its inhabitants is both fun and creepy at the same time.

It is a wonderful thing.\nIt's a couple of years old, the animation isn't that great, some of the voice acting is above average.\nLet all that pull you into the game. This is how it is. This is the reality of that world\nPlay it in a darkend room. ...and keep the speakers up.\n\nI first heard about this game when I became interested in Ghost Hunting TV shows. I was hoping for a true ghost hunt game (which i would love to see happen some day). What i did get is a great point and click adventure game by Jonathan Boakes, creator of the Darkfall series. If you havent played any of his older games, check them out sometime.\nIt is so nice to see that adventure games are still making themselves known and this is one of my favorites since the golden age of  Sierra adventures.\n\nLike I said in the intro. this is fun and spooky. Not scream and run out of the room but enough to give you a good creepy feeling\nBest part for me, is that you do get ghost hunting equipment. There are areas where you get to utilize them not only to find paranormal activity but to also help solve puzzles as you continue your story.\n\nPut yourself into the shoes of the main character. Believe that you are stuck in this odd, colorless and sometimes foggy sea-side village. That is the best way to enjoy this game.\n\nI heard that ths is the beginning of a new series by Jonathan Boakes about The Crown. I am looking forward to the next.\n\nSomeone asked me if the game runs in 16:9 1920 x 1080. When I got my first widescreen monitor, the original version of the game would not adapt to it. I ended up with a stretched out version of the screen and no way to adjust for the wider screen.I would have beeen happy if i could at least have black bars on the side of the screen so the scenes didn't look squashed.\nThis version does that. The game was not made for wide screen. The steam version has a option  to maintain the aspect ratio of the game when you press start, giving you the black bars on the side. This made me very happy.\nI run it at 16:9 1920 x 1080 , put a check in the box for maintain aspect, run it at full screen and it runs great.","June 13, 2014","true","1.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

I'm not quite sure what it is.  Partly, I know, it's that they tend to be a tad pedantic with the puzzle-solving and/or just a little too ♥♥♥♥ing "clever" for the dumb-arsed likes of me, but another part of it is...I'm not sure, but I suspect there's something about the whole interface which just doesn't resonate for the most part.  With few exceptions, I'm also not that terribly fond of turn-based strategy games, so perhaps it's something to do with the unnaturally "static" natures of such games.  I won't deny for a second that most of my favourite games tend to be fairly "cinematic" in nature, and if an equivalent term could be applied to these point-and-clickers, the word "literary" perhaps springs to mind.  Certainly less visceral and "immediate" in their audio-visual thrills; perhaps even requiring a bit more "imagination" on the player's behalf, rather than just serving it all up on a silver platter to be easily consumed.\n\nThe Lost Crown is certainly anything but an "action-packed" or "fast-moving" game, at least as far as I've played it.  In fact, I think it would be safe to say that unless you find its storyline as compelling and immersive as some evidently have, it downright PLODS.  Perhaps it's very "English" in that way, I'm not sure.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing...it's certainly preferable to a Michael Bay movie, a phenomenon which is comparatively very "American", in the worst possible way.  Maybe that's the thing with point-and-click games for me...I WANT to like them, because they represent an ideal which I would like to support; that of INTELLIGENCE and TASTE, in favour of just making ♥♥♥♥ BLOW UP.  But...and I hate to say this, and I'm sure some of you will hate me for saying this...but maybe...just maybe...video games, to some extent, NEED to be about more primal things like, well, "blowing ♥♥♥♥ up".  Again, I'm not sure.  Or maybe I just feel that if you're going to indulge in what is, just like a movie, a fundamentally "audio-visual" medium, perhaps you need to take full advantage of the strengths of said medium and create a predominantly audio-visual experience.  Which, all things considered, point-and-click games basically DON'T.\n\nSome people hate these games for being so "old-school" and "retro", and basically believe the medium should have died out a good decade or two ago.  Other people LOVE these games for PRECISELY THE SAME REASONS.  I guess I'm somewhere in between, and while I appreciate the great lengths The Lost Crown has gone to to evoke an interesting atmosphere and tell a quite possibly interesting yarn - I love a great ghost story, no doubt about that - unfortunately the glacial pacing and pedantic talk-to-everyone-and-examine-absolutely-everything gameplay left me a little uninspired.  And let's not forget the main protagonist, who may look a bit like Simon Pegg but is entirely bereft of said man's charm; he's an insufferably rude, borderline belligerent ♥♥♥♥, truth be told.  I found myself constantly bemused that the other characters didn't just slap him in the face and walk the other way, the condescending little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!  Which isn't to say that I found many of the other characters terribly charming either...eccentric, yes, but not much else.  It's all just a bit...odd, and...awkward.  There's no doubt Mr Jonathan Boakes is an interesting and talented game-maker, but if he's responsible for the dialogue and/or any of the voice acting in this game, he should probably learn to be just a tad less stubbornly "independent" in his future endeavours.\n\nNone of which is to say that The Lost Crown isn't successful in being something very different and even somewhat intriguing, it's just...well, I'm only a few hours in, almost ♥♥♥♥-all has happened, and apparently the game lasts a good thirty-plus hours and has plans of being sequelized, so...sigh...I'm gonna have to opt out for now, perhaps wait 'til I age another decade or two, then come back to it in the hopes that I will have "slowed-down" enough to better appreciate the paint-peeling pace which it seems so determined to maintain.  On the other hand, should Mr Boakes ever choose to widen his horizons/lower his standards and make a full-blown "survival horror" (read: action/adventure) game, I'm there with bells on.  This just wasn't the game for me, I'm afraid.  I will, however, heartily recommend it to anyone with far more patience than I apparently possess...just don't expect a non-stop-thrills/rollercoaster-ride of a game - quite the opposite, really - and you may find much to love.  Each to their own, no accounting for tastes, etc etc, ad nauseam...\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","October 15, 2014","true","2.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The lost Crown (written by Jonathan Boakes between 2005 and late 2007 and released in 2008) of Anglia is top priority for Nigel Danvers as he battles with the paranormal to find it.</p>\n\n<p>I am not a particular fan of Point and Click Adventures or those games made in all shades of black and grey but, this Ghost Hunting Adventure had me glued to the monitor.</p>\n\n<p>It plays well in Black/White and various shades of grey with the odd spec of color. Characters became (for me) quite believable as I unravelled the many clues both readable and captured on both video and E.V.P tape.</p>\n\n<p>The clues and links match up well enough not to be that difficult that they would eventually have you pulling your hair out, and giving up on the adventure. The cut scenes are relevant and bridge gaps in the story to give it a flowing continuity (creepy continuity).</p>\n\n<p>Stealing documents from is employer Hadden Industries Nigel is on the run from company agents who lose track of him when he boards a train that has only one destination, a village called Saxton, a fictional harbour town set in the Fens of Eastern England.</p>\n\nEnjoy not just the main adventure (find the lost crown) there are two more thrown in along the way linking seamlessly to the main adventure. One of which is to help a young boy and his sister reunite with their father. Both children feel he has forsaken them (not a spoiler but enough said). I found this to be rather moving (well presented Mr Boakes).\n\nConsidering this game was released 7 years ago (2008) it still holds its head high on the list of Ghost Adventuring. The game's music and sound effects are brilliant, background music chilling and haunting, sound effects very realistic (checkout the sky later in game. Sun worshippers would call this type of Summer sky to die for) and adds a startling contrast to the shades of black and grey throughout the game.\n\nThe ghosts and paranormal entities have been lovingly created, so much so it is easy to become realistically involved as you search Saxton and its surrounding country buildings and fen for the Saxton Crown, a crown that does not want to be found this is something Nigel learns only to well as he continues doggedly to find it.\n\nFor me the only negative points in the game were few. Nigel Danvers would be one. Rather than walk Nigel floated, much like a Hovercraft. Lucy Reubans soon to become Nigel's partner in crime so to speak (ghost hunters) moves around much like a broom stick (stiff and ridged). There is a lot of ground to cover, some 30 to 40 hours of game play, so you may find yourself becoming quite annoyed at the slow pace adopted by all characters.\n\nSteam achievements was also a bit of a problem to obtain. One such problems was getting a picture of the decorative stone in the mine. I tried time and time again to get this one, but Nigel insists on taking a poor picture of it, another was the lobster in the Bear, however through trial and error and it won't defeat me I finally got it. I made repeated visits to the lobster four times one after the other.\n\nDeveloped and written by Jonathan Boakes, author of Dark Fall: The Journal and Dark Fall 2: Lights Out, was released in 2008 and can now (2015) be purchased from Steam price £6.99 (at time of posting).\n\nIf like me you can appreciate more than one Genre of game play buy it even if you are an avid player of RPG's give it a try or wait until it becomes amongst one of many cut price games on Steam, and purchase it.\n\nMe... I am a dedicated RPG fan known to sometimes play First Person Shooters, MMO's and Multi-Player Games. I found this game to be a refreshing change and I will keep my eyes open for Mr Boakes next release... May the force be with you.","March 17, 2015","true","121.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A long, immersive, engrossing tale of hauntings and ghostly encounters it should appeal well to fans of MR James and the kind of lo-fi ghostly horror that British TV used to excel at such as the BBC Ghost stories at Christmas, West Country Tales, and the old Hammer House of Horror and the like.\n\nIt's certainly not without it's flaws for sure; the voice acting is beyond hammy, the animations are wooden (although they are as good as needs be for this kind of game) and to be blunt the main protagonist is rude, sarcastic and generally a bit of a d*ck - he'd certainly get a good punch on the nose if he approached people like that in real life!\n\nAfter awhile however I found this added to the games charm rather from detracting from the experience and the lead character does grow on you as the game progresses.\n\nThe use of photographed backdrops of a quaint seaside village and the surrounding countryside are also quite stunning and again add to the games unique charm.\n\nIt's certainly, for the most part about as scary as someone in a white sheet going "woooo!" but this isn't about Silent Hill-esque psychological terrors and perverted demons of the mind, rather a quaint, pleasantly hokey and quintessentially English take on ghost hunting (and it it did have a few moments which were actually quite chilling, cat lovers beware!)\n\nOh and the nutter in the antique shop is bloody hilarious!

If you like point and click puzzlers then this is one worth checking out. It's decently long and has an intriguing story that is well structured and gradually unfolds as you progress.\nI admit a soft spot for games and puzzles based on history and archaeology and this game weaves those in along with the ghosts and mythology. The puzzles are varied and while all the info you need is given within the game you might find yourself checking a walkthrough at some points (my downfall was the music puzzle as I'm tone deaf and don't play any instruments!)

I completed the game in full prior to the Steam release.)\n\nThe Lost Crown is the pinnacle of modern adventure games, without question. The length alone is simply staggering, clocking in at around 30 hours(maybe a bit less now dialogue skipping is in). Unlike most of the genre you can't simply breeze through it in an evening of playing.\n\nUnfortunately as with many indie games, sometimes the limited budget shows through. Character models are sub par for today, though fortunately the backgrounds are stunning as they are photographic and wonderfully done. Voice acting is perhaps the weakest aspect of the game, with the inexperience of the actors being plain as day--a problem shared by many of Boakes's games unfortunately.\n\nStorywise, it is hard to touch the depth of Boakes's writing. He puts more dialogue and written material into his games than most AAA even dream of. And while the ending of the Lost Crown certainly leaves much open, that is understandable as it is only the start of the series(which is itself a spin-off of Dark Fall).\n\nFor fans of the adventure genre, supernatural mysteries, or horror games there are few titles that I could recommend more.","December 12, 2014","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately the voice work turns out to be very disapointing in its delivery. As well as a lot of the scripted lines characters say to be eye-rolling at times.

The worst of which is centered around the main character Nigel Danvers. Who is voiced, written and modeled after the games creator Jonathan Boakes. This makes the poor voice direction all the more baffling. Under the guise of going for an eerie atmosphere the people ramble nonsense and the "conversations" as they were are mostly just two people taking turns saying things with little regard for the presense of the other person. In that it all feels very poorly directed and out of place.\nThe biggest villain in this regard is the main charachter Nigel. His stiff delivery and ability to make you utterly loathe him is uncanny. There are many instances in which it seems the person speaking the line had no idea of the context of said line in the game. It's bad.\n\nThe game itself is a fairly standard point and click. With weird floaty and painfully slow animations. As well as ♥♥♥♥-backwards puzzle logic. There are many instances where you know exactly what you need to do, but they game won't let you do it because you have to click everything in one very certain order at specific times.\n\n","September 12, 2015","false","23.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"

They are absolutely HORRID, especially the main character's. It sounds like every word or short bit of sentence was recorded separately, each with their own unrelated pitch and tone, and then put back together like some sort of auditory Frankenstein. It sounds like: "I. *DO* not... want? TO!! play-this-game". Makes me cringe just to think about it (maybe that's where the "horror" tag came from?)\n\nSecondly, the slowness of the game droves me crazy. Yes, we can double-click to quickly enter another scene, but the main character will still glide very slowly into the next scene, and do every action at a snail's pace. I've wanted to kick him in the shins so many times.\n\nI did like the graphical style and the story line was initially intriguing, but it moved along way too slowly for my taste.

You get pulled into a rather misterious and intriguing story, getting fed hints by tiny snippets but left guessing for more.\n\nThen, when you get the tools of the trade, it gets even better, if you don't count that the first few encounters are railroading you in totally un-obvious ways, like audial clue not just not giving you audial results, but not even allowing you to attempt to get them, and vice versa. This quickly passes, though, and it gets really fun.\n\n... If you manage to forget the main character's main and only motivation being obsession with finding some treasure he didn't even know existed the day before. But he still delves into ghosthunting with passion.\n\n... Then, half the game through, you are suddenly forced to lose all interest in hunting the supernatural outside the two main ghost stories and little threads. Suddenly, your equipment doesn't react a all to a full-fledged pocket of ghostly life,  letting you take it for real, and even when you learn that these people are LONG dead, the ONLY reaction is kinda "hmm". Another such pocket, again, doesn't show any reaction from your equipment, but you are shown to recognize it as such and even acknowledge by telling so to ghosts involved -- but don't (and can't) do ♥♥♥♥. Just interact with them as if it's absolutely normal.\n\nAnd then you stumble onto the real mood killers. Suddenly, the story flips over from being on the edge of supernatural to full fledged antique precursor spaceship visit (not literally, but it feels that way -- advanced technology, airlocks, elevators, etc, which would be at home in Assassin's Creed series).\n\nThe pinecone on top (those who played the game to the above point will understand the pun) was some little details like game designers making a puzzle based on Moon phases, but totally having no first idea about them. Waning Moon in England, it being located in Northern Hemisphere, looks like (, not like ), which is waxing Moon.\n\nAnd as I already mentioned tangentially, there are too many side stories which are, for absolutely unexplicable reason, not followed and dealt with in an absolutely nonsensical way.\n\nA few game-breaking bugs (thankfully, random) like getting stuck with no actions available and not even an option to load a game or even quit besides terminating the process don't help.\n\nSo... Overall, it would have been good game. IF.\n\nBe warned. You're in for a MAJOR change in style and genre about mid-game.","November 30, 2014","false","17.6"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

But I overlooked that in favor of giving this game a fair shake. I should have trusted my gut from the start and stopped playing.\n\nAfter the intro lets up you find yourself in control of Nigel Danvers of whom the hilariously corny "villain" and "hired goon" spoke of earlier. You, as Nigel, have very little option but to speak with the 'Station Master' on the platform where you'll be spoken to like a right ♥♥♥♥♥ and given quite unhelpful information about where you are and a jolly shot in the mouth because, guess what, you're stranded here because apparently no one at the train station told you that you weren't going to be able to reach your destination, which was very much not where you ended up, because the train, apparently, doesn't go further due to seasonal flooding...which is something you'd expect to be informed of when you bought your ticket to begin with. [Plot hole or just lazy writing? My vote is on extremely lazy writing.]\n\nBut not to worry, Mr. Danvers! There's a little town within walking distance across a marsh and through a very dank, dark, and quite unsafe cave!\n\nWhen you do reach the town you're going to spend a terribly long time just clicking on random things that have absolutely no value to you whatsoever, having inane (and poorly voiced) conversations with random people, and being condecended to by just about everyone in town who knows exactly who you are, why you're here, and seem to have gotten their dialoge from a Vague & Mysterious'  2 for 1 special.\n\nTwenty minutes in and I was no only completely bored but actively wishing I could set Mr. Danvers and/or the town on fire so there would actually be SOMETHING to get emotional over; this game does very little to endear you to the supposed protagonist nor the townsfolk of which you're forced to ineract with. It's all rather a tedious experience.\n\nThis is NOT a game for anyone that's looking for an engrossing dark mystery. This isn't even a game for anyone looking to waste time with. It's just a mess.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason but I do actively encourage people to form their own opinion...just please watch youtube videos of gameplay or something first because it's not something you should waste your money on even if it's currently (during the winter sale) cheap.","December 24, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","0"

I really can't. The voice acting is just terrible. The player character moves at a very slow pace to the point where you have to double click everywhere just to make any progress whatsoever. There are a lot of pointless things to investigate. The number of times I've examined areas closely to see what's there only to find that there is nothing for me to actually look at or pick up really gets old fast. In a point and click adventure game, pointless areas only make the game tedious and boring because you have to investigate everything to make sure you don't miss something important, only to find many points of no interest.\n\nThe premise of the game isn't bad. I actually would have liked to see how the story played out, but I just can't sit through this game for that long. It's far too slow.\n\nBut hey. At least I got a few Steam Cards out of it.","April 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

This game has none of that. Its black and white, terrible blocky graphics, resolution doesn't scale so its a small box on the screen and hard to tell what all there is in each scene. No easy way to see what's interactable. You have to make sure you find every little picture or scrap of paper and do every single thing possible in all the branching paths before you can move along, so you basically need a walkthrough so you don't get stuck and waste tons of time. You move super slowly. The game is just boring and not interesting. Apparently it gets more interesting later but I don't want to spend 20-30 hours that it takes to see it get interesting. Voice acting is awful. No skippable cutscenes. Your guy moves like a derp and just floats around without walking like a human and touching the ground. Options are not available in the game menu. I know all the adventure tryhards that spent 10 hours pixel hunting and got into the story will disagree, and down vote this as they have to everyone else talking about how boring this game is, but I don't care. This game gets a big "or nah" 3/10.","May 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

Was reluctant to purchase it but since the reviews was so overwhelmingly positive I decided to purchase it. Do I like it? No! For me the gameplay is much to slow - compared to other point a click games. The voice acting is awful to say the least. But what must be the most annoying aspect of this game is the fact that it doesn't support 16:9. I have this ridiculous stretched out “box” (if I choose the maintain aspect ratio option), or if I choose the “use desktop resolution” option it gets even more ridiculous since I have this small “box” in the middle of the screen. I should have gone with my instinct … but now it’s forever to late and I have another title in my collection that’s not worth the price and I will most likely never again play.

The Lost Crown gains bragging rights for being a game that is not big on graphics, but it has sustances.  You play as Nigel Danvers, on the run from Hadden Corporation after witnessing some of their technological hardware, which apparently is illegal by their standards.  Danvers then enters a train that takes him to the Sedgemarsh Station which leads to the shady harbor town of Saxton.  Thankfully, Nigel discovers the town is riddled in mystery of the paranormal and is even helped by Hadden using ghost hunting equipment to discover the towns ancient treasure The Saxton Crown.  So, as the player you control Nigel to explore the town, talk to people and solve puzzles.  What I like is that the game will give you a chime once the puzzle is met.  Also, certain actions and cutscense will play unless you solve certain puzzles, like before Nigel goes to bed, he must place the camera on the window sill before going to sleep in order to continue.  This is good idea and little things like these help with the games creepy atmosphere.  Yes, creepy is a great word to put in this perspective.  I am also glad that there are no jump scares, unlike FNAF, the presence of scary looms over you and watches you from shadows, until it scares you.\n\nUsing the tools are great as well.  You have many things to work with such as tape recorders to here EVP, a camera to take pictures for both scenery and the paranormal, a E.M.F. Meter to find powerful forces, and a Night Vision Camcorder to see in the dark and record movement.  The harbor town of Saxton is like a small dream come true and I do enjoy the ambience this game has.  It has calm quiet moments that enjoy the scenery, and there are times on where it will scare you.  I recommend to anyone if their are interested into ghost hunting and reading a huge story.  As always if you don't like it, you don't, but if you want to explore the curious side of things, I highly recommend you pick this one up.","June 5","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
