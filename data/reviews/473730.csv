BUT... right now there seem to only be 10 puzzles so it took about 5 min to complete them all, actually it took less than 5min but steam requires 5min of game play to review. :(  dont be fooled by the 10hrs+ the game refuses to close when you press exit (it still runs in the back ground) I cant even seem to kill it with task manager as its not listed in the processes as "Physic Monster" The two "positive" reviews are obviously the Developer or their friends or family. This should be free in its current state because I feel ripped of even at the $1 price!","June 1","false","11.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
