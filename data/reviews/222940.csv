Music is really nice, characters are fleshed out (No overpowered or underpowered crap except for the boss but thats to be expected for a SNK fighter), and a nice throwback to the older KoF games while maintaining modern graphics (Not 3D rendered graphics mind you). Customizable fighters is a plus although you don't do like in Soul Calibur or Tekken, you just change color palettes but I'm sure you'll come up with some good ideas.\n\nOverall, props to SNK for puttin this game to Steam. Heres hoping to see more of their titles here in the future.","November 13, 2013","true","35.4"," 140 of 150 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","140","150","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/recommended/222940/","AncientPancakes","AncientPancakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/","61 products in account","Good evening.\n\nPlaying King of Fighters 13 is more enjoyable than eating a grape-flavored popsicle on a scorching 200¬∞F saturday afternoon.  If you think I'm joking then try it out for yourself.  Once you do, you'll quickly realize the errors of your ways, and that this is one of the best fighting games available.\n\nLet me begin by saying that this fighter is not an easy one to learn.  For those who aren't used to playing fighting games, special move inputs can be difficult, combos can be difficult, understanding what is even happening can be difficult.  But the reward of learning this game and pulling off super saucy cream dream HD combos is vast and satisfying.  It is a feeling that is similar to what we feel when we viciously chew on a crispy strip of bacon.  I'm sure you all get what I'm saying.\n\nThe cast of characters is FANTASTIC. Most of the great KOF classics like Terry Bogard, K', Iori Yagami, and Ryo Sakazaki return, so long-time SNK fans will be pleased.  The visuals are MAGNIFICIENT.  They have chosen to stick with the 2-D sprite style which looks ultra sick nasty, and some of the special moves just look crazy godlike.  Hitting opponents with the POWAH GEYSAH gives me one of the greatest feelings that a man could pursue.  And don't even get me started on the musical greatness that KOF13 features.  The characters, visuals, and music are all top-notch godlike, of this I can assure you.\n\nI've played a decent amount of online matches and I am happy to say that it runs great.  Even though I suck at this game and got my buttocks kicked in almost all my matches, lag had nothing to do with it and I had a jolly time mashing out attacks.  If playing against others isn't your thing, then there are other modes like Time Attack, Survival, Story Mode, Arcade Mode, and color customization that can keep you busy for quite a while.\n\nTo conclude, if you aren't familiar with fighting games, then you may want to pass on KOF13. The learning curve is steep and you might quit once you find out that you suck at life.  But for fighting game veterans this game is like a sacred treasure trove of award-winning, swedish barnacle balls just waiting to be devoured.  Don't pass up on it or you will feel the wrath.\n\nI give King of Fighters 13 a score of "Back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest Champion".  Thank you for reading this review.","October 23, 2014","true","63.3"," 127 of 140 people (91%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","91","127","140","32","3"

Whether it be due to its stubbornness to stick on the Neo Geo arcade machine architecture until 2003, the usage of 24-bit graphic sprites until its twelfth numerical entry in the series, or the stronger anime influence on the series than the genre's most famous franchises, The King of Fighters is a series that is highly underrated and deserves much more praise than it gets.\n\nWhereas the series is notable for experimenting with new gameplay engine mechanics, The King of Fighters XIII opts to lift the most popular gameplay elements from the fan favorite entries, The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighter 2002, and marries them to the high quality sprite designs introduced with The King of Fighters XII, making for one of the greatest entries in the series. The game's 36 character roster hosts all the franchise staple characters and a good amount of fan favorites, which provide a large amount of variety in character playstyles to choose from so you are bound to find a character that will suit any style of player. The game also sports one the most robust amount of options seen in a 2-D fighting game ranging from an in-depth tutorial, arcade mode, story mode, challenge modes, online multiplayer, and even a custom character color editor for personalizing your favorite characters.\n\nWhat makes Steam Edition different from the console version of the game is that it includes the three DLC characters into the base package and sports the refined balancing from Japanese arcade only revision of the game "The King of Fighters XIII Climax". Also, while the netcode is vastly improved over its console counterpart, the features present for online multiplayer are the same. The game does not feature any sort of lobby system nor does it allow you to browse replays or spectate other players matches. These aren't really a deal breaker but the lack of them is a real shame.\n\nIf you are looking for a game in the series for a good first impression or are just looking for one of the fighting game greats from the seventh console generation of games, you cannot do very much better than The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition.","June 6, 2014","true","9.6"," 118 of 130 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","118","130","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sny83/recommended/222940/","sny83","sny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sny83/","62 products in account","The most balanced fighting game of this generation and - once you get the hang of the game mechanics - the most exhilarating one to play as well. Characters share a basic set of offensive and defensive moves that allow you to escape or overcome any situation at any time with the proper read, unlike other popular 2D fighting games where you're sometimes doomed to die in certain situations.\n\nThe game also differs from most of its contemporary counterparts in that offense is almost always rewarded more generously than defense, discouraging turtling, full-screen keep-away and holding your ground. The fast pace and multitude of movement options also means that the emphasis on prediction is much higher than on reaction, and a general lack of inputs covering multiple options means that against similarly skilled opponents you can't rely on autopilot like you can in Capcom fighting games, making your every decision matter.\n\nIt also helps to sell the experience that the animations and sounds of special and desperation moves are impactful and convey a sense of power like no other 2D fighting game. The soundtrack full of rock tunes also fits the game very well. Last but not least, the devs working on the Steam version of the game did an admirable job with the netcode compared to console versions, making this port the best choice for players without a local offline fighting game scene.\n\nIf you look forward to being challenged by a game and you aren't intimidated by a steep learning curve, difficult controls and high risk, high reward gameplay, you can't go wrong with King of Fighters XIII.","June 22, 2014","true","541.5"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","64","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WFF-AirLancer/recommended/222940/","WFF-AirLancer","NYC AirLancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WFF-AirLancer/","37 products in account","When it comes to fighting games in North America, Capcom has always been top banana. From Street Fighter to the VS series, it's usually the Capcom games that get top billing. However, they're definitely not the only developer with a rich history of making great fighting games. Enter SNK Playmore (formerly SNK), and the King of Fighters series. Building off their previous Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series, KOF has a soon-to-be 20 year history, as it all started in '94. Does two decades of fighting game crafting experience add up to a great game, or is SNKP over the hill with their 13th entry?\n\nGameplay\n----------\nThe meat and potatoes of any fighting game. While there is a story to KOF, it's generally not what keeps the public coming back for more. Rather, if you're like most players, you'll spend the majority of your time duking it out with your rivals, either sharing a couch or through an internet connection. Local multiplayer is your standard player vs player affair, with 3v3 and 1v1 modes available. 1v1 allows both players to select one character, with which they play through multiple rounds like in most standard fighting games (aka, Street Fighter mode). It's good for when you're starting out, and learning 3 new characters at once seems a little daunting. Rather, it'll allow you to focus your time into playing and mastering one character. However, 3v3 mode is the classic King of Fighters set up, allowing each player to assemble a team of 3 separate characters to battle each other with. This is also the only mode available for online play in either Ranked or Player matches. There are also several other modes, including Time Attack, Survival, and Trial Mode, which offers a series of increasingly difficult combos for players to attempt.\n\nThe game can get fast and furious, with a hefty amount of movement options available for every character. Mastering the nuances of maneuvering your character effectively may be a somewhat daunting task for newer players, but the rewards are more than evident during gameplay. Characters can walk, run, hop, hyperhop, jump, and super jump. They can also roll, which can avoid most attacks, but are vulnerable if predicted or done at poor times.\n\nThe combo system allows for a good amount of creativity and flexibility, allowing players to come up with their own combos in training mode. The Power Meter, similar to the common super meter found in other games, is used for performing EX special moves, Desperation and EX Desperation Moves, and is necessary to perform your character's devastating NeoMAX Desperation Move. You can build differing amounts of meter depending on which character you're on. Your first character can build up to 3 stocks, the 2nd 4, and your last character can build a maximum of 5 stocks of power meter to use against your opponents. On top of that, KOF XIII introduces the "Drive Cancel" mechanic, which allows you to cancel certain special moves into other special moves using your Drive Meter. Using this mechanic, one can create very damaging and brutal combos that'll quickly drain your opponent's life bar, with each Drive Cancel costing 50% of the Drive Meter. However, to add to the combo craziness, there is also the "HD Mode" mechanic, which veteran KOF players will recognize as similar to the MAX mode from KOF 2002. HD Mode allows players to utilize the Drive Cancel mechanic freely for a certain period of time, each drive cancel costing a much smaller amount of drive meter. HD Mode also allows a character to combo certain Desperation and EX Desperation moves into their NeoMAX, otherwise known as a MAX Cancel. This allows you to create absolutely devastating combos, but only if you can manage to pull them off!\n\nOn the defensive end of things, players have the "Guard Cancel Roll," or GCAB, and "Guard Cancel Blowback," or GCCD available to them in order to help them out of sticky situations. As the name states, these moves are performed when your character is guarding, or blocking an attack from your opponent. The GCAB allows your character to perform an invincible, and unpunishable roll in either direction while blocking your opponent. Used wisely, this can be used to get out of dangerous situations, or even punish an overzealous opponent who gets too predictable by rolling out of the way of their attack sequence and striking them during their recovery. GCCD, the Guard Cancel Blowback, is an invincible attack that will knock an opponent away, giving you some breathing room and a little time to reformulate your strategy. However, if it is predicted and blocked it has a lengthy recovery, and can be punished. Each of these maneuvers costs 1 power meter, so they should be utilized only when necessary.\n\nMuch has been made of the difficulty level of this game, or rather in the difficulty of executing your characters' combos. However, these things are much exaggerated. Yes, there are some fairly difficult maneuvers to pull off, but nothing that can't be ameliorated through practice. Just as there are advanced combos that only veteran players could hope to pull off, there are still a great deal of combos that beginners and intermediate players can do with a little practice. Given the game's combo system, even players with average execution skills can do serious amounts of damage. I find that fundamental skills like spacing, good defense, and not letting your opponent get away with mistakes are far more important than who can do the longest, most damaging combo. Also, don't be discouraged if you only have a gamepad and not a fancy arcade stick. I myself have used a DualShock 3, DualShock 2, and PlayStation 1 Pad in the course of playing this game, and all have served me just fine. For proof, look at the combo videos I have! However, if you have an XBox 360 pad, you may wish to find something else, given the general awfulness of that controller's d-pad.\n\nVisuals\n-------\nMany fighting games in the modern era have switched to using 3D visuals, even 2D fighters like Street Fighter IV and Marvel vs Capcom 3 utilize 3D graphics in their games. While this approach does have several advantages, and certainly has its appeal, the old-fashioned 2D sprite work found in KOF XIII is absolutely beautiful in its own right. Done with painstaking efforts, with each character taking the equivalent of more than a year in man hours to produce, KOF's sprite work exudes a charm that most games today just can't match. While certain shortcuts are apparent (Hwa and Joe sharing the same body, for example), the passion of these characters' development is evident in their appearance. Besides, nobody complains about Street Fighter IV's Ryu and Ken pretty much having identical bodies, and that game is in 3D! The backgrounds are also gorgeous, or at least 99% of them (you'll know which one I mean when you see it). With strong colors and a great deal of fun details and cameos, they add flair to any fight.\n\nSound\n-------\nThe PS3 and XBox versions of the game came with a soundtrack, just sayin'. The music tracks in this game are all great, catchy tunes. One stand-out example in my opinion is the theme of Team K'. Each track fits their respective teams, and works well with the action on screen. If one great soundtrack wasn't enough for you, the game also allows you to use a B soundtrack through the options menu, replacing the characters' themes with ones from King of Fighters past. Classic tracks like Esaka and Geese Howard's theme make appearances. The sound effects in the game are also very effective and add to the experience. Some games' sounds are too muted, not matching the visual flair with audio that matches the excitement on screen. KOF XIII's sound effects are fine-tuned for this game, giving each punch, kick, fireball, or giant chest laser beam an oomph that few games match. (Ryo's NeoMAX for example!)\n\nLong story short: Get the game, it's really good. 100x better with friends.","December 26, 2013","true","399.4"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","43","46","0","5"

Well this is a fast-paced fighting game anyway so most likely you won't even notice it unless you're doing practice or customization or just staring at characters at select screen which have unlimited time. Not a bigt problem but could be nice it they have re-worked the whole sprites but I guess even SNK Playmore have limited development time and most likely won't even translate to additional sale and I understand them.\n\nTight control and well-balanced characters. Based on experience I can just pick random character and play it and I'd still have fun beating someone. New comers have to go through the tutorials which is oky but not good. They could have done a better job at it though.\n\nWhat is most disappointing is the lack of character rooster. I mean the rooster is huge already but the game was released in Steam last year so a character DLC would be nice but so far no news about this. It's pity that great characters such as Mary Blue, Chizuru, Shermie/Shermie Orichi, Chris/Chris Orochi, Geese, Nakoruru, Ryuji, Kyo's parody Shingo, Kasumi and so many are not featured in the game. SNK Playmore should really concentrate on this latest game and just release well-balanced characters like what Capcom does to Ultra Street Fighter IV's outfit DLCs but at a fair price.\n\nBut thank you SNK Playmore for reviving one of my favorite character Mature in this game, she's a merciless character. Mature in 96, 98, cvs2 have nice costume though :D: but this one is not bad and even her stance is well-suited considering she uses claw technique.\n\nOne of the things I miss most is the concept character artworks featured in the past games. Browsing through the whole artwork gallery is fun just to see concept characters that didn't make the cut and also some very funny and hilarious artworks like the one with Iori Yagami holding a mallet with the attempt to drive a stake to Kyo's poster with Kyo standing not far and shivering cold(? I might be wrong in this since I haven't played any KOF games for a long time so let me play the old game and see if I can fetch this particular artwork).

If you've rumbled with friends and foes in the version that appeared on last-generation consoles, you'll feel right at home here: the intricate combat mechanics, gorgeous graphics, and uptempo music are successfully ported over to this Steam port. Even better, The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition contains all the console DLC, the King of Fighters XIII: Climax arcade features, and PC-centric graphics options. In short, The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition is an excellent title, but a few problems keep it from KO'ing the fighting game king, Ultra Street Fighter IV.\n\nThe King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition isn't for the faint of heart. Casual fighting game fans will enjoy executing basics and supers, but those who are willing to spend significant time in the digital dojo are the ones who will make the most of the game's complex combat system. That's true of all fighters, save for the incredibly basic Divekick, but in order to truly get good, you'll need to learn, and properly implement, cancels.\n\nCancels‚ÄîDrive Cancels, Hyperdrive Cancels, and Super Cancels‚Äîlet you quickly exit a move and input another to unleash ungodly combos and big damage. These cancels are governed by each fighter's Hyperdrive Gauge, which fills as you land, block, and take hits. Depending on the cancel needed, you'll consume between 50 percent to 100 percent of the Hyperdrive Gauge‚Äîso cancel with prejudice.\n\nThe King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition has many defensive options that help you avoid or mitigate damage. Rolls let you quickly evade attacks. Short hops allow you to avoid footsie attacks without leaving yourself exposed to a possible anti-air attack. CD Blowback Attacks costs meter, but they let you quickly counter a move when you're in block stun. It's essential to master these excellent moves to get yourself out of sticky situations.\n\nThe King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition's graphics impress in a manner that few modern 2D fighting games can match, as it balances silky animation with a ruggedness that fits a fighting game. Guilty Gear's visuals are beautiful, but overly polished. Ultra Street Fighter IV's polygons are lovely, but lack soul. The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition, on the other hand, drips in colorful, expertly shaded pixel love. Its graphics may not match Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike's insane-to-the-point-of-distraction animation, but what's there is absolutely stunning.\n\nWhat isn't quite as attractive is The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition's netcode, which is decent at best. Lag appeared in many of my online matches, though in varying degrees. Sometimes the lag appeared for a second or so; at other times, it impacted my ability to beast an opponent.

I have no controller/stick, just a plain old keyboard.\nAfter 30+ hours it has been quite a trip learning myself this game from scratch using a keyboard.\nWhy did I stay? Because the game is awesome and here is why:\n\nFirst of all, the game is stylish and colourful, the aesthetic is nice yet not over the top. The animations are fluid as you'd expect from a decent 2D fighter, and effects are beautiful.\nCharacter design is different from the usual designs. Some sprites have their flaws (yuri's big head) (shen's long neck) but these make all characters feel unique except for Ralph and Clark who share the same legs.\nDifferent body types, different colours and PLENTY of colours to choose from to customize your favorite characters.\n\nThe gameplay is difficult, in-depht and there is always something to learn.\nPulling off the moves, combos and all these CANCELS CAN GET SO HARD.  SO MANY CANCELS.\nOne neat feature of this game is the Hyperdrive, allowing you to cancel special moves into others or even bigger moves, allowing you to extend an already awesome combo. Half a bar allows for one ''Drive'' or ''Super'' cancel.\nA full bar means you can go into HD mode and just unleash unlimited cancels for a short amount of time.\nThe game in general is fast and requires quick-thinking with plenty of room for punishments.\nWith all these features added the game becomes quite execuction heavy the more skilled you become.\n\nAs I said, there is always something learn. The roster is diverse with 30+ characters each with their own set of moves and possible combos. For the characters you want to master you can always sharpen your skills, making sure you don't drop the combo and just unleash hell whenever you desire.\n\nAs for my negatives:\n-The netcode. It's good, but only when you find someone close-by to fight with. Getting a friend to play this with you is recommended. In random matches, try to stick to either a 3-latency or 4-latency.\n- A minor complaint would be that the pixels showing themselves. Mind that this is a game that got released in 2011. You might or might not be ticked off by this.\n- If you own a HDD that can hold more than 1 tb, you're going to have some technical issues if you install it on that HDD.\nTo avoid them, try installing the game on a cheap let's say... 256 GB drive.\n\nThanks for reading my review :)","January 9, 2015","true","144.9"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

All the usual suspects are here. However, for beginners, you have got a bit of a mountain to climb. This game is a sequel of sequels in the purest sense, in that it expects you to already have played a previous version of KOF. There is a tutorial, which does help, but you have to play and practise alot to get to grips with the true depth of this game. And the tutorial does a pretty lame job of introducing you to the very advanced fighting system. But that said, you can still enjoy it as a casual fighter.\n\nThis game has some of the finest 2d graphics and animation, with cut-screens looking like anime. The character spries move flawlessly and look so much better than they ever did on the mighty NeoGeo (that does include Mai and her bouncing....errrm distractions). However, the graphics options are limited, as are the available resolutions.\n\nSo to the game play. The fighting system, as I stated before is very advanced. And this has translated well into the Steam version (unusual as most Japanese ports from console/aracde to PC general suck noodles). It is recommended that you get a very good joystick or joypad to enable you to pull off the specials. Also, as this is a team battle, you need to gain skills for not just one character, but three as you are involved in 3x3 battles. This adds to the learning curve if you a noob.\n\nAll-in-all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's migration to the PC has been handled very well by SNK-Playmore. A welcome game on the PC that so sorely needs more fighting games. Buy it now!!!","December 26, 2013","true","4.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

The in-game art is anime-y, but not "moe", thus managing to look pleasant to the eye. Character illustrations and cutscenes are all skillfuly drawn, reminiscent of KoF XI's in-game art.\n\nBut, since it is a competitive game, the gameplay is the most important part:\n\nMore fast-paced than other fighting games, such as Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, KoF XIII delivers by moving back to the series' roots, with its gameplay most reminiscent of entries like as '98, while managing to fit in complex elements from '02 and XI. All of the 30+ characters are very well balanced (though not as much as in '98), fun to use and each with unique movesets and seemingly endless combo capabilities, feat managed by the inclusion of a cancel system, which allows multiple unchainable moves to be used one after another in a combo. NEO MAX moves make an appearance, reminiscent of '02s most devastating moves. The system is fluid, the hitboxes are okay for the most part, and the roll and hop systems give the game more dynamism as opposed to its competitors. Projectiles though seem to have been buffed from XI, giving them more potential not only for zoning, but also for their offensive and hard to counter nature (for some characters, such as Robert and Kensou).\nIt takes a lot of time to get used and good at the system, and for newcomers to the genre I wouldn't recommend this game, but to veterans that are looking for challenge and a deep and complex game, this game might just be for you. The netcode is vastly improved compared to the console versions, but can still be unsatisfactory at times. I am still waiting for a matchmaking feature that pits players of the same rank, and a spectator mode.\n\nOverall - 9/10","February 25, 2014","true","412.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

However, I admit that the original price is really pricey. So I recommend you wait for the sale again. =D Okay, into the review!\n\nFirst of all, just like what I wrote on my review written on the 5th of March 2015: If you love high skill cap fighting games, buy this\nVERY HIGH SKILL!!\n\nThis is really true.\nThis game is not like Tekken. In Tekken you can juggle(do some combos while your enemy is in mid-air) easily. It's easy to land attacks when you launch them into the air. However, this game doesn't work like that. At first I found the command list very small and limited. No 10 hit combos (like Tekken) but as soon as I explored the game a little more, there is a mode called "Mission" in the main menu. And in that mode, there is a sub-mode called "Trial" that, ladies and gentlemen, is where I learned how to combo.\nHowever, I want to warn you again that this game is high skill cap and some combos are very frustrating; you'll end up making your own.\nThat's not a bad thing!\nIt also took me a while to fully understand the game's mechanics like EX moves and such.\nIt was fun :D I really love this game.\nThe only con is that only a few play online(maybe in my region only). But I don't really care, as I have to controllers to play on LAN. Oh!

Thanks to versatile and powerful movement option and clean game play, players can easily start the game without thinking concept such as linking or set up.\n\nCombo is mostly direct and there is many combo that can be done with What You See Is What You Get without complex timing issue. With systemic assist such as button holding, short cuts, and longer registration -early input- kicking in even you don't realize they're helping you to remove pesky timing errors in combos you can perform.\n\nWhile it is KOF XIII's Trial mode is indeed considered as hardest trial mode in all fighting game and that's true - But never be afraid, you don't need them, and with Drive / Hyper drive cancel system you can enjoy making your own combo in practice and use them actively.\n\nIf you're just in to enjoy playing fighting game with small group, or single and practice mode. You're in for treat. If you're in competitive play, KOF XIII will provide you with honest choice of any character being able to dominate opponent regardless what character they have picked.\n\nNetcode wise, KOF XIII Steam Edition relies heavily on player's computer spec, meaning lacking certain capability in processor, etc can actually actively effect net code and slow down both player from playing it. However, there is usually good chance to find someone you can play or teach you as fan bases of KOF series are very dedicated to this game.\n\nIf you're a fighting game fan, don't wait to pick this up. Even you're not, you might check it out when there is discount going around. With multiple innovative, unique and lovable characters and fascinating move, great sound track that captivated Asian Game Communities since 1994. You will find something you will like.","September 1, 2013","true","551.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

(TERRY BOGARD FTW)\n-great fighting system.\n-possibility of changing one's favorite fighter's colours.\n-nice story, even though not the best one yet. (Geese saga is still the top one)\n\nin the middle:\n-might be pretty hard at some points of the arcade. This can be a flaw or a strong point depending on the player (I consider it a strong point, personally). If you're having trouble getting over a certain stage the game offers you to give the CPU a malus or a bonus to your fighters.

WHICH I NO LONGER OWN WHICH IS WHY IM PLAYING THIS.\n\nI'll be honest, about 50 people play this game now, youll be lucky to get about 10 matches in an hour. The netcode is pretty bad unless you have godlike internet on both ends, me personally, i have amazing internet and i struggle dealings with other people's connection being straight ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Everybody spams the same combos online and if they lose they go EX Takuma, Kim, and Maxima (Because Lag + Super Armor = easy wins)\n\nBut playing with friends on a solid connection is amazing, fast and complex gameplay not intended for beginers to grasp. If i can compare this to any other fighting game it would be Melee, its simple enough where beginners can play but with a LARGE skill gap between the casuals and the competetive scene. I highly suggest playing with a sick or a pad or just anything other than a keyboard because this isnt Street Fighter with its simple inputs. This game has inputs that require you to press about 3-6 keys at once (Another reason to play on Pad/Stick) and the command window is much smaller, HD combos are demanding and precise and its all together just cut throat make or break KoF action weve seen since '94\n\nAND THIS GAME HAS THE RETURN OF 100% COMBOS THAT DONT TAKE FOREVER TO DO, QUICK AND EASY 100% KILLS FOR THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.\n\nGraphics are amazing, the option to listen to the KoF XI soundtrack was a good choice, the game is "balanced" (AKA theres more than 5 top teirs you can play as so theres variety when you play online, although most people will go top 3 if they lose because theyre salty)\n\nId give this game a 9/10. Its a near perfect game with a lack luster netcode and and an even worse online scene.

I'm not saying its the funniest, the most important, the one with best graphics, no. Then why do i say it's the ultimate? It's all about the gameplay. If you've ever played any KOF before, you know it's not a friendly game. But if you know how to play it, know the basic combos and the special moves, you can kick ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• at any other game, for sure. When i get in the arcades and play SF (any version) i kick massive loads of butt, excepting when the pros come. Guilty gear? piece of cake. UMVC? are you kidding? heck, even in blazblue i've kicked ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with my first coin, and i barely know that game. I've just bought Skullgirls and i kick some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• there too, but not as much as the other games. So think, it's a game that's been refined for 13 times, its fast, has great combos, some of the best 2d art (the best in my opinion) and tunes you up for every other game. Even tekken lol.

You are expected to know all the names and backgrounds already.\n-Limited resolution setttings\n-Uneven difficulty progression.\n-Could really use a key rebind for menu pageup and pagedown\n\nThe game runs very smoothly on my J-series intel [2GHz] + 820M setup.  The tutorial mode is nowhere near the skullgirls level, but the practice mode is good [easy access to command list].   The Story mode is like a choose-your-own-adventure which is fun, but for someone who is new, I struggled to put a face to the speaker, often not knowing who                                                        was talking until the frame scanned to the other side at the end of the scene.  Also my major gripe is with the difficulty spike at the end.  I can clear out story mode with ease, often using only one character per fight, yet the final boss will get perfect matches against me.  Yes, it will make his defeat more rewarding, but it cheapens the rest of the fights.  I like Street Fighters progression more, where each fight is more difficult than the last, so that I can better gauge how well I am improving with a character.\n\nAside form all that, the game is really fun.  The fighting is solid and the variety of approaches to the story mode give it some replay value for people like me who like to know character backgrounds.\n\nI have not tried online multiplayer mode, and wont until I have stable internet.","January 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played KOF 97 and 98 so many times. And my favorite game is KOF 98. I tried the series after 98 and I didn't like them. None of them, until this game.\n\nKof 13 is a solid game overall. And the pc version is great now. It wasn't because I read about the problems it has on forums before buying it. I recommend this game to any type of fighting game player. They will find so much content in this game that they wont find those in any other game at this time. Unique gameplay; keeping the old KOF gameplay is great, no need to change that. The graphics, backgrounds, soundtracks are all great. They complete the game like in any other kof game.\n\nI've played this game on PS3 for the first time. The online experience was so bad, I just couldn't enjoy it. I've played it for sometime then I put it aside. Before I buy the game on PC, I read that they improved the netcode while porting the game to PC. It is correct and they did a great job. Online gameplay is smooth. If you've played SF4 series on PC, you will find similar, even better online experience in this one.\n\nGame includes a  new game mechanics to make you achieve crazy combos. When you get caught to that kind of combo, you are probably done with the round. Imo it is not a good thing, even it is hard to achieve that type of combo. You need experience and very good reflexes. I loved KOF because of it's unique gameplay and forces you to think before acting. I am not saying there shouldn' be any combos but not like this, like infinite ones.\n\nAnyways overall it is a great game. If you are a dedicated, curious fighting player you will find a lot of content in this game.  And you will keep trying to master a character or a team. Where is Bluemary, Yashiro team !?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyM/recommended/222940/","FluffyM","the way bob intended","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyM/","399 products in account","There are two things I have to point out before being able to recommend KoF XIII fully.\nThe first one being technical issues: this game has issues with VSync, lack thereof, and everything surrounding game-speed. You will have to spend some time trying to set up your game so that it doesn't run too fast or too slow, but that's just a matter of combining forced VSync through your GPU's settings and fiddling with the ingame-options (fixed framerate); make sure to add "-r" (without quotes) to the launch-options for the game in Steam.\nThe second thing to point out is that this game is pretty difficult to play. If you wanted to compare KoF to Street Fighter, you'd probably have to say that where Street Fighter has tight links on buttons (plinking 1frame-links) but relatively simple motions, KoF has demanding motions (qcbhcfb and similar) but lenient input-windows for buttons. KoF also has 4 different types of jumps (hop, hyper-hop, jump, super-jump) and a huge roster of characters. All that said, here's a good YouTube-tutorial (general non-KOFXIII-specific KoF-tutorial).\n\nAs for the good things, the game being fairly difficult to get into means it's also very rewarding. Momentum plays a huge role, so the neutral game and knowing how to apply/escape pressure are very important. The netcode seems pretty good, from my experience thus far it's very close to playing offline with a good connection. The characters allow for a fairly varied approach to the game and building interesting teams (3 characters/team that fight 1v1 until you or your opponent run out of characters). Game-balance overall is generally considered pretty good; there are no complete duds on the roster, only some chars need to work harder to win. The training-mode offers most of the functionality you'd expect- could be better. The trials are meant to showcase shortcuts and be a challenge to experienced KOF players, if you try to learn the game by playing them (which can be done, theoretically), you're going to have a very bad time.\n\nTo get started I'd recommend watching the tutorial linked above, look up the bread-and-butter combos for the characters of your choice/interest on the Shoryuken.com KoF-wiki[wiki.shoryuken.com] or the Dreamcancel KoF-wiki[dreamcancel.com] or similar sites, and to maybe just jump right in and play with a fellow noob, that's always very helpful- online you'd probably get destroyed, from what I read on different forums.\n\nA very solid 2D fighter that is well worth investing into.","February 16, 2014","true","50.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And it's one heck of a game, packed with a smattering of fan favorite characters. The gang's all here - including the mysterious Ashley Simpson, the carefree Tommy Bogart, the hot-headed Corey Yamada and the ever-popular Kai Kostanza (and his leather-loving brother, Kay Apostrophe), and even that one woman with the cartoonishly oversized breasts and crippling spine problems and groan-inducing character design that serves as a painful reminder as to how gross the game industry's (as well as the gamers themselves') attitude towards women is.\n\nFeaturing several riveting modes of play, like the spine-tingling Story Mode (in which you discover the deep and complex motivations that drive these people to punch each other in the face) or Arcade Mode (in which you punch people in the face) or Time Attack mode (in which you must attack time itself) or even Online Mode (in which pro competetive EVO players hunt down beginners and mercilessly slaughter them) you will almost certainly find something to do in this game.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Poorly animated cutscenes, complete without voice acting. Discover a new style of post-modernist minimalism. Why could they not voice the scenes when the characters already have in-game voices? Like all historic artworks, this game makes you think.\n- High-resolution backgrounds to look at while you're being juggled for twenty seconds by someone who enters Novice matches for fun whenever he's not competing in EVO.\n- All characters come COMPLETE with graphics - not a single one is rendered invisible due to the artists forgetting to draw them. This alone makes the game far more balanced than some of its competitors. (We all remember the Stealth Sagat fiasco from Street of Fighters III)\n- The game has several sound effects. Everything from "Smack" to "Whomp" and even "BWOOOoOOOOOOoooOSH". You will be amazed by the variety of sounds of people getting punched.\n- It has an SNK boss.\n- Make your own color palettes. This mostly seems to involve making everyone look naked by setting all their clothing colors to skintones.\n\nFINAL SCORE:\nGraphics: 8/10 Every character is completely opaque, and the menus are all in a language.\nSound: 9/10 This game has full compatibility with ALMOST ALL brands of headphones. (Speaker support not yet in, but the devs are working on it!)\nGameplay: 7/10 It might be a bit hard - by the time you've found the sixth page, it will be very difficult to avoid Slenderman for long enough to find the last two. However, it can be done with practice.\nCharacter design: Skeezy as hell, sometimes\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 9/10","September 19, 2013","true","40.9"," 30 of 57 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","30","57","2","5"

Velison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velison/","186 products in account","A long-time popular fighting series since the golden 16-bit era.\nFrom the start of Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting games comes a popular hybrid now with 13 official titles.\n\nThe King of Fighters is what makes 2D fighting right. It's a shame that this game is overlooked by the PC community and lacks any local players online (coming from an Aussie standpoint).\n\nMore PC gamers should definitely check this game out, it's worth the while. If more attention could spread towards this game with the PC community then everyone can enjoy the KoF experience together.\n\nAnother downside aside the lack of online players is that the players you actually find are already experienced, and most opponents are from another country so the lag doesn't make up for its solid netcode. There are small communities who list their names down to make it easier to find local opponents, but it still proves difficult when wanting to play a ranked match - especially after a long wait until you find an opponent who's more skilled with well over 150 ping.\n\nAside from the internet issues and lack of community, the whole package is there. It's perfect for those hardcore and newbie fighting fans alike. If you're looking to get into fighting games then this is a MUST. Becoming skilled at this game may be complicated and scary, but the time put into it will be well worth it in the end.\nAnd, this game is part of the professional eSports scene such as EVO. So if you're planning on becoming all MLG with fighting games then KoFXIII is definitely the way to go.\n\nI recommend this for everyone, except those who aren't fond with the fighting game genre.\nIf you love games, then pick this up. Play online and let the PC community of KoFXIII grow, because it deserves a larger community for the Steam port.\nIt's a 2D fighting game as well, so you don't need a spec-heavy PC to play.","January 18, 2014","true","229.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly Kof 13 is one of those KoFs, no Duck King and the roster feels minimized. However, this is probably the best thing SNK has done in ages. The PC port is just beautiful, it lacks the high def res and animation of Blaz Blue, but it's still a really beautiful game and the resolution goes up to 1980 x 1080 although it defaulted to my TV's standard 720p 1340 res switching was easy. There's a customization mode so you can just palette swap sprites so when you go to battle, your team is customized to your liking, missions ad variety and even in arcade mode the game politely asks you to perform certian accomplishments. The game ran flawlessly on my pc, I was really impressed. Getting online and playing in this is easier than in Street Fighter IV. Oh yeah AND IT'S A KOF GAME!! Are there a few transgender lesbians around? OF COURSE! And one has super stretchy arms too! King still kicks my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• every time. Super powered school girl? Check. Oh yeah and the game also has story... and I mean like a lot of story. Every single character has a smack down talk before the battle and cut scenes even delve to a plot that's slightly intriguing. In other words KOF 13 is more well made than any other fighter I can think of on Steam. Completely worth the price of purchase, hopefully KOF becomes a staple in online games.","November 1, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the disaster that was KOF12, I had lost hope and faith in SNK PLAYMORE.  I wasnt alone. I knew a long time KOf fan, Im talking form 94 and Fatal Fury days that had quit KOF altogether after 12. I didnt blame him as when i finally played it , I felt hat I was playing a demo. That game was not KOF quality .\n\nWell I am happy to say 13 or XIII was the charm that brought sense back to the KOF world.  THe gamepplay and graphics were awsome. Loved the music as well. BUt what I really enjoyed about this game, was the story aspect of this gaming series. This series concentrated on character story first. In story. This adds depth to the game. To see Terry and KYO talk about KOF attendance was great. TO see how the womens team felt towards the Fatal Fury or Art of fighting team is priceless.  If you been playing this series since 94 or even just discovered t, you will see that certain toons actually ahve association with each other.  The fact that SNKPLAYMORE included it in the game was awsome.\n\nWill you like this game is the real question. If your a fighting game fan or even a KOF fan Im gonna say yes. A HELL YES to the KOF fan part. Warning, unlike Capcom bosses, these SN Bosses want you  to know the game inside our before challenging them. There is a reason the term SNk Boss Syndrome existed.

There is also the 1 vs. 1 fights if a player is just looking to have a couple of rounds with their best fighter.

It's nice that not everything uses your super meter anymore, too.\n\nPros:\nHD cancels.\nSupers are as flashy as ever.\nVery smoothed 2D sprites.\nSecret characters to unlock (who else does that anymore?).\nThose of you with potatoes for computers can easily play this game.\n\nCons:\nI honestly can't really think of any, except that not enough people play it.","March 10","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Considering how much I enjoyed similiar games developed by SNK/SNK Playmore (i.e. Samurai Shodown, Fatal Fury, Last Blade), I expected great things when I finally purchased my first King of Fighters game: KOF XIII for Steam.\n\nThe game's fighting mechanics are deep, the characters have distinct appearances and attacks, the controls are responsive, and - most importantly - the game is fun to play. This is especially true when you have a human opponent (or opponents) to challenge in person. Although the game features native online netplay, I have not yet tried it.\n\nWhen it comes to 2D fighters, Capcom's Street Fighter series has always been the first one I turned to. (Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike are some of my very favourite games.) Although Street Fighter IV (and its numerous updates) seemingly overshadowed the attention that KOF XIII received, I feel that KOF XIII is actually the superior game. I much prefer its (traditional) 2D models and aesthetics to those of SF4, and while the end bosses are cheap, I don't find them nearly as frustratingly cheap as SF4's Seth, who is the most annoying boss I've ever encountered in a fighting game. (He actually makes SF3's Gill seem mildly fair.)\n\nThe main reason why I prefer KOF XIII over SF4 is because SNK Playmore didn't dumb down the gameplay to give the game more appeal among less skilled players. Don't get me wrong: SF4 is a far cry from the dumbed down simplicity of Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but it's hard not to be at least a bit disappointed with the title for discarding SF3's parry system (A boon for skilled players who take risks) and replacing it with the focus attack system.\n\nIf I had to fault KOF XIII for one thing, it's that the game's backgrounds are hit and miss. Some of them are gorgeous and preserve the style of backgrounds seen in older KOF instalments, whereas others are populated with grotesque characters who seem to do nothing but eat. The contrast between these NPCs and the stylish fighters is unpleasant, and for that reason, I am generally more impressed with the backgrounds I've seen KOF installments predating KOF XIII. They're not as high-resolution as those from KOF XIII, but their style is more consistent.\n\nIf you are a fan of 2D fighting games, I highly recommend playing KOF XIII - especially if you share my sense that SF4 was a little unfulfilling.","April 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Although Street Fighter IV (and its numerous updates) seemingly overshadowed the attention that KOF XIII received, I feel that KOF XIII is actually the superior game. I much prefer its (traditional) 2D models and aesthetics to those of SF4, and while the end bosses are cheap, I don't find them nearly as frustratingly cheap as SF4's Seth, who is the most annoying boss I've ever encountered in a fighting game. (He actually makes SF3's Gill seem mildly fair.)\n\nThe main reason why I prefer KOF XIII over SF4 is because SNK Playmore didn't dumb down the gameplay to give the game more appeal among less skilled players. Don't get me wrong: SF4 is a far cry from the dumbed down simplicity of Marvel vs. Capcom 3, but it's hard not to be at least a bit disappointed with the title for discarding SF3's parry system (A boon for skilled players who take risks) and replacing it with the focus attack system.\n\nIf I had to fault KOF XIII for one thing, it's that the game's backgrounds are hit and miss. Some of them are gorgeous and preserve the style of backgrounds seen in older KOF instalments, whereas others are populated with grotesque characters who seem to do nothing but eat. The contrast between these NPCs and the stylish fighters is unpleasant, and for that reason, I am generally more impressed with the backgrounds I've seen KOF installments predating KOF XIII. They're not as high-resolution as those from KOF XIII, but their style is more consistent.\n\nIf you are a fan of 2D fighting games, I highly recommend playing KOF XIII - especially if you share my sense that SF4 was a little unfulfilling.","April 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

One of the best KoF's ever (my unbiased opinion, most people like to compare everything to 98 and 02) The roster is nice, the gameplay and mechanics are pretty godlike, and acceptable amount of modes, and a nice sound track to top it off. (i don't like the Character select screen music at all though) The difference between the steam version and the console versions is that of course you get PC settings that enhance your experience visually (higher resolutions, no anti aliasling unfortunately)  but you also get an improved netcode for online play, something that the console versions completely failed to deliver. But i'm not saying that netcode is great though, it's decent as long as you have a good connection and play people within your same state. No, really, just play people in your same state and have a solid to good connection and you'll be fine, cause the netcode is keyword decent. If you aren't dependent on playing online, and have friends/community's/ or tournaments to play it at, then this is a MUST BUY, if you are online dependent, it's still worth the purchase, just make sure when you actually do find someone online with a good connection, you make him your best  friend.

If you're starting with fighting games, start with Street Fighter, otherwise this game will overwhelm you.\n\nKoF XIII is a fast, rushdown-oriented fighting game. You need to learn hops, rolls, drive cancels and hd combos to really win against people, otherwise you will get obliterated. While it is very hard to learn, once you mastered it, an extremely balanced and awesome game awaits you!\n\nStory: Saiki tries to take over the World. OF COURSE. It's nothing special, but still fun too play.\nOnline: While the community is not that big, you can still get plenty of fights if you're playing arcade with challenging activated. Most battles are very fluid, only sometimes it will crap on you. I recommend it, but be careful: most online players are EXTREMELY powerful and will show you no mercy.\nGraphics: Very high quality sprites. While not graphically impressive like the Sprites of Skullgirls, it still looks extremely good.\nSound: Very rock and metal-ish. Gets you pumped for the next match. The Voiceacting is only in japanese, but thats probably better for this game.\n\nAll in all, KoF is a joy to play. Not easy to get into, but once you get the hang of it, the endless possibilities of combos, character-teams and more will blow you away!\n","July 28, 2014","true","222.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

KOF grants you a lot of control of your character,  and the characters are all varied nicely in body type, fighting style and gender. Backgrounds are gorgeous. Different tutorials and practice modes are available. Dialogue between characters is cute.\n\nCONS: Trials are absurdly hard, making it difficult to acquaint yourself with the moves. This is not the fan favorite, so you will not see the same community that is as passionate about KOF in the lobbies of this one. In fact, you won't find many people in the lobbies at all. There are some networking issues for when you finally do find a match. No way to view input.\n\nOVERALL: It has some gameplay and multiplayer flaws that may hold you back from having fun with it. Still, I find it to be an enjoyable installment despite its problems. It's got a great cast and is really satisfying once you find your rhythm.\n\nSCORE: 7/10","June 9, 2015","true","41.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

They played it a little too safe with the roster. Along with a safe roster they went with older character designs and movesets. The effects look really amateurish and detract from the sprite work. All the UI's look horrible with poor choice on fonts. Even the game mechanics are a step back from what King of Fighters XI offered players. It's slower paced and load screens between character changes in matches really takes away from the flow and action of the match. With that being said, the game is a huge step above King of Fighters XII.

You are combos are extended by using a rather complicated meter system. If you are new to fighting games dont pick this one up as your first since it can be very frustrating on making progress, but if you feel up to a challenge you might enjoy KOF for the greatest 2D it has always been.

It's actually better to use an anti-ghosting keyboard (most decent keyboards are anti-ghosting now). If you want to get serious though get a fightpad which are quite cheap, or even better a fightstick which are expensive sadly.\n-This game is a third of a price on other websites that sell Steam copies\n-The hardest part of this game is actually rebinding the keyboard controls so gl if you do use a keyboard\n-Music is repetitive\n-Game is good","March 7, 2015","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combo system feels really satisfying, hits feel really solid and the drive cancel system opens up a whole bunch of really interesting things.\n\nIt also has a look to it that I really enjoy. The detail in the stages is entertaining and the characters all hold themselves in their own cool little styles.\n\nOn a more cautious note, this game is a 3v3 fighter. There is no tag or assist system, but you do need to know three characters inside and out. If you can't handle that then this game is probably not for you.\n\nI've only spent a brief ammount of time with KOF XIII but I'm beginning to think it is a better game than SSFIV.","September 2, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For many classic characters they either altered their core moves (Ralf without grappling? Seriously?) or deleted them completely (Why does the Korean team have Chang and Choi replaced?).\n2. The overall performance, no matter artwork, frame rate, or on hit effect, of the game is still below what Capcom was capable of 10 years ago (CVS2, for example).\n3.

During launch they touted the netcode to be "Like playing on the same [arcade] Machine" and boy were they lying (at least in terms of american internet).\nbasically, to sum up the online, nobody plays the game anymore since this game has had a lot of stream time taken away from it by other games (i.e. this game is not even at evo 2015) and that the offline scene in America is basically non-existent. I can only reccomend this game to you if have friend(s) that have good connections that live close to you that you can play with, then maybe this version might be worth it. All I can say I am sad at the state of KOF these days because I love this franchise to death and I hope to see more KOFs in the future.

KOFXIII takes away alot from the classic style of KOF gameplay of footsies and speed in favor of boring, very long and repetitive combo's and the significance of poking and big individual hits is heavily toned down. Many characters movelists are netuered as well, leaving much to be desired.\n\nIt's also not a good game to get into if you are new to fighting games, the more complicated commands like Ranbu's and such will turn away newbie's that are only familiar with Street Fighter, and this isn't a game where you can just fireball then dp all jump-in's. It won't work.\n\nThe online play is a major mixed bag, and because of that, it's hard to get good matches.\n\nIf you really want to play KOF online, I'd suggest getting The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition or 2002 Unlimited Match. Much better KOF games than this one.","August 10, 2014","false","40.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

So i have a experience with the game, i know a lil bit about the game lore, and how some characters changed over time.\nI would not recommend buying this game, even if it is on sale, unless you are a game collector and really fanboy of the series.\nAbout the game:\n-Old teams are weak and patetic(plus most of them doesn't have their powers anymore).\n-New teams are ridiculous broken.\n-Unbalanced.\n-The story mode is something new in the series, but the lore of game, is so confusing, bad told.\n-You need to have asian blood to withstand this game.\n\nTL;DR:\nComparing to the others in the series:\nIf you have or haven't played KOF 94, i recommend doing so, play with iconic characters like Iori(kof 95+), Joe, Terry, Robert, Kim, Kyo, Ralf. Then play with the very same character over the other games to see how they evolved (kof 96-98 highly recommended), how better the game was becoming, until kof 99, which was a bit too much, with many characters remakes. Kof 2000 is a mess, play it just to say that you have played it, 2001 is joke, 2002 is ok, but isn't as good as 97 and 98. But after playing this one, 2001 feels great ! This one has nothing to do with the ones before of it. Iconic characters aren't badasses as they used to be. New characters are OP and the gameplay is awful.\nLast note:\n-Ralf in kof 98:\nHe had these abilities:\nCharge on punch - Charge on kick - A grab on kick - Rapid atk on punch - Aerial charge atk - Aerial atk - 3 unique desperate moves.\n-Ralf in this one:\nrapid atk on punch - special atk on punch - 2 desperate moves.\nWhat have they done to Ralf ? He was my favorite testosterone bomb ! Now he is a cupcake with a cherry on top of it.\nThe game had a very unique art since its beginning, a very SNK way to do it. You wont feel like this is a KoF game at all, the art is completely different.\nLets put this way: You never played KoF in your life, and you start by this one ok ? Then you play the other ones and you will see how different this one is. Its like a Lego who doesn't fit on any other Lego. Then you pick Iori and play XIII vs 98 you will see who is the king of combos.\nConclusion:\nIf i could forget about this game, i would. But i cant so i do not wish other people getting frustated as i did with this one.","October 30, 2015","false","11.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

Especially ones that are very technical. So, if you are a fan of fighting games requiring a high degree of technical proficiency, you can probably skip my review.\n\nI gave this game a fair play through. I obtained this with a bunch of other games via a Humble Bundle purchase. It wasn't part of the reason I bought the bundle, but I figured I'd at least give every game a fair shot. This game provides 7 Steam Cards for playing it as well, which is nice.\n\nHowever, grinding out those 7 cards was exceptionally painful. I only become "passably familiar" with a single character over my entire time playing this game. When I say that, I mean it's difficult even to get past the first few stages in Training!\n\nNow, it is true that this game when I first acquired it wouldn't recognize my controller at all. So, maybe it was insanely difficult to enter combinations due to it not properly supporting it or something along those lines. I can only comment on my experience.\n\nAs for the game itself, I quickly grew bored with the poorly-translated dialog which plays at the beginning of almost every fight. There was almost as much button mashing just to skip dialog as there is when playing the game! And despite the fact that they obviously made an effort to translate the game's text, there is absolutely no audio translation... which makes it very difficult to find any appeal for the characters unless you happen to speak the language. I'm assuming it is Japaneese, but that's only because I believe Japan is the largest game producer in Asia, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAfter my compaints in the translation department, you also have the art style. It's obviously an anime-style fighting game. It's even complete with the horribly sexist character models you would come to expect. I remember one of the female characters they clearly put a lot of time into making sure her breasts "jiggled" as much as possible. Maybe it was done mockingly or something, but all "personality" of the character comes through in audio... which I couldn't understand!\n\nHonestly, I do feel that there's quite a set of people who might enjoy this game, but it definitely wasn't for me. If there was a "meh" option, I would choose that instead of "not recommended," but I don't have that option.","June 15, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","6"

There was almost as much button mashing just to skip dialog as there is when playing the game! And despite the fact that they obviously made an effort to translate the game's text, there is absolutely no audio translation... which makes it very difficult to find any appeal for the characters unless you happen to speak the language. I'm assuming it is Japaneese, but that's only because I believe Japan is the largest game producer in Asia, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAfter my compaints in the translation department, you also have the art style. It's obviously an anime-style fighting game. It's even complete with the horribly sexist character models you would come to expect. I remember one of the female characters they clearly put a lot of time into making sure her breasts "jiggled" as much as possible. Maybe it was done mockingly or something, but all "personality" of the character comes through in audio... which I couldn't understand!\n\nHonestly, I do feel that there's quite a set of people who might enjoy this game, but it definitely wasn't for me. If there was a "meh" option, I would choose that instead of "not recommended," but I don't have that option.","June 15, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","4","2","6"

Actually? They're lazy to re-draw everything).  The animations don't have as much frames as they should for a 2d fighter of 2013 (Check out Skullgirls to see the difference and the like).  The gameplay feels very stiff...but worst of all for me, the jumping in this game is nuts.  KOF games have a lot of jumping involved...this one takes the cake.\n\nKing of Jumpers XIII - Air-Attacks Edition, ftw.\n\nThe netcode in this game is more stable and reliable then: MK: Komplete Edition, Injustice: Gods Among Us, Street Fighter X Tekken, Ultra Street Fighter; However, there aren't many ppl playing.  Not nearly as many encounters as Ultra Street Fighter (SSF4:AE) but more encounters then Street Fighter X Tekken (SFXT).  On par, about as many encounters as MK: Komplete Edition and Injustice, which isn't a big deal at all.  Most of the time, you'll find people from half-way across the world and have wonderful bad delay together and the game pausing while it displays a  [Synchronizing...] menu in your face.\n\nCharacter designs are hit and miss.  Some are totaly rediculous:\n- The Ikari male soldiers are blatantly on mass amounts of illegal steroids.\n- Billy Kane looks like a heroin addict in remission.\n- Joe Higashi may be Japanese, but he's suffered some weight loss fighting for his freedom in a Thai prison.\n- King is just straight up anorexic now.\n- ALL of the females are actually aging backwards, each KOF game.  Yuri, especially, is suffering from a Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\n\n\nGet RomStation.fr or Mame32K++ (or any kaillera-supported emulator) or even GGPO and emulate the earlier KOF games, for free, with (ironically) better netcode rather then buy this one on steam.  With Mame32K you can play 3 players 3 players, online...Hell you can even have 10 ppl in , 6 playing, 4 spectating or you can have a 3 player co-op or a 3 player co-op vs 1 player + 2 AIs...so much fun options.\n\nNothing like that here.  Nothing as intuitive.  Nope.  Emulated versions of KOF raised the bar for online play for me and the earlier KOF games (which I love to bits) to the point where this one falls just bellow average.","August 22, 2014","false","21.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","1"

They always use moves that freeze you solid and cannot be blocked, meaning you never get any chance to move, unless you can find a flaw in AI and keep using one move that the AI doesn't care to block.\nProblem number two, the difficulty setting doesn't seem to affect versus mode. Even at highest difficulty, the CPU opponent in versus mode is still too easy.\nProblem number three, online match sucks. I don't play well and lose most of the time, but won't it be better if the balance can be adjusted according to the players' stats. This system is there in versus mode, so why not online match mode? Because I always lose, I've lost all interest in online matches.\n\nWith the three problems, I don't want to play arcade mode because the boss is too hard and I can't finish the game; I don't want to play versus mode because CPU is too easy; and I don't want to play online match mode because I always lose. There's no point in playing anymore. Well there are still trials I can challenge, but that's about all.\n\n+ it's KoF at its best(?)\n+ combos, combos and combos\n+ story mode and collectibles\n+ free DLC\n- awful online battle\n- unfair boss battles\n6 out of 10, barely satisfying.","February 7, 2014","false","12.6"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","2"

I have mixed feelings about KoF XIII.\n\nI played this quite a while, mostly online to find worthy challengers. What I found most of the time instead where veterans, who played this game hundreds or even thousands of hours and others who play with dirty tricks, repeat unfair moves over and over or trapping you in the corner an starting an endless combo.\n\nWhile I think of me to have a settled character, I never felt a rage like this before. First I have to wait an enormous time to find another player, then you are confronted with a lv.40+ pro who eats you for breakfast. The most annoying part is you can't even refuse to fight unless you quit the game. There is no button to return to the main menu, once the game puts you together with another player!\n\nThe reason I kept playing is that once in a while you meet a guy who is about the same level as you or slightly above. Your heart is racing, you are glued to the screen. You analyse his movement, learn and beat him in the last second. That is the moment where you get the most out of it. And I am not even mad when I lose in a fair duel like this.\n\nShould I judge the game for its player base? I don't think so, but I am mad at them for a slow servers, bad ui decisions and bad player matching mechanics. At its core it is a solid 2D-fighter with nice graphics, which doesn't let me enjoy it like I want it to.","October 20, 2014","false","46.2"," 3 of 35 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","35","0","0"

I was looking for a casual beat em up on PC, and what I got was some hardcore japanese gaming. While I laughed at the silly music and the silly menus at first, I was then quickly let down. The Tutorial starts with bad explanation and some difficult combos, locking you in the arena looking for LP and LK on your XBox360 controller. The buttons are labelled in some random way in is very helpfully described in the options as "LP=Button1". Try performing 7 direction movements and a double button press without knowing which buttons to press. That is how much fun I had. The first rounds of fighting were me helplessly button mashing against some AI that fires Combo after combo while I was desperately searching the "block" button, that the AI used so well.\nAll this is from a casual fighting gamers point of view.

The music is overly loud and some tracks are better than others.  Combat itself is literally hit or miss, as I found myself punching air most of the time.  Multiple keys (or buttons on a controller) perform the same action, which can become a bit confusing at times.  The story doesn't make much sense, and the nonlinear nature means that trying to complete another section of the game can be difficult.  Intro scenes to battles are drawn out and you'll have to skip multiple times in order to fight.

There are tracks in this game that I would just sit and listen to while I do other things, its that good :).\n\nOnline play, in my experience is a little bit shaky. I was put up against players where I was lagging by a second and in a fighting game, that second really does help. This might be something that you might not have to worry about since you dont live out on the other side of the world as I do.\n\nAll in all, KOF 13 is an awesome game. Its one of those rare Fighting games where you will actually play it for more than 10 hours and still be wanting to play it.\n\nI highly recommend it!","January 26, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SNK claims that if placed on a smaller drive (such as a USB or camera card), that it should run properly (this doesn't count as proper from my viewpoint however & is unacceptable that I can't run it from a normal 4 TB SATA HDD; external drives are going to have a slower transfer rate & won't likely be sufficient for running games from if it's loading data while in game unless you enjoy stuttering in your game & that's not a good thing in an action game). At this point I am boycotting any further SNK purchases until they fix the issue.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374189077 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=374189092\n\nEDIT:  So I found a fix to the issue where the game would not run from a drive larger than 2 TBs & the simple fix as apposed to doing a legit repartition of your drive is to create a virtual drive under 2 TBs to install the game to.  The downside to this method is you need to manually mount the drive every time you start your computer (I haven't found a way to make it auto-mount on startup yet) before starting up Steam, otherwise you'll need to restart Steam after mounting the virtual drive before Steam can find it.  Considering I haven't actually played it yet, my opinion towards the game is currently neutral (however I'm leaving the review as I wouldn't recommend it because of the problem that requires a makeshift resolution like I have just stated where it should just work regardless of the drive size); I will update it later when I've had time to actually play it...","January 12, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However it still possesses enough technicality to keep hardened veterans happy, and once mastered will provide hours of beatdown joy.

I can understand why, but If you sped up the FPS limit, you can still enjoy smooth animations, while requiring frame accurate button presses.\n\nOH YEAH...THE CONTROL SETTINGS SUCK.

I also dislike the lack of extra frames to just smoothen out the animations. I can understand why, but If you sped up the FPS limit, you can still enjoy smooth animations, while requiring frame accurate button presses.\n\nOH YEAH...THE CONTROL SETTINGS SUCK. I can't change Player 2's control to the USB device, while I use the keyboard. KEYBOARD KEYS MUST BE SET BEFORE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE. This is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•!

However it still possesses enough technicality to keep hardened veterans happy, and once mastered will provide hours of beatdown joy.

KoF leaked on Steam?! I've got to check it out then, i simply have to!" .. were the first words occuring to my mind when i read the news some months ago. I was certainly very eager to get this newer version of the game since the franchise did make quite a reputation back in the days some of which can still be caught here and there within the flock of oldschool / hardcore gamers nowadays. I've ended up waiting for a few months until a decent discount would more than justify the aquisition and o boy do i feel contented now!!\nThe games basicaly works like it always has with all the evade - block - counter - Ex (?! well yeah that one is quite new to the KoF mechanics actualy!) - Fury - Deadly Fury and even the different jump manoeuvres such as big leap, tiny hops and even long/faster hops! The greatest asset of this game is to bring flashy and cartoon-like 2D graphics (set in motion by some of the best animation and framerate you'll ever get to see in one of thes fighter games!) with combat mechanics even a Tekken or Virtua Fighter wouldn't quite be able to compare to somehow! I know this quote seems to get a little more messy line after line so to sum up things and get to the point : Great visuals (if you can afford oldschool 2D themed games that is .. if you can't shame on you!), super complex yet accessible combat mechanics, quite a big rooster of fighters (even for a game like this one), quite amazing soundtrack and voiceacting (which tended to be somehow poorer in some earlier versions of the game) and as always a VERY challenging (if not too much at times!) AI .. If you like 2D fighters you will have to seriously consider putting your money into this one .. pretty much well spent!","December 22, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike those games which have mechanics specifically engineered to rewarding losing players with easy comeback chances (Ultras in SF4, X-Factor in MvC3), KOF XIII has none of that. Instead, what it offers is an incredibly solid, fast-paced, balanced and honest fighting game where victories are always earned, and the better player is always the one who wins.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that the game is significantly less beginner friendly that any other fighting game on the market, with no easy inputs and strict timing requirements for combos. Additionally, the game only teaches the basics on the guages and on universal moves, but very little on HD and how to use it for combos. Unfortunately, you'll have to experiment in the training mode or search online to learn how to use each character. There is a character trial mode included, but the difficulty ramps up extremely quickly.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning is the online play which, when playing in Australia at least, is largely hit-or-miss. Of the online matches I've played since its release, roughly 90% have been noticably laggy or worse, with matches typically feeling like you're playing underwater, and at its worst dropping completely. However on the rare 3-4 bar connections, the lag wasn't an issue at all. Your mileage will vary.","December 25, 2013","true","117.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Any KoF you pick up characters play about the same with small changes each volume.\n\nThis game however requires a lot of dedication, inputs need to be clean and on time. Doing something too fast will not be rewarded, I recommend actually seeing how SLOW you can achieve a link. Also learn buffering, you can input the motions for an attack while performing linked normals or special moves. Great for achieving desperation moves in your combos. (Example: Kyo has a desperation move that is quartercircle back half circle forward, in one of his lengthy combos you end up doing a reverse dragonpunch+lk. Instead of quartercircling back again... you can just half circle forward from the reverse dragonpunch.. the desperation move will come out)\n\nBe sure to check out this site for more basic and advanced information on the game, and each pages of information dedicated to each specific character. http://dreamcancel.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_King_of_Fighters_XIII","December 26, 2013","true","47.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Note that the Steam edition includes all 3 DLC characters you must pay extra for on the home console version.\n\nAs a fighting game in general, 13 has a rich set of features for movement, defense and offense. Someone coming from a more casual background may take a little longer to get used to the pace of the action, but rest assured that the effort is very well worth it.

It is stylish and bold with its gorgeous 2D graphics and silky smooth animations, and its fighting mechanics are tight and fast paced. The combos you see on youtube will make you question whether this game actually only uses four buttons, and yet, it is a fair game. No two characters have a matchup worse than 60/40, when played with comparable skill. Street Fighter IV has a high skill ceiling, but this game...this game doesn't know what ceiling means. Everything about it is too fluid to master completely and even the most advanced players have to play things by ear because of its unpredictability. If this appeals to you, I highly recommend. Otherwise, you're going to want to wait for Ultra Street Fighter IV, which has much more rigid terms about what is possible.

I picked up KOF as the first of three games I had in mind for this sale (skullgirls and street fighter IV being the other two), and I loved it immediately.\n\nAs a beginning step into fighting games (although I did spend a couple weeks on SFIV a while ago using a pad) I couldn't have picked a more daunting task, but really, I love it.

Using a controller or proper arcade stick is practically needed to play this even competently.\n\nKoF13 is one of the best fighters around right now, and is incredibly balanced. The technicality and risk of every character matches their reward amazingly, and you don't feel too underpowered playing anyone. The controls are tight and it feels amazing hitting your opponent with fully planned out combos. The customisation allows you to set colour palletes for any character, with new options added as you complete certain tasks with said character. Though the customisation is nothing compared to games like Soul Calibur, full control over the pallette with many colour options can give you a lot of cool possibilities.\n\nPros: Controls are great, characters are balanced, line-up is large and extensive, the art is good.\n\nCons: Considering the rewards for mastering the higher skill fighters, new players or people who aren't very good at fighters may be beaten down easily, since just cheesing it is hard in this game. Button mashing won't really help you\n\n9/10","January 2, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mostly this is due to highly technical, fast, rewarding and simply enjoyable gameplay coupled with the stunning visuals and soundtrack. You can tell that many hours were spent crafting the sprites, backgrounds and gently tweaking the hitboxes and movestes of the characters. Almost every move in every character's moveset has a use, which is testament to trimming of superfluous waste in this truly streamlined fighter. Effort was put into developing the game and it shows; most evidently in the highly balanced character roster in my opinion. Like all figting games the learning curve is steep, but because of the very technical nature of King of Fighters the execution barrier is even higher. Regardless even if one is new to the genre I can recommend it due to the extremely balanced characters, advanced mechanics and a well executed pace. As such there is a lot less frustrating nonsense that plagues many other fighters.","December 6, 2013","true","212.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simply, KoF XIII is my favourite fighting game and has bene since it came out. I'm useless at Fighting games but I love them all the same for the catharsis of mashing my controller after a long day at work but KoF XIII, even for a complete casual like me, is fantastically accessible but still has a deep core system. The arcade mode's standrad difficulty isn't as hard as the other KoF games on steam either. I can't comment on the competitive side of things becausl like I say, I'm just a casual fan, but if you've ever wanted to get into fighting games this is the one to start with in my view - an excellent cast of characters, simple to learn mechanics that will reward you the more effort you put in and some of the best graphics in any 2D fighter. It also avoids a pet peeve of mine with newer fighting games in that it doesn't have many (with the exception of a couple of Neo Max supers) overly long special moves with absurd animations - the flow is contsant and smooth throughout. The only downside if having to grind for colours for the character editor which can get tedious and it has the commin fighting game problem of not having enough music so I have to mute it to avoid oversaturating myself. But otherwise, I've bought this twice (PS3 abd Steam) and can't recommend it enough.","June 27, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a solid, high paced, fighting system that gets you hooked and a big character selection that contains variety!  You won't find characters sharing moves and each character plays at a different speed.  The game contains a tutorial that leads you through the big concepts of the game including super cancels and desperation moves.  It has a bunch of game modes like Arcade, Story, Time Attack, Score Attack, and Survival.  There are even 2 secret characters in which you can unlock in Arcade mode.  It also works great with the Xbox 360 Controller and I assume it supports other controllers as well.  This game is extremely fun and has a challenging final boss.

There are great characters, art, music, and gameplay that you'd expect from KOF's heyday. The story is alright but Story Mode is done quite well with interesting branching paths. Netcode is fairly solid as long you play people with a 3 bar connection and sometimes even 2. The skill ceiling for this game is real high and the execution required as well so there's a ton of room to grow in this game. Also, this is a real honest game in that 9.5/10 times the clearly superior player will beat the inferior one. There's few gimmicks, no comeback mechanics, and a pretty fast pace that make this game shine. I know I probably won't be even decent at this game for a long time but I don't care since I haven't had fun with a fighting game like this in a long time.","October 5, 2013","true","55.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Online play is considerably better than the 360 version in my experience. Even relatively low connections have performed pretty well in comparison. The matches I've had online have been a lot of fun, and there are some very good players out there!\n\nThe story mode is not the same or as good as the one found in Arc Sys' BlazBlue series, sadly. Its not as good as the most recent Mortal Kombat's, either. Its more of a visual novel with fighting periodically. Interesting, but not as fun as the others. Still, better than a straight arcade mode in that regard.\n\nIf you like 2d fighting games, I can't recommend this game enough. You absolutely WILL NEED a control pad or joystick, though.

I could not afford the horribly priced console, and was always one of those phantom systems everybody wanted and talked about but did not have. When I saw this game on Steam, I could not pass it up. First, the positives: Beautiful graphics, and sound that I come to expect from a SNK beat-em-up game. Lots of backdrops to choose from, and plenty of fighters that are varied (yet, like most copied some of the Capcom characters), The controls are smooth. I also love the multi-player. No lag! The downsides: The menu system is haphazard, the controller combinations can be tricky with a joypad, and the gameplay can get tedious for long stretches.

It's a very solid fighter. It does take time to learn characters, but if you really put in the time and effort it is worth it when you get to the point where you can pull off the amazing and flashy combos. In my opinion, this King of Fighters XIII is the heart of the series. All the other KOF games have led up this one. It feels great. If you are new to Fighting games, it will seem like a lot of advance stuff at first, but as i said before that if you really take the time to learn how the game works inside and out it will be one of the best fighting game experiences you will ever have. 10/10 <3","June 18, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still i like some things about it enough to play it and recommend it.  But SFIV is better.\n\nHere is what is wrong:\n\n1.  Game is too fast!  So fast that you can't actually have time to spot what they are attacking you with to react with a proper counter.  Especially since the characters are so small.. it's hard to see their little feet and hands to judge what they are hitting you with in a timely manner for you to compute this in your mind and then consider the possibilities of how to counter it.\n\n2.  Combo's drag on and on and on and on to make me fall asleep, when you're up against someone that knows the game too well and there is no way to break out of them.  This game needs "Combo Breakers"\n\n3.  When you successfully block an attack it doesn't stun the enemy to give you an opening to counter like it does it street fighter.  They can just keep combo-ing your block with a barrage of attacks and no real stun on them.  Good fighting games stun the enemy if their attack is successfully blocked so that your next move is a free hit.  Example:  In Street Fighter IV if i'm blocking low and Ryu tries to sweep me with a kick, it pushes him back and produces a stun-animation so that i can counter it with my own sweep kick to trip him that is unblockable now for him since he is stunned for a moment.  SFiv's system rewards you for successful blocks.  kofxiii does not and encourages more button mashing instead.\n\nGreat fighting games have a counter for EVERY situation!\n\n4.  I think the Blowback counter attack when blocking should cost no meter.. the cost of timing it is enough to reward you with it.  Maybe remove the cost and tighten the window for it a little more so i can freely use it when i think to use it.  I tried playing the CPU on hardest difficulty and gave infinite meter so that i could freely use this and i find it makes the gameplay much more fun and rewarding.\n\nAnother thing i do not like are the cafe and jungle stages where the humans in the background rapidly drink their tea or jump around at inhuman speeds on and endless short loop.  make the people sit still and move around slightly or get rid of them.","March 11, 2015","true","119.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike those games which have mechanics specifically engineered to rewarding losing players with easy comeback chances (Ultras in SF4, X-Factor in MvC3), KOF XIII has none of that. Instead, what it offers is an incredibly solid, fast-paced, balanced and honest fighting game where victories are always earned, and the better player is always the one who wins.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that the game is significantly less beginner friendly that any other fighting game on the market, with no easy inputs and strict timing requirements for combos. Additionally, the game only teaches the basics on the guages and on universal moves, but very little on HD and how to use it for combos. Unfortunately, you'll have to experiment in the training mode or search online to learn how to use each character. There is a character trial mode included, but the difficulty ramps up extremely quickly.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning is the online play which, when playing in Australia at least, is largely hit-or-miss. Of the online matches I've played since its release, roughly 90% have been noticably laggy or worse, with matches typically feeling like you're playing underwater, and at its worst dropping completely. However on the rare 3-4 bar connections, the lag wasn't an issue at all. Your mileage will vary.","December 25, 2013","true","117.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Presentation wise it is absolutely gorgeous. Vibrant colors, awesome characters, fluid animation, KOFXIII has this in spades.\n\nThe combat system is unlike any other fighting game I've experienced. With 3 basic ways to avoid attacks from your opponent(block, roll, blow back) you will experience very unique situations where the tide of battle can change at any moment. Though many say this is an execution heavy game, I feel it's a lot more forgiving then Street Fighter IV especially when linking normals into super moves. This gives the game a very gradual feel and rewards the player who takes the time to learn the more advanced techniques like HD combos.\n\nWhile the verdict is still out on the internet connectivity, I've had a chance to play the beta and must say as a player coming from the xbox 360 version, the steam version definitely shows a vast improvement. I played a few matches with someone in Boston(I reside in Georgia) and they were smooth. I also felt like the input was very responsive which is something that was a big issue with the KOF netcode on console ver.\n\nIf you enjoy fighting games and have never experienced King of Fighters before I implore you to try XIII. It does a great job of combing a lot of the elements from different fighting games while still keeping its own identity.\n\n","September 12, 2013","true","211.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Six hours later, my new one's analog stick's becoming loose.\n\nPainfully truthful jokes aside, this is an excellent game and worth the disposible controllers. Cast is extensive and, for the most part, each unique in their own way.\n\nControls are incredibly smooth and responsive (I'm just too rough apparently), and its fairly easy to pick up and play (i.e: button mash) but the combat and combos are really worth learning; you'll WANT to spend hours and hours in training mode to improve your skills (I'm still trying to successfully pull off a 40 hit combo with Leona I saw in some video). Is it necessary? Probably not, but it's a lot of fun to experiment and then brag to your friend who doesn't give a rat's bum about it before he goes back to talking about catgirls or whatever; I don't bother paying attention; after that 20 hit combo, I'll fight his catgirl 1v1.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and stylish; the character sprites are well detailed, the animation is great, special effects are flashy, and the backgrounds are pretty; some of the backgrounds have people watching you fight, and I swear they're on something because they move faster than a McLaren F1 with the rev limiter removed being driven by Michael Schumacher while hearing the Emerald Hill Zone music from Sonic 2 in the background.  It's hilarious.\n\nI will lastly add that I speak for single-player and local-multiplayer only. I haven't the slightest clue how well online play is.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best damn fighting games I've ever played and worth a purchase even at full price. Bring your friends, buy some spare controllers and be ready to fight; we got all night and no girlfriends.","December 19, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Would I recommend to somebody who likes fighting games? Hell yes. To somebody who has no idea what a fighting game is? Perhaps, but I'd be more likely to show them to something like Skullgirls, due to this games fairly hefty pricetag and slightly lower production value. When this goes on sale, it is a steal.\nCombat is interesting and almost every character feels unique in their own playstyle. Compared to a lot of other fighting games, the skill ceiling is intensely high, fast paced, well balanced and has one of the stronger training and tutorial mechanics for each of the fighters than almost any other fighting game out there. The Art is excellent for a sprite based system and the art assets for the story mode are definitely above average.\nHowever, compared to probably it's most close rival, skullgirls, it has some things that just don't feel up to par with it's rival. It's characters though more plentiful are less interesting, the art is still, though well produced, fairly low rez and there is a huge issue with anyone running this game at any other frame rate other than 60. Dropping it down to 30 causes slow-motion and booting it up to 120-144hz causes ridiculous fast motion gameplay.","October 4, 2014","true","46.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StyxHighwayProject/recommended/222940/","StyxHighwayProject","Mecha Carrier I.S.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StyxHighwayProject/","760 products in account","KOF games story and functionality wise have often gone in waves. Every game brings a bit of a change up to the table, but collectively there's legs of the journey. One that's often come with an interesting story that waves just a bit sharper than most fighting game tittles of such background. Capcom still can't keep a major story of how Chun Li's father died. And to think SNK use to make this KOF collection of fighters from several of their games once every year.\n\nWith the Orochi Saga leg, Nests Saga, and whatever you might call the last stretch of games through KOF 11 where they stoped giving them numbers on years and just sequal numbers, I'm not sure if we're in a SAGA, or just progressing a story that through the tournament that Rugal's children now sponsor, seemingly not being evil, another faction that seems very evil is using it toward their ends in plots that could undo Mankind as we know it. And like Jedah from the ye old DarkStalkers franchise, they seem to be a kind of re occuring evil that can go back and try again until something in a timeline changes.\n\nAnd the way they do this when all is said in done is smart as they find the best way to deal with a character many don't like that let's them finally leave the franchise, and yet also earns the character perhaps a bit more respect. Leave it to SNK to actually make a story that does some justice, and delivers a damn fine engine worthy of the tradition. It's not without a few flaws, but some of the likes come with tittles that look to recreate what they've been doing a bit.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nThe move lists are not to the hgiher counts like later in the Saga legs tittles like 98 or 2003 tended to bring, but much of the core moves known to characters are there and many with slight changes on their approaches to how they function.\n\n@#$$ I still miss Terry Bogard's "Power Dunk" move. I really #$%^ing do.\n\nThe Music is decent, but not sure I'd call it the great music styles that SNK got into back in it's earlier years that made you feel the character and situation all the further. It just lacks some of that catchy factor, but it's fitting.\n\nIf you're new to the franchise, it tells a story you can hop on right now and find some interest, but the real treat is in for people who do a little back searching into the rich story universe of SNK and how it's connected. Trust me the SNK universe is worth it, which is kind of a PRO if you're willing to do a little research.\n\nBAD AND GOOD.\n\nAnd finally I'm not sure I dig how the super bar is basically turned into two seperate bars. One is stockable and needed for your super specials, but to pull a NeoMax move, you need the top bar full too, or use that top power bar above the oragne to go into a powered up mode to so the neomax. But if you do you can in theory peform not only a special into a super special, but a Super Special into your NeoMax move. The things you can pull become a massive game changer.\n\nWhen you pull some heavy hititng stuff in SNK, you know it, and you feel it. Sometimes on the recieving end you feel it a bit much, but otherwise it feels rewarding and creats it's sense of danger. But the multi bars turn it into feeling a bit more cumbersom in requirements than at first most may like.\n\nTHE VERY GOODS\n\nMai is back. Anyone who follows SNK will know what I'm talking about. No Mai no buy as they say.\n\nThe flash and flare is there and feels like it bellongs but makes for some good wow moments. In fact the all over 2D fighter package looks good and yet not disorienting.\n\nControls are good, yet not over the top forgiving. You get what you pull, and when you figure out what you're doing wrong and get it right, you're going to know it and do plenty better as a reward for doing it right, and it will stick with you if you play semi regularly.\n\nClassic Yuri and King clothing malfunctions after special moves are back. Ask a veteran, or beat Yuri or King with a special move and up and you'll understand what I mean. Yes, it's necessairy.\n\nCombos can be impressive, but you work for them, and chances are with the team three on three broken up matches they give you good oppertunity to turn things around, and the combos aren't super over the top to the level you should just put your controller down and die like Marvel vs Capcom 3.\n\nPlay Iori in both his forms without extra DLC cost.\n\nA certain someone not only dies, they utterly get undone from the universe, and most of you will applaud how it's done.\n\nThe game simply looks as nice as it feels for someone to play, and you can get things done as a newer player or a veteran. With the way the team system works too, you really can pass the controller with a friend if you choose to team up and face the world online or the computer, or even local friends. Sometimes it dosn't need to be a tag match for it to be a good team endeavor.\n\nUnlock colors by simply playing the game to customize the character palates for quite the different looks. Maybe even put yourself in the shoes of one of the many SNK characters you really relate too. There's characters for every kind of fighting fan, make a few your own.\nWRAP UP\n\nIt's a solid game, plenty worth it's 20 dollar price tag these days, and if you'd really like to see how KOF has evolved, the tripple pack here on STEAM basically gives you the total up game play of some of the past high points of the KOF franchise. If you watch a play through of the other years to get some story, then play the wrap up leg tittle for yourself, like playing 98 witch has the best of everything non story wise from 94 to 97, or watch what happens up till the next year available on STEAM and then play that one, it can be a rather rewarding experience. Or hell, hunt down the other tittles and play them if you can. But seriously, at least peek out the story universe of the other tittles and play the leg wrap up tittles so you can feel the story as you come to understand it, even the once hidden characters that were a part of the story unfolding.\n\nWith the STEAM tripple pack, you get those wrap up milestones of the series in a good final form, each one a bit different. Who knows, it may inspire you to look back into the depths of SNK and how the connections run deep, and get a piece of the fighting tradition that now and again in ways rivaled Capcom, a company that was very thrilled and supportive of it's fans.\n\nPS: Beware those who hold liniage with the Orochi blood. Baddie characters and characters with just cause alike. Beware the Blood Riot. All part of a story universe you'll learn to respect.","September 2, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SNK 2 EO on Gamecube. And that game, in my opinion, was the most amazing fighter that I had played to date besides Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. KOF XIII is slightly more complex than Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO and possibly more balanced. It has many unique and colorful arenas to fight in plus a fitting soundtrack. The game runs extremely smoothely for me offline as well as online. This is a really solid and fun fighter with multiple game modes including a tutorial and fully customizeable character colors. The story mode in my opinion is the weakest part of the game, yet it isn't terrible, just different and may be confusing for people new to the series. KOF XIII has both keyboard and controller support. If you're a fan of Street Fighter or either of the other games that I've mentioned and you're in the mood for a fighter with online play that works then you should absolutely buy this.","June 20, 2015","true","40.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After years of trailing behind the original SNK, it seems SNK Playmore finally caught up and made a decent, faithful KOF game. In my opinion, it still feels a little lacking in content compared to KOF '97-'2000, but the quality is top-notch. It also comes with lots of features. Probably everything that anybody'd ever want.\n\nI've only played it on and off with a friend, but the game seems fine. Netplay is also fine, despite my friend and I living in different countries. Overall seems like a very good port. Recommended if you want a good fighting game.","December 29, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But looking back, I can see why others will enjoy it. I had fun with itt until LP,HP,LK and HK tutorial prompts came along and confused me. But I am not a fighting game kind of person.

(And because im a scrub I couldn`t be asked to nab a controller.)\n\nI can see why others would enjoy this game, keep in mind I have not played this for long at all. In fact, less than an hour (I think).\nSo for the sake of the community I will recommend this, but only if you have basic knowledge of keyboard controls on console ports.

Six hours later, my new one's analog stick's becoming loose.\n\nPainfully truthful jokes aside, this is an excellent game and worth the disposible controllers. Cast is extensive and, for the most part, each unique in their own way.\n\nControls are incredibly smooth and responsive (I'm just too rough apparently), and its fairly easy to pick up and play (i.e: button mash) but the combat and combos are really worth learning; you'll WANT to spend hours and hours in training mode to improve your skills (I'm still trying to successfully pull off a 40 hit combo with Leona I saw in some video). Is it necessary? Probably not, but it's a lot of fun to experiment and then brag to your friend who doesn't give a rat's bum about it before he goes back to talking about catgirls or whatever; I don't bother paying attention; after that 20 hit combo, I'll fight his catgirl 1v1.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and stylish; the character sprites are well detailed, the animation is great, special effects are flashy, and the backgrounds are pretty; some of the backgrounds have people watching you fight, and I swear they're on something because they move faster than a McLaren F1 with the rev limiter removed being driven by Michael Schumacher while hearing the Emerald Hill Zone music from Sonic 2 in the background.  It's hilarious.\n\nI will lastly add that I speak for single-player and local-multiplayer only. I haven't the slightest clue how well online play is.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best damn fighting games I've ever played and worth a purchase even at full price. Bring your friends, buy some spare controllers and be ready to fight; we got all night and no girlfriends.","December 19, 2015","true","23.5"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

(hardcore grapple: goro, clark. vice   --overall balance: kyo, iori, Terry Bogard   --Heavy hitter: Raiden, Mr. Karate, Shen Woo  --Rushdown:  K' , Kim, Kensou  --Zoner: Duo Lon, Athena, King).\nBut the beauty of this game is that these characters can fall into different categories even muultiple, but still find a way to be balanced and ridiculously unique.  If you get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on in this game it is due to skill.  with so many ways to evade simple spam.  combo knowledge and positioning really determine if you will win.
