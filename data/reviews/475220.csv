I highly recommend the bees because they help you focus on the level and can save you time which means more crystals.\n\nThere is an RNG box which you can "try your luck" or kill yourself if you get a bad roll. Poison spikes will inflict a poison debuff which will result in death as well. Checkpoints grant you additional time. You have to learn the map in order to achieve and complete the level.\n\nNot sure if intended or bug?; but jumping onto an enemy who is also jumping in the air will result in loss of life. This would mean that there is some strategy involved as you need to time your jumps.\n\n7/10","June 3","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I recommend it for its challenge. And also, i think your kids would enjoy it, just like mine did. =D","June 2","true","9.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"
