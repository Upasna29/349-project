"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/412230/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Important note to begin with: I wrote this review soon after the release of the game and the developer has been working on updates for the game. After the big update comes, I plan to rewrite this giveaway (as I believe it can end up being positive).\n\nSummary:Do you remember Indiana Jones' hunt for treasure? Ohio Jack wants to get the Cup of Eternity and you must help him through 35 time trial levels with volatile difficulty - some are really easy but there are few that might frustrate you.\n\nI was thinking about positive review originally but then I finished the game in less than an hour. That's really disappointing for a game without any proper story and just pure gameplay focus.\n\nBy the way, it's worth mentioning that this is NOT a puzzle game. All you do is just jumping and crouching to get over traps and lava/goo pools.\n\nPros:- Well-optimized for gamepad. You don't need to set up any controls for gamepad.\n- Some levels have nice level design. Others are just about average.\n- Level editor. So the community might actually make the game way better.\n- The graphics are somewhere between 2D and 3D. That looks actually nice. :-)\n\nCons:- It's short. I would find it reasonable in a story-based adventure game with multiple endings, but this is just retro action game with few levels that take less than an hour to finish them.\n- Bad sound effects. There are only few of those and most are just annoying.\n- Slow teleport time. Teleporting takes unnecessarily more time than it could, it's annoying in levels where is teleporters (but there aren't many of those, at least.)\n- Only 5 achievements. Achievement hunters might be happy on the other hand, you can get 100% achievements easily (if they'll work, as I currently couldn't get achievement for beating first levels).\n\nNote: My copy of the game was obtained from a giveaway oficially sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't affected my review in any way.","January 5","false","4.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","10"

I find the game overpriced, but won't mind the price, since I got it in a bundle.\nThe game is short, but well made.\nIt took me around an hour to find the patterns and finish it. The game is hardcore and may be for some people frustrating, since the difficulty comes close to old NES games.\nAnyways it offers a nice variation of enemies and features a level editor.\nThe quality of this game is higher than most platformer you meet on Steam.\nI recommend to buy this game on a good sale (except if more content is going to be released).\n\nP.S.: This game was developed by only one guy but the game+engine are enjoyable.","December 24, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The controls are a little bit annoying but, for example, I think that this "slippery" edges of the ground are intentional (we're used to jump during our walking or running and here we often have to jump first and then we should give a trajectory).\n\nDespite the fact that achievements have been bugged on release day, the creator fixed it very quickly. I’m really into the design and I’m keen on the idea of some features, although it is clear at first glance that this is not an extensive game, even as for an indie title. Well, I've marked that I recommend it but if you don't intend to simply support the developer, you should wait until the price will be reduced by 75-90%.","December 24, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I like the lighting effects and humour, but with these rock-hard level tasks it frustrates me too soon. Every maze consists of several deathtraps which you can avoid by jumping or crouching. You have to reach the (illusional) Cup to fall down into the next level and probably get the real Cup at some point. Did I mention the timer? Yes, you have to keep up a good pace too..\n\nНе столь ужасно, но все же любительский дизайн проявляется в грубой анимации, примитивной озвучке и нечетком кправлении. Мне понравились световые эффекты и юмор, но от таких сложных заданий я быстро обломался. Каждый лабиринт состоит из рядя смертельных ловушек, которые можно преодолеть прыжками и приседаниями. Необходимо достичь (иллюзорного) Кубка, чтобы провалиться на следующий уровень и когда-нибудь добраться до настоящего. Я не упомянул о таймере? Да все это надо проделывать в хорошем темпе...

As far as I can tell the zombie's movement is random and not scripted. Correct me if im wrong\n-Kinda short, but expected for the price of 4$\n\nIn short, if you like games along the way of Super Meat Boy, its a great indie game!\n\nDisclaimer:\nI did recive my copy of the game free in a giveaway from the dev himself.

Said dinosaur can be found here [imgur.com]\n\nSummary\nThis game is both infinitely frustrating, yet fun in a challenging way. While it is not necessarily a kid friendly game as the dev suggests, I think little tykes may like some levels. I got frustrated at quite a few levels and almost stopped playing, but I decided to trudge on with it. I'm glad I did because this is a wonderful little indie game with a supportive and caring dev. Please don't make me eat those words though! I'll get around to finishing it once I clear out some other games on my list. Definitely will be on my need to finish list.\n\nPro's:\nChallenging game. while it does frustrate me quite a bit, I enjoy sitting bit with my controller.\n\nHeartfelt story in the beginning about the Dev and his son.\n\nGame Adjusts well to both keyboard and gamepad- I use a Logitech F310, and have no problems.\n\nKid friendly options but I would NOT recommend this for kids. More in my cons section on this.\n\nSeemingly generic story at first, but throws a little twist that made me have a chuckle.\n\nCon's:\nIn the beginning the dev recommends options to turn off for kids. I would NOT recommend this for kids- I got frustrated quite a bit. This doesn't make it a bad games by any means, I quite enjoyed it still.\n\nAs many other's have stated, this is over priced. I would put this at $2.50, and drop it to a $1-1.50 during steam sales. Sure it has 30 odd levels, but some of them got old pretty quickly, or repeptitive.\n\nThe zombies and traps are quite frustrating- I feel like I should be able to be able to run away from the zombies quicker rather than stand there like a derp. I also wish I could just over some of the traps such as the mini flamethrowers.","January 5","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

You are greeted with a treasure hungry protagonist named Ohio Jack who is on a mission to acquire the Cup of Eternity from Culsus deadly lair. She plays along with your search and grants you the power to revive as long as you keep playing the “game”. The puzzles are simple at first but gradually get tougher with the time limit playing a big factor and you will find yourself dying not once, not twice, but thirty times! The 2D graphics are simple and fun with a standard color palette for exploration in ruins. The music is nothing spectacular but charming in a way to make you think and eager to go to the next level. I found myself loving the levels and progressing to get closer to that cup, even though I died the death animations are amazing. I did find  a couple of problems with the levels such as for one of them where you’re surrounded by zombies and you have no idea where the end is and to me that level is based on luck. A puzzle game should be based on strategic thinking, a optional minimap can easily solve this problem and make some of the levels like that more successful in being stealthy. Another problem I found were the traps…well the one really where you could not even tell it was a trap, I know the idea of a trap is surprising but this one was not obvious…the floor is somewhat cracked if you look really close at it. I know there are limitations for 2D graphics but players are going to get frustrated if they can’t tell what traps look like in the game. I did take a look at the level editor and it took some tinkering but I understand how the triggers, setting enemies, and emitters work, but play testing and seeing the custom map in game did not work for me, I’m hoping the issue will be resolved as soon as possible! Overall I enjoyed the levels I played and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to play a fun exploration puzzle game. Onwards to your journey!\n\nI also made a Let's Play video if you want to check it out of the first 12 levels!\n\nLet's Play Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXYFckwkCvo","January 21","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I always have loved challenging games, and if it is a retro game, then I'm all for it. With that in mind,\n\nPros:\n\n* Pleasant sound effects, although they will get really repetitive.\n* Pretty good looking 2.5D graphics and animations.\n* Nice default controls, for both keyboard and gamepad.\n* Great level design on most stages.\n* Physics of the character that you control is nice.\n* I haven't personally tried it, but the fact that there is a level editor is admirable.\n* Didn't find any bugs or glitches.\n\nCons:\n\n* Short game.\n* Some levels can be extremely frustrating, but not in a good way where it tests your abilities, but just plain-dumb way.\n* This is not necessarily a con, but the dialog annoyed me.\n* The zombies are not a fun aspect of this game, and just bring it down a little.\n* Overpriced for what it's worth.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to play for about half an hour to an hour at most, and receive some kind of entertainment, then you might enjoy this game. The game has a lot of potential, and if utilized to its maximum, it could become a lot more satisfying to play.","January 9","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is quite difficult, and on one of the levels I played through and died about 30 times in a row before I figured out what I was doing wrong.  At first I found myself wishing for a tutorial, but then I realized that figuring it out on my own made me feel like I had really accomplished something.  You know, sort of like when you don't understand some math homework, but then suddenly the answer dawns on you.\n\nSince I have young game players in the house, and also because I prefer not to watch bloody and gory animations, I truly appreciate that the developer included a 'no gore' option to make the game family friendly.  It's always a positive when gamers are given a choice, and it shows that the developer is willing to put work into the game to make it accessible to everyone.\n\nSince I grew up in Ohio, I'll admit that I'm a bit biased toward liking the title.  Control works excellent with my Xbox 360 controller.
