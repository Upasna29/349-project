I honestly don't know how this title got greenlit because it looks hand drawn in Microsoft Paint. If you're able to overlook this incredibly painful eyesore then you'll find an extremely fun and challenging game that's drastically similar Commander Keen. Let me be clear that this is not criticism because I doubt another Commander Keen will see the light of day. I'm sure the majority of gamers know what Commander Keen is so I'll just keep it brief and say what makes this game shine is the non-linear world + levels, level design, cuteness, and high difficulty.\n\nUnforunately since the graphics are so downright awful and overall things lacks polish, the game will continue to get deciminated by mobs of angry gamers. To resolve this issue the Developer should take a look at the Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures (AVGNA) or even Commander Keen 5 (if the graphics of a game released in 1991 are better than a similar game released 15 years later that should tell you something is seriously wrong) and find an artist with a similar skillset. Right now I recommend buying this game at $0.50 cents and if the graphics are eventually on par with Commander Keen 5 then I would pay $5.00 or $7.50-10.00 if similar to AVGNA.\n\nDespite the eyesore I'm still recommending this game if it goes on sale at my suggested price because I see potential.\n\nRating:\n5.5/10\n\nPros:  The game is a mix of mainly Commander Keen + a little bit of Super Mario Land + Metroidvania style + Microsoft Paint (just kidding this is a Con)\nFluid player movement\nWalking around the World Map and choosing the level you want is always a perk\nLove the map secrets (similar to Commander Keen)\nWide open level exploration with alterative paths.\nCross platorm (Linux+Mac+Windows)\nNumerous updates\nThe game is relentless with 1 hit 1 kill deaths.\nCons:  The worst graphics I've ever seen for a game sold on Steam. Everything looks like it was drawn in Microsoft Paint.\nThe default key for jump should be Left Control.\nOdd launcher showing MS-DOS command prompt commands + the game launched in window mode + I had to press ALT+ENTER to make the game full screen.\nAbsurd price. Should be $0.50 cents in its current state. If the graphics were on par with Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures I would pay $7.50 - $10.00 depending upon how polished the game is at that point in time.\nI wish the oxygen level would be higher when swimming underwater.\nThe end of the level slow motion effect is irratating.\nPoor background music.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor Samsung 27 inch 1ms   Headphones Logitech G230   Keyboard Logitech G710 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard   Controller No Controller   Mouse Steelseries rival   Microphone Logitech G230   OS Windows 10 + Debian Jessie Linux\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Cheese and Bacon Games","February 17","true","2.0"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","46","51","0","4"

Yes it is rough around the edges but the developer seems committed to improving the experience. If Commander Keen or Jill of the Jungle have a special place in your heart than you can not go wrong with Hubert's Island Adventure: Mouse o' War.","February 10","true","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you die you go back to the last checkpoint.\n- The default controls were awful on keyboard and controller, you will have to rebind some.\n-  Really poor background music\n- The art direction....is just.... like what? I'm kind of wondering if someone really used microsoft paint or if they made it look this way on purpose...\n\n\nIn conclusion I would say the game would probably be quite challenging to beat, it might be fun for kids, or for someone looking for a platformer that's more about exploring than getting to the end of the level. Graphically it could use some improvements, but overall it's not really that bad of a game. I actually did see myself wanting to play a bit more to find keys to see what happened next.\n\nSo overall I'm going to recommend it mainly because it's a decent platformer in a sorta charming imaginative world. :)","February 5","true","0.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

As you walk through the world it's easy to see that is 2d top down shooter isn't the most graphic intensive game out there. There are however redeeming factors such as the helpful attitude the game shows toward the player and the competitive high learning curve progress. If you can see past the confusing interface this game is a blast for a few hours and maybe even more if you want to be the best.","February 28","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
