"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/33130/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Guns, Countless Bullets and an almost endless wave of Zombies.\n\nThere is something strangely satisfying about playing this game with your favourite playlist playing in the background. That feeling of leaning back in your comfy chair and unleashing a wave of molten metal justice into the unsuspecting horde of zombies. I'm not usually one for such mindless carnage (although now I think about it I enjoyed the hell out of Carmageddon all those years ago). Yet, I found myself turning to this game when I had no idea what else to play.\n\nI'm not going to sugar coat the game at all, it 'says what it is on the tin' to be fair to the developers - It's  Zombie Shooter. That's all there is to it, yet there feels like there's more.\nIt has a Campaign and a Survival Mode, both of which are pretty fun, although I did find myself enjoying the Survival Mode more. In Survival Mode you have survive as many Zombie Waves as you can in a small confined area. There are a selection of maps (each with their own unique element), a wide range of guns and a collection of power ups to use as you see fit. Interestingly there's a perk system too, which allows you to customise your character as you level up from killing the Zombies and surviving the waves.\n\nCampaign mode was OK for what it is, a isometric 'corridor' shooter, and doesn't really try to be anything else. However, it does suffer from some environmental clipping, which is perhaps the most danger you'll find yourself in as it's easy to become trapped/stuck (forcing you to restart the level).\nMuch like the Survival mode you can upgrade your character, but you have to find the guns to unlock them (rather than the guns falling off of Zombies and into your lap).\nI think what I really liked about the Campaign was that there wasn't a half-arsed story tacked onto it to try and justify the mindless onslaught against the Zombie Hoard. It just plonked you into the game and allowed you to go. It makes me realise that I'd actually like to see a Zombie Movie based on that idea - no poorly written story with terrible actors, just a person or two killing endless zombies before the zombies kill them.\n\nThe controls are basic and use as WSAD approach with Mouse aiming, sadly no gamepad support (that I could find). There are no real options to customise resolution or graphics, so you'll have to make do with what they offer. The sound is OK, but not amazing. I do feel as though this game is missing out on a killer soundtrack to support the carnage.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=281355021\n\nIf you have low expectations, and are perhaps just looking for something to sit back and waste a few hours on this game is ideal - it might even surprise you.","July 4, 2014","true","4.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","2"

What you do in the game is all in the title. I find this game to be very relaxing, as you kill zombies to an awesome rock/techno soundtrack. You can level up, improve your stats, and buy various items to help you on each level. There isn't much of a story, but thats not what you buy this kind of game for.

This is a game where you shoot zombies. Everything is in the title, and this is everything you'll do all along the game.\n\nIs this repetitive? Maybe, but this is an arcade game. You will play it when you want to vent your violence on a good old game, or when you want to beat your friend's highscore. Is it worth the 15€ price for the entire pack ? Maybe, but it'd be better to get it cheaper if you're not sure you'll like it.\n\nTL;DR - this is a cool little arcade game you'll play between two other games.

Got to playing it today out of 120% boredom, and it killed my boredom for 2 whole hours, since the game is rather short. But it was entertaining, and for anyone looking for no story, quick action, hundreds of zombies and awesome guns (and upgrades!), get this game. The playthrough on normal difficulty is repetitive yes, but sometimes that's all you need. The game drags you through neatly designed levels with loads of zombies of different nature and different abilities, and the graphics, although clearly inspired by older games, are very meticulous and nice.

But I have also seen games that were much better... But; yes, you read right - I said but, this game is quite old. It runs smoothly and perfectly and is a good small waste of time.\n\nOf course it is not Left4Dead, not Resident Evil, but it's one of the earlier "Zombie-Apocalypse" games here on Steam. The Mechanics are simple and easy to learn. It is fast paced and easy to play, at times to easy - because you are fighting zombies with a nearly unlimited amount of bullets (at least for your pistol) - and that is what makes the game unrealistic. But still fun.\n\nThe worst of the game is that there are some glitches that can catch your character and force a restart. But this was also in so many high priced games recently, that these little bugs are not so important.\n\nIt has the right atmosphere. Though the music could have been more sinister imho. In a bundle a classic, but buying the four games for 14,99? No way, and I won't praise the game for this pricing because of three things:\n\n1) To old\n2) To many glitches\n3) Replayability is zero.\n\nSo, Yes if it's in a bundle.

Offline leaderboards that is.\n\nThe base gameplay of Zombie Shooter is not terrible in any way, it is just simple. It takes the top down shooter and removes everything about the shooting.\nWhile this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing in other games Zombie Shooter doesn't add anything to fill the void. Not even content.\n\nWhat you are left with is a short, shallow game, fighting the same aliens over and over just in different colors.\n\nWhat little enjoyment I have gotten out of Zombie Shooter comes from the fact that it's a bundle game.

You can’t possibly feel the satisfaction of blowing up hordes of the undead in to gigantic piles of blood and gore just by looking at screenshots; you’d have to participate in the slaughtering. I played many top down shooters before, but none are this satisfying. All the things you could possible want from a top down shooter is present in the game; you can pump up your stats by leveling and there are shops at the end of each level to buy new guns. The only downfall is that it’s terribly short; most should be able to beat this game with relative ease in around 2 hours.

Shooter" games from Sigma Team even better than they are. When I saw character select screen I was confused - "it looks same like in Alien Shooter... maybe they just replaced aliens with zombies?". How mistaken I was.\n\nSo what could be done to make this simply yet amazing game better? Upgrade and level up system! I didn't liked how Alien Shooter forces me to use next weapons because if I won't, then I will not make any progress and won't complete game. In Zombie Shooter you can upgrade your favorite weapons and use them for much longer time - now you don't need to buy this uber plasma minigun to beat the game. And what's the deal with leveling your character? It makes you spent points to skills which make your character fit your style. Also, if you are looking in every corner it has become more rewarding than ever: not only because of money, but also for hidden exp capsules.\nYou can also see that each level is designed much better than in Alien Shooter. And of course, zombies are also more fun to kill than alien*. The only thing that stays same is fun in killing those creatures - which means great fun.\n\nI'm glad that I buyed and tried Zombie Shooter. Maybe it's because I'm fan of Alien Shooter but I had fun, and probably I will have more when next time I will have whim to play something not demanding, brainless and with tons of blood. I wanted to kill zombies and Zombie Shooter delivered it. Good job Sigma Team.\n\n*biased opinion","May 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Main menu music is a nice throw back to Resident Evil games. Otherwise the rest is this rock style kinda like Starcraft rock.\n-Classic late 90's graphics.\n-Nice mix of open and close spaces.\n-Distructable enviroment is a nice touch\n\nDislikes:\n-The music doesnt really fade out well.

Shoot lots of zombies, pick up health, move on.  Spend money to buy new guns and upgrade existing ones with better stats.  Gear progression is pretty lackluster, your new guns completely obsolete the old ones because ammo is plentiful.\n\nSome 'RPG' elements in that you upgrade stats after each level based on killing enough zombies, but its just Health / Ammo Capacity / Speed / Accuracy (yes, shots stray).\n\nThis is really the kind of game you'd have played back in the day when PC gaming was new, for for a $1.25 throwback its not bad, just nothing amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brattysnax/recommended/33130/","brattysnax","𝕭 𝖗 𝖆 𝖙 𝖙 𝖞","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brattysnax/","4637 products in account","One of the things I miss about video games is the fact that you used to be able to throw a cartridge into something, boot it up, and play it for about 10 minutes and make some actual progress or have a little bit of fun on the way. Truly, a few video games of the past really fit this bill perfectly as little time wasters. This is one of those games, though after having a couple of hours of play invested in it, I do feel the need to point out some problems that I haven't seen other reviews point out.\n\nThe idea of shooting zombies is one that has been done one million times, now this isn't necessarily a drawback, but it seems a lot more like some of the characters in this game are mutants rather than zombies. Zombies are a pretty straightforward concept, and though I do like some variation in the type of zombies, there's usually an archetype that people tend to expect when shooting at them.\n\nIn other words, zombies coming at you with rocket launchers and guns doesn't make much sense. However, this is balanced by the fact that there are zombie dogs and zombie rats, which I always find entertaining.\n\nAnother thing that I will give this game credit for is that it definitely fits its name, it is Zombie Shooter, and you will not play another Zombie Shooter that is quite as Zombie or quite as Shootie as this one. Well, you probably will, you probably have! As others have said, there's no really new ground covered here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for a game that you can roll out of bed and play for a few minutes then turn off without feeling guilty about the amount of progress you've made because you just needed something to play while you wake up and drink your coffee, this may help you metabolize that caffeine a little easier.\n\nNow I will move on to some improvements that I feel would make this game better and more enjoyable. First of all, fix it so you can move around certain dead zombies - you will get stuck at times and have to completely exit to the Main menu and restart the level because you get stuck behind them and cannot escape. This also happens with extras boxes, certain walls, you name it. Sometimes, you just get stuck, and you can't get out of that position. This is irritating, even if you're simply playing for ten minutes. If you get super involved with it and decide to play for more than a half hour (or as long as you can take hearing "BLARGH ARGH THUMPTHUMP WHOMP BLLAAAHHHGHHGHHRHRHARRGHHURGLE" and get stuck behind something, you will have a screaming fit with your monitor. At least you will if you're as impatient as I am. In other words: Patch this. Just make it so you can walk over all dead zombie types, you can walk over most of them as they vaporize into a puddle of red goop, why not all of them? Yes, your character designs for the ones that mutate or shoot several tongues at you are awesome, but when they're dead you don't need to make them immovable objects.\n\nSecond, fix the night vision. The night vision sucks. It's easier to see without it in 99% of cases.\n\nMaybe have different types of drones. I realize that the drone is a little bit of a wuss move for anyone to make playing this game, but having the option definitely helps, but the one drone option that is available is surprisingly useful..for about 30 seconds, before it gets blown up by a zombie lobbing rockets at you (again, this doesn't make sense in a zombie game, but I'm not looking for realism in something like this.)\n\nFourth, maybe throw some steam achievements or trading cards in there. I don't know how much effort this takes on the part of the publisher or whoever programs the game, and I know many would argue that it ruins the fun of playing because it takes the focus away from the gameplay and more toward the achievements, but come on, achievements are cool! It's not that they replace real life achievements such as learning to play the guitar or landing a promotion at your job, it's that they're neat little decorations for your profile, or bragging rights whenever one of your friends insists they've gotten further in a game than you have. "Oh yeah?!" you will say, and show them the achievement that proves otherwise, that you splattered more idiot rocket-launcher wielding zombies than they did, that you survived an onslaught of 8,000 mindless "GUUUHHHRRGHHHS" coming at your face while trying to turn the lights on in another underground vault for the 900th time.\n\nI'm going to wrap this up by saying that this game is worth the money depending on what you want to get out of it. I don't think anyone reading this review or buying the game is expecting a AAA title or to invest a hundred hours of their time into it, but it is worth the money to play it and I would recommend it, just be prepared for some somewhat irritating moments when you get stuck behind something that has the health that you desperately need and you have to completely restart the level because of this. Also be prepared to become quickly annoyed with having zombies shoot rockets at you without actually attempting to eat your brain. Finally, one thing I didn't mention in this review that bears mentioning is that the RPG elements are extremely fun. They do have real impact to your gameplay, and playing with them does make you consider whether or not you're making the best use of the game money you spent to get through each level.\n\nSo whether you're looking to waste some time or....waste some time, pick this up. When I weigh the problems of this game with the positives of it, I have to give it a 6.5 out of 10. With a patch, it could easily be taken up to 7.5. Good job, guys.","February 27, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The concept of the game is simple enough, and I've seen it work just like this in a bunch of Flash games: kill things, get money, buy weapons, kill more things.\n\nThe problem is that the design of this game is very sloppy. The level design is poor: things often get obscured by the walls, I got stuck in the geometry, and many other minor annoyances. There's no tutorial, and this game probably could have used one.\n\nThe art and music work, but they're nothing special. The constant clinging of shells hitting the ground gets old.\n\nZombie Shooter's fun as a quick diversion, but it's definitely not the best way to spend $5.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/33130/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Zombie Shooter looks and is extremely low budget. It could easily have been a DOS game from the mid 90s, but it was actually released in 2007. With that said, it is an enjoyable DOS game from the mid 90s. The level design is basic, linear, and straightforward. Animations are the bare minimum that one could expect from an average game from that era. Each mission involves doing very similar actions, like reaching certain specific areas of the map a couple times in order to proceed. There are several items and upgrades that could be purchased between each level, as well as upgrading skills from your character, which makes for an interesting and fun addition to the upfront running and shooting. The AI has very serious problems, and at times you may use this to your advantage. Zombies will often get stuck behind walls or other objects, and many times they will also spin in place and not move, without doing anything else. Besides the campaign, there are two additional game modes, but they are much less interesting and do not provide for a true extension of replay ability. Zombie Shooter is a short and basic game, with very simple game play mechanics. It is plagued by severe AI path finding issues as well as general AI problems. There are also various bugs throughout the game, and the final boss is not challenging at all, in comparison to the massive groups of non-boss zombies that will come at you almost non-stop. Also, the small amount of text found in Zombie Shooter has some grammar errors. There is very little variety to be found in Zombie Shooter, and the short lived amount of game play will not keep you very interested, and it will not last long. For an unintentional DOS game from the mid 90s, this is a small gaming distraction amidst the abundance of better, more polished games out there.\n\nZombie Shooter is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

They're very similar games, with the same premise: run and shoot all zombies in sight. Same graphics, same controls, everything, with the main difference being that the enemies are zombies instead of aliens - which is perfectly good so far since that worked really well with Alien Shooter. And while Alien Shooter was already quite fun, Zombie Shooter brings some important improvements.\n\nThe first is that there are more upgrades to buy and there's a leveling system that makes a huge difference.\n\nThe second is that the game's difficulty is WAY more balanced - it's a lot more playable and a lot less frustrating, while still maintaining at least some challenge.\n\nThe third is that there's a lot more variety of scenarios, instead of always that same "inside a bunker" look that Alien Shooter had through all levels.\n\nYet, I still need to mention the camera angles since it's one problem that all games from Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter seems to have and was never fixed... It's really bothersome because there are enemies and items that will often show up behind walls, making the player unable to see them. This could easily be fixed with a non-fixed camera angle or transparency effect.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who just wants a game to run'n'gun.","February 19, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I'm going to take this game as a single game. What can I say about it is that it's rather... Basic. You mow down zombies, get money and XP, upgrade, mow down more zombies. No replay value I'm afraid. Although what I can say is that it's perfect for killing a few hours.\n\nWell, few notes though... It's a game with zombies and guns and zombies with guns. And weapons have endless magazines that can fit unlimited bullets. Ain't that fun?\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PLD6LmrYDA","August 8, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
