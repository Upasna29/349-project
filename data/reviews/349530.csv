Yes there's problems like one resolution at the moment but this kind of stuff will be fixed soon enough. Nice depth with the world tour mode for good replayability and online works well too. Very fun online with friends.

This is the Zynga of sports games. That's not a bad thing. It replicates table top cricket with plenty of detail, more than enough of a learning curve to provide a challenge... right off the bat.\n\nGraphics are fine, they represent this table sized world with generous detail and colour.\n\nPlenty of different shots to learn, and well as all the options when bowling. You can spin it like Warnie, turn the ball into a bullet like Brett Lee, and swing the ball like.... ummm.... no Aussies come to mind.\n\nBugs? Yep, lots. More bugs than moths on a lovely evening at the SCG. One guy hit the ball out of the ground - it went through the stadium, lost into the abbyss, and was only declared a 4. My fielders will either will a ball one step to their side like an Indian fieldsman, or jump across the pitch to get a ball as if Jonty Rhodes has Superman powers, and could cheat.\n\nYet to try online, though it should be great if done right","March 17, 2015","true","26.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

FOR THE FIRST 5 MINUTES. After you bat, you bowl, like in normal cricket, but in this game I cannot figure out how to bowl if my life depended on it. I select where I want to bowl, then hit A (or enter) but then the game just seems to give up and leave you staring at your screen wondering why you payed 10 dollars for it.\n\nOverall:\nThe batting is really fun and fluent, you will never see me without a smile once I've hit a six against England. Really, it's just the bowling that is the sledgehammer to the gut for me.\n\nEDIT:\nI've found out how to bowl but I shouldn't have to review the controls/mash buttons mindlessly to find out how to bowl...","November 5, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The World Tour is most enjoyable with its various challenges. If I have any gripes, it's that some of the shot challenges are very difficult, especially the backfoot one in the USA segment of the world tour, which seems to require more backfoot shots than the keyboard instructions show you. Also, the "late cut" challenge doesn't seem to recognise when I play a late cut. Mind you, it's very hard to press all the requisite keys at once. When I try to play a back-foot on drive for instance, my batsman keeps leaving the ball instead. I really can't understand why that is. But that issue aside, I have mostly had a lot of fun with this game. Definitely a cool way to play cricket on a computer!","March 25, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are no graphics options (can't even change the default (720p), nor is there a tutorial anywhere in sight. I'm not sure which is worse, but the lack of a tutorial is inexcusable as there's a bit of a learning curve to actually play the game (as there is a huge difference from Don Bradman Cricket 14). If you plug in a controller after you've launched the game, you have to close and re-open the game all over again. The mouse cursor is also constantly spinning, and doesn't disappear even when a controller is plugged in. You can move it to one side, but why is it spinning (and why doesn't go transparent for that matter) in the first place?\n\nThere's constant crashes and hangs, which just continues to show the game has been badly ported or supported. This is in stark contrast to Don Bradman Cricket 14, which really shines on the PC.\n\nVersus Mode doesn't even work properly (or at least it didn't at the time I wrote this). Sure, you can choose to play two players, but once you get into the game, it's just player one against the CPU.\n\nI'm a massive Big Ant fan, so I'm not sure what they were thinking on this one, though I have a bit of confidence they'll patch a lot of these issues that really shouldn't be issues.\n\n\nJust as well the price point is lower than on consoles, because it would be unforgivable otherwise. This has clearly been rushed, when it had no reason to be. For a game that was announced in 2012, it's an immense disappointment. Therefore, at the moment, I just cannot recommend this.","February 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohsBk/recommended/349530/","JohsBk","real boy gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohsBk/","133 products in account","Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\nMerely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted—nevermore!\n","November 26, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Another Gem from Bigantstudios.\n\n-When i first installed the game , i started the VERSUS mode and played a game with Indoor rules. Ohh Boy, it looked so beautiful. Stands full of crowd . Controls are Good and You get wide range of shots ( 18 different shots). Unlike other cricket games the Bowling is rewarding as well as fun. So you wont get bored after bowling 2 overs.\n-World tour mode is another good feature which lets you take on the World in Either Ten10,T20, ODI formats. There are many challeges too which you can play in tours.\n- THE MOST FUN PART IS ONLINE MODE . I played like 4 matches till now and I cant get over it. I want to keep playing and playing. The shortest Format You can play in ONLINE is INDOOR rules. Where you play with anyone in the world or with your friends with Indoor rules.\n\n-Well done Bigantstudios.
