"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/397270/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","A Kiss For The Petals franchise, Remembering How We Met is a great chapter for those who are new to the series as it tells the brand new story of Risa and Miya romance while looking back on the history of their time in St. Michael Girl's School. A long look back at Risa and Miya relationship, telling the tale of how they first met and came to be lovers it follows Risa and Miya’s storyline from Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke o - Michael no Otome-tachi (correct me if i am wrong)\n\nBrief overview of the storyThe story starts off with Risa suddenly feeling nostalgia. It was this very uniform she was wearing on her first day at St. Michael’s. The day she met her future girlfriend Miya.\nAs Risa starts to look back this will be a story that shows Risa and Miya’s first encounter, where they were initially antagonistic toward each other as both are smart in different ways.\nRisa is studious and works hard for her achievements while Miya seeks the freedom to pursue her own interests, bcause of her innate intelligence making class a bore for her, as it all started with Risa just trying to get Miya to come to class...\nHow did love manage to blossom between them? Find out as they recount the tale in a sweet loving and charming fashion.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual Elements - The CGs of this game are very pleasant to look at and the art style is very "charming" with the use of bright colors to depict the mood and environment.\n\nAudio Elements - The music sets the mood for every situation, depicting playfulness, happiness and many more. While dialogue and voice acting are both well done. Ending credit music are pleasing to listen to.\nHowever there is one problem which i found is that the "applause" sound does not fit into the visual novel at all in. Eg. The scene where Miya presented her plans for the tea party and it was perfect, the applause at that scene does not fit in at all.\n\nIn ConclusionFor those who are new to the franchise, this series is a must follow for every fan of yuri. As it focuses on relationships between two girls who fall in love with each other, A Kiss For The Petals stays true to the romance between two women. Though adult scenes are plentiful, this series is charming, and have natural development of relationships as the heroines go on dates, try to steal moments alone to express their love, and bond with each other in a very tender fashion.\n\nTo sum up i would recommend this visual novel to anyone who are fans of this genre, Yuri. This visual novel will last 3 - 4 hours.\n\nA note - This particular Sonohana title, A Kiss for the Petals - Remembering How We Met, is strictly an all-ages game. An adult version of this game does not exist. MangaGamer, as the publisher, did not remove, alter, or censor content for the Steam release.\n\nClick here for full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","September 25, 2015","true","206.3"," 244 of 276 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","244","276","10","20"

Tired of pondering the intricacies of the greater universe unfathomable?\n\n"A Kiss For The Petals" or Sono Hanabira is the answer. It is the shining beacon of respite in a world without enough yuri. When you may have troubled yourself as to life's mundane purpose, you smile, knowing that you must trouble yourself no longer, for it is done, and Sono Hanabira is on Steam.\n\nNotes:\n\nThis was originally a mobile/iPhone supplementary game in the Sono Hanabira series, and this is clearly an experimental English license. Fans will be supporting this release wildly for further localizations, and for newcomers, it may seem a bit overblown. This is not a long visual novel, nor is it entirely representative of Sono Hanabira as a whole. With that said...\n\n"What's with 'Sono Hanabira?'"\n\nFor long-time fans of the series, this is the seventeenth game, and one of two that are 'all-ages' (the other being Hanahira, for those of you interested in continuing your adventure into Sono Hanabira while staying within the 'all-ages space). Sono Hanabira started as a doujin nukige (doujin: amateur work by a small group of individuals; nukige: visual novel where the plot is only around to allow for 'plot') that was very well received for its tone, atmosphere, and high-quality character designs.\n\n"Finally, yuri done right!"\n\nA core cast of couples was developed, and multiple releases furthered the story between each of them. The success was too much to ignore, and after ten doujin releases, the company 'Yurin Yurin' was founded and it became a professional endeavour. "St. Michael's Girl's School - Maidens of Michael" was released as a full length visual novel that connected, expanded, and meaningfully explored the characters in a way that previous entries didn't have room for. A shorter sequel was released, focusing on the new couple Risa and Miya (the ones featured in this game!), as were wholly original ventures (such as ones focusing on a post-high school Nursing School) and even a "New Generations" series re-boot with an entirely new cast, as 'Yurin Yurin' was replaced as developers by 'St. Michael's Girl's Academy' (again, a company founded entirely for this venture).\n\nAt this point, fans are dying to play Sono Hanabira in its wholly professional and full length visual novel glory, but, it has far outpaced the fan translators and official English licensing and releases are wanted. So, with everything we've got, fans support Sono Hanabira in its fullest with this game! With enough support, the more lengthy games will be licensed, and the age of yuri can be heralded!","September 25, 2015","true","3.4"," 162 of 191 people (85%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","85","162","191","25","1"

Each chapter of the original 11 (drawn by Peko and written by Jun) feature an individual couple from the series, with the 11th installment, Maidens of Michael, featuring all the couples from previous chapters.\n\nThis chapter, along with the overly chibified Hanahira are the exceptions to the rule of adult content as they are both all ages chapters.\n\nThis (as far as I know) is the first chapter to receive an official western localization, and is a very light entry into the series, telling the story of Azumi Risa and Ayase Miya, a couple first introduced in Maidens of Michael and receiving their own chapter known as "Maidens of the Atelier"\n\nThis is simply the story of how they met. It's as cute as any of the pervious chapters, and features no adult content. Definitely recommended for anyone who likes Yuri, despite it not having any choices to speak of.\n\nDefinitely work picking up if you have any history with the series (like me) or if you like Yuri at all.","September 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","93","104","4","0"

This Visual Novel functions as in essence a prequel exploring the backstories of the two primary characters, a juncture where they were unfamiliar with one another. This unaccustomed disposition the two take establishes the analogue to Cartesian Duality, as outlined in the Meditations of Descartes.\n\nIn this past instance where the two principal characters are recondite to each other, the comparison is established as a degree of separation is seen between the two. Just as they are separate, two very different characters with Miya the intellect as the mind and Risa the epicurean as the body, so too then are the mind and body, a distinction between the the bodily substance, res extensa and the thinking immaterial yet definite substance, res cogitans.\n\nHowever, as the two character become closer, there is a dramatic shift to a more Spinozan philosophy as outlined in Ethics. Just as Spinoza follows Descartes, so too is this represented by the growing attraction between the two characters, leading to their relationship. The couple is thus as a single thing, but with differing properties. Countering Descartes, the whole is as such and we can not draw a distinction between in terms of interaction. For Spinoza, there is no thinking substance and no extended substance, only the one substance, represented as the couple.\n\n“We say that they all form one body or individual, which is distinguished from the rest by this union of the bodies.”\n-Baruch Spinoza","September 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","71","40","56","25","2"

However, Unlike most of the VNs in the series this game is NOT R-18. The game has a stellar translation by MangaGamer as it is in the same vein that the fan translations are in both style and phrasing (without all the grammar and spelling errors).

If you are a fan of the series do notice that this one is rather "mild" in comparison as Steam does have its policies with censorship. ;D I had to get it as soon as possible when I saw its release.  A must buy for any yuri lover  x,D <3 its a cute story of two girls relationship, starting at how they met and had a bit of a rocky start but ended up dating. Also don´t be discouraged by how the black haired girl is acting in the beginning when they start remembering how they met x,D I found her way of acting soo annoying too but by the end of it still ended up really liking her character. So give her time :P Also it may feel like an eternity of them just chasing after each other but trust me it will make sense in the end.\n\nIf anyone needs reference on how long it is, it took me around 3 hours to finish, so for a visual novel thats longer than some. Its a pro that its voice acted like the rest of the series too. Another pro is that if you have played the other games in the series you can get nostalgic over the locations and characters in this one. It has some cute cg as I had grown to expect and if you ask me to recommend you JUST ONE yuri game on Steam THIS IS IT for me~ <3 Also if you did find this enjoyable do look into getting the other parts of the series too even tho they arent on Steam! I love them all equally myself. <3 One of my favorite game series.

Because this is one of the best franchises about "Cute girls doing cute things". And it's yuri. So, Remembering How We Met - is it worthy or not? Difficult question actually.\nHanabira - the epic franchise about love relationship between schoolgirls. It's quite famous and lovable not because of beatiful sprites and backgrounds, not because of beatiful music, and not because of beatiful 16+ scenes, but because it's about "cute girls speak cute things to each other" and "cute girls douing cute things", not only illegal in their age. In few stories we have incest though. Nevermind.\nSo, i look at my eight installed eroge with some nostalgia and instabuy this - A Kiss for the Petals - Remembering How We Met. What i got? Not what i wanted and expected, actually. Main characters have already appeared in two games of the main series, so the whole plot of Remembering How We Met is flashback/prequel tho the plot of first game whith this girls. Because of it, cute things is unimaginable. Whatever, i wanna say at first, but second problem - the plot. Plot of this game can be discribed in two or three sentences. Of course, this franchise don't have the plot of "War and Peace" - or "Game of Thrones" if you wish - but in earlier games it was nice and interesting. The only kiss at the very end - what happened after two games and not a part of flashbask - like a bait from developers: "Look, we have nice girls in other games. Buy from us more".\nI'm kinda dissapointed. I just hope that this is the first game of my favorite franchise on Steam and other will be better. Unfortunatly, steam don't gave "Neutral" rating - only "Good" and "Bad", so i chose "Good". Because "Bad" is not nice.\nAfter all this - Remembering How We Met is not a bad eroge. It's just not actually a part of Hanabira series. If you are fan of Risa x Miya or want a play some sort of demo - this is your choise.","September 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokenatic/recommended/397270/","pokenatic","pokenatic μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokenatic/","569 products in account","As the fall season begins, Risa Azumi reminisces about how she and her now girlfriend, Miyu Ayase, first met, hence the title. It's the first visual novel in the nearly decade long Sonohana franchise to be officially released in the west, and the first non-spin-off entry to be non-H.\n\nThe story is that, when Risa and Miyu first met, Miyu, the newly transfered student, would quickly start to skip classes very frequently which irks Risa, the newly chosen class representative, particularly because the teacher asked her to help Miyu get adjusted to the school. What follows is a series of events which leads them to develop feelings for each other.\n\nWhile it's a sequel-prequel to three other entries in the Sonohana series, it is somewhat newbie friendly due to the story concerning how they first met, even though there is a noticable gap between the flashback and the present day. On the other hand, it doesn't give newbies any indication how pornographic the series can get, even though the not so subtle raunchy parts of the dialogue from the beginning and the end is a clear nod to the fact that this series is an eroge series first and foremost. For those who aren't into eroges, Remembering How We Met is still good as a stand alone story, although some small details go nowhere without the context of the other installments.\n\nClocking in at approximately 3 hours with auto enabled at a brisk reading speed, Remembering How We Met is a short, fully voice acted kinetic (linear, with no branches whatsoever) visual novel with no replay value aside from picking up some details in the dialogue you might've missed the first time around. Aside from the main story, there are a couple extras; a CG gallery, BGM player, and a set named Memories, which is essentially the entire visual novel cut up into multiple chapters, which is good for people who didn't make their own bookmarks (although the game will return you back to the Memories tab once you reach the end of that section of the story). The UI is pretty standard for a visual novel, and everything runs pretty smoothly, although the text will occassionally hiccup when set to auto as it will fail to roll out and most of it will pop up at once instead (thankfully, those hiccups don't affect the audio as well). At $8, it's pretty reasonable if you compare it to the cost/hour of anime (which, given that it's a kinetic visual novel, is a fair comparision) and it's a must buy for any yuri fans.","September 26, 2015","true","11.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's even less of a game than the other games in the series since you have no input at all. It's an experience but a bloody well sweet one at that. I'm not super into anime culture at all, but I've been a small fan of the Kiss For The Petals' series as love stories but have only read the first, second, third and eighth ones. All you need to do is read and listen to the girls speak Japanese you can't understand and look at the pictures. It's by no means the best story you'll ever read but if you've two hours to spare, break out your favourite drink and sit back and read this heart-warming little lesbian love novel with pretty art to boot. Because lesbi-honest, why would you want to do anything else?\n\nP.S. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price, it's a nice experience don't get me wrong, but its content doesn't warrant the full price tag. The game is basically the two girls remembering how they met, you never see them actually get together which is really supposed to be the most satisfying moment for the reader in a romance novel. I'd highly recommend the eighth game though, Petal-Coloured Angel I think it's called, it's my personal favourite.","September 27, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

There's nothing particularly suggestive about it save a moment near the end and, of course, the fact that it's a story featuring two girls (gasp). The game is originally a mobile port and doesn't have any of the mature themes the rest of the series does  (thanks, Kimchi).\n\nAnywho.... 'A Kiss For The Petals--Remembering How We Met' is exactly as the title says: it tells the story of two girls who are reminiscing on how their relationship started. It begins in the present, flashes back to the past, and returns to the present once more for the wrap-up.\n\nMiya and Risa are, of course, attendees of an all-girls school, cute, brilliant students (one do-gooder and one delinquent), and utterly parent and/or guardian-less. Typical Japanese school girls.  Their world is presented in static images and their portraits move just a bit to fit whatever they're saying on screen. At key points in dialogue, you sometimes get a different static image featuring one or both girls as a background and those can be viewed in the "extra" tab in the main menu. From that menu, you can also listen to the BGM and click through the "CG"s which reflect the minor changes in static images all in a sequence so that it kind-of-sort-of looks like a short clip/gif.\n\nEverything is fully voice acted, with the exception of narration, in Japanese.\n\nNo other characters get a graphical representation or even a name. They are generic "Student A" or "Teacher." I suppose they get glossed over because they're not central to the plot, but that level of detail would have been nice. As it was, the world felt empty--devoid of only two teens in love and a handful of faceless, nameless background characters. I can count them on both hands: Students A-D, Driver, and Teacher. Still, it's a minor gripe.\n\nIt'll take you around 2 hours to read through this and, after doing so, there won't be much reason to fire this game back up except to collect card drops seeing as there aren't any decisions to be made that could affect the story. You're just along for the ride... and that's okay.\n\nBottom line: short and sweet. 7.99 is a little steep, but it's worth a look if you're looking for a yuri love story that'll give you cavities.","March 23","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The two main characters Risa and Miya are the only true characters in the game, other people technically exist but are never shown and the minimal dialogue they do get displays such things as "Girl A", "Girl B", "Teacher". This is a kinetic novel, so no choices or alternate endings. We watch a school interaction turn into friendship, and something more, but there's not much time for any of it to sink in or have any meaning. There are undertones of family drama and serious problems but they are only touched on for the briefest of moments. The artwork is fine, just very limited in variety. Not the worst hour I've ever spent despite the "No" recommendation but wait until you get a break on the price if money is a consideration.\n\n(Total gameplay time: approx 1 hr.

And rather boring. I feel like the sales blurb on the store pretty much sums up the entire story.\n\nArtwork is pretty. Music is pleasant but bland.

It was short, completely linear, and really has no replay value.\n\nThe story is very much a recollection of how the two characters met. It doesn't actually detail how their romantic relationship started, which was upsetting to me.\n\nFullscreen resolution also was a bit offputting. For a game released in 2015 (even if it is a remake of a mobile game), the very least that could be done is have a widescreen resolution.\n\nI did like the art style, and the story was cute and enjoyable, despite the short length.

It just have a few problems that i will explain in the next paragraphs.\n\nFirst thing first, the only good thing that i can tell about this vn is the plot, its decent enough and actually serve its purpose, it tells how lovey dovey this two girls relationships is, and how when they first met they actually didn't have a lot in common, but they are drawn to each other by fate.. (i think). It also tells what Rita and Miya (The two main heroine) like about each others dispite being kinda different. The title didn't lie, its really "Remembering How We Met" and it was really sweet and innocent. My critic though, its really short ! It took me 3 hours to complete that. 3 hours !! I expected more out of it.\n\nNow, i have to say since visual novel is actually only consist of plot, art visual, and audio. Visual is really important, the drawing in this vn is decent some of them are really cute, but there are only few of them. I seen about 8 background image and less than 15 characters sprites, i have to say that again, less than 15 !! The bad thing about that is, it makes the background image really boring because they use the same background in a lot of scene, and there's a couple of misunderstanding with their expression since in few of the scene, the characters are suppose to have a neutral expression or an annoyed expression and the character sprite that they used is a smilling sprite. There's also another problem, its not that big of a deal but i will say it either way, there's no character sprite for anybody else, except for Rita and Miya. It just strike as a lazyness for me, because they certainly could draw, but they just choose not to draw other background or other characters sprite.\n\nThe other problem that i have with this vn is the voice acting. The two main heroine has a good voice actor, i didn't have a lot of complain about that, they really give personality to Rita and Miya. Even though for some reason Rita is louder than Miya by a huge margin, which is really strange. My problem is the other minor characters voices, like girl A, girl B, teacher, or driver. Its really obvious that this vn only have possibly 4-5 other voice actress to voice the other characters and that is suppose to be fine, if they give the other characters a generic voice. But, they give a unique voice like the ear destroyer child voices to 2 different characters ! So, we have the same unique voice for 2 different characters. Its really confusing and bad. Again, it just seems lazy for me.\n\nMy conclusion is.. Visual, audio, plot is the main thing in a VN, unless you have a terrific plot and a beautiful visual. Having very few decent backgrounds that you use in a multiple scene, very confusing voice acting, only 3 hours in length, and also very few character sprites makes me cannot recommend this VN, even though the character development is actually kinda good.","September 27, 2015","false","3.0"," 19 of 51 people (37%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","37","19","51","4","7"

I love soft yuri and this was perfect. The art is gorgeous, the character interaction and development is entertaining and fleshed out, and the ended leaves you kind of wanting a sequel, just to watch the two interact and go on with their daily lives.\nI've never been a huge fan of kenetic VNs due to them usually just being a one and done but I'm glad I spent my money on KFTP. It has no replayability but it was a memorable enough story that, a year or so from now, I'll probably re-download it and play it again.","March 18","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an over 10+ visual novel games as well as an anime OVA. Since Steam doesn't allow adult contents, this game is merely a short story from the main series without the R18 stuff. It's definitely a good start and perhaps the begining of more yuri related contents being released on Steam.\n\nIf you're a newbie when it comes to visual novels or even yuri as a genre, this game is a great start. If you're a veteran that knows the yuri genre well and possibly have played the other AKftP games, this is most definitely a pick up since I'm sure you'd like to support more visibility for the game as well as the genre.\n\nOverall, this is a fairly short game for only about $8, which I believe is worth it.

The only way to transcendence -- is this game.\n\nWhen Nietzsche developed his philosophy he wanted to escape from the assumptions and misconceptions of European society and culture, to become truly a self; to date the only work of art that would assist one in becoming an Ubermensch - to be become *what one is*-- is this game.\n\nWhen Sartre wrote his No Exit and Nausea, he was trying to express the strange incoherence of existence that lies behind our built-up beliefs and behaviours, to show how Radical Freedom is the fact of our lives. The only path one can walk to fulfill your potential to be a self, to truly exist,  -- is this game.\n\nWhen Pessoa wrote his "factless autobiography" he was trying to express the inexpressible tedium of life, to express through paradox the fact that even the idea of paradox is a paradox; for individuality is the containing of paradoxes in our selves, yet to nothing, for tedium continues to crush us. But the only way to escape the pain of living -- is this game.\n\nWhen Kafka wrote his Trial and Metamorphosis he was able to show the absurdity of human relationships, the fragility of so-called love, and justice and law: but the only thing that can truly express these truths: -- is this game.\n\nWhen Cioran wrote about his times at the peaks of despair, about his bottomless white nights of insommia, he was trying to show the "irrational nature of existence which continues itself without reason": but the only work of art that can show this to us, so far: -- is this game.\n\nAnd, when each of us stops for just a moment, as we wake up and cringe ourselves out of our beds and anticipate the disasters, misery and shame that the day will bring us; what are we looking for? The beauty of yuri is the only thing that justifies life, for in reading yuri we lose everything to the purity and gain nothing... -- for what is there to be gained from the world? Nothing. The world is material for our intrepretation of the world, but all of these intrepretations, being personal, are meaningless. Therefore only yuri allows us to express our radical freedom, to survive our white nights, to give solidity to our love, and our society, to allow our paradoxes to form a beautiful whole, to find transcendence, to become what we are: the only way to survive the world we live in -- is yuri.","September 29, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet 3 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not into the genre, then this is not a game for you.\n\nIf you are a fast reader, this game is easily completed in 2 hours, so can't say its content you're paying for.\n\nConclusion: If you like the Sono Hanabira stories, then yes, this is worth the buy. If this is not a genre you like, then it's not really worth the money.","December 12, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a slight experience, taking all of 1 or 2 hours to read in its entirety if you skip through the Japanese voice acting. The production quality of the game is high, with eye-catching CGs, unobtrusive music, strong voice acting and what looks to be an excellent and very well-edited translation from MangaGamer.\n\nStory-wise, this is a leisurely and very cute story that paints a vivid portrait of its central characters and their peculiar cat-and-mouse relationship (Risa, a strict middle class student who strives to be an exemplar to her primarily rich and pampered schoolmates, spends most of the game obsessively trying to convince Miya, a highly intelligent but bored and possibly unhappy girl in her freshman class, to attend classes and become a more responsible student). It's fun to watch this dynamic evolve as they gradually start to become something more to one-another.\n\nIf I have a complaint, it's that, for all of the build-up, we're never actually allowed to see when these two decide to fully embrace their feelings and confess to one-another. While this might seem like a bit of a cliche, it's a standard part of any romantic storyline, and the game ending without us ever seeing the biggest transition point in their relationship is a bit... anti-climatic. We see their loving and apparently passionate relationship after they become girlfriends, and we see most of the build-up to the change in their relationship, but the climax of the narrative is missing. I also feel that certain issues related to the character Miya's past are hinted at and then abruptly dropped, which was also disappointing.\n\nWith that said, the engaging character writing, high production values, and excellent translation still make this more than worth the paltry asking price. I enjoyed every moment of my time available with this game, and I'd love to see more accessible shoujo-ai become available on Steam.","February 23","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a short kinetic novel (there are no choices) but worth a look if you're into the genre. The art is good, the characters are engaging the only issue is that it's very much a short side story to another series of games.\n\nSo here's hoping for that to get an official translation.","January 26","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
