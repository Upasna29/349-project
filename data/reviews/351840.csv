"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kovos_Datch/recommended/351840/","Kovos_Datch","[GUG] Palmela Handerson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kovos_Datch/","133 products in account","Author's note: My play time on Steam does not reflect my actual play time. There was an issue with the game keeping track of the play hours. This bug has since been fixed.\n\nAuthor's note: I wrote a negative review about this game earlier. It actually compelled one of the owners to contact me so we could discuss some things. Because of this, some complaints were actually fixed or improved!\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? That is a really tough call. As it stands, I VERY HESITANTLY recommend this game.\n\n\nThere is a lot to like about this game.\n\nFirst, there is no shortage of items whatsoever. Many are quest items. Many can be equipped. Some are totally useless! In fact, there are so many items that it can be confusing!\n\nSecond, there are a fair number of classes to pick from and many items that each class can equip. Each class has its own perks and flaws.\n\nThird, there are job classes a person can pick from. For example, I am a blacksmith.\n\nFourth, there are plenty of monsters to fight. Each one has its own sprite.\n\nFifth, there is a decent sized world to explore.\n\nSixth, there are a lot of quests in the game. Apparently there is an overarching quest in the game as well.\n\nSeventh, the music for the game is pretty good.\n\nEighth, there are minigames as well!\n\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks with the game as well.\n\nFirst, the game's store on their website is a tad distressing. There are items in the store that you can buy automatically. The good news about that though is that you can also get those items in game. There are really expensive "quick levels" that you can buy in the store as well. $100 will max your character's level and his skills. Although I understand that hosting a game server costs money, I think being able to buy levels is kind of crummy. One of the owners and I talked this over. We both understood each others opinion.\n\nSecond of all, the community really sucks. Think a bunch of 20 year olds acting like a bunch of 12 year olds. No maturity. No accountability. Nothing. A big part of this game is the pvp factor. With pvp comes drama. With drama comes name calling and swearing. They have a right to say those things, sure. This is not a children's game or community.\n\nNOTE: There is a swear filter for the game, but is not working at the moment. One of the owners was alerted to this because of my other review and said it would be fixed.\n\nThird, there isn't much direction in the game. I'm okay when a game doesn't hold my hand, but they ploped me into a world and I had no idea what I was doing. One of the owners and I talked it over and they are seeing what they can do to help newer players more. From my understanding, there is a larger quest that needs to be done. I think it's sort of like a puzzle where you need to go off to one place, get an item, take it to another person, who will give you an item, to take it to another person to give you another item, etc. However, after 10 hours of playing this game, I still have yet to find the starting point of it.\n\nFourth, people in this game are solid. You can't walk through them. So if someone wanted to block a path and not be afk, but fishing or something, they totally could. This can be useful for quests and pvp, but it could also be abused.\n\n\nAfter speaking to one of the owners, I realized that they really do care about the community and new players. The idea for this game is cool. The execution of it needs some work. However, I think this game might really turn into something great.","April 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","68","81","6","2"

Didn't have any of those, game worked right away.\nIt did take about half an hour before I had a clue of what I was doing, things are explained at the beginning but you have to pay attention to the chat box! Anyhow.. once I continued playing it felt a little repetitive, mostly because I had just one attack button to spam.\n\nIt felt a bit like I was playing a mix between tibia and runescape. I have to say, the music of this game is pretty darn awesome. And it has some potential, I didn't have any magic yet, and heard someone say in chatbox there whasn't any yet. But once this is included, it should make the atck-spam button, obsolete. There is also Lumberjacking, Mining and Fishing, to train proffesions like blacksmithing.\n\nThere is plenty to do for now, but also plenty to be implemented into the game, mostly things which will make the endgame much more enjoyable. So for now, you can play, test it out and help the community grow. Having some fun with an oldschool style rpg. Hacking and Slashing, to get your loots and buy that awesome weapon you always wanted..\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR_FqeV92C4","March 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","3"
