The only thing GDT has on MGT is being able to build and distribute consoles, which could possibly be added in the future. (I'm not going to compare this game to Software Inc, because it's more about software in general and doesn't go into too much depth(yet) with game development like this and others in the genre).\n\nFeatures\n\n-Build each room within your building, giving you more control over your company (you can have 100's of employees if you want, it gets a little hard to manage in it's current state, but hopefully that will be fleshed out more)\n\n-Employees skills raise by developing/working (Game Dev has this as a mod, but I feel it works better in this game) also the skills make more sense (GameDesign, Programming, Graphics, Music & Sound, Office Work, Speed, Work Will).\n\n-Employee needs (Bathroom, heating/cooling, and furnishings)\n\n-Research new genres, topics, engine features, game sizes (B - AAA), and game improvements.\n\n-Has WAY more Genre and game topics than GDT, and there is no game genre/topic matching (which never made sense to me, there's no such thing as a bad genre/topic match in the real world, only bad games).\n\n-Release updates/patches for your games after release. (In the beginning you won't be able to fix bugs during development, but you can after release by either patching the game, which will remove a lot of bugs. You can update the game and choose to remove some bugs while also improving the game, which will improve sales as well).\n\n-Eventually you can have seperate rooms to improve your game:\n~Game Design (Remove bugs during development and improve gameplay, also where you make game reports)\n~Music Studio (obviously improves music/sound)\n~Graphic Studio (dem textures)\n~Motion Capturing (recently added, I'm not to sure on the specifics, but I believe it improves graphics/gameplay)\n\n-Sell developed game engines and make money off games made with them (you can select the initial price of the engine and the % you receive from sales)\n\n-Customer support room to keep your fans happy once you reach a certain amount. Can also run campaigns to increase fan base\n\n-Publish your game through other companies (they will produce and distribute your game, and occasionally market it).\n\n-Publish your own games! (To do this you need a production room and a storeroom. You can actually choose how many copies of a game you want to make, including the price and things like a t-shirt, game manual etc. You can also re-release older games and eventually release game packages)\n\n-Marketing!\n\n-Build a Server room and release your own MMOs! (Yes Game Dev Tycoon has MMOs too, but it works so much better in this game) You actually choose the Subscription price of your game and have to have enough servers to support your subscribers. Unlike other games, once your MMO stops selling copies it stays on the market, and you can release expansion packs. Expansion packs will act as seperate games (in terms of sales and marketing), but it will also make your base MMO start selling again. There is also a F2P option that is not usable at the moment, so hopefully the way MMO's work in general will be improved.\n\n-Licenses for movies, books, or other games that you can buy. I honestly don't even use this feature as it's not necessary and there's always another game already released under every license anyway so I don't really see the point.\n\nPossible negatives\n\n-(This one really isn't a big deal, but it annoys me). I'm not sure if the Dev is foreign, but the FPS genre is called Ego-Shooter. Never heard this term before and I don't like it at all, I could see "Ego-shooter" being used for more arcadey style games like Doom, Serious Sam, and maybe even COD to an extent, but it's not a term used in the U.S.\n\n-Managing huge teams can be annoying if you want to make sure you have the best people for each room. There is an auto-assign feature, but I'm not sure how it decides to assign employees.\n\n-As I stated before, you can't create consoles like in GDT, but hopefully it will be added.\n\n-The aspects of controling the way your game turns out (other than the skills of your employees) have specific settings for each genre that are considered "correct", but in my opinion GDT's sliders don't work much better.\n\n-No real End game as of yet, and no New game+ like GDT has.\n\n-Each genre has pictures for your game that depend on the level of technology applied used, but don't differ between topics. Ex. if you make a Fantasy Rpg and a Knight Rpg on the same engine, the pictures will be the exact same. Granted no other game in this genre has this from what I've seen.\n\nIf you enjoyed GDT then buy this game, it's way better IMO. I believe this game is worth the price even if it's not finished.","December 11, 2015","true","156.7"," 79 of 81 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","79","81","3","6"

The success of games seems to depend entirely on the amount of "points" invested into them.

Now this might be due to the fact that due to the abovementioned problem, ALL my games were getting 90%+ reviews no matter what I did, but essentially I ended up with unlimited money at some point.\nThere is also not a really good progression system. Basically my first smash hit allowed me to go straight from a small studio to a huge office building, hire 40+ people and spam games with multiple production rooms/studios. Simultaneously, I could train a dozen code-monkeys in the training room which are now maxed out in most stats and producing the aforementioned >90% games en masse.\n\nNow of course a lot of this might still be due to alpha status and might get finetuned down the road, but at its current state I would not recommend the game.\nOverall, it does not handle its own complexity well and is fairly easy to exploit. A lot of refining in regards to the ingame economy is needed in order to make it more challenging & fun, so buying it now is really kind of a gamble.","January 15, 2015","false","9.8"," 219 of 309 people (71%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","71","219","309","20","9"

You can’t deny that Mad Games Tycoon does not seem a bit similar to Game Dev Tycoon (I guess a lot), but this is not a bad thing. I personally loved Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon deserves love in its own light. The one thing that really sets Mad Games Tycoon apart from Game Dev Tycoon is the fact that it allows so much more customization.(Office Upgrades, Storefronts, Paintings, Plants, different desks, and bookshelves One of the huge draws that Game Dev Tycoon had for me was all of the references to real life game companies and devices; Mad Games Tycoon only expands on this and creates even more amazing references and jokes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategypony/recommended/341000/","strategypony","Tidal Charm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategypony/","138 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMad Games Tycoon is a game with an identity crisis. It's not sure whether it wants to be an economic simulator for the games market, or a game studio micro-management simulator, and because of that it fails pretty poorly at both. A lot of the reviews laud the game for doing more than Game Dev Tycoon, but Game Dev Tycoon's simplicity is part of why the game is attractive.\n\nThe micro-management in MGT is quite tedious at times. When you create a game, you have to select all the priorities, focuses etc. This part is fine. You then have to click on your graphics department and improve the graphics, then click on the audio department and improve the audio, then click on the QA department and improve the gameplay, then click on the motion capture studio and improve the filming & animation. Six times for each of these departments. Similarly, you'll need to micro-manage your production department.\n\nThe marketing department can auto-repeat its campaigns, but I'd like to see this expanded into a queue system, where you can give a department jobs and have each job executed when the last finishes. I'd also like to see the ability to link up the QA, graphics & audio departments with a specific development department, so that when I start making a game, those departments automatically queue the improvements I've researched (or at least, so that when I add things to my queue, they're automatically done on the right game).\n\nThe development cycle is also very inaccurate. My team of 16 developers (plus 4 QAs, 4 graphics, 4 audio, 4 motion capture) could barely put out an MMO *expansion* every 3 years. Treyarch is a similar-sized studio, and they can put out a full AAA title every 2 years.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon has a 'hype' system which allows me to predict my game's sales. In MGT, I can run a media campaign but I can't have any idea how much it's influenced sales, how many people it's reached etc. It would be great to see more media interactions like interviews, followup articles when my games reach landmark sales or news about my competitors' games.\n\nThis brings me onto the other side of the coin, the market simulation. It feels like MGT is trying to simulate a market, this is something I really wanted in Game Dev Tycoon, but it's a very poor simulation.\n\nThe competition never seem to decline. They grow until they are valued at $200 million, and then grow no more. A market simulation should correctly simulate their studios in the same way it simulates mine, with the games produced, their scores and their marketing determining which companies thrive and which die and/or are bought. Similarly, I've not seen any of the console manufacturers die. Atari, Sega, Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony are all active in 2050 in my game, all sitting between 8 and 20% market share.\n\nIf you're going to simulate this, you'd also need a better media engine to display the information to the player. My competition are buying each other? The RPG market is saturated right now because 5 AAA RPGs were announced at E3 this year? Right now it feels like the competition only exist to be bought and to offer me terrible games to publish. Similarly, the studios I buy, even after being upgraded to 5 stars, rarely give me a game with higher than a 70% score. These studios were winning Game of the Year before I bought them.\n\nCompanies should be created (it wouldn't be hard to create random company names) on a regular basis, most would go out of business after one game, but some would go on to be a success. Companies should buy each other. Publishers should buy developers. 'Franchises' should exist, which have fans (separate from company fans) and are transferred when you buy their owners.\n\nMinor bones to pick:\n- Random game titles destroy immersion, 'Rabbit Quest' the sports simulation and 'Ice Hockey Manager' the ego shooter? Please create lists of topic/genre specific terms and a better algorithm to create the names.\n- Engines are ridiculous. I managed to get from 1980 to 1995 without releasing a game. I just researched, created engines and sold them for $0 + 40% of profit. I made an absolute killing and got to my 3rd office this way.\n- The game is too easy. By the end I could buy all the devs for pocket change, and none of them grew to my size/scale.\n- No Linux/Mac support in 2015.\n- Performance was poor even on modern (i7, 8GB RAM, Intel HD4000) hardware.\n- The Marketing menu doesn't have a confirm button. ALL of the other menus do. This has caused me to waste $ on the wrong campaigns multiple times.\n- Staff item requirements are ridiculous. I had to buy a cheap refridgerator for my staff room even though I already had the expensive one, had to buy an orange chair in an office where everything was blue, etc.\n\nThe game is not without its positives, you really do get a lot of choice, and a lot of control over the focus and design of your studio. You get to know your staff, you can train your teams; you can find a publisher, self-publish or even publish other studios' games. The game has charm and can be enjoyable at times. It's just that the lack of difficulty and a deeper market simulation overshadows the positives.\n\nMGT has a lot of ambition, but really isn't well-tuned in any of it. It is in early access, and if the developers can tighten the scope a little and fix the balance issues, it shows promise to become the forerunner in this emerging niche. Until the developers make the changes I've mentioned, though, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend their money on this title.","December 31, 2015","false","17.4"," 156 of 231 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","156","231","10","16"

It's one of the few early access games I've bought, but I'm irrationally obsessed with Game Dev sims like Game Dev Tycoon and Game Dev Story. Eggcode's take on game dev management adds much needed customization options and depth to the experience by allowing you to build rooms and assign employees to specific rooms to perform specific tasks.\n\nBefore I get to the bad, I would like to say up front that I freaking love this game. I've had tons of fun and I think it's absolutely worth the purchase if you enjoy tycoon games or want another take on the Game Dev Tycoon style of management sims. The team at Eggcode is a standout example of how to do early access right and deserves recognition for their constant bug fixes and content patches that range from adding new rooms and employees to improving the UI.\n\nThat's also part of the frustration of this game. I'm sure that this was a gameplay choice, but having to build special rooms for certain tasks gets annoying. For example, the games core development all happens in one room. Bug fixes have to take place in a seperate room for QA. If it takes the QA team longer to squash the bugs than it takes for the core team to finish development on the game, the development room is rendered useless until you choose to launch the game. Not to mention, the development team can't help fix bugs unless they're dragged away from development and pushed into the QA room. I get that the music studio, art offices and motion capture rooms should be standalone, but why can't the core staff improve level design?\n\nThat is my biggest issue. Everything else is a minor problem. I don't like how many clicks it takes to assign tasks to almost every room except for the development rooms. The UI isn't that great. The art isn't terribly nice to look at and I wish there were more (or custom) logos to choose from. But the art didn't effect my enjoyment.\n\nLike I mentioned above, I love this game. It's fun and I've lost afternoons to this game. I can't wait to see how Eggcode continues to improve this already enjoyable game.","July 24, 2015","true","100.5"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"

Sorry.***\n\nAllow me to preface by saying that I own both the Kairosoft original 'Game Dev Story' on my phone as well as the similar release Game Dev Tycoon here on steam. Huge fan of both, but there was always something missing in a way. I feel like this game takes the things that I liked about both of those games(time/micro management), removes the things that I didn't like(RNG), and adds a few new things to keep me engaged(building)! I spent all day playing this yesterday without even realizing it.\n\nHow do they compare? Here is my breakdown so far:\n\nGame Dev Story/Tycoon- You reasearch technology and genres while doing contracts in between for extra cash so that you can eventually release big titles, gain fans, and maybe even take over the world? The not so fun thing about these games was that if you got lucky and managed an amazing score on a certain game, future releases would be forever held to that standard which in turn made it very tedious to try and stay afloat while releasing a quality product that your fans would like. Half of the time the score would seem a bit random even if you did all the right things like combining the right genres and putting your strongest team to work on the more dificult parts. It would get frustrating when you would lose power or your machines would break down, ruining all progress on any of the titles you work on. This isn't so bad at first, but it happens more as the game goes on which effectively makes the time and care you put into making a good game title pointless. You also had to grind out 'Research Points' to be able to learn about anything which took valuable time away from making money among other things. In short, while fun at first, but was hurt by seemingly RNG mechanics and too much micro management which I never thought possible.\n\nMad Games Tycoon- Still research everything from technology to genres but it only requires money. You can actually design your game company with special rooms just for your developers, researchers, marketers, customer service reps, etc. You can even build a warehouse/production area so you can publish all your games in house and watch them fill the shelves! It made it really easy for me to keep track of who does what and making sure they were on task. You don't have to worry about a previous game's high score effecting future releases with unrealistically imposed standards. You don't lose power or progress and your employee stats are much clearer and easier to gain. You don't have to grind research or any other kind of currency besides just money which allows me to spend my time doing other things to help my company thrive. Training your employees is much less costly and everything from their stats to the game creation seems to be a lot more streamlined. I also love that you can change where any of your employees are working with a simple click and drag.\n\nAs far as early access titles go, this product is pretty polished! My only gripes are that once your company starts to get REALLY big the game starts to struggle with the load. I had the big 2 room office which is the largest one you can get and while most things were still running smoothly, the hiring window was really laggy. I also wish there was a way to hit pause on the game time while a dialog box is open notifying me of something so I don't lose time in between tasks.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\nThis game, like its predecessors, can be very unforgiving at first til you learn how everything works. Expect to restart your game a few times within the first hour of playing as you get the hang of it.\n\nDon't be afraid to exlpore and make mistakes. Try new things! When in doubt, save first! You can reload if things go badly.\n\nYou have toggles on the bottom of your screen in case you keep accidentally picking up furniture when trying to click an employee.\n\nKeep an eye out for a sad face icon on the lower left hand side of your screen. That is your employees trying to tell you they need something to thrive. It's usually shelves or fire extinguishers so fix it. Otherwise they work at half their normal speed.","May 11, 2015","true","18.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","0"

It has a lot more things to do game play wise then GDT and feels more enjoyable even in early access but definitly does feel like it suffers from the same issue of GDT of each genre having a perfect slot for the sliders  to get the best sales, so doesn't really let you make silly things unless its in the tending right now things.\n\nWith that said, if you hated GDT then this probably isn't for you, if you thought GDT was meh but like tycoon games like Theme Hospital, Rollercoster tycoon, et then you may find this game enjoyable even though it has some of the same issues as GDT. And if you enjoyed GDT and hate normal Tycoon games then you may not like it, and if you liked GDT and love other tycoon games then you will probably love it.\n\nAll in all it's definitly not a must buy, but this is definitly much more of a tycoon game then GDT was and has more things to do.

In my opinion it delivers enough to be worth buying at this stage of development. Be aware though, it's much different from Game Dev Tycoon. Thats either a pro or a con, depending on the way you look at it. I think its a pro and both games are fun in their own way. One isn't better then the other, they're different and can both be lots of fun.\n\nIf i would compare Game Dev Tycoon with Mad Games Tycoon i would say GDT has more focus on the game development and less on business simulation, where as MGT is much more of business simulation tycoon. For example: in MGT you spend relativly more time on upgrading your building, producing games in your factory and managing your staff. And creating a good game itself isn't much of a challange in MGT, compared to GDT.\n\nPro's:\n- enough content to meet the expectations at this stage of development\n- lots of charts and stats to play with\n- gameplay looks promising, with the more content and challanges it can be a pretty nice game\n- actual business simulation elements in it, havn't seen that for a while in a game!\n- lots of fun possibilities, like your own game factory\n\nNeutral:\n- okay graphics and sound, nothing special\n- could use some customization options for the charts\n\nCon's:\n- controls are a bit sloppy, but can be changed pretty easy i assume\n- creating games isn't much of a challange, it does'nt have to copy GDT but it could be made a bit more challanging\n- at the point where you run a big business, it gets a bit hard to keep oversight... this could use some work","July 15, 2015","true","18.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

To be honest, of all the titles I own (early acces I mean) I only regret a single purchase. And that's because the title in question went from alpa then to beta and then to full release in a single update. But that's not relevant here so that's the last I'm going to say about that. My point I was trying to make is that early access is ALWAYS a risk.\n\nYou know what you are buying in advance and if the game doesn't pan out... Well then that's tough luck.\n\nIt is for that reason that early access titles in general are hard to review or to be more precise, it's hard to give a good review about it because the damn thing isn't finished yet.\n\nBut at the same time... Is it an excuse? For example, there are many things that could be considered a 'negative' about this title. The majority of the tooltips are missing. Adding those would surely not take all that long right? But on the other hand, that is not something that could be considered a priority.\n\nCompleting the tool tips would in my opinion be something you could correct when you are finishing the game up.  Another 'negative' point about this game is the fact that the first language of the dev is german. It isn't English. So the English is a bit... Weird to say the least at times. Humorous but in that 'what the heck is this supposed to mean' kind of thing that makes you smile if only for a moment.\n\nThe third and last negative point I will give as an example is the fact that the graphics are seemingly unfocussed and will definetly never win any awards. But that was never in question. I mean, a game like this doesn't NEED state of the art graphics. What would be the point?\n\nThose negative points aside there is also a lot of fun to be had. You can try (and fail in my case) to try and remain a single man developer in an effort to simulate an indy company. Or you can decide for yourself that you're not going to hire more then say five people and that each has to be highly specialized, that you're never going to produce your own games and various other limits. Of course these aren't in game and rely solely on what you decide for yourself.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out what would get me a good game. My first games were all beneath fifty. Heck, I was lucky if I got one over thirty five. Then I managed to publish a hit (over eigthy points if I remember right) and the millions start rolling in.\n\nOf course then I got over confident and before I knew it, my millions had gone to 'only' a few thousand in cash.\n\nThere are many people who ask this question: how does this game relate to game dev tycoon?\n\nDon't compare them. Each game has its down and upsides in the way they do things. One is finished, the other is not. So again, you can't really compare them YET.\n\nEach game does things differently. Differently enough that it is hard to compare them with each other.\n\nSo here is my conclussion.\n\nThe dev can certainly use some improvement when it comes to the english l language. After all, and especially if you publish on steam, where the majority of the language is English, knowing and mastering the English language is a must.\n\nShould you buy the game? I myself don't regret buying it and I think that neither will the buyer. If you are unsure then watch some gameplay or let's play video's on youtube. It is what I did myself and if you still aren't convinced then just wait until it gets a sale again.\n\nKingdark","February 11, 2015","true","15.8"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","2"

The devs deny it but can't help question the likeness. Regardless, Mad Games Tycoon has more in common with Game Dev Tycoon, except that MGT is more indepth and has a lot more too it.\n\nAlready as an early access title, its got enough features to keep you entertained. Where as Game Dev Tycoon is more of a mobile type of game, and rather simple in design, Mad is designed to be more PC worthy in that it has a lot more features such as running your own production machines, storage and servers for online games that you have to setup. You also have to setup a support team for technical support, and keep your dev team happy and productive with amenities dotted abuot the office. Although I've yet to see any direct consequences of NOT having stuff around to keep your employee morale up, it may become more prominent later on.\n\nThere's also the fact that you can essentially build your own office and place things where you need them. Mad Games Tycoon definitely reminds me of an old PC game called 'Startup' that had a lot of these features, but in the end was a very poor implementation. MGT seems to have gotten it right, so far at least.\n\nTheir are a few shortfalls however that the game lacks that I hope the devs work on in the future, this including staff categories and perhaps a more immersive background experience, perhaps a road and some animated cars/people walking by including all the noise that comes with that?\n\nI'm also not sure if modding features are ever going to be supported, but hopefully they will.\n\n\nRegardless, if you liked Game Dev Tycoon, or even, if you didn't like it and thought it was too simple, then I can recommend this as so far its a great title, and it looks to improve even more in the near future.","January 8, 2015","true","20.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","1"

I waited with much eagerness for some kind of update or sequel but sadly none was forthcoming.  Well thankfully this game came along and I really couldn't be happier.  My review will compare it to Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nPROS:\n\nGame is slower - it really allows for you to get stuck in and enjoy all the little components that involve running your company.  Also allows for you to keep up with the market instead of being one step behind all the time.\n\nMore to develop - Not only can you develop games but you can also develop game engines (which is a great way to make some money) this is a lovely touch.  There is also more to develop in terms of what you want in your game.  Plus when you come to produce your own game you have some freedom to decide what to include in the box and how much you want to sell it for.  There are also many more genre's and topics\n\nBuildings - it's refreshing to be able to build and equip your own offices.  Much more freedom to decide how much you want to spend/how many people you want working on something.\n\nStaff Training - much easier, much quicker and much more effective\n\nCONS:\n\nCan get annoying when people won't work for you because you don't have a certain fridge or seat.  In some cases I have had the luxury version but people won't work for me because I didn't have the cheaper version.\n\nUI can get a little annoying.  I can't think of how to describe it but the expanding boxes type of thing becomes monotonous and you have to go through a few boxes sometimes to get what you want.  Be good to be able to pick multiple things too, especially when selecting platforms.  The screen can become a little cluttered also.  Be nice if the full screen would work but I can't seem to get it to do so.\n\nNo ability to develop your own console (at least not that I have found).\n\nNo tutorial although it is easy enough to figure out.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis is a really good game and I'm sure it will continue to improve.  It is far better than Game Dev Tycoon and provides an enjoyable gaming experience.\n\n","May 14, 2015","true","10.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

This game is definitely at the forefront of Simulators for game making. Not that the "topic" is flooded at the moment, but I've played them all mostly.\n\nMad Games Tycoon gives lots of options and locations for building your company, not just office or studio, but eventually a game making conglomerate. It's lots of fun getting there too, buying or making game engines to power your games, hiring and firing employees and making them do thankless menial work like customer support, it gives you a good sense of being a di- i mean boss.\n\nThe games gets continuous updates since its release and continues to improve, and I hope it does because even though I've thouroughly enjoyed it it's falling a tad bit into a gameplay pitfall. It uses the same slider method of "making games" as other simulators. My problem with this is this is not a good method in my opinion, because it's easily solved by opening a guide and just notching as you see to get appropriate scores.\n\nPretty much all aspects of getting a good score for a game can be solved by opening a guide.\n\nAt that point all the fun goes out the window. Game making suddenly becomes less about making funny/cool games and more about copy-pasting a recipe for a profitable game. I know you're saying, "Oh, then don't look at a guide if you don't want to be EA!". Well, failing over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, to eventually get to the point where you're basically writing a guide that's already been written, is not fun either. At least not to me.\n\nBesides that aspect of Mad Games Tycoon, the fact that the bathrooms are the hardest rooms use space in efficiently, and the like it or hate it graphics they got going on, I sure can recommend it, because I had a blast playing it! If you loved Game Dev Tycoon, Game Dev Tycoon, and the like, you're prolly gonna love this!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Subenu/recommended/341000/","Subenu","CultureGeek/Sven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Subenu/","539 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI love Game Dev sims. Game Dev Story was one of those games that managed to burn away many hours of my life. It still is one of my favourite games on my iPhone. And for a long time, it was also pretty much the only game of its kind. Thankfully, Game Dev Tycoon came out in 2012. While it managed to be similar to the aforementioned game, it was also a bit more complex and supported mods. I played it a lot back in the day, but it never became an evergreen for me. Thankfully, Mad Games Tycoon has been in Early Access for some time now and I think it's the right moment to write this little review of it.\n\nMad Games Tycoon takes a similar, but more complex approach to the topic at hand: You start off in a garage, alone, with your new company and you immediately get to build rooms, Theme Hospital-style. You even get to buy furniture, which has some impact on hiring new employees for your young studio. More talented people only pop up, if your company has enough stars, which in turn are determined by the quality of furniture you have in your office. At the beginning, you won't have a lot of stars, since you need most of your money in order to finance your first games. While they are cheap to produce at the beginning, you have running costs, like the salaries of your employees and of course the upkeep of your studio.\n\nProducing games is relatively simple at first. You define the name, genre and focus of your game. Each genre has a different focus, so you'll have to experiment and invest in a quality assurance department in order to find out what's the perfect mix. The closer you get, the higher the critics score your game and the better your game will sell. Later on, you can even combine some genres, but some combinations work better than others. You also take care of updating your games, which can have a positive impact on sales.\n\nWhile this certainly sounds easy enough, there are additional things you can take care of. You can decide to develop your engines yourself, which has the added benefit that you can sell said engine to other game producers and get a fraction of the money they make with games that use your engine. This means you'll also have to invest time and money into research. Buying a licence for a third party engine is an option too, of course, but you'll be loosing a portion of your profits.\n\nWhen your games start getting bigger, you'll need to invest in a quality assurance department and dedicated graphics, music and motion capture studios, in order to improve those areas of your games. This also means you'll need bigger offices quick and this is where one of my biggest problems with this game can be found: When you get a new office, you'll need to build all your departments from scratch and reassign your entire workforce. Now, this is manageable the first time around, but it gets tough quickly. In one of my games, I had a workforce of over 100 people and it was impossible to assign them properly in a timely manner. Sure, you have the possibility to arrange them by five different attributes, but that is not enough. The game lacks a filter for unassigned workforce, which makes life harder than it needs to be. Maybe this will be added at some point later in the development.\n\nThe latest addition to the game is console development. While it doesn't look like it's completely integrated yet, it is pretty awesome to research and develop your own console and push it on the market to let it go up against the NES. You can set the price for your console and developing for it is pretty cheap. Unfortunately, right now I haven't managed to develop an exclusive title that turned a profit...\n\nWhile the gameplay is fun and the systems are comprehensive, the presentation still leaves a bit to be desired. Graphics are simple, yet functional and the music is ok for the first couple of hours but soon starts to get on your nerves. Some soundeffects are overused, especially the telephone, which thankfully can be switched off separately. Performance takes a notable hit too when there are more than 100 people working in your studio.\n\nWhile these are some important complaints I have about the game, I'm also certain that at least some of those things will improve over time.

You, the reader already knows that you are your own game development company, but more of a Sims effect is placed in the game, because you the owner are to create different rooms including development, research, etc. and place objects in there including desks, etc. The more starred things you purchase, the better employees you hire and the further efficient your staff and you are.\n\nMaking the games is a fun process. It varies each game you produce, but it can get annoying considering it gives you hints as to whether which side you should make your game. For example, do you choose more of a focus on graphics over gameplay or vice versa, and after creating a game for that genre, it would give a suggestion to go to say, the graphics side of things. It can get very easy and with the limited amounts of genres and topics, it is easy to reproduce the same type of game with the same focus under a different name and get a high rating.\n\nThe game however, is in early access still (I'd say mid Alpha as there aren't all features implemented yet) and for right now, the basics are there, they just have to be developed more. For example, I'd love to have more of a intertwine between the games you make and how that affects the NPC world, does it affect the sales of your competitors, or vice versa. The similarities are there with Game Dev Tycoon, but I think both are distinct. They follow the same basic guideline of making games, but both do so in a different way and I personally think Mad Games Tycoon is much more in-depth so far than Game Dev Tycoon, especially in the Alpha stage.\n\nThe later part of the game (Past 2010) is not fully developed yet. The NPC companies work still the same, but I find an unbalanced effect happening. Playing in easy, by 2010, I have released about 10 games with three hitting first on the all-time charts, by 3x what the NPC game was. My three would final sell at 13+ million copies while the highest NPC one would be 4.5 million. Another example is, less features pop-up following 2010 and I have noticed by 2020, the game has stopped releasing consles, features to develop, but NPCs still release there games. To expand on this though, I'd think that everything hasn't been implemented purely because with all features so far in the game being researched, there is 41 or 42 features (and with the improvements in features like parallex scrolling compared to basic scrolling) the usable count in a AAA game (mind you, AAA games allow 50 features max) is about 33. Thats my own real flaws as it can become increasingly easy late game, but then again, I'm playing on easy and haven't really tested the higher difficulties as I had did a full playthrough of normal, but that was prior to a patch recently while buffed the difficulties of all levels.\n\nAt the moment, I'd say buy the game. I have had two full run throughs in about 10 hours, with the game setting on easy and me fast forwarding everything. It isn't a full finished product yet and the updates are regular (actually the updates coming every week or week and a half and if a hotfix is needed, a hot fix comes about 2-3 days following), though in saying that it is solid enough to have run throughs without being bored. The use of NPCs which are a major hit, different variaties of producing the game including motion capture studio, etc. and the building effect make this game a solid outing thus far, more in-depth than GDT personally, and with a suggestion thread that the developer usually follows apart from his own wishlist (though the thread will stop recieving suggestions on April 30th), the game will improve along the way and become better.\n\nCurrently, a rating is not needed but I recommend buying it at your own risk. For the average player that plays this, you can easily get 15 hours out of the game minimum, and I haven't done that yet because I had only bought it a week ago, though I have only had playthroughs mainly on easy, and will go to the next difficulty soon. If you are still hesitant following my review, if you do like these types of game, wait until it goes on sale because if it does on the summer sale, it will most likely be 50% off and will be $7.50, though sale or no sale, I think it is a must buy for the management fan.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

It combines aspects from games like GamersGoMakers and Game Dev Tycoon to make an amazing Game Studio Simulation. An all round super-fun game.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing office building and customization\n-Brilliant Character customization\n-Unlocks system is a very good concept\n-Much more historical than other games, the vanilla game features a lot more platforms to develop for\n-Any Game Dev Tycoon player or GamersGoMakers player will know the feeling when you make a game engine then 2 days later there are new things to research which make your games better, well in Mad Games Tycoon you can improve old engines by adding stuff to them after release. You can also sell your engines for other companies to buy!\n-Adding in things to improve your games like Copy Protection, Buying engines and rooms like the Graphic and Music studio, Customer Support and Quality Assurance are great!\n-Being able to self-publish games is super cool, being able to choose what goes into the box when you sell your game is also just fantastic.\n-Being able to make patches, bug fixes, MMO Addons and Langauge packs for released games is awesome\n-Many other features which generally make the game amazing...\n\nCons:\n-AI pathfinding when you put them in a room can be messed up\n-Game isn't very challenging after a while\n-Could do with a workshop so the Community can create mods (more topics, genres, consoles etc.)\n\n\n9.5/10 And its still in Development! Hopefully if they can fix some of the issues and add a few more features then the game will be a 10/10. In my opinion better than Game Dev Tycoon and GamersGoMakers, would reccomend highly.","March 30","true","23.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Although it has it's flaws, it's an outstanding game. There is something that I just keep wanting to be added in...\n\n-Franchises/IP- Wouldn't it be cool to create your own IP even bigger than Mario or The Legend Of Zelda series? I always thought it was cool and it'll be super funn to do this. And you can crete cross overs with your own IP and even Ip from other companies! Also make a couple spin off games and have the option to include third party characters in too!\n\n-MMO Expansion Packs- MMO's get a lot of money and stay alive for quite some time and it'll be even better to create expansion paks for them. After a while, your MMO just stops selling and it never sells anymore until all subscribers unsubscribe. It'll be awesome if you can create an expansion pack and it suddenly just boosts up your sales and it can either increase your subscibers or just decrease at its normal rate depending on how good the game was rated.\n\n-CONSOLES- You need to create consoles in this game. It's a must! Something cool to do as well is also develop a console with partnering with another developer/company to increase the sales, but you would have to give some profit to your helper (Maybe we can decide how much control they have. The  better it sells but less income for you, but little income , and when you give them little control, the console sells less, but you get more profit)\n\nAnd that's pretty much it!

From a strategic standpoint, as well as various gameplay options, it provides a deeper experience than Game Dev Tycoon (not to continually compare the two, but I'm having a difficult time avoiding that).\n\nThe added element of designing how to utilize your blank work spaces was a welcome wrinkle, as compared to other games of this type.\n\nI've purchased and played Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, as well as Game Dev Story on mobile.

It's already completely enjoyable to play and feels feature complete for the price tag.\n\nThere are a couple of games similar to Game Dev Tycoon out there and this one has become my favourite, because it just keeps throwing features, genres, technologies and stuff at you all the time, basically incorporates the entire Game Developing and Console Developing features from GameDevTycoon while improving on it.\n\nIf you have played Gamers Go Makers or GameCorp DX you will realize that the genre actually offers a lot of possibilities in regards of adding rooms and facilities. Mad Games is the only game in the field that let's you create big teams doing different things in different rooms with a decent presentation.\n\nIn addition you get stuff like MMOs with a Server Room, Sequels for great games and Add-Ons for the MMOs.\n\nThe game development itself is pretty much the same in all games. You can use look-up-tables on the net to create the perfect game or stumble your way to perfection with your own table, or memory. With all the Genres and Topics in the game you will probably go crazy making your own table and definitely unable to remember everything that worked with all the sliders.\n\nMad Games not only takes the "hint" feature that Game Dev Tycoon introduced with a patch, but it also lets you re-apply the same setup from a previous project. The advantage being, that you can develop an RPG, then a Sports Game and then another RPG, load the RPG settings and re-adjust from there on out, instead of being forced to manually switch everything back from Sports to RPG. And thanks to the "hints" that appear, the more you develop within a certain topic/genre mix, the more of those hints you will see and the better your team becomes.\n\n\nIs it the perfect game? Not by a long shot.\n\nIt's way too easy too be a successfull developer and the result is that I have no idea how platforms and genre mixes work.\n\nYour workers don't age and their wages are quite low in comparison to what they start earning for you. This makes the game easier, but on the other hand you don't get the management horror of a Software Inc. , which is nice.\n\nOnce you develope a great ♥♥♥♥♥♥me you are done. It's GG. You could say that this is realistic and you are probably right. Just look at the history of Blizzard. If you are going for money, go for subscribers. You can also release a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sports game every year without learning anything in the process or improving the engine, so that's realistic, but also too simple.\n\nOverall the best reimagination of the original GameDevTycoon concept by Greenheartgames. I'm sure we are going to see another one of those in the future that will surpass Mad Games, but for now I'm declaring it the best game developing tycoon out there.\n\nI wish there were more games in that style. Especially if they could switch from Game making into a more detailed movie making simulation. A blend of the classic Molyneux' The Movies with the now 2nd Generation Indie Management games would be the best.\n\nFor the presence, we have to stick with Mad Games Tycoon.","January 16","true","34.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

I like were they are going with this game. Game Dev Tycoon had small problems such as a limited staff to start off with. Also once you make one type of game you cannot make a game of the same type or it would bomb. I feel like that does not represent real life game development at all.\n\nMad Games Tycoon changes that. It keeps the similar layout that Game Dev Tycoon had and allowed for you to do what you want as many times as you want. Like to make mid evil rpgs make as many as you want. With that being said there are some problems with the game(Its in alpha to be expected).\n\nFirst MMOs do not make since. You can make your game have a subscription fee yet not have but a small fraction of the game sells have the subscription. Also with the production costs and server costs they make very little to no money.\n\nAlso right now it really doesn't have any type of penalty for making a game that makes no since such as some people have said in their reviews. You can make an music RPG/shooter and get game of the year. Of coarse stuff like this will more than likely implemented later down the road. Also if you get into the game some and hire a lot of people money will never be a problem. This is do to the fact that a game can get more than enough points to be game of the year if you have the staff, and make serious money from anything you develop.\n\nI will recommend the game if you have the money and don't care that it is in early development. If that is not the case pass until it releases in the coming months.","January 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The game feels similar due to a similar layout, a lot of similar functions, and even the music is oddly reminiscent of Game Dev Tycoon. The thing this game does well though, is that it locates a lot of the flaws in Game Dev Tycoon and fixes them. This could easily have been called Game Dev Tycoon 2 and no one would have doubted it for a second.\n\nI personally love that this game lets you have more than one development team, more than one research team, etc. It increases the pace at which your company grows immensly and it gives you more to do while waiting for a game to finish developing. The production element is also quite interesting, as you can print your own games and determine price, rarity and more. You are also able to buy other gaming companies, and release their games as your own, where you take the majority of the profit. While it's a fun element at first, it can get quite demanding if you own a lot of companies, as they produce a lot of games! If you're like me, you'll even forget to release your own games and instead just rake in 100+ million every year releasing other companies games.\n\nOverall, the game runs extremely well for an early access game. It has a lot of cool features and expands brilliantly on top of an already terrific design by Game Dev Tycoon. It'll be interesting to see what other features they have lined up for the completed version, but so far I love this game!","March 22, 2015","true","33.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","2"

Would I recommend it in its current state? Yes. Yes I would.\nI bought this game today, I played it non-stop and have now ran out of content after building my one man in his garage into an enormous empire with around $2270m. More content will be added in the future as a few rooms are locked and I assume more techonology advancements and the likes will be added, so fun fun!\n\nPros:\n\n+Its addicting, seriously.\n+The customisation for the rooms is interesting.\n+Plenty of choice and competition.\n+There is already a fairly large amount of content, even for an EA.\n+The graphics are nice and fit in well with the theme.\n+The choices when making a game are pretty cool and varied.\n+The different stats on your workers allow for some tactical placement early game.\n+Updates appear to come quickly and in response to community demand, which is nice for an EA! (Cough, Starforge, Cough)\n\nCons:\n\n-The music. God damn. I had to mute it after about 20 minutes as I felt an urge creeping upon me to douse my computer in petrol.\n-Placement of items is still a little so-so, I've bugged it a few times and had desks stuck in walls and objects placed over the tops of each other. (Just another minor issue with EA)\n-The MMORPG's subscribers drop off in drones randomly you are also unable to make expansions at the moment, if I'm wrong correct me. ( I just didn't see a way)\n-Once you have money, it is beyond easy regardless of difficulty.\n-Needs more level 3 publishers to allow for greater yeild on your prefered games. (Current set-up makes RPG's less than profitable)\n\n\nInteresting bits!\n* The random speech is quite fun actually, with strange little references to other games.\n* Some of the current bugs can be funny and are not particually game-breaking. (one of my workers was typing on a plant and cupboard)\n*The names - Seriously - They are great little knock offs. I love it!\n\n\nTo sum up, even in its current state it is well worth the purchase and the time. The developers are community-centric and update often with bug fixes and content. There is much more to come so pay up, support the developers and reap those rewards!\n\nCurrent rating: 7/10\n\n~Liquifiction","May 9, 2015","true","44.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Effective and fun.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n[ early access review @ 20 August 2015 ]\n\nThe topic chosen is quite appealing and I must comment on the alter-names and logos of all the companies I know by heart given I went through them all during my PC gamer life and those that really made history like Microprose, Ocean and Activision just to say a trio.\n\nThe graphic department is competent. It does what it is intended - gives movement, colour and life to a "time sheet". There are some issues with colours but nothing that takes away value. My guess is some further work on it.\n\nThe sounds are there. Mechanic types and directed mainly to the alerts and to signal the progression of the tasks being performed. Would enjoy some variation and explicity especially on the events like the games conventions and marketing campains.\n\nMad Games Tycoon mechanics are good and open way to great diversity. We have all the technical departments in place, at least the major ones and the liberty to self manage a dynamic shift of responsabilities on the different offices is notable when compared to other tycoons where there are limits. For example I can build mini offices with all the necessary departments and develop several projects at the same time. Other tycoons fail at this. A plus on this mechanic.\n\nThe Marketing and Customer department mechanics need more depth, after all they ARE one of the most important aspects of the gaming culture :) Also it would be top work if we get the reports for the campaigns.\n\nThe Games Engines part is weak at best. While games can be buggy the engines are flawless. I bet this part will change for the best so we can develop a subsidiary dedicated to engines with their own issues, so better branching par with the Production mechanics are needed.\n\nIn the optimization side, the game can demand a bit from the shared graphics laptops. With a dedicated graphics everything goes very smooth. This being said and from a propective buyer point of view one would expect a average specs laptop with an SSD to run it okay especially with all blows and whistles turned off. It is early access and this can change as well.\n\nTo close it, this will be a entertaining game. Very fun at this stage already even with all the raw mechanics.\n\nIf attention is given to the core rules of the game in the upcoming development cycle we might have a lot more to review.\n\nA great Indie project.","August 20, 2015","true","54.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Also, I have never written a worthwhile review before. This game changed my mind on both of those.\n\n***How I feel about Early Access and these developers***\nMy problem with early access, I've seen to many games cost $20+ for a game that is anywhere from 10-40% complete, and that just doesn't seem fair to the consumer. I have also heard when games have been sold cheap for Early Access but then has to be repurchased upon realease. Both of these are reasons that kept me away from Early Access. This team of developers has changed my mind on this. Eggcode has made me happy to finally be a pleased supporter of an Early Access game. They release a sizeable update approximately every week. It shows that they care about their project even though they could take the money and run right now. Also, when I bought this it was clear and upfront that the game was considered 15% whole. This was a great change than what I've seen. With each update it shows that they are listening to the customers and are on top of things like the small details such as March 24th when to numbers would display switched with each other. This didn't need to get tackled so rapidly, but they chose to be on top of even the small details.\n\n***The Game***\nThis may or may not be the most accurate depiction of the game based upon when you read it because updates are happening approximately weekly. The game had a good bell curve of difficulty. I felt like I was trying to climb and try every angle at the beginning with little success but enough to stay afloat. As you succeed at creating games or doing contract work you can afford to keep employees. They are not extremely dynamic yet, but after about 2 employees they start requiring items such as a couch for "sitting," vending machines, (humorously) toilets, arcade games, etc. These employees have monthly salaries which make you have to continue working. The employees cost more as they level up later in the game. You can train your avatar as well as your employees which lead to better games and faster contract work, but cost more as the get better.\n\nYour employees have multiple facets: making games, contract work to make some quick money, marketing to sell more games, customer service to keep your fan base happy, and research.\n\nThe games seem to change with time. At the beginning you can make a game that sells "enough" to keep you going, but as the game progresses your one man or woman indie game team won't keep you alive. Later in the game it does take a team to make good games happen fast enough to sell on whatever the current market is.\n\nThere is more to say about this game. I spent 20+ hours making 10+ billion dollars and called it quits at that point with a team of 25 fully trained game developers, 8 customer service pros, and 8 marketing pros. I look forward to "replaying" this game as the updates progress, and hopefully I can update this review as time progresses.\n\n?/10 the game isn't finished so this wouldn't be valid. It's an enjoyable game that goes at your pace. Late late game is a breeze, but other than that I have no complaints and this game is currently the best Game Tycoon game out there.\n\nThanks Eggcode for changing my mind about Early Access Games!\n","April 1, 2015","true","23.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It has a depth that no other game development sims have. The skill floor is just low enough to be able to jump in with just a little help from the tutorial, while the skill ceiling is unimaginably high. There are many ways to increase the efficiency of game production, from assigning staff to certain departments, making sure you're fitting the current trend, and even having a reasonable office layout. The different kind of company you can be also beats out any of the game's competition. You don't even have to rely solely on games.

The controls are a bit iffy and has a little learning curve but once you get the hang of that things get fun. Now you need to be prepared, this game is not at all like Game Dev Tycoon. Game Dev Tycoon focuses more on developing games to make money. Mad Games tycoon focuses on expanding and creating not just video games, but game engines as well as the layout and size of your building. There are a little things that can be frusterating when you make your first few games but once you get into the swing of things it's easy. In this respect the game is alot more immersive than GDT because you honestly never know what the finished product will be like. This game is great and even though there are a few buggy things (Which is to be expected when a game is in alpha) the dev team is working hard to fix it. 9/10 for the experience alone.","July 23, 2015","true","35.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It is such a 'feel good' game, on top of being an amazingly balanced 'sim' game. I always find myself coming back to it and making new game companiesm, and playing it in so many different ways.  The dev keeps adding in new ways to keep the game fresh, and each time it makes it fun to start again and get rich...well, of course after tanking a few comapanies.  But seriously, it's so awesome that he listens to community feedback, so +1 there.\n\nFor the most part it is a sim game where you build a game developing company.  Like all sim games, you must choose what to put your resources into, as well as hope for some good RNG on your side!\n\nHalf the time I play I make games like "The Second to Last Fantasy". or goofy pun names...and don't forget the go-to alliteration names.  The fans want a "Sports" game about "Robots" -  Robot Racketball!  They want a Puzzle game about Gangsters - Mafia Monopoly!\n\nOf course every now and then you try to actually come up with real sounding names and making a serious company, which is a whole new way of playing.  This game is just so fullfilling, from the kid in my, all the way to the adult in me.  I always get real nostalgic when I play it.\n\nI have played 100s of sim games in my life, they are by far one of my favorite genre of games, and I can easily say this game is in my top 5.

For an early access game, it is pretty much feature complete. It is much more in-depth, and has some great ideas that add to the game's realistic feel (like developing and selling engines to have a cut from the competitors profits). Unlike GDT, it includes some basic spatial management in the vein of Theme Hospital, meaning that you have to do some floor planning and deal with the furnishing issues. That isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I'm ok with this - if only you couldn't buy the best equipment available straight out from the beginning and had to unlock it instead. Production and marketing are supposed to be just as vital for your success as research and development. Speaking of which, Mad Games Tycoon is always telling what technology you are researching (rather than using the generic '3D graphics level 2') and even showing what the game you are developing is supposed to look like (not without some quirks - I have developed a FPS using the early 90s technologies, but the screenshot was more like Counter Strike).\n\nSo far, all of the concepts implemented in Mad Games Tycoon look good, and the only issues are the game balance (for instance, once you have unlocked the engine development, you can switch to it and never bother with developing actual games to stay afloat), the interface that requires some easing into, and the updates that break your savegame compatibility. All of these issues are perfectly normal and excusable for an early access game. I'd like to add that during my 30-odd hours of gameplay I've not had a single crash, which is a no small feat for an EA game either.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n\n+More content and depth than the other games of that genre;\n+Frequent and meaningful updates;\n+Stability.\n\nCons:\n\n-Balance issues;\n-Some major updates break the savegame compatibility;\n-User interface.\n\n\nBottom line:\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who is into that genre/topic.","February 18","true","64.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Unlike "Game Dev Tycoon", you can build your own rooms (though not the building itself).  I also like the fact that you can sell game engines and set a market share...that is, you gain X% of the company's profits on their game should they use your engine.  Finding the right ticks on the sliders can be frustrating (setting focus on graphics, gameplay, etc.) and you'll often get bad scores until you get a feel of what each genre/topic calls for...though if you've played "Game Dev Tycoon", you'll be no stranger to this.

This game allows you to simulate what it's like to run a video game starting in 1980 all the way to present times and beyond. This game has a lot of depth, and is loads of fun. At times, it can seem frustrating: Just keep in mind that starting out isn't always easy. This game is a bit of a process of trial and error, until you find that perfect balance of space and resource management. There are currently 6 save game slots (Awesome! Wish there was more tho). As of right now in Alpha, they are often needing to wipe saved games to accomodate for the new features that they add and change. I thought I would be more upset with the save game wipes, but it actually wasn't bad- It wasn't until starting over that I realized all the things that I could improve upon from my previous game. This game is not hard to figure out, but has lots of depth and thus takes time to truly master. As a musician and aspiring game dev, I found this game to be enlightening in some ways. Obviously it is "big picture" stuff compared to the day to day work of a single game dev, but it is interesting to consider all of the moving parts. It is astounding to see how time, society, console popularity, choice of game engine, marketing techniques and various other aspects all affect success or failure of a game.\nAlso, I wanted to avoid comparison, but I knew I couldn't. I own this and Game Dev Tycoon, both are excellent games. I feel that, at the moment, Mad Games Tycoon is a bit more complex and advanced. Both are truly awesome games in my opinion though.","August 3, 2015","true","27.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Do you want that RPG specialist who is also great at the graphics that your own engine supports? Then you will have to buy a certain “furniture” or an “arcade game” first before he or she even considers to accept your job offer! A Fantastic Idea!\n\nThe game also runs really well for an Early Access application. I’ve not encountered a single bug, yet. Sure, there are some features that are not in game but that comes with the territory. The devs also really take into account its customers’ ideas into incorporating them into the game’s updates.\n\nHowever, one major flaw that I’ve come across thus far is that Save Games from prior game versions do not load properly whenever the game updates. The player loses hours of gameplay and progress that way. Nonetheless, it’s really not a consequence because starting over keeps the game fresh while offering new contents and its own challenges.\n\nA few things I have on my Wishlist are the following:\nBe able to quickly sort through applicants by certain genre or feature specialties when hiring new employees\nBe able to have an idea of projected sales from Marketing to help with self-production\nRandom events in gaming industry that cause competition to fail and rise (i.e. random R&D breakthroughs that become players own license, market recessions, bankruptcy, or even new competitions such Indie Devs)\nMore end game features such as Digital Download Services, Market Investments, Building our own consoles or platforms, to name a few\n\n8 / 10 – Great Early Access game!

Initially I thought it looked like a Zynga-esque rip-off of Games Dev Tycoon, but I took a gamble on it during a sale and to be honest I find MGT is the better game! There are very many similarities between MGT and GDT but Mad Games feels like the less mobile-version game of the two. It has a watered down, but still enjoyable, Sims-ish building/management component that GDT does not. But the best element about the game in my opinion is the actual game making itself. I found it infinitely more enjoyable and transparent than GDT, where the quality of your games feels like a crap shoot and you are not penalized so harshly for being imaginative and drifting from obvious genres. Instead of the Tech/Design ratio thing GDT has, MGT has a numerical graphics/sound/controls/technology pool which is influenced by the visible stats of your staff, making way easier to understand where you game succeeded/failed. Similarly, any feature extras like 'sprites', 'vibration controller support' etc contribute directly to the game in transparent ways that make sense, such as 'sprites' contributing to the graphics quality of the game, 'vibration' improving the controls, etc.\n\nAlso, every update the dev releases (which is about 1 a month or less) has been excellent and not just bug bashes, and he seems very responsive to feature requests on the Steam forums. He has also been very cooperative about making the games files available for modding, allowing us to rename companies and products to their real-life counterparts.\n\nSo if you like GDT, I recommend this! I find it like a less mobile, more in-depth and (most importantly) more transparent version of GDT, and even then it is still an early access with features being added to it!\n","May 9, 2015","true","47.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

At first, I thought it was an excellent game, and I put well over 10 hours into it. However, as time passed, I slowly started to see issues with it that I hadn't seen before. Now, I have stopped playing that game because I got this game... for 1 dollar cheaper.\n\nIgnore the fact that Mad Games Tycoon is in Early Access, and you'll have fun! Look at it like any other "EARLY ACCESS" (poorly made Early Access games with no updates, tons of bugs, and a poor publisher and/or developer) game on Steam, and you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. YES, Mad Games Tycoon DOES have it's flaws: some times it can be WAY too easy, while other times it can also be a little hard. BUT, nevertheless, I still enjoy it.\n\nI always feel as if this type of simulation game is growing, but the more it grows, the more people copy each other. When I played Gamersgomakers, I knew it was going to be just like Game Dev Tycoon, a game I have played before, but I don't own on my steam account (as of now). However, when I played this game, I was under the impression that the creators of this game had mixed Game Dev Tycoon, Gamersgomakers, Game Dev Story, and the building element of The Sims games' together, and in some ways... I was a little right. Why a "little"? Because while it does have elements of all 4 games combined, it doesn't have the EXACT features they had. Is this a complaint? NO, it's a tiny little nitpick, that YOU (as the reader) can ignore.\n\nAnyhow, you know how I mentioned previously that there are flaws with this game? Well, I meant that. Besides the difficulty thing I mentioned, it always seems as if characters in this game can barely stay in one spot for a small ammount if time. This became even more angering once I had a small office with a LARGE development room (that could fit something like 14-15 people), especially when I was developing a AAA, AA, or A game. Once again, this is a nitpick, but a much more annoying one than previously. However, one flaw I could not just pass over in this review is a flaw that goes for all of these games (at least for me): they get boring after a while. Oh sure, in this game you have things like Copy Protection to look after, but that just seems like filler to me, and once you pass that filler, you start to get bored... REALLY bored. But the final thing that gets on my nerve: the music. I don't know what it is about these games, but the music always sounds cheap and poorly made. As such, much like the other 3 games in this genre I've played, the first thing I did was either mute my sound, or look in the options for something that disables the music.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nMad Games Tycoon is a REALLY fun game when it's not way too easy or hard. Do I hate the game? No, not even close. Do I love the game? Mostly. Much like the other games in this genre I have played, this game is what I would say is a "time waster", one that is fun, but also can get VERY boring after a long play session. Still, naming a game that gets a score like 15/100 "F*CK YOU" never gets old.\n\n\n[/table]Final Score: 7 out of 10 Oh, and also... GOOD LUCK MGT DEV's, GOOD LUCK!                                    Gameplay        8/10. At times, Mad Games Tycoon is engaging, other times,\nit's easier to get bored.                Sound        2/10. Once again, annoying sounds and earbleed worthy\nmusic does not help this game AT ALL!                Graphics        6/10. Nothing special or average. The graphics are minimalistic at best,\nbut they won't make you want to tear out your eyeballs.    Replayability5/10. This game can be addictive, and some days, I find a craving\nto play this game. Sadly, I don't feel like getting back on after a playsession.\nPlus of which, once you've seen all the game has to offer, there's no real\npoint to coming back.","June 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has decent graphics and rather decent music, both things i dont care for. The gameplay itself, the features that are added continuous are the things that i care for.\n\nThis early access title, especially with the developer behind it, is the best one i ever bought. Constant updates, quick reaction times to put out hotfix-patches and a very nice game developer game! You can also buy all those npc-developers, be a publisher on your one, never making games and so on. And if you can challenge yourself, you will see that this game has a lot of potential to offer.","May 14","true","97.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The title is a bit underwhelming, and I expected a pretty bad rip-off. At first, I thought I was right, as the starting situation, with your company in your basement and a car next door reminded me quite a bit of a certain other game.\n\nHowever, soon you realize that this game has more features. You can design your office, controlling the size of each room and what is being worked on in that room. You assign dev- or research projects to a room, and the more people work in it, and the more advanced they are, the faster the result is done.\n\nYou can even start to produce the games yourself, which requires a manufacturing room with CD presses and a storage room (make sure you get both, they dont need employees in them, but before you have both, production won't start, and you wanna have the game available as soon as it was developed).\n\nMoving to a bigger space requires a bit more work... you sell old office stuff, move into the new space... and it's all empty. So you have to build those walls, decorate and furnish the rooms and assign your workers, which of course still get paid while you build, so it helps to go room by room so you can assign people quickly.\n\nIn general, the game has more detail than that other game (Which I enjoyed a lot as well, btw!!), has more options and features which DO make sense, and seems to be shaping up quite nicely. My first play-session lasted for 3 hrs straight with no break, and I am looking forward to continuing. Not sure how much replay-value the game has once you have become the big and rich tycoon, but until then, its a very enjoyable and slightly addictive game.","May 10, 2015","true","12.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game also now has enough content to warrant a buy. I say, go ahead, get it. I also want to add that whenever I suggest something, it gets enough attention so that it is either fixed or implemented as a feature or option. The developer(s) of this game is amazing and the community is also working. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n\nGo to the bottom for TL;DR version.\n\nThis game has a lot of Theme Hospital inspirations. Like how your staff needs radiators to be productive or how certain staff members can only be hired when you have certain items. The game's atmosphere is nice on its own and it has a lot of topics and genres and features for your development journey.\n\nNow, let's talk about the downsides of this early access. First of all, there isn't much of a tutorial on how things work, the only tutorial you're given is at the start and it's pretty simplistic. After that you have to unlock certain stuff by doing other stuff. Researching a feature to be able to make your own engine for example. However, the buildings that you unlock have no tooltips whatsoever and you can only go for a trial and error approach. They do have tooltip boxes though so they're sure to be explained later on in an update. There are also some minor grammatical errors or typos but nothing too bothersome.\n\nNow, if you have bought the game and you're just starting out, don't invest in the last 3 skills. They are only ever useful for research, marketing and support. Get skills other than music, sound and graphics since those are the first few employees available to you and you can just get one if you need.\n\nTL;DR version: This game is like Theme Hospital meets Game Dev Tycoon. It is in Early Access but it doesn't have any bugs that I can see. Only issues are, late game lag (can be solved by lowering graphics etc.) and npcs getting stuck (can be noticed easily) and some minor typos. The game deserves its current price tag. As an Early Access game it gets a 9 out of 10.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nWarning, this review is out of date. The problems mentioned here may or may not be present in the current version.\n\nEdit: Performance issues with having too many employees seems to be fixed or at least alleviated. Teleporting employees now only teleport to the door if they can't find a path to their desk or where they want to go, which is a good thing. Late game seems like a bother because of the training room and how employees get so little experience from actually designing games.","January 17, 2015","true","47.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Story along the lines of\n\nGame Dev Tycoon. All features of Game Dev Tycoon are in there including\n\nMaking your own system, doing side work, and  creating mass games that blow\n\npeoples minds. Upgraded graphics and more open ended gameplay make this a\n\npretty good game. I like that I have a choice in what my people are going to do\n\nand where. You can even pick employees with special skills and traits that you want.\n\nI personally enjoy giving my employees what they need and even messing with them\n\nwhen they do bad by taking away things like the bathroom. I love the new explination\n\nsystem as it gives you more in depth information on things and offers beginners a\n\nbetter understanding of what you are doing. I can't really say much about how to get\n\na perfect game but there are online  tutorials and such out there that you can look up.\n\nYou can  make the game easy or hard and cater to your desires of running a business\n\nbankrupt or making it a success. I miss some of the cutesy graphics but I guess that the\n\nnew ones are just as good. I got frustrated at the move object function until I learned\n\nhow to turn it off as I kept selecting items I did not want and in a time sensitive game it\n\nis not good for you to waste any precious seconds when in threat of bankruptcy. Also,\n\nwhen you delete a room you get nothing for it. So if you spent 200000 on it and remove it\n\nbecause it was too small, you lose 200,000. There is no way to enlarge or shrink a room.  So, in\n\nmy opinion it is just as good as their previous game but polished a bit for those seeking\n\nbetter emersion and more stuff. I find myself stuck on it for hours when I play it and often\n\nlose track of time as I micro manage my little simmies into an early grave.","August 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you can deal with that though, then keep reading.\n\nThe game provides a great mix of simulating some small details as well as the big picture of the game development industry.  It ranges from picking physical game package contents to buying out other game developers and publishing their games. I find its end-game stuff to be more satisfying than the "create" a new console feature in a comparable game.  They've also added specific development departments/studios like for testing (gameplay) and audio, which for a price help boost certain aspects of the games being developed.\n\nThere is a pretty good range of game difficulties which have improved over time, and I appreciate that genre-specific tips earned with dev time don't give precise levels for what it takes to make the best games. Although the game was definitely rough around the edges in its first 1.5 months of Early Access, the devs have addressed nearly all the bug reports I've provided. I like the choice community-fed ideas that have been put into the game. So I'm confident that they'll meet their Q2 2015 release goal, and if not then I'm sure it will be for good reasons.","April 13, 2015","true","94.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You need to hire staff, match their skills to the various assignments and train them up.\n\nYou can build a large variety of rooms and need to decorate them to improve productivity (must like theme hospital).  Getting larger offices means you can build larger rooms and dedicated more staff to the room etc.\n\nAlso you need not focus only on game dev, you can also go the publishing route, publishing other developers games which is neat.\n\nOne thing I also like is once you have released a game and if you have publishing facilities you can re-release them later at a discount and also make bundles, thus increasing your profits for that game in the long run.\n\nStill a few issues to sort out, a few bugs and also to address (which I believe has been) the fact once you reach mid-point the game gets easier and getting good score games is a bit too easy (again this is being fixed).\n\nOverall a highly addictive game thus far.\n\nI will update this review when the game is released but right now it is in a very good state for Early Access.","September 13, 2015","true","66.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HockK/recommended/341000/","HockK","HockK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HockK/","424 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: This is a long review so if you plan on reading read to the end\n\nSo this is a game I had picked up recently due to the interest I had had in it a while back. Playing games like this I find pretty enjoyable and  have done my fair share of Game Dev Tycoon, seeing this I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this was a rip off of that very game.\n\nAnd boy was I wrong\n\nSo not only is this a game that takes the functions of Game Dev Tycoon and other Game Dev Sims it improves on it greatly allowing you to go into a deeper creation of your games, although not too far away from where it's aging older brother set the benchmark. By this I mean the ability to impliment copy protection for your games allow it to be released in other languages because it isn't all about the english speaking world and above all else it expands on what Game Dev does with it's combinations.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well this is quite simple where Game Dev had the massive list of topics with the  5 root genres with the 6th researchable one of casual games coming into effect early on along with Multi-genre and MMO being unlocked later into the game, Mad Games Tycoon  goes balls to the wall with the progression of time since Game Dev's release these roots have branched off  to a collection of 16 genres for you to combine with one another to experiment and create the best games, and as time goes on maybe this will increase even more.\n\nThe Key element of this gameplay however is the other side to it, Game Dev is you sitting at your desk making money by making good games and then having you move into a bigger space and hire more people to sit at deska and help you make money, that may be putting it bluntly and to be fair there is other stuff to do like research and so on but stripped to it's core that is game dev. Mad Games Tycoon however decides to borrow elements from the late Maxis'  collosal franchise of the sims where you have to care for these people in more depth, you give people the multitude of rooms to work in along with a bathroom and break room as well as tending to their needs so their will to work for you is great this hopefully allowing you to get more done in your games and tilt the tide to get that higher rating and more money.\n\nThere is however one issue with this game that I have and that could partially be blamed on me as well. Mad Games Tycoon at the moment of me writing this review has no tutorial mode and if it does I can't find it, It does have an easy mode option which starts you off in an office space however but that really doesn't do much when it comes to learning the mechanics and the key gameplay elements. it took me a while to find out how to even build a room to work in let alone make a game and even then the sliders are easy to work around, but i wasn't too sure on how it would work. With words either side of the bar  I was unsure if moving it closer to one way meant it was a higher priority or that it meant it was a lower one because of the way Game Dev worked with the bigger bar meaning more time, and i'm honestly still not sure to this day.\n\nDon't let this bring you down as eventually when you learn how the game works you can easily get into the game even with the difficulty. all of these games are the same fundementally with the rinse and repeat and if you don't succeed try again aproach with the idea that someday you will hit it big and from then it is smooth sailing.\n\nOverall then this is a strong game even in it's early access state and is in strong standing within the Game Dev Games, although this review constantly made comparison to Game Dev  it does not mean I think of it as a worse game, I would honeslty say I believe that Mad Games Tycoon in it's current form is on par even without the tutorial and I really hope to see this game through to a full release where then it could take it's place on the throne of where Game Dev Tycoon currently resides","March 30, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The "game report" feature isn't implemented yet and the start of the game can be very hard (at least no rent to pay). It's not quite clear why a game gets bad ratings. I had good combinations with good production value and no bugs and the game still gets slammed with a 40%. Still fun, especially with the complexity of different rooms and finding out how they work. MMOs are much better implemented than in Game Dev Tycoon and you can as well print your own games in-house and ship them. But you can not make your own hardware. In 9 hours I moved through 3 different offices and ended up with an MMO and a RTS that I would actively update and advertise, ended up with 8,3 billion before I decided to end it. Definetly a recommendation for everybody who likes these kind of sims. I'm looking forward to future updates of this game, hopefully containing the still missing rooms.","May 15, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As much as I'd like to write about the faults or bugs within the game that put you off you simply can not because of how quickly they are updating this game.\n\nBy now most people will be put off by when they see "Early Access Game" - I know I am, I've been burned too many times now.

Most Early Access games aren't worth the buy, sometimes because they're barely worked on AT ALL. (*cough* Castle Story, Tinder and Stone *cough*) Or sometimes Early Access games are just a genre that's always being pumped out by lots of developers. BUT, this game isn't like that, Mad Games Tycoon is a Game Making and Management game. Now I haven't played a game like Game Dev Tycoon in a while...\n\n*Pros I Guess*\n\n1. Graphic options are nice.\n2. Hard game right when you start.\n3. Not punishing.\n4. The style has a Sim sort of feel.\n\n*Cons yeah you expected me to say "pretty much" right here didn't you?*\n\n1. A little too easy after you get good at it.\n2. I don't like how it gives you hints for the genre of the game you made when you make a new one.

Just don't get too attached to your save games!  (It's early access, you signed up for that!)","January 10","true","16.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you want to push yourself further, get into console development, costly but can be very profitable.\n\nIf your interested in Game Dev Games, this would be the best one to go for, cause there is more to do, more to offer, early access so more content will be added, and you do everything you could in other game dev games but with more to do, more to focus on.\n\nI got upto year 2187 because I was maximizing my staffs skills\nBut made alot of mad games on the way, profiting in over $9999mil\nMade a few MMO's and added a couple of expansions with max content, was making average about $200mil with each MMO. So profit can easily be made there aswell, just getting there can be a pain, unless you make and sell engines, or know the right mix and match for games.\n\nOverall I like what this game offers apposed to the others on the market, only flaw for me though is once you reach year 2015 things start to settle down and the game gets pretty dull, other devs are still making games but no new consoles come out. So basically it only gets easier from 2015 unfortunately.\n\n9/10 I know its still early access but the fact they are going further than any other game dev game and doing alot more than just game and console development speaks for itself. I have high hopes for this game, keep up the great work dev's!","January 24","true","56.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Zane/recommended/341000/","-Zane","Zane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Zane/","67 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor me personally this is the best 'Game Dev' type game out at the moment. It builds further on the foundations laid by previous IP's in this genre. Compared to these previous titles this game offers a lot of personilization and offers deeper gameplay even at this early access stage.\n\nYou decide how to build your office as well as design it a bit by placing down various specific interior objects from a nice variety. There are various types of rooms which all help in the process of designing and developing video games. Including but not limited to QA rooms to improve game quality and remove bugs; sound studio for better game audio, marketing; customer support; toilets (when you gotta go you gotta go); development office and more.\n\nRegarding the game development itself you research new technologies which you then implement by making new game engines for your own use or for selling it to your competitors for some extra cash. Although in the beginning you most likely have to purchase game engines due to shortage of cash. When starting development you have the basics such as the genres, topics, which engine to use, game size, etc. But also small extras such as licenses to purchase from movies/sports to give your game an additional popularity boost. Further down you choose with sliders where you want to focus your efforts on during development. The game can receive additional bonuses with the help of the QA room and sound studio at the moment.\n\nOnce ready for production you give can decide how many copies to produce and even decide what the package should be like. Want to give your new to be loyal fans a t-shirt and a manual? Or screw the manual! Let them find out on their own and just give them a nice one dollar sticker with the game! Set the sale price which can be adjusted and voila, rake in the profits .. or the losses.\n\nThis game also has some negative aspects at the moment. In my opinion the UI could be a bit better. Sometimes it feels you need to click couple times more in order to view what you want to view.\n\nWhen building new rooms it's very difficult to sense the size of it. It would be helpful if there was some kind of visible tile/grid pattern to help visualise it. Because of that I often make my rooms too small because all the objects are not bound by the tile system that is used when creating a room. Desk 1 can be 1.25 tiles in lenght while desk 3 can be 2.2 tiles in lenght. Obviously it's somewhat more 'realistic' to not have everything the same size but it does not help with object placement at all.\n\nOnce you found the way to make money early game then you're launched and it will become very easy financial wise. You can get loans in case you're short on cash but they're paid off very quickly if you know the previous mentioned way to make money and the loan interests could be a bit higher as well imo.\n\nLast but not least the game advances - at least in my opinion - rather quickly through time. So your play sessions could last a bit short.\n\nAll in all the positive aspects definately outweigh the negative ones. I highly recommend this game, not only for what it has right now but also for what will come. The developers give frequent updates and you can be sure that after an update or two/three you'll have some extra content to guarantee a new play session.","July 1, 2015","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is very addicting as I have been playing it almost non stop since I got it. The game is well worth the price escpecially because there is still more to come. This game is like The Sims and Game Dev Tycoon had a child and that child then became a prodigy.\n\nPros: Lots of content pretty much equal to Game Dev Tycoon with mods. Building your own company is fun especially since you build it Sims style. More than enough content that the game could be considered a release game. Gameplay is very addictive and provides lots of upgrades to keep you playing for quite sometime. Will take awhile to reach the biggest building but that is a good thing.\n\n(Just small annoyances)\nCons: During the building menu sometimes the game will not recognize how big you want to build a room but the confirmation box only makes this issue a small annoyance. Some menus seem a little clunky like not having a cancel button if you accidently click on an object. Tutorial is really short and leaves out some important items around self production.

It already is in a sort of way, but it's still a short-term addiction.\n\nThe interface is a shameless copy of Theme Hospital. Let's just be honest about that. But why not use something that has proven to be solid instead of reinventing the wheel? There's something very appealing in being in charge of a gaming company. You start from your garage, being small time and struggling to keep the annual figures in green colors. You have to work a way through developing games, hiring staff, expanding your business and getting fans.\n\nThe strength of these 'tycoon' games, is that they don't demand much graphical attention. What does demand attention, is detail. I want to have to make important decisions: do I take out a loan? Do I invest funds to reignite a game? Do I have to cut the budget by firing staff? Some elements of a typical Tycoon game already show, like deciding to take part in a yearly game convention and expanding your fanbase or the endlessly staring at figures and gauges towards planning your next move.\n\nIf you're a fan of tycoon- or simgames by any stretch of the imagination, you'll like this game. There's a satisfying depth in developing your own games and there are a lot of possibilities to do so. I can only recommend to the creator to add more depth. As much as possible. I mentioned Theme Hospital. Remember how you were able to turn up the heating at a certain expense? More heating means the people will feel better, but it presses on your budget. I want to be thinking about these managerial decisions. If that can be provided, this game can become a long-term addiction.\n\nSome advices for enhancing the game: add a toggle gridline, show the measurements of rooms when designing them, add the option to redesign a room without having to delete it, being able to take out a loan, easy dispatch of staff (not having to pick them up one by one), more gamespeeds (the first speed still feels a bit too fast, especially later on in the game).\n\nKeep up the good work!","March 9, 2015","true","63.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In my main save, it is 2006, I am sitting at about 2.5 billion dollars, 1.2 million fans and all of my games have been 90% or better for about 18 years, and this is at the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe game is really unoptomized at the moment, my computer can run simcity on high settings at 1080p at 60fps but it cant run this at "fast" settings at 1336x768 and stay at 60, which really killed my experience.\n\nIn conclusion I think that this is the best game studio simulator at the moment, but it does still need some work on expanding the content.\n\n\n\nTL:DR Buy it, its pretty good.\n","March 24, 2015","true","20.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Every couple of months I find myself spending a week as flat out as I can on it. It is addictive and satisfying - exactly what a tycoon game should be!\n\nThe synopsis of the game is such. You are a small scale aspiring game developer working out of your garage. You need to make it big in the gaming industry and you do so by researching technological advances in both hardware and software. You employ the people who you believe will make you the best games and then you plan the game to be developed according to the current trends.\n\nThe devs have clearly struck a real good balance in so many aspects if you ask me. For example; sometimes you may think that you are onto a whopper of a game... only.... it flops - generally for understandable reasons. That is when time starts ticking and bad decision making would almost certainly spell  B.A.N.K.R.U.P.T.C.Y.  However, delving into some serious debt with the bank is an option. I mean what is the difference between going bankrupt with a debt of $200k or going bankrupt with a debt of $1.5m? (The answer is nothing - except of course for the differing amount but that is irrelevant as it has no impact upon you). What I am coming to is that the extra borrowed cash used to make a good game has been enough to bring the company back into the black and I have gone on to build a massively successful gaming company thereafter. What is my underlying message?  THE GAME IS FUN AND REWARDING!!\n\nDevs don't read the next statement.  I have gotten my money's worth many times over already IMO and yet the game is still in Early Access!!  Well worth the money for a really cool tycoon game.

I bought this game the day after the release on steam, ended up playing it for a while and thought it was pretty fun.  There were a couple features lacking then, and some problems with a couple other things at the time. However, unlike a lot of the Early Access Games that get dropped when the developers feel like they did enough or got enough money; Eggcode has had updates since the release.\n\nTo me it seems that the developers are open to ideas that the community has and would look into adding it if they think it would work well with the game. They also arn't shy from hearing about the bugs in the game people find, for me though the only real 'bug' I found was just a missing word, only because I was looking to hard at the history log at like 2 am. Sometimes the controls can be spotty but they always end up getting better overtime. Overall I have no real qualms about the game and very much like where it is heading.\n\nIf you where to ask which early access developer I like the most It would probably be these guys because I have seen the changes it has taken place in the past year. This would be on my Recommendations for early access games or just Fun games in general.\n\nKeep up the good work! :D","May 12","true","26.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Updates are regular and meaningfull.

The first thing is the space. There is not enough space for you to build everything at a suffiecent size and not all of the items have been added in. Second in the late game the game starts to have horrible lag spikes. I have a beefy gaming computer and I was having issues, so I can't imagine how bad it might be for someone who doesn't. The Third one is the game can become boring, can you possibly add some flavor events or some real competition to spice things up. Fourth its to easy to make amazing games especially early on, make it where the characters actally suck at everything, so we may groom them for what we want them to do. The next one, fifth, The game doesn't give you enough information making it hard to figure out your building layout, or just whats going on.

I'm really impressed. Especially since this game is in alpha. It already feels complete. And honestly, this is probably the deepest game dev sim I've played.

Props to the devs for making this game. $15 well spent.\n\nEdit:\nThis game gets very hard after you have around 20 million dollars. Lots of micro-management.

Not only do you design and publish your own games, but you rather manage a game studio. You design the different rooms and decide how many people should work in the different departments. You build rooms for marketing, support, graphics, sounds & music and many more, whom you can assign different tasks, Do you want to design two games at once? Not a problem at all.\nAs the game goes on, you won´t need a publisher anymore as you can produce your games on your own. Furthermore, you can be the publisher of someone else´s game. This all is a guarantor for your financial well-being.\nThe most interesting aspect of the game are the different ways you will gain your money on. Not only a good game will earn you money, but eg. a good engine will make your competitors buy it and cut you in the profits of their games.\n\nPeople who like to design their own games will like Mad Games Tycoon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THEBrandonBrownson/recommended/341000/","THEBrandonBrownson","thebrandonbrownson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THEBrandonBrownson/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA lot of people are going to compare Mad Games Tycoon to Game Dev Tycoon, and it's understandable why. They're both tycoon games based around game development. So the question is- which is better?\n\nThat's a difficult one.\n\nMad Games Tycoon definitely feels like a much deeper game. Unlike Game Dev Tycoon, you can actually build your office, which is a plus. You can also have multiple teams of people working on different things, instead of everyone working on the same thing, which is a huge plus. However, the actual game making part feels a little more satisfying in Game Dev Tycoon. With Game Dev Tycoon, you have to adjust things every so often in the game making process, while in Mad Games Tycoon, you do everything at the start and you wait. Admittedly, with the ability to have multiple groups of people doing multiple things, it doesn't feel like you're just sitting around and waiting for the most part, but I've had a few moments where I got rather bored just waiting for a game to get finished.\n\nThe one big thing that Mad Games Tycoon has going for it is that features are still being added. I've had the game for a week, maybe a week and a half, and it's already seen two updates that have changed up the gameplay significantly. Game Dev Tycoon, as good as it is, is a finished game. Sure, you can add some mods to the game to keep it fresh, but what you see is what you get, and it's all you're going to get. Mad Games Tycoon, on the other hand, is still evolving, still making changes to keep the game fresh, and that's why I prefer Mad Games Tycoon to Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nThe game's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. There are some things I wish they made a little more clear, the lack of mod support is kind of a bummer (Though, it still being in development, I can understand) and sometimes the staff gets upset by silly things, but I've plugged a bunch of time into this game and I plan to plug a bunch more into it. Definitely worth picking up.","March 25, 2015","true","79.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Reed, the sole proprietor of Angry Panda Studios began his journey. Over then next twenty years APS would be the laughing stock of the gaming community. Always being the underdog drove Reed. He stayed afloat for another decade when he decided to hire another person. It was this ragtag team that formed what would be referred to as "The Big One." With both employees focused on producing a game of epic proportions history would be changed forever. The release of their game generated nearly 500 million dollars in revenue for the company, thus expansion began. APS became a titan in the gaming world almost over night with over 30 employees on staff 24/7. Reed decided it was time to unveil the real reason he started APS in 1980, to take over the gaming industry. With all staff members devoted to one project they created a monster, a hellish beast. Critically acclaimed and winning game of the year this game pulled in over 10 billion dollars in revenue and stayed on the market for 20 years. With such a large income Reed purchased all competitors and forced them to close, making Angry Panda Studios the studio of the year, every year.","May 15, 2015","true","45.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one has potential, but in its current state you come to a standstill after about 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n- Interactive choices, you can build your own rooms and add furniture. Style is reminiscent of Theme Hospital.\n- Ability to add decor is nice. Some employees may require for you to have a specific piece of furniture or decoration before they'll work for you.\n- Large variety of topics and genres to build games off of.\n- Ability to train staff is nice.\nEdit 05/29/15:\n- Recently added feature allows players to release game updates for their games.\n- Recently added "Quality Assurance" room allows players to bug test their game prior to release.\n- This game is updated frequently enough that I keep coming back to it, giving it lots of replay value.\n\nCONS:\n- Needs a bigger variety of staff to hire from. After a while the only ones I could hire were the ones I fired for having low stats. Edit 05/21/15: This was fixed in latest patch.\n- Game starts to get really slow and laggy at the biggest office upgrade. Maybe I just have too many staff, I dunno, but it got really sluggish after a while. Edit 05/29/15: I don't know if this was actually patched, but in my most recent game I noticed this is no longer an issue while playing the biggest office.

This game is awesome, by far the best "tycoon" type game I've ever played. And with near-weekly updates, Eggcode has clearly proven themselves to be a developer that knows what early access is supposed to about.\n\nA lot of folks are comparing this game to GameDev Tycoon, and how could you not? But to really get the most out of this game you need to realize that they're two different animals that need to be approached in different ways. I had trouble with this when I first bought the game, and for awhile I went back to playing GameDev Tycoon and kind of gave up on this one, but once I started playing MGT as its own game I found that it is clearly the better of the two (GameDev what?)\n\nIf there is anything negative to be said about this game, it's that there is really no way to lose. If you run out of money you have a huge line of credit to draw upon, and the monthly interest isn't enough to provide any kind of deterrent to going in the red. For now, this allows me to stay in business long enough to check out whatever new features are added in the latest update, but I hope that eventually the credit lines and interest rates are changed enough to provide some challenge.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game.

If you haven’t, then this puts you as a game developer, starting out in the early 1980’s.  You begin small, producing small, simple games, from small, simple premises with appropriately early gaming technology.  As time goes on (assuming you don’t go bankrupt) you have the opportunity to expand, by hiring more people, researching new technology and moving into bigger premises.\n\nVisually, Mad Games Tycoon is better looking than those other games.  Another area where this differs from the aforementioned games is that with Mad Games Tycoon, you have to manually create each room and place the appropriate furniture in it.  Over time, your staff will complain about wanting things, like plants or heating, which you’ll have to place in the room, so you’ll need to make sure you create a room big enough.  Not too big, though, because in the early stages, you only have limited space for your rooms.\n\nEventually, you’ll have the opportunity to produce and distribute your own games instead of going through a publisher, as well as creating MMO’s hosted on your own servers.\n\nThis game is still in early access, and while it should be obvious what that means, it’s apparently not obvious to some.  Early access means the game is still in active development.  So, new features will be added and existing ones may be altered or even removed.  You might even find your save games get ruined sometimes, forcing you to start again.  The game is NOT a finished product, which is why it’s in early access.  You’ll almost certainly run into bugs from time to time, and features that aren’t available or aren’t working as intended.  The most important thing to know about early access games is this: are the developers actively working on it?  The answer for Mad Games Tycoon is definitely ‘yes’.  Updates are regularly being released, which are usually both fix bugs as well as adding new features.  This is important, because I’ve seen early access games where the updates concentrate on one but not the other, causing the game to suffer as a result.\n\nThe game is still very much playable in its current state, but it’s by no means finished, and nor is it perfect as yet.  It would be really good, for example, to have better feedback as to why your game was terrible, or indeed why it was so good.  It’s not necessarily easy to work out exactly why your previous game did as well, or as badly, as it did.  Hopefully that aspect of the game will get worked on in time to come.  I know too many early access games have died or taken forever to do anything, but I’ve seen nothing so far to suggest that this game will be the same; on the contrary, I’m confident that we will indeed see a finished product in time, and a damn good one.  But please keep in mind, if you buy a game in early access then you’re paying money for something which may or may not actually get finished, or finished in the way you were expecting.  It’s always going to be a gamble, but in this instance, it’s one I was happy to make.","May 25, 2015","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Reed, the sole proprietor of Angry Panda Studios began his journey. Over then next twenty years APS would be the laughing stock of the gaming community. Always being the underdog drove Reed. He stayed afloat for another decade when he decided to hire another person. It was this ragtag team that formed what would be referred to as "The Big One." With both employees focused on producing a game of epic proportions history would be changed forever. The release of their game generated nearly 500 million dollars in revenue for the company, thus expansion began. APS became a titan in the gaming world almost over night with over 30 employees on staff 24/7. Reed decided it was time to unveil the real reason he started APS in 1980, to take over the gaming industry. With all staff members devoted to one project they created a monster, a hellish beast. Critically acclaimed and winning game of the year this game pulled in over 10 billion dollars in revenue and stayed on the market for 20 years. With such a large income Reed purchased all competitors and forced them to close, making Angry Panda Studios the studio of the year, every year.","May 15, 2015","true","45.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing big, but fits well into the game.\n- I do not feel the pressure to release a game. I can spend time on enhancements.\n- There are just enough areas the game covers, from game engine development to production.\n- Quite good interface. It's easy to reach anything.\n\nCons:\n- It is a bit annoying that after I finished a game, my development team cannot do anything if I select 'release later'. My team should improve the game, develop bug fixes, add new features, etc...\n- The music team cannot finish their work if I choose 'release the game' even if I set a long, lets say '24 weeks later' option. The whole game release process should be revised.\n- The review should come after I finished everything, even improvements! Now it happens immediately after I selected 'release game'.\n- I am not sure, but it seems that even if I started repaying my bank loan, when I have enough money to repay the whole amount, the original amount will be taken from my account.\n\nImprovements:\n- There are tons of topics to research. With a 4-member-team I can easily reach a point when I do not really have anything to do just reasearching new topics. A small checkbox with title "Continue topic reasearch when finished" would come handy, so I do not need to go through the research topic procedure in every 3 seconds.\n- There are areas that need some additional help information.

It really does improve on everything on existing "Gave Development" games. The biggest downside however is near the end, and not a lack of end-game either.

I had every room in the game in my building, and it was the most micro-managing I have had to do since StarCraft 2.

The game is good and I really enjoy playing it but the biggest plus for this is the developers.\n\nConstant updates (although most do break the save games) gives the game lots of replayability.

They are constantly monitoring the forums and the updates come thick and fast.\n\nI have also been really impressed by how polished the game was even way back when I purchased it. Each new update usually adds another feature that encourages you to have another run ;)\n\nEggcode games interactions with their fanbase and constant updates is an example to all and would put your large publishers to shame.\n\nThank you Eggcode, I eagerly await your next instalment :)","September 3, 2015","true","117.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The developers are the best I've seen on Steam. Always pumping new features and updates. I love that I can play for a bit then come back a month later and have three or four new features added. If all Steam early access games matched MGT then I'd gladly play early access more often. Replay value is very high.

It really does improve on everything on existing "Gave Development" games. The biggest downside however is near the end, and not a lack of end-game either. What I've noticed is that once you start making bank, you've made it to the bigger buildings, and then you move into production and self publishing. I had every room in the game in my building, and it was the most micro-managing I have had to do since StarCraft 2. For me, it lost a lot of it's character and enjoyment as soon as I hit this roadblock. Developing games quickly becomes just a side project alongside the many many other side projects you have, and it becomes very reptitive.\n\nAll said and done, it's still a great game and it will keep you entertained for hours, and this is still alpha!

Not only do you design and publish your own games, but you rather manage a game studio. You design the different rooms and decide how many people should work in the different departments. You build rooms for marketing, support, graphics, sounds & music and many more, whom you can assign different tasks, Do you want to design two games at once? Not a problem at all.\nAs the game goes on, you won´t need a publisher anymore as you can produce your games on your own. Furthermore, you can be the publisher of someone else´s game. This all is a guarantor for your financial well-being.\nThe most interesting aspect of the game are the different ways you will gain your money on. Not only a good game will earn you money, but eg. a good engine will make your competitors buy it and cut you in the profits of their games.\n\nPeople who like to design their own games will like Mad Games Tycoon.

My suggestions:\n\n*Once you own a company (100% shares) you should be able to manage the overall focus of the company such as types of games they create atleast.\n\n*Just to make things easier it would be nice to have games produced in batches. Such as "If number ordered is over 100k produce 200k".\n\n*Dynamic Environment. I understand many of the terms in the game are statically assigned such as names. While The overall translation is simpler this way, you could use a 3D database to sort words and phrases by "Category - Name - Language" This would make it so you can dynamically assign things like names of games, personnel and companies. This will also make it so you can have some companies go bankrupt  and new companies can enter the game.\n\nBut, keep doing what you have planned. Im enjoying it sofar.\n\nThe author seems to have a very nice idea and I am definately looking forward to the final product. Even as a prerelease I find this game addictive and hard to stop playing.

Nothing big, but fits well into the game.\n- I do not feel the pressure to release a game. I can spend time on enhancements.\n- There are just enough areas the game covers, from game engine development to production.\n- Quite good interface. It's easy to reach anything.\n\nCons:\n- It is a bit annoying that after I finished a game, my development team cannot do anything if I select 'release later'. My team should improve the game, develop bug fixes, add new features, etc...\n- The music team cannot finish their work if I choose 'release the game' even if I set a long, lets say '24 weeks later' option. The whole game release process should be revised.\n- The review should come after I finished everything, even improvements! Now it happens immediately after I selected 'release game'.\n- I am not sure, but it seems that even if I started repaying my bank loan, when I have enough money to repay the whole amount, the original amount will be taken from my account.\n\nImprovements:\n- There are tons of topics to research. With a 4-member-team I can easily reach a point when I do not really have anything to do just reasearching new topics. A small checkbox with title "Continue topic reasearch when finished" would come handy, so I do not need to go through the research topic procedure in every 3 seconds.\n- There are areas that need some additional help information.

If you haven’t, then this puts you as a game developer, starting out in the early 1980’s.  You begin small, producing small, simple games, from small, simple premises with appropriately early gaming technology.  As time goes on (assuming you don’t go bankrupt) you have the opportunity to expand, by hiring more people, researching new technology and moving into bigger premises.\n\nVisually, Mad Games Tycoon is better looking than those other games.  Another area where this differs from the aforementioned games is that with Mad Games Tycoon, you have to manually create each room and place the appropriate furniture in it.  Over time, your staff will complain about wanting things, like plants or heating, which you’ll have to place in the room, so you’ll need to make sure you create a room big enough.  Not too big, though, because in the early stages, you only have limited space for your rooms.\n\nEventually, you’ll have the opportunity to produce and distribute your own games instead of going through a publisher, as well as creating MMO’s hosted on your own servers.\n\nThis game is still in early access, and while it should be obvious what that means, it’s apparently not obvious to some.  Early access means the game is still in active development.  So, new features will be added and existing ones may be altered or even removed.  You might even find your save games get ruined sometimes, forcing you to start again.  The game is NOT a finished product, which is why it’s in early access.  You’ll almost certainly run into bugs from time to time, and features that aren’t available or aren’t working as intended.  The most important thing to know about early access games is this: are the developers actively working on it?  The answer for Mad Games Tycoon is definitely ‘yes’.  Updates are regularly being released, which are usually both fix bugs as well as adding new features.  This is important, because I’ve seen early access games where the updates concentrate on one but not the other, causing the game to suffer as a result.\n\nThe game is still very much playable in its current state, but it’s by no means finished, and nor is it perfect as yet.  It would be really good, for example, to have better feedback as to why your game was terrible, or indeed why it was so good.  It’s not necessarily easy to work out exactly why your previous game did as well, or as badly, as it did.  Hopefully that aspect of the game will get worked on in time to come.  I know too many early access games have died or taken forever to do anything, but I’ve seen nothing so far to suggest that this game will be the same; on the contrary, I’m confident that we will indeed see a finished product in time, and a damn good one.  But please keep in mind, if you buy a game in early access then you’re paying money for something which may or may not actually get finished, or finished in the way you were expecting.  It’s always going to be a gamble, but in this instance, it’s one I was happy to make.","May 25, 2015","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have actually put in 29 hours into. I would have played more but I plan on waiting a while until more content is inserted into the game. Even though, this is an early access game I still highly reccomend it to anyone who likes management games or Game Dev Tycoon or just anyone who ever dreamed of starting their own video game company. You get to hire you want, make good and bad games, design the inside of your building, sell engines you make and expand your company. Two thing do not like so far but I know it will be added in the future is the fact that there is a certain point in the game you start to run out of stuff to research for new video game engines. It just felt weird that it was the year 2014 and my game engine still had a 32-bit color support and not 64-bit. Also I believe the option to create a free to play game in the game is still locked and also the option to add a graphics studio to enhance any of your video games in development is locked. However, the game is still in early access and theres a lot of features that are locked now but will be added later so just be patient. After the amount of hours I put into it this game I could confidently say that my investment in this game is more than worth it. So do yourself a favor and give the developers your money.\n\n****UPDATE**** 4/25/2016\nThis game has improved a LOT since my first review in June? July? idk. Anyways they added more features like new rooms you could build such as a music studio and a animation room. I also like the build a console feature even though it feels incomplete. For example there is not that  many custom designs you could do for the case. Also it feels weird that after I make a console I don't have to produce it like any game you produce you just develop it and it magically sells. One thing I also noticed that i thought felt wrong was that after the year 2010 theres not much else you can research. Yes there other stuff you can research but they are few and far between which makes the research department useless late game.

Every game I release that does not sell 100 Mio. Copies in the first year is considered a failure. But that's still ok, since my studio hasn't released a game with a rating less than 90% since the early 80's. Unfortunately, I can't releaser any more games, even in the biggest office and though I demolished almost all other rooms, I can't build any more servers for my subscription sheeple. And since I closed down all the other studios early on, there hasn't been a game of the year in...years, really.\nSo I guess, I'd be a little more fun if there was something to discover after 2001, a way to improve something instead of just repeating what you just did, like dismissing a marketing campaign every 5 seconds. But you get to develop something like 75 games before you figure out the perfect settings, and for that time, it was great fun.\nThe bad:\n* the default speed is way to fast, and space does not pause the game (hint: '1'\ndoes, though)\n* assigning people to rooms is hell\n* re-assigning people to rooms after some training comes down to 'who are you and where did you work before'\n* no work queueing. (actually, that is not true. Almost no work queueing)\n* after a while, it get's repetetive as ....\n* appearently, the world of video games has not made any advancements after 2001.\n\nStill, you get almost 30 (simulated :) years, in which teh game is great fun.\n\nLast's about a weekend.","August 18, 2015","true","35.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm assuming it got worse because I have more rooms and staff members now, therefore more things are happening. I turned down the graphics and tweaked some things off but no change.\nI hope this can be fixed since it is getting quite hard to move the camera around and click on rooms to give tasks.\n\nSince there are more buildings to unlock and I have currently everything researched, I hope there are more coming soon. I'm currently in the year 2013.\n\nMade a huge success with developing "World of Lifecraft" as an MMO, which was quite fun and already brought me over 80mil.\n\nAll in all great game, addictive and fun. Just hoping and waiting for new updates to fix these issues.\nI hope I'm not making this sound worse than it is. The game is overall great fun and since it it still in early access I will be waiting and hoping for more updates.\n\n(P.S. agreeing with a lot of the helpful and positive reviews)\n\nShort Edit: They kept updating the game, which is awesome to see. Now you can make your own game consoles, which is fun. I'm not sure, but it seems like its harder to make good enough games now, my old save was gone so I had to start over and this time I made my money with engines and contract work, since games kept failing.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that there are some typos or grammatical errors in some of the texts (I'm playing in english).

I don't know why they can't make the save still work (heck even Prison Architect could do it) but I would wait for it to come out of early access before buying it.

This is still in Early Access, they are still making the game. Don't forget to post bugs and stuff you see. Now that that has been said, continue reading.\n\n\n\nI highly recommend this game. Not only is it a better version (and more updated) of Game Dev Tycoon, but it adds the element of how it is like to acutally create the game. This game does have some downsides, but other than that it is a really good game. I think this game will bring alot of people into the game making community! Now, I have personally tried using the unity engine, and I know Basic C#, and I could create nothing like this. I also have about like 79 games in my library, so this should make an impact.\n\nIf you want to see this, hover over it!\nFirst off, this game is amazing. Not only will you spend the time to get started, you have $500,000 dollars into the hole while playing. I have gone into the negitives a couple times, but I have always gotten out. This game should really have a modding community, or at least mod support, because this could be imporved by adding things by mods.\n\nThere are a couple downsides to this game as well though. If you want realism might wanna play Game Dev Tycoon. If you want fun, might wanna play this game. I say that because the ecomony is not the best. I will usually get about 500,000$ on a really sh*tty game. A second thing is that, sometimes when I launch the game, it will crash when it is done loading the "Egg" screen. I don't know if this is just me but I have to relaunch the game to get it to work. After I re-launch it seems to work fine though, so yes, this game is amazing. Another thing I really hope they work out is the "No Deleting Saves" thing. I feel every Game Dev game is missing a delete save. What are the odds ;)?\n\nOther than the couple of bugs, I highly reccommmend this game, because I have played it for hours now, and already almost reached a day. This is going to be an amazing game when it comes out of Early Access, and I wonder what the price will be when it does.

My main complaint is the dialog boxes. Once you really start to take off and you get to the point where you're bringing in huge amounts per game, naturally you want to expand to the largest location available and really develop your studio as much as possible. However, when you have that many projects running at once, the dialog boxes get so out of control that the game is nearly unplayable.

I don't fill out online surveys. I don't respond well to people calling me and asking if I have time to answer some questions. I NEVER GIVE FEEDBACK. Yet, here I am, writting this review. That should say something about how passionately I feel about this game. This is exactly what I have been searching for. I love it. I cannot stop playing it. It's absorbing my life and ruining my sleep schedule. If you like logistics you'll love this game.\n\nIt's still early access, but it's already a great game. I don't know if developers read these reviews, but I have only a few complaints.\n1. When your company gets large and people are wandering around it becomes impossible to find people and move them to a different room.\n2. I feel the game is paced too fast. I think that one game year goes by in 20 minutes? I haven't really timed it out, but it is too quick. I think that they should slow down how long you get to spend in one year, or at least add the ability to adjust the game pace (making faster makes the game more challenging).\n\nThose are my two biggest complaints. And they're not even complaints. I don't know how much longer they plan to keep it in early access, but this is a well put together game right now. I can think of a lot of features it would be cool to have (for example the ability to release early access games, the ability to develop mobile app games), but I can't think of anything this games needs to complete it.\n\nIf you like the builder/management sim type games, you will love this game.\n\nYou will be obsessed.","August 26, 2015","true","101.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I certainly had great fun with the game for a few hours, but I wont be coming back to it.\n\nI mean for long stretches the games was fun, but in the end when I got MMO's it went downhill. MMO's are simply too overpowered. My world of warcraft-ripoff made well over 800 million for me and all I had to do was open more develoing rooms so I could develop several consecutive MMO:s and develop expansions for them and the money just kept rolling in. Across all my active MMO:s I had well over 15 million subscribers so it kind of feels like I cant really lose at this game now.\n\nBut up until that point it was a fun, albeit somewhat unpolished, game.

The rooms are customisable and your staff will require different furniture and working conditions to keep them happy. It has quite a steep learning curve at first and I failed miserably with my first 3 games. As the game progresses and as you hire more staff, you'll need to be ontop of several different tasks at once, all with time limits. Games that have been released will need advertising and game updates to keep them in the market. If you publish your own games you'll need to keep an eye on how many are being made, if you have enough stock etc. The game will pull you in, and has a lot of replayability.\nFinally making a smash hit game was hard to do but felt so damn good.\n\nDefinately worth the money.","October 29, 2015","true","77.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What better type of game to make than one about making games? Besides, I find this very type of game interesting as it allows me to simulate my dreams. This game is very much for the players as well, as any ideas or suggestions are considered by the development team. Although simple I feel as though it is the perfect game to begin your—Eggcode’s—development experience with.\nMad Games Tycoon starts you off in a garage in the 1980s where you must claw your way up through the game industry by starting your own company and making history. Creating revolutionary games is all the fun with this game. Being able to create a legacy for others to be inspired by as well as making the games which changed the industry in your own way are the reasons this game is so addictive. The game is quite easy as well, making all of the complex tasks very easy for beginners; of course there are exceptions further along in the game whereby the expansion of your company requires more elements to be available. The ability to unlock more aspects of the game in a more controlled manner by forcing players to earn money and play for lengths of time before they can move onto more complex tasks creates a buffer for new players to understand the mechanics of the game industry better. I did find however that when I began first creating my games they would usually go bust and I would have to rework contracts to regain money, I now realise that this game utilises the term you need to spend money to make money, and it works.\nTheir depiction of the tools available is quite well done in fact, it excites me. Being able to change and modify so many details such as the toilets for example captures the side of me that loves management games. The ability to develop patches, updates, language packs, sequels, as well as undertaking contracts tugs on my perfectionist personality when it comes to games, so making sure they’re ‘up-to-date’ creates the atmosphere of me almost being there. The endless immensity of content in this game leaves me wanting more, and the actual experience far outweighs the realistic visual quality some of today’s games may offer, especially for such a low price.\nThis game honestly propels my excitement for my own career through the roof. Being able to tell stories and make so many people happy in such an interactive way is thrilling. Mad Games Tycoon gives me encouragement to create games which can redefine gaming; a big dream yes, but at least I’m aiming somewhere. This experience provides me with insight into what can be done with a little work: being able to create worlds, or go back to different times, it’s all merely based on imagination and creativity and this game shows me that Eggcode has created a very tantalising experience—one that shows they create promising hope of future games as alluring as this one.\n","October 29, 2015","true","45.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagurati/recommended/341000/","kagurati","4b6167","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kagurati/","464 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, I'll be honest, after the great game that was "Game Dev Tycoon" (GDT) scratching an itch to be a game developer that I didn't know I had, I ended up talking and making mods with an associate of mine, and eventually ended up looking for games that came close to what we wanted to turn GDT into. The only thing that was 1) available, and 2) came anywhere close was a title called "Mad Games Tycoon" by Eggcode.\n\nBut it's not a title that appeals to just one type of simulation gamer, but multiple types. It aims not only at those aiming for perfection, but aiming for an experience that isn't easy.\n\nTrue, you could take notes on things between games on where different sliders for game customization should be for different genres but to me that seems to lessen the experience a bit. This is a game where you start out in the early days of video game development. The first systems are a Personal Computer (PC) and an early Atari-type system. And it goes from there, with new consoles being released, competitors making their games and engines, liscensing your engines, and the reviewers being as critical as they ever were!\n\nIt comes in four difficulty levels and options to randomize the console popularities, and so many little intricacies that you can use to affect your scores on different titles that you can never be quite certain how things will turn out.\n\nOh, did I mention it's still early access? Yeah, it is. This game isn't even officially "launched" yet, and it's my benchmark for any title that wants to be a business simulator--yes, not just a game development simulation, but business simulators in general.\n\nIf you've not picked up Mad Games Tycoon, you should. Surely you can spare $15 for this gem of an early access title.","March 7","true","38.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A few minor translation errors and there are some areas of the game that are not intuitive, but become clear when they come along later in gameplay. For example there is no point in holding the publishing of a game early on, if you do not yet have departments for graphics, music and QA etc. It is not immediately clear on how repackaging and bundling old games works. The purpose of the desk in the Home Office is also not explained, it is not actually used but applies a modifier based on the quality of the desk used.

That should tell you quite a lot.\n\nThis game is quite similar to Game Dev Tycoon except has a whole lot more. The rooms are customisable and your staff will require different furniture and working conditions to keep them happy. It has quite a steep learning curve at first and I failed miserably with my first 3 games. As the game progresses and as you hire more staff, you'll need to be ontop of several different tasks at once, all with time limits. Games that have been released will need advertising and game updates to keep them in the market. If you publish your own games you'll need to keep an eye on how many are being made, if you have enough stock etc. The game will pull you in, and has a lot of replayability.\nFinally making a smash hit game was hard to do but felt so damn good.\n\nDefinately worth the money.","October 29, 2015","true","77.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What better type of game to make than one about making games? Besides, I find this very type of game interesting as it allows me to simulate my dreams. This game is very much for the players as well, as any ideas or suggestions are considered by the development team. Although simple I feel as though it is the perfect game to begin your—Eggcode’s—development experience with.\nMad Games Tycoon starts you off in a garage in the 1980s where you must claw your way up through the game industry by starting your own company and making history. Creating revolutionary games is all the fun with this game. Being able to create a legacy for others to be inspired by as well as making the games which changed the industry in your own way are the reasons this game is so addictive. The game is quite easy as well, making all of the complex tasks very easy for beginners; of course there are exceptions further along in the game whereby the expansion of your company requires more elements to be available. The ability to unlock more aspects of the game in a more controlled manner by forcing players to earn money and play for lengths of time before they can move onto more complex tasks creates a buffer for new players to understand the mechanics of the game industry better. I did find however that when I began first creating my games they would usually go bust and I would have to rework contracts to regain money, I now realise that this game utilises the term you need to spend money to make money, and it works.\nTheir depiction of the tools available is quite well done in fact, it excites me. Being able to change and modify so many details such as the toilets for example captures the side of me that loves management games. The ability to develop patches, updates, language packs, sequels, as well as undertaking contracts tugs on my perfectionist personality when it comes to games, so making sure they’re ‘up-to-date’ creates the atmosphere of me almost being there. The endless immensity of content in this game leaves me wanting more, and the actual experience far outweighs the realistic visual quality some of today’s games may offer, especially for such a low price.\nThis game honestly propels my excitement for my own career through the roof. Being able to tell stories and make so many people happy in such an interactive way is thrilling. Mad Games Tycoon gives me encouragement to create games which can redefine gaming; a big dream yes, but at least I’m aiming somewhere. This experience provides me with insight into what can be done with a little work: being able to create worlds, or go back to different times, it’s all merely based on imagination and creativity and this game shows me that Eggcode has created a very tantalising experience—one that shows they create promising hope of future games as alluring as this one.\n","October 29, 2015","true","45.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the hell out of both games, but both games lack the amount of depth Mad Games Tycoon brings to the table. It combines the core aspects of Game Dev Story/Tycoon and adds in the ability to manage different divisions of your studio. It also adds the ability to publish games, market them, sell game engines, and a lot more. It takes sometime to grasp everything, but if you stick with it you become addicted. Mad Games Tycoon can use a couple more points in the visuals department, particularly with its UI. The graphics are actually pretty good. The main menu is fugly though and the game menus are a little cluttered and not totally polished. It's early access though and this is just nitpicking. I'm just glad this game exists; it’s totally what I was looking for.

It used that Game Development genre and took it to the next level. This game can be played in so many ways, you can make games, produce games which could be your own or other companies. You can purchase shares of other companies  and produce their games or have them only make games for a console you develop. You create rooms for each type of office and there is just so much more.\n\nIt is slightly challenging due to the lack of tutorial for explaining what each thing is or does and some tutorials help in providing how to make games great but they don't know some of the features it seems as well. There are very minor issues with the clashing of objects when placing them down.\n\nOVERALL, A MUST HAVE if you even think you like these type of games.","June 5","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has more variety, it allows you to build rooms yourself, it has a wider range of training parameters, and the story is considerably longer than other tycoon games. At six hours I just encountered the release of the PS2 where in other games we'd be finished the list of events.\n\nThat said the game can be much better. English is clearly not the first language of Eggcode (See event message for game release "3th World War 2") and there needs to be quite a few corrections. Secondly the animation and graphics of the people / employees is terrible. People barely look like people and females are only distinguishable by their names. The game allows you to succeed largely as a producer of engines if you don't have luck making games but I feel this could be expanded and improved to allow for engine marketing and support. Maybe even the design of periphreals to sell with the engine or game. Another issue is that the event messages are strictly limited to other game releases and profit reports. Eggcode should be looking at adding things like conventions, pirating issues, fan requests, and direct interaction with the publishers. The game tracks publisher relationship but that doesn't seem to extend in functionality any further than how likely they are to produce a marketing campaign for your game.","January 11, 2015","true","21.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a more realistic approach like that your employees have to use the bathroom and if they find the room/building cold then they work slower. Although I find working 24/365 unrealistic as I don't think anyone is that passionate about games where they would work without at least taking a vacation in 30 years. Mad Games Tycoon has more ways of making money for example  you can make money off of engines by setting a certain % of profit sharing if people buy your engine and use it for their games. You can also make money from subscriptions from MMO although that needs some balancing.\n\nThe game is still in early access and so far I am happy with the way things are although there are some bugs and things that need balancing.\n\nWould recommend.","January 12, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The consept of the two games are similar, but everything else within the game is much more complex in both tasks and mechanics. You are required to put in a lot of consistant imput, spend a lot of time thinking about growth, and for the perfectionist there is a lot of ways to micromanage, but the game is not built to require it either for the casual gamer making for a great balance.\n\nWhile there are flaws such as how the charachers will get themselves hung up on some objects, I hardly consider such minutia an issue due to the fact that this is an early access game (as of writing this review). For those who loved Game Dev Tycoon, this is a must buy. Just remember when you start the game, there is a sudden learning curve (due to the fact that the early access lacks a detailed tutorial at the time of this review). So for the first time player, treat the first 2-3 starts as a dry run to learn the mechanics, the objects, the rooms, etc. For early access buyers, bear with the learning curve because once you pass the turn its a massive and enjoyable timesink.","January 13, 2015","true","110.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You need proper planning and the game, in its current state, is unforgiving. You cannot resize rooms! Choices like "should I place that expensive one star plant or the cheap one star plant?" become important as you grow a bond with your virtual employees. Sometimes you feel like rewarding them by throwing in an extra fan.\n\nThe game follows accurate history of game development and I felt nostalgic when I could easily relate to 16-bit graphics being a selling point.\n\nI highly recommend you try it out and experience it for yourself but keep in mind : EARLY ACCESS","June 15, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I don't see any cons yet, which for an Early Access game (Which I usually avoid,) is outstanding in itself. It takes a little time to completely figure out how it functions, but that's because it's FAR more complex (In a great way,) then Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nThe amount and levels of control you have is great, highly useful.\n\nI build games... and did horrible at the start.

The UI has gotten a lot worse, but the new things that they have added are REALLY impresive! I played the crap out of Game Dev Tycoon, and Game Dev story (Game Dev story is awful), and I thought that this one was the most indepth by far.\n\nConsole Development in this game has improved a ton and is probably the best console dev simulation out of any game that I have played. You have to research the different items and fetures for your console and then develope it. The only issue is with this is that there are very little of them! After 2020 passes all the fetures have been released. And that leaves you in a lot f trouble, because your console automaticly losses market share over time. So, you then have to make a new console; no big deal. But the problem wtih that is the next console you realese will be a copy and past of the last one, giving your console ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews and ultimately leaving the console dev part of the game unplayable! What I hope Egg Code does is put another layer onto console dev, like a Operating System, that you develope! You put a certain amount of money and time into the OS like you would while making an actual game. Mabye in the begining you could even buy an OS in the same way that you buy engines. And making OS's never ends, so that your console doesn't suck after a while. What would also be awesome would be OS updates!\n\n\nBut, the game development is pretty good. When initialy staring development you are aloud to pick and change a lot of stuff, including the languages that the game is made for, what engine you use, etc. Later in development you are also aloud to make big improvments, like making graphics studios and music studios to make the game look and sound better. Although I have played this game a lot, I still can not defeat legendary mode; it is litteraly impossible. It makes the bank barely give you any money, (and you will need it badly), and LITERALY caps the review at 80%! Oh, and one REALLY bad thing that they added, was caping the amount of updates that you can for a game! ♥♥♥♥ING get rid of that please!!\n\nNow after the most recent update, (which added a hype system and marketing for consoles), I can say that it is the best game developement simulator that is on steam. I was happy to see that that Eggcode releases an update every one to two weeks. I would say to the hardcore and casual gamer that this game is a must! But, buy this game with a grain of salt, becasue you always suck in the first 10 hours that you play, until you memorize what types of games need what.\n\n9/10","January 28","true","186.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm a big fan of simulators and most of them are crap. This one is different and the Dev's have obviously made a commitment to quality versus just trying to turn a quick buck. What is lacking is an end game at this point, or true competition with other Studios in the game. Further, when you add production lines and start self producing games, it becomes a bit difficult to manage without larger buildings, or a more automated process.\n\nThe Dev's at this point could release the game as a full complete addition, and it would rival many of the sim games on Steam. But they promise more, and the sky is the limit as far as how far they take this game.","January 17, 2015","true","24.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But still, I did not and will not judge a game by it lokking or just is a copy of another game, it is content and the way that content is distributed throughout the game by it's engine.  The blend, in my view, is perfect.  However the following are the major flaws I have found to be quite irritating; you must be carefull when selecting options for what you want to be accomplished in a certain room, by opening that menu it pauses the game, but, it does not prevent you from picking up an object/staff member.  Then there is the lag generated by the moving boxes on the pressing machines, tha particle effects of a pressing machine, and from the progress/money icons generated from the staff/machines from progress/up-keep cost, respectivelly.  Next, the way pop-ups are handled in the way that the releases of consoles and the generation of money from a competitor.  I know that you can turn these off, but I belive that they could have added in, say, a ticker bar at the bottom that would not cause the game to pause during me looking up achievements or hurrying to a room to order a contract to be completed in order to avoid bankrupsty.  Finally, the way that games are created are based off of an irratating back/next button desicion screens, I sometimes miscount the number of features, or realise that the game I wanted was either to be market release only or MMO.  It would kinder that they replace the button system with a tab system.  But with the enjoyment/satisfaction I feel I would have to say 8.5 out of 10.","September 9, 2015","true","89.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(which is really what Early Access is all about, unfortunately, not every developer gets this)\n\nWhere it's at:\nThe game is rather stable, my computer can play it without crashing, or encountering many bugs at all (my computer is a 2013 high ender, it's due for an upgrade, but it's still really powerful) this is rare for a game so early in Alpha.\nThe game already has some really great things to play with, the core mechanics seem to all be present to my knowledge.\n\nWhere the game stands now, you can purchase it and have a lot of fun with it.\n\nThe game however has one downside that I personally hope gets addressed, progress on games, research, engines, general progression even progression relating to skills, is really slow, and this means that after finishing a game, you don't really get any real benefit from it in the skill department, your developers do get better at certain genres though, which is a separate system from the skill system.\nAnd to add to that, you are often put in the situation of "I have nothing to do and I'm bored, because I'm just watching things happen" while you wait for a game to complete or an engine to be fully coded, or research to be completed, etc.\nand there needs to be things implemented so you the player have something to do while you wait (maybe a mini game, or just general things to do, click this, this happens kinda thing, for example watering plants, collecting mail, something to keep you occupied)\n\nThe visuals are good enough, but I personally believe they should upgrade the graphics if the developers get the chance, and aren't bogged down with everything else. I'd also like to be able to zoom in further.\n\nWhere is it going scoreboard:\nHas the potential to be:\nVisuals 8/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nDepth and scope: 10/10\nreplayability: 9/10\n\nWhere it's currently at scoreboard:\nVisuals 6.5/10\nGameplay 7.5/10 - (affected mostly by what I discussed above about there being nothing to do during certain parts)\nDepth and Scope: 8.5/10\nreplayability: 8/10\n\nOverall (currently): 8/10\n\nVerdict:\nDo you like tycoon games? do you like money? do you like video games and challenges and management?!\nThen why are you not supporting this?!\nIf you like all of those things, buy this game, support the developers, play the game now and have a good time!\n","January 10, 2015","true","22.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

After reading the reviews and watching let's plays of Game Dev tycoon and Game Dev Story, I came to the conclusion that they both were lacking of deep gameplay and customization mechanics. On the contrary it seemed to be one of the strenght of Mad Games Tycoon which is exactly what convinced me to give it a try.\n\n...and I do not regret it so far:  this game is already very good even on EA. There are flaws and annoying issues of course but also great gameplay mechanics and very good ideas in this game.\n\nPro's:\n\n-Dozens of game genres (Rpg, RTS, FPS, TPS, Sim, MMO, Arcade, Sport, Fantasy, Strategy....) which can be mixed together with a subgenre AND one of the hundred of themes (SuperHeroes, WW2, Pirates, Mafia, Space, Wizards, Planes, Tanks...). This system allows you to make very unique and customized games following (or not) the public current expectations.\n-Office configuration: You create the rooms where your developpers will work, allowing more space and more workforce to key sectors (Research, Development, Support, Server Rooms, Marketing...) This system reminds very much of Theme Hospital and Prison Architect.\n-Characters levelling: Your developpers gain experience in different skills when making games or following courses on specific aspects. You can train a "Sound and music effect" expert team working specifically on music-based game for example, the possibilities are huge.\n-Ability to create your own game engines: Another gameplay approach is the engine development. Bad at game development? You can create games dedicated engines (customizable with a lot of functionnalities) and sell them to the competitors that will send you royalties when they make games with your engines. This alternate gameplay is one of the examples of the game's depth.\n\nCon's:\n\n-The current major issue to me is balance: For my first game in normal difficulty, without knowing anything of the gameplay mechanics, I ended up with 360M$ in about 20 years, leader on the market, releasing only major hits (90%+, 3 MMO's and 50 games overall) with my own high end game engines, with nothing to fear from the competitors (top 20 games were mines).\n-Lack of interaction between us and the competitors: we don't know much about them (stats, strength and weaknesses, no possibility to hire their developpers or see ours being recruted by them). I'd like to see major game companies leading the market with AAA titles like in real life, and struggling to get market shares on their lands. Currently this is simply not the case.\n-Not enough building and rooms objects ATM, and more than half of them are useless (why buying cheap desks when you can have the best for almost nothing).\n-Not enough control on the work force and the budget in general (you can't adjust the wages, no taxes, no charges...) I understand this would make the game a little more complicated but that's what economic simulations are for IMO.\n-Other balance issues: Marketing is basically useless (the publishers do a great job at it and releasing the games on your own (game possibility) is not financially very interesting (you earn millions even without it). Fan mechanics is not developped at all (what do they want? ATM they are only a Score System, sort of...). Some game consoles or computers are not interesting, their market share is too low (why not make unique specificities for them to give them more attractivness: A company focused on casual gaming and movment recognition could target the wii or kinect for example and become one of the leader for these consoles or on this game trend. Or aim at a niche market on another one which would be the best at one type of game.... just toughts.\n-Graphics and Music are poor at the moment, but that's not a major concern for me.\n-No tutorial (I put it here because I saw a lot of negatives comments about that, but that will change for sure).\n\nOverall this is a very good game but it seriously lacks balance at the moment. If the devs manage to balance all this and keep adding features to it, it will be one of the best economic simulator on the market.\n\n6/10 for the current state of the game, but It has the potential to reach 8/10 easily.","January 15, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However...\n\nThe game gives good process, in a Civilization-like manner. You have a couple desks, you release a game, make money, buy more desks, add more rooms, sell more copies, buy a bigger place etc etc etc. This part is very addictive since there really is a ton of stuff (9 different desks, 20-some different rooms, 100+ game subjects etc) to build and set up. However...\n\nBalance: Easy is a walk in the park, while Normal suddenly becomes practically impossible to make money, unless you just concentrate on making game engines and doing contract work. I can't imagine this being what the develoers had in mind. You can release a game that gets good reviews, and release a game with the same staff and setup 6 months later and get Worst Game Of The Year award.\n\nDesign decisions: You start in a garage with not much space, but enough for a small dev space, research center, toilet, and perhaps a marketing office. All this needs to be outfitted a la The Sims. Desks over there, plants over here, lighting, heating, ceiling fans, first aid kid, and on and on. Quite fun in fact. But then you make enough money to move to a bigger place. The game sells all your stuff and plops you down in an empty room where you have to do the whole thing over again. This is less fun. And there are TWELVE different building sizes, and each time you have to put the rooms, desks, plants, lights... This appears baked into the design. It would be so much better to add onto existing space, so you could have fun designing the more exotic rooms you didn't have access to before, because you didn't have the space.\n\nThere are other balance issues, like getting access to console research when you barely have enough money to buy toilet paper, the bank's suicidal-like willingness to continue to loan you ever increasing amounts of money, despite never having made a successful game (Normal difficulty), but this is EA, so we'll see.\n\nSteam forums are dead, but perhaps discussion of this game takes place on another forum.\n\nWhich raises the question: How do you make a 'deep' game with this subject matter? As a gamer, you have foreknowledge of the history of games. Adventure games were really big for a while, but now they're not. The Dreamcast flopped. The PS is gonna be big. If you know all that, the game should be easy. If you don't know that (or set the game to random trends) then the winning and losing will appear arbitrary.\n\nI'll be back for 1.0.","June 5","false","32.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

While that is true, this game is severely lacks polish. There seems to be little rhyme or reason as to why games succeed or do not. Though I did not play for long, a basic explanation of the mechanics would go a long way to increasing my enjoyment. When the core gameplay loop is resource management but the only source of information is trial & error, you have a problem.\n\nThis game also sorely lacks professional localization. Sometimes translation errors are funny, but when your command of english is so bad that your tutorial only half-communicates the message it's time to bring in a native speaker of the language. The entire time I was playing I kept thinking, "Just let me go through all this text and fix it, my god."I know that this is a small project, but one tweet from the dev for crowd sourced english corrections would solve the problem.\n\nLastly, the sound effects in this game seem to be intentionally annoying. There are numerous threads on the internet complaining about this. Sound assets do not cost much, and there are even free sound effect packages out there that would be much more pleasing.\n\nI did want to love this game, the way I love Game Dev Tycoon.

More troubling is the fact that the developer suffers from a complete lack of focus on so many areas of the game (as others have mentioned).\n\nHere's an example:\nI get that toilets is a part of every day life, but when your little worker ants go potty as the game speeds forward at a pace where weeks are seconds, I see no reason why I should be treated to the view said ants taking a 15 second potty break, and then don't even wash their hands. That's right. After 15 weeks spent on a potty break (don't ask me what they ate), don't even wash their hands. Filthy animals!\n\nI'm not saying I want the developer to add a new animation just to show me that my employees are wasting another couple of weeks washing their hands, I'm saying we're getting distracted by this whole potty nonsense to begin with! Just like the developer! There's no reason to even show such behavior at all, unless we're moving at a real time pace, in which case, those filty animals better wash up! A simple complaint notification about there not being a proper bathroom with a toilet and sink would be more than enough.\n\nIn Game Dev Tycoon, the employees need vacations now and again. That's fine. Perfect, in fact... because this isn't a real time kinda game. Focus on the big stuff, and not the potty. Please.\n\nAnother example of the developer wasting time:\nThere's no need for 3D models just to make a thumbnail representation of each individual worker ant. The 3D models currently in use are so badly made, I can't even tell race or gender most the time. I was playing the game, and it suddenly struck me that I only looked at the stats when hiring people. Go figure! My brain told me to hire the most skilled worker ants over the rest. I forgot all about being "politically correct" and trying to "diversify" my staff, so I decided - because I'm a perfectionist (and an idiot) - that I would make an effort to make sure my staff was in fact diverse.\n\nThat's where I ran into said problem, not being able to tell the one from the other. But it doesn't really matter. This isn't real life and I don't live in a country that's run amok with politically correctness. It's not even a feature in the game. I'm honstly just wasting your time with this rant, just like the developer is wasting their time making 3D models that suck, instead of making simple 2D graphics and focus their efforts on what this game is really about! Managing a game company! You'd think a game company would grasp this inescapable revelation.\n\nThe "tutorial guy" that pops up and tells you what to do talks too much, and doesn't really help that much. I was better off just clicking around and figuring things out on my own. There's no mention of how big a room should be in comparison to other rooms, or how many desks you would need to get a balanced workload.\n\nIn the smaller buildings, you'll want to maximize on what little space there is, but you can't create wall to wall rooms in certain scenarios because you're only allowed to have one door! That means you have to waste space on hallways, which really feel like undeveloped, empty space.\n\nThe gamebreaking fault with this game:\nI spend hours and hours in my very first garage, slowly figuring out what was important and what wasn't. I ended up with a simple one desk office, a one desk research pit of despair, a bathroom which I'm having some kind of problem with (apparently), and I think that was about it. From these humble beginnings went from struggling to survive, to making millions of dollars! Then I bought a gigantic office space, spent half the day drawing up rooms and adding props. A few hours later I had 1500 Mill $ in the bank, a thriving MMO and the ability to produce and store millions of copies of my own games. That is to say: I was done. No new consoles coming out anymore. Nothing more to aspire to. Game Over!\n\nIt's like the game doesn't have proper stages for advancement. At one point, my worker ants were making a AA game. I clearly didn't have the staff for it, because it took about 20 years to finish, and every year I'd show up with a booth at the convention just to pick up more fans along the way. The fans stayed true and loyal for 20 years as I was promising to deliver. That aspect is something Game Dev Tycoon did really well. If you didn't publish within a certain timeframe after marketing your game, you'd lose fans so fast it looked like a snowball rolling downhill, heading straight for your office.\n\nIf I had to do it all again, I'm pretty sure I could reach the same level of success in half a day, and that's not a game worth money to me. There's not much replayability here. I know, because I don't want to go through this circus again. Besides, games like this are only really fun before you graduate to the big leagues, at which point it becomes a managing nightmare. This is why in real life we delegate! I don't want to have to tell that guy to do these same six things with every game I make! He should learn to do this automatically, because that's what I'd tell him to do if this was real life! I'm the boss! I don't wanna deal with all the little things. I have minions for that! I just wanna make the big decisions! There's management, and then there's micro-management.\n\nWhen all is said and done, this game goes a smidge deeper than Game Dev Tycoon, but there are simply too many faults, missing pieces and lack of focus for me to think that Mad Games Tycoon will ever match the geniusly simplistic, polished marvel that is Game Dev Tycoon. Scrap this one. Start over. As for my recommendation: Don't buy!

I'm not saying it's bad, but I couldn't get straight into it like I did Game Dev Tycoon, which I think is better. There's just something about it - it seems to be missing something, soul, atmosphere, appropriate sound effects and game feedback. I don't feel immersed and I don't care about my character. Everything happens so damn fast, too.\n\nThere are other issues, like lack of a tutorial or help, so you have to figure it out for yourself. Personally I also find many of the sound effects annoying (and the music) so I turn them down (many sound like something out of the early 90s). I don't much care for the UI either - too much clicking and mousing around for buttons. Another thing that annoys me is that my character is always followed/surrounded by icons and other info graphics, especially when he is at the desk working. It seems cluttered and looks ugly.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are otherwise generally nice and the devs seems to have put quite a lot of thought into the game dev world elements (but it doesn't work as well as Game Dev Tycoon). And to their credit the devs seem to be very active in developing and updating the game.\n\nBut I just can't get excited about it, it leaves me cold, and somewhat irritated.

I don't think this will change, at all, although it's just in pre-alpha. And, that is, that they have this pop-up boxes PLUS they animate the entire screen once the pop up boxes are clicked off.\n\nWhy is this a problem? It is an epilepsy hazzard. Even though, I don't think I have it, I am very sensitive to screens flashing all over the place.\n\nFor instance, WoW had an animation whereupon if you were in a vehicle and you were taking damage, they made a red vignette flash around the screen. When I contacted Blizzard about it, they had already provided to completely remove it.\n\nI understand that the pop-ups are there to create interest in the game, but literally, they could provide a side icon that is permanent, that could light up when whatever state is ready, lights it up.\n\nI notice that if something small is on the screen, permanently there, and if it simply lights up, it doesn't cause so much eye stress.\n\nSecondly, losing control of the game is terribly annoying to me. And, this is the 2nd complaint about these pop-ups.\n\nLet's think about this for a second. If I am the executive director of a company, no one is going to send me a pop-up to tell me they are done with their poster marketing campaign. In fact, I find it highly juvenile that you don't have a queue of tasks for all departments.\n\nAlso, you have no feedback, nor projections of what tasks are hoped to accomplish by their monetary expenditure.\n\nYou've flushed out the other Game Tycoon games, but have left out the key components of why the successsful tycoons were so successful, feedback.\n\nYou can't have a game with the detail of self production and self publication and leave out any feedback of what you're going to get from spending any money or contracts, or campaigns.","August 21, 2015","false","43.3"," 0 of 14 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","14","0","0"

But does not mean i can't make a review about it... So when i entered this game, I was kinda really hoping I would see something similar to game dev tycoon... But this game is different big time... Not in a good way...\nFirst off\n\nThe graphics they used aren't really that good for what type of game this is suppose to be. it kinda feels like when you compare Game of War to Clash of Clans graphics wise... In this case, Mad games Tycoon to Game Dev Tycoon. The graphics for this game are just mad.. (see what i did there).\n\nThis game requires to much to learn how to properly play it, and takes to long to do 1 task. Like making a game engine has never been more annoying in this. In Game Dev, it was rather simple, you clikc a few buttons, add a few features without going through a giant maze, you name it. Your done.. In this though, You need to click so many things just to add a feature. it is annoying, and just rude to make a player do that. Games like this are for casual players... They failed on that part.\n\noverall, I disliked my first 20 minutes of playing this. I spent more time writing this review then palying it so far. So in this, They should of made this a casual type game. They failed to make you start off in a "lowly garage". They failed to make reasonable graphics for this type of game... the plus side is though.. this is still in Early Access.. So they can fix it whenever they want...\n\ni would say.. Don't be afraid to make something completely similar to game Dev.. Your idea your going towards is perfect. How much customization you can put into your office space, How you can completely choose what your staff members will be. just really good mechanics in some cases.. but just a lot of things screwed up that are quite important.\n\n(Also about the fact that you have to wait a second for every pop up to fade in is quite annoying).","June 17, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 18 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","18","0","0"

What percentage of the budget should you devote to graphics vs. sound? etc. Apparently, the game favors particular combinations of the sliders which represent these values. Thus, to create a successful game, you need to randomly guess what would make a game of that genre and of that topic successful. Good luck with that, as after an hour of trial and error I have yet to come up with anything. There isn't even a good wiki or forum to reference (although I am a big believer that a game should never require you to utilize outside resources in order for you to play it). I honestly don't know how there are any positive reviews, as I don't know how anyone could figure out how to do well in this game.\n\nOf course, I could be completely wrong about all of this, as there is no tutorial yet. So for all I know, I may have completely misinterpreted everything. I might try this game again after I watch some Let's Plays and they release a tutorial.","May 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 16 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","16","2","0"

If you are looking for a similar game to Game Dev Tycoon, you will find it here but it is not built as well.\n\nTo start, the game, while offering more options then GDT, does not have the same feeling of "doneness" as GDT does. Again, this is Early Access, so that is a given. However, even being Early Access, one can say this feels more like an alpha then anything else.\n\nThe game lacks a tutorial, has bad spelling (I assume the developers are German) and over all, the design is somewhat low-budget.\n\nI would recommend waiting out the game to start. Watch it from afar to see if the developers are able to piece the game together. If they do, then this will be a game worth talking about.","January 6, 2015","false","24.0"," 24 of 74 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","24","74","0","1"

I can enjoy all sorts of games, so i am open for new things, and this one got me hooked for now xD so why not give my opinion on what seems to be a promesing game.\n\nBrings back memories, when i start playing and find myself still playing 4-5 hrs later.\nFor me its the best 15€ i spend this year (i know, 2015 just started, but worth mentioning imo) and to be honest, i didnt expected that!\nIt looked like an ok game to me, but its way better then i imagined.\nIf you like tycoon games, are willing to put some hours into the game to get to learn it, and are a game-fan just like me, i would not hesitate and spend those 15€ on this game.\n\nRemember its early acces, it needs more fine-tuning, but no game-breaking problems encountered yet! (Seen ohter Early-Acces games doing much MUCH worse!)\nDeveloper is active on Steam forum, listening to their customers, something i can only praise!\nGame gets regular updates, adding content, so they are working on it! (i was very pleased to see an even larger company building after a certain update this week, no such thing as to much space :)\n\nAll those who complaign its the same as game dev tycoon:\n1) du-uh, they are both game dev tycoon games, and from what i hear (dont have game dev) there are plenty of differences....\n2)The more choices we have, the better! Healty competition is good for us, cusomers :)\n\nI really recommend this game to every game-fan!\n\nThanks Eggcode for making this game, and keep up the good work and im sure this will become (already is) a game that will steal alot of free time hours!\n\n\n+Gameplay\nI like the Sims Style - build and decorate - ur company (More objects are always welcome)\n+Graphics are not SUPER but deff ok\n+Start small - Grow big\n+Deff worth its money\n\n\n-Sounds are getting enoying very quickly :/\n-Some important things should be added later (maybe u guys are already working on this)\n*A pause / speed up button. (while still being able to give commands PLZ :) )\n*Being able to adjust room sizes by dragging the walls? its a pain to have to sell the whole room and everything in it (and loosing alot of money in the process) because it should be 1 square larger to fit in what u want to fit in\n*Pauze development / research / ....\n*Simple tutorial!\nLearhing curves can be steep at the beginning! so why not start a tutorial in the smallest garage building, where u show ppl how to get set up right?...\n*More in-depth info on all sorts of stuff\n*More ways to spend ur money mid-late game\n*Why can other developers build their consoles, and not us?\n*More content, more objects, more more more xD\n","January 15, 2015","true","141.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
