Sadly it's a lackluster title that will merely wet your appetite for an industry simulator that we've all been craving.  It's worth closer to $10-15.  Would recommend Cities in Motion 2 or Euro Truck Simulator 2 for a better executed experience.","July 30, 2014","false","7.2"," 249 of 310 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","249","310","0","11"

Keep in mind I have played city and business sims before.\n\nIE offers an extensive tutorial that will introduce you to its mechanics. This game seems to be very detailed and nuanced in terms of its gameplay mechanics. You not only make larger choices about where to place buildings, but you hand-pick the number and type of trucks needed to deliver your goods; different trucks transport different goods. You will also need to maintain your vehicles as time goes on. Also, you can actually determine the shape of the land you purchase for development, as well as the location of buildings within a given plot.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, but they are serviceable and get the job done. So far, I haven't run into any bugs or problems of note.\n\nI'll update this impression once I get more gametime under my belt.\n\nUpdate: The various information panels available are acutually useful and helpful. As vets of the genre know, this is not always the case with this kind of game.\n\nYour primary source of income will be from fulfilling orders for various products. You will need to deliver the products on time in order to avoid a penalty for late delivery. The game ends if you run out of money. However, you can get a limited number of loans (six, I think) from the bank.\n\nIt looks like the game has two gameplay modes: freeplay and scenarios. At launch, there are six different scenarios for you to choose from, which place in charge of varying industries at different stages of development. While the scenarios seem somehwhat interesting, I think most gamers will want to go for freeplay option.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. I know there are concerns about the the developer's past releases, but I decided to take the plunge, and I am enjoying myself so far.\n\nUpdate 7/31:  Still enjoying the game overall. Pick-up and delivery of goods are made instantly once a truck arrives at a given destination. It looks like the early game is limited to farming, and you will gain access to diffirent techonologies and industries as the game progresses. The game can drag a bit at regular speed when waiting for production of various goods to hit a desired level, but you can speed-up time to compensate.\n\nOne minor issue I have run into is the awkwardness of knowing how big the next plot you're going to buy needs to be in order to accomodate a given building. Right now, you have to go into the Buildings menu select the building and look at it's footprint; then you have click on the Land menu and draw out the plot based on your memory of said footprint. This isn't so bad when you're placing one or two buildings, but it can become a bit of a challenge when you're doing more. It's not a dealbreaker, but it is annoying.\n\nIf you want to mine, you can order a geological survery that will tell you the size of given deposits in an area, and I wish there were something similar available for setting up water plants. There doesn't appear to to be a water table that tells you what areas of the map have more water than others, and this is a feature I really liked in the latest SimCity. Currently, it seems like you can just plop a water plant anywhere, and it will produce the same amount of water.\n\n\nWorkers become available instantly when you build residences and request a given number, so there's no gradual build-up of the population like in other games. This may not be realistic, but it does allow you get facilities up and running sooner since you don't have to wait for workers to become available once requested. Their travel to and from work is not simulated either.\n\nI still haven't encountered any major bugs or crashes. I'll update these impressions again soon.\n\nUpdate 7/31 #2: Okay, after playing the game for a while on Freeplay, I would still recommend this title for fans of the genre. If you are trying to choose between IE and the latest Sim City, however, I would go for Sim City, as it's prettier and, perhaps, more streamlined and refined in some of its gameplay elements. Some folks have been reporting lag spikes and sluggish gameplay.  I really haven't had any problems in those regards. All of the game features I have tried have worked as one would expect.\n\nThe bottom line IMHO is that this is a competent entry into the city building genre, but it could use a facelift and some subtle improvements  to make  it even better. Perhaps the price tag should be a bit lower given these issues, but this is a generally robust simulation that seems to offer a solid foundation for some good fun. If you're on the fence, wait and see if and how the devs respond  to suggetions and complaints.","July 30, 2014","true","28.8"," 92 of 121 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","92","121","0","3"

And all of this time, I've been nothing but supportive and hopeful, waiting for this to occur. But now, I've finally thrown in the towel and decided it's time to call this donkey for what it is.\n\nAll you really have to do is go to the forums and you'll quickly see other peoples' reasons for dissatisfaction with this game. But speaking for myself, the worst aspect of the game is that has an economic model that creates orders/demand for you to start a business, then dries up those orders to ZERO unless you open other businesses (with different products) to develop the surrounding towns to create more demand for your original product. Sound ridiculous? It is. For example, you go from building a successful egg producing business to suddenly, zero demand (due to no one in the world eating eggs anymore because their town is too small, apparently). It takes all of the positive, enjoyable parts of the game, wads it up, lights it on fire, and throws it out the window. Have you ever heard of a business game "on rails"?\n\nI don't know if I've ever even written a negative review on Steam. But, my level of frustration and disappointment in this game has led me for this to be my first. Is this the worst game ever made? No, but it completely misses the mark of creating an enjoyable progression of building your business to be what you want it to be (which to me, is the point of game like this, Railroad Tycoon, etc...). This game is SUCH a missed opportunity and the developers seem to be oblivious and completely disengaged. Not a good way to run your uh...  business. So, save yourself the frustration and do not buy this game.","May 31, 2015","false","24.9"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","40","44","0","0"

Does not install properly, requiring you to find and install a specific version of DirectX and PhysX, must be run as administrator (also during install), must change GFX card config to abnormal settings (which will break other games if not changed back first), must run at low-quality audio on your soundcard, cannot use anything above 16-bit 44.1kHz (CD-Quality), which is shamefully poor with today's common 24-bit or at least 16-bit 192kHz, and i've literally never seen a game that can't downsample-  it requires you to nerf and reconfigure your whole system just to run it.  Then, once you've done ALL THAT, you will STILL find that it crashes to desktop constantly.  In-game features such as auto-scheduling product deliveries are broken (they ONLY work if ALL the goods are available at the very moment of the order, at ONE location, AND can fit on ONE truck... which will never happen.)\nTo top it all off, their support seems to think all these problem are 'okay' and 'normal' for games 'these days'.  They're deluded and insane.\nThis could have been a nice game, but the incredibly poor compatability with standard computers, lack of configureability, ineffective patches, haphazard coding, poor performance, and dismissive support attitude are all enough to make this a truly awful, painful experience that is more frustrating than it's worth for a medeocre and seemingly unfinished game with few original elements to a genre with only a half dozen entries!  Really, they couldn't do ANYTHING new?  The strange lack of development in many areas (such as the fact the only source of power in this world is, apparently, solar?) and clunky interface (you can't 'back out' of some 'draw' menus and must switch menus to get back to normal click-to-interact modes) just... ugh.\n\nConsider this game a painful basket of lessons being learned by an indie developer.  Hopefully they can add some real content, fix the interface, and for the love of GOD get it working within some modicum of basic computer gaming standards... then, maybe they'd have a good little game.  But as it stands?\n2.5 out of 10.  Go play Capitalism 2 instead.\n\nAlso, just a note.  It has crashed to desktop 19 times in the 90 minutes i've been 'playing' it.  Oh, but I can run Minecraft for 8 hours without one crash?\nThey just didn't even try to make this thing stable.\n\n\n\nIF you really need help or are unlucky enough to have bought it, and are one of the people (see:  most) who can't even get it to run, please feel free to send me a message on Steam and i'll try to walk you through all the many steps to make your computer compatible.

You build industry around a map after buying land and produce in a 'unit per hour' style to then sell to cities which, depending on population, have needs. You build truck hubs to send out trucks to pick up goods and deliver all over the map. Even if you've found this style of gameplay fun, there are some significant drawbacks to this particular title.\n\nThe actual method of getting goods to market is not the smoothest method either. You'll find yourself doing extremely mundane tasks with a lot of clicking - and there is no simple 'deliver per month' that would make bringing things to market more automated and streamlined. This is only set up between your own factories.\n\nThe actual manner in which your vehicles take things to their orders is unsatisfying. Undetailed vehicles, no sense of loading and unsatisfying sound effects mean that the thing you'll do over and over seems to reap little reward. There's no ching or money or roar of engine, no sense of big loads or interesting vehicles. In this regard, it falls short of previous, older, non-3d titles.\n\nThe method of land purchase, itself, is a little obnoxious. If there were tools to help you fill in gaps or 'snap to road' and 'snap to non buyable land' options, it would be a little less so - but with large footprints, winding Freight Tycoon style roads and rigidly blocky buildings, you'll find yourself with an ugly landscape rather quickly. You point and click to form a shape. If you've ever played Cities XXL and built a farm - the manner is identical, but for the ability to snap to lines and fill in spaces. This, agan, is sorely missed, costs time and leaves gaps.\n\nFurthermore, there is little sense of border in some buildings. To make roads between them, you'll often be clicking on invisible (Indeed, also 3d) footprints as you select and build roads to create alleys and access roads.\n\nTo progress through the game you start with a few buildings, earn money and level up. This releases more buildings and products - that cities, too, will begin to pick up as they grow. To make a city grow you have to supply it with as much as you can. This means you'll be taking large numbers of orders.\n\nThe different menus you have to go through to send a truck, the inability to rename vehicles or places to create senses of locales or purposes (Especially helpful as your plants specialize in products), you'll come to know them as 32, 44, 1 and 3. Not only unpersonal, but it continues to take away from an immersion of the game. A simple option to rename would have helped. You wont see the load capacities of trucks when you send them out - you have to actually select the logistics depot, go to purchase a new vehicle and determine it from there.\n\nA truck will then leave, 'touch' its source destination to instantaneously load, get stuck behind a vehicle going slowly (ala Freight Tycoon without the passing or upgrading of roads), and then 'touch' its destination to deliver it. The sound effects are ala Windows 95 System Sounds than an actual game, and the little details that make the sight and sounds of these games, the sense of a day to day operation, seem lost.\n\nI've tried playing this quite a bit, and it still suffers from a crash to desktop every couple of hours. More importantly, the more I play this, the more I not want to play this. I want to go back to other titles to get a sense of satisfaction that they, as a game, give. Though newer and in 3d, this game is both expensive and lacks a sense of basic heart, soul and effort that others have tried to give. I don't recommend it.\n\nAs a sidenote, the graphics are clean enough when zoomed in - but this is a view you will be rarely using. Zooming out, they very quickly become pixelated and seem rough.","August 2, 2014","false","16.4"," 32 of 49 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","32","49","0","0"

I was waiting for a game like this!\nAnd I'm Surprised. This game is good... Really Good!\n\nLet's have a deeper look on it:\n\nPro's:\n1. If you like micromanagement games, like I do, you will enjoy this game, becouse it can guarantee you at least 100 hours of gameplay.\n2. The Game is BEAUTIFUL! The design is what it should be!\n3. The Gameplay is the best of it's genre. You can Hire workers, buy lands, research new upgrades for your factories, buy trucks, buy your OWN House!!! And it's still not over: You have an achievement section and the Trade Cards too. But this is not the biggest thing in the game.\n4. Skill Tree: Yep! Halleluia! Finaly somebody, who told: 'Let's Put Skill Trees in this game!' They ARE helpful, and can give you a boost in-game.\n5. Price system is really accurately done. The prices are never too high or too low... they may seem to be, but none of them are. They are perfectly equilibrated with the game.\n6. Autosave Feature: The game at least not punish you to restart everything from the beggining. Every 3 monthses (please correct me if I'm wrong) your game is automatically saved, so if the game crashes, you are saved.\n\nCons:\n1. Still Buggy: There are still some bugs in-game, like what happened to me today: The acchievement system broke down, and now I can't use my skill points. Sad story, hopefully it will be patched in the v1.02.\n2. Engine Crashes: Sometimes (especially if you play more than 4-5 hours), the game just shuts down by it's own, loosing all your progress from the last Autosave... Sad, sad, sad. Not talking about the engine what needs 2.4GHz Dual Core Processor. It can be a nightmare for some players to play with it for the lags. :(\n3. The Mechanics: This tipe of game is not for everybody! If you want to get to the top quickly, this game is not for you! Be patient, and you will have your Gold Medal! :D\n4. Graphics Settings: As Soon as you enter to the map, you will see the blured trees, and say: 'OMG Why?'. Just turn off the Blur mode, and the game will be Fine! :)\n5. PC Requirements: They are TOO high for this tipe of game. I know that the INSOMNIA engine is powerfull enough, but why did it have to be so outrageously demanding? (Not my teritory, just saying) Sometimes less is more!\n6. The Price: Just one question: WHY??? I bought this game in the GameStop for 15€... Half price like here. And what is different? I don't think so, there is any difference.\n\nMy opinion about this game? Well, if you are a HARDCORE gamer, who likes this genre (micromanagement), than you will be fine with this game. :)\nFor others: If you would like to try this game, buy it at the GameStop or wait until the price will drop down! You should probably give it a try!\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10 (will be updated after the release of the new patch!)\n\nCheers!","October 26, 2014","true","19.7"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","0"

This game is a refreshing new take on a tired old genre that hasn't had much in the past few years. It's great at scratching the same itch as the Railroad Tycoon series or OpenTTD while adding new game play elements.\n\nI've only played for one evening and can see that it might have limited re-playability value - the progression seems fairly linear and it might not be exciting the 3rd or 4th time through. It's a long progression though, so to me, the $25 price is a good value for a single play-through. Other people might disagree, but I expect a solid 20-40 hours of fun.\n\nIf you do not enjoy tycoon games you will hate this game.

I don’t have a powerful graphics card, but the screens lead me to believe I’d be ok (I can run many more visually appealing games on mid-low settings, like Anno 2070 and Sleeping Dogs). On the lowest settings the game still runs kinda low and the software cursor is often choppy.\n\nI did encounter a bug in the tutorial where one of the dialogues that didn’t have any apparent requirements (no click here, etc) did not advance. I was able to skip it and complete the tutorial.\n\nThe game itself presents to be a  more complex SimCity (not that always online crap, I'll never play it so I can't compare), it looks very indepth and in many ways looks like it's trying to deliver exactly what I want.\n\nThe game requires lots of micromanagement, which isn’t on its own a bad thing. I prefer games that give me lots of control over what needs to be done. There is a strange lack of automation however. For example, when I built a chicken coop, even after I assign workers to it, I have instruct it to start producing chickens, which is its only function.\n\nTransporting goods between buildings and to contracts is similar. This makes more sense and does allow you to program the route so it repeats. However, I was unable to find a way to queue tasks. I had one farm truck and contracts to two different cities. The game did not allow me to start both tasks as I had only one truck. Preferably, it would set the tasks in a queue and available, unassigned trucks would go.\n\nI entered Freeplay and balked at first at the lack of freedom (no industry buildings, no research options) until I learned that you level up through completing orders and your level is saved to your profile (so future freeplay games will start at a higher level). I played for a bit but became bored at how slow the progress was.\n\nI ended my play session when I realized one order that I had set up game days ago was never delivered. Nor were the other two contracts I had just set up for delivery. Supposedly there is a way to track a trucks motion, but when I was looking for it, the game began to run very slowly and I had reached my limit.\n\nPROs\n*Very complex looking game\n*Has a leveling system where your actions make your more efficient\n\nCONS\n*Poor graphical engine (this may be unique to people on lower powered systems)\n*Buggy and/or sometimes unintuitive\n*Lack of effective automation\n\nFinal thoughts: I guess it is less of a simulation game and more of a literal sandbox, meaning you are a kid in an actual sandbox playing with your Tonka truck, You have to find the sand, dig the sand, and put the sand in the truck, and push it in the direction you want it to go.

In that game, one had to use your mind to come up with some strategies.  However, Industry Empire lacks in several of those areas.\nDislikes:\nThe game does not seem like a game, rather than a grind.  The concepts are easy to master.\nIn order to level, one simply has to play long enough and sell enough "goods" to an infinite market.\nOnce you get enough $, you can buy more land to build another building to shorten the time to the next sell.\nThe game has a severe lack of features.  For instance, you can change the speed of the simulation, which is good considering time is the biggest adversary.  Unfortunately, the game notifies you when one of your storage buildings is full.  Which is good, except it puts the game back down to a crawl.  There is no option to disable the mandatory slow down of the time.\n\nBottom line:  The concept is good.

The problem is that Industry Empire isn't fun to use/play. I admit I didn't go as far as actually finish the whole tutorial (played half an hour), big flaws emerged far before it ended.\n\nClaiming a land requires drawing a free polygon within which you can construct only rectangular based buildings. This system implies messy placement, clumsy space optimisation, lack of "snap into place" that'd have actually helped the player play the game (maybe the devs thought using square/hexagonals cells was so 90s... I dunno). Drawing the roads is a nightmare, without any clear indication whether they effectively connect or not with the building. Again, free placement, no hint, no idea what you're doing right or wrong.\n\nThe GUI doesn't completely work either. I suspect some bugs, but it also doesn't work on from the ergonomy standpoint. What's the use of both a Reset button and a Cancel button where the Reset button actually Cancels everything you just did? And do we really need scrollbars on which you cannot click to page up/page down?\n\nDuring placement, say during road placement, you can select buildings on which you missclick without even leaving the placement tool. Now what?\n\nThe game looks and feels like a pain to play. I would recommend playing Banished again. Good UI, solid, fun to play. It might not be as rich as this one but it works just fine.\n\nI can't just have a clear opinion on the price tag, but it feels like 30€ is a bit too much for what we end up with.","July 30, 2014","false","0.4"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","30","54","0","0"

Economy simulators are not for everyone.  In fact, very few people will be able to dig their claws into them.\n\nWhen you go to the grocery store do you look at all of the products in front of you and immediately calculate in your head which is the best per gram/oz?  If not, you probably don't have the kind of mind made for these games.  Economy simulators are designed around people who can curb every nickle and every dime to maximize profits.  They make spreadsheets in their head and can figure out the exact figure of every single profit margin.\n\nIndustry Empire is an attempt to try and soften the genre for less hardcores by making things more manual and thus less complicated.\n\nIn a general economy simulator the purpose of creating product is for the use of the population.  They demand TVs and you get them TVs.  In this game there is no local demand, it is entirely export basis... kind of like Tropico.\n\nThe game tries to get a little deeper than Tropico by making this all manual.\n\nSo let's say you have begun producing Eggs.  You need to sell those eggs.  You go to an order sheet and pick which offers you'd like to accept.\n\nYou fulfill those orders by shipping product on trucks.  Trucks come in different types that have limitations on what kind of product they can ship and how much they can ship.  Min/maxing means only having as many trucks as you need to fulfill orders for each kind of product while having large enough trucks to fulfill the sizes of orders you need to fulfill.\n\nAs you continue to do business you level up and gain access to new products you can make.\n\nThe key to these kinds of games is the production chain.  So you start off with basic resources but as you level up you can make more complicated resources.  You might start off with cows.  Then you get a butcher to cut them into beef.  Then you might get a sausage factory to make beef hotdogs.  After this maybe you'll get a hotdog factory to make microwavable hotdogs.  Each step in production increases your costs but also increases your profitability.\n\nTo further promote selling more products the game limits you on how many orders you can fulfill.\n\nTo further incentive you to sell different products they also have achievements which will give you bonus points when leveling up.\n\nA secondary feature of leveling up is the Leveling Tree.  You will gain certain static points modifiers that will make life easier.  Your level stays for every single play so the game actually gets progressively easier as you continue to play it. It means good players will spend less time at the game, whereas bad players will spend more.\n\nWhat the game lacks is a lot of character to get you into the game. With Tropico, Anno, and SimCity you are given missions and goals that will continuously pop up throughout a game.  This game has nothing like this.  You are left to your own means with no real direction on what to do.\n\nAnother major weakness to the game is the lack of automation.  You can schedule deliveries to your own facilities to keep your own production going.  But there is no way to automatically sell product to the various towns.  You have to fulfill the orders which takes endless hours and may be just too tedious for the average player to stomach.\n\nOn top of that the game has some minor issues with crashing.  This would all be fine if you were getting a phenomenal game... but you're not.\n\nOverall the game lacks a lot of design that you would find in similar games.  Unfortunately there are just far better simulators out there that are older.  Anno 2070 which was released in 2011 is a far superior game to Industry Empire which was released in 2014.  The catch is that Anno is the exact same price (including all DLC). Stick with Anno... unless you've already played Anno to death and want to try something different... then pick up this game at a Steam sale.","January 6, 2015","false","18.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

This is work you pay for and death will not come soon enough to safe you from it.\n\nEdit: There has been a update to the game wich is pretty much as useless as the basic game was because it will allow you to let the system make transport orders for you but only if all conditions for said order are met in advance... so its still a lot of guessing, comparing and estimating and pretty much doesnt work. I did actually try to take all the offers aviable on the market and set everything to "auto" and yet still i did not see a single truck go anywhere. I hope the next update will allow for the "vehicle task" to be created even without having the needed ammount of resources on hand before... then it MIGHT become a game instead of just a boring job...","August 1, 2014","false","0.8"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","21","45","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kozlic/recommended/291930/","Kozlic","mstrasner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kozlic/","79 products in account","I bought this game because I love industry/production games. There's nothing better than starting from nothing, building up you business and see the profits roll in.\nThis game allows you to do just that. It's fairly similar to Farming Giant but FG is better if you don't include the constant crashes.  Why is FG better? Because you don't have to click 100 times just to sell your products. There you can sell directly to the city and you can automate that process the same way as you can automate the supply of your factories in Industry Empire.\nThis game is good but it would really need automated selling to make it great. Because now, you can't focus on expanding because you constantly have to accept and fulfill orders.\nIf the orders get bigger later in the game, maybe it gets easier. But fulfilling 20 unit orders  to make 200 bucks gets boring real quick.\nI would really suggest that they add a more automated selling process with the first update! It's an urgent update!\n\nEDIT:\nSo the update came with automated selling process. Yaaaay you might think. But hold it right there cause it ain't what you think it is. You still have to click about 5 times to earn 300 units of money. You have to search for a task, see if you have enough resources, accept it (it get's auto completed if you have enough trucks/workers).\nMaybe I'm doing the game injustice here because I have only played 8 hours but it was painful 8 hours to be honest.\nYou start with 2 mil, have to spend it all to start leveling the city but then the city decides to change the resources needed and you have to sell everything for half the price that you bought it but only made 10k in 6 months with it. (You can start selling to another city but then this city starts shrinking and your work is wasted)\nI'm amazed how some people managed to level the cities to 60k+ population without losing their minds.\nI thought this would be more like Farmig Giant which was GREAT! (minus the crashes and money disappearing). I will give it a few more hours but I don't recommend it anymore.","August 1, 2014","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
