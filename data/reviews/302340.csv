Tex Murphy is an old school private eye, a man from the past living a cyberpunk detective noir life in the future.  The text in the game reads like a cliche 1940's detective movie which makes for a cool atmosphere.  Your case is to find the CEO of Terraform's missing daughter, and some other thing which the CEO doesnt name, but its a thing.\n\nThis game is a point and click adventure, you choose an option at the bottom like, use, or move, and then click something on the screen.  I've noticed its always best to look at everything, just try to use your imagination with the pixels, this is old school, its a fun game once you get your imagination fired up you lose sight of the pixelated visuals becoming the flatfoot private eye Tex Murphy.  When talking to people you see this old school computer video with audio dialog of them talking, its old school look makes the game actually feel gritty like a cheap detective novel.  Going through dialog trees sometimes over and over you can ask questions to get a raging clue going about how to solve the case.\n\n*This game is unplayable, there is a bug with Max Malden, he asks you to help him solve the "Andretti case", which should result in a new dialog option with others about Angelo Andretti, however in the steam version this never occurs.  This ends progression in the game since you cant continue without finding out about "Angelo Andretti"\n\nWill this gamebreaking bug be patched?  Who knows so Buyer Beware!  Even broken its worth checking out to see what gaming was like back in the day.\nRating:  1/10  Value:  $0.99","June 14, 2014","true","3.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","2"

Also remember names and places and distinguish characters and such which often makes a good adventure game.\nThe graphics and sound however are really old and are just acceptable for me. Although I played games during the 90's, I am used to modern graphics. On my 20" Flatscreen monitor the game looks awfully pixelated.\nHowever I bought this game with a nice discount offer from its usual price, so I am happy with it.\nI may also buy 'Under a killing moon' for the story and review score on steam and adventure game review websites.","January 8","true","12.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Otherwise it's the regular ask all the things on the list then continue to some location to find items. The story is corny scifi but it works great like always. There are games that are good only to be look back with nostalgia but when actually played you realize it isn't that good like you remember, but Tex Murphy is not like that, Tex was good when it was released and it is good game today, the graphics can cause a little problem if you play with big screen, because you need to spot all these little items, so I reccommend you to play with windowed mode in native resolution or with 15" screen.","March 3","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You need a job, and you need it soon.  Lo and behold, Marshall Alexander, CEO of the TerraForm Corporation, hires you to find his daughter, who was abducted -- and something "else" . . .\n\nGone is the dialogue puzzle of the previous game, which disappointed me a bit.  There are times when you need to do more than just talk to people in these screens, such as give them items in order to move the story along, and I didn't realize this until I read a guide.  Granted, it's entirely possible that such was clearly mentioned in the manual that would have come with this game if you bought it hard-copy (in 1991).\n\nAlso removed from this game is the driving mechanic from Mean Streets, which was difficult at best and caused you to miss out on a lot of the previous game's flavor.  Another mechanic taken out is the side-scrolling shooting gallery.  I am pleased that neither of these mechanics made it into Martian Memorandum.  That said, the game then becomes rather linear, but it's still a pretty neat story even today.\n\n(NOTE:  There's a portion of the game that you can actually skip because it was so mind-bendingly difficult.  Google 'Tex Murphy Martian Memorandum Guide' and any guide worth its salt will explain further)\n\nPeople who are genuinely interested in seeing what constituted gaming in the early dawn of the industry should have this in their library.  That's the only reason I do.  I grew up in the 90s, and there's nothing wrong with taking a trip down Memory Lane.","June 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Funny writing and the FMV actors aren't half bad. Fun fact, Mac Malden is Chris Jone's(Tex Murphy) brother IRL. The difficulty isn't crazy unlike alot of adventure games of the era(thank you help feature). Pure point and click goodness. You don't need to play the previous Tex Murph game.\nSome words of advice though SAVE OFTEN and don't overwrite. Don't be worried about making a new save everytime you save. I had 30+. If you don't talk to someone or miss something before going to mars you could be stuck and if you don't have a good save to go back to you may have to restart the game!","September 18, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krudmonger/recommended/302340/","krudmonger","Krud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krudmonger/","307 products in account","I got this game at a huge discount from its usual price, so it hardly cost me anything at all. But the time I spent playing it - 7 hours - is time I wish I could get back now.\n\nTo call the game mediocre is being generous. Thinking back on my standards around the time this game came out, I would have found it lackluster and tedious even back then. The dialogues are a meandering choose-your-own-adventure that sometimes matter and sometimes don't, and sometimes are dead-ends unless you interrupt with an inventory item. This wouldn't be too bad, were it not for the extremely low-fi voices. I give it points for being one of the first "talkie" games, but those points are taken away for the dialogue being very grating. There is also a lot of reading, which I am fine with in games, but the font style, size, and color used made it difficult to read, whether in a window or full-screen.\n\nThe graphics were a weird hybrid of detailed and abstract, so while you'd sometimes have a grainy photo of a real-life object, other times there would be two beige pixels nestle unobtrusively in a scene, that you were supposed to realize were important and click on (because it was a piece of paper or something.) And since this is before the days of highlighting, there was never an indication of what was and wasn't an important pixel, so you could click all over an object and get a generic response, not knowing that the slightly lighter pixels were the ones that would give you the clue you actually needed. This wasn't a problem unique to this game, but it was rampant within it.\n\nAnd of course there were the psychic puzzles where the only way you knew what to do was die and time travel. (See if that supports your weight. It didn't? You're dead? Well, good thing you can relive that moment.) Again, this wasn't the only game to do things like this (Sierra was notorious for it), but when the rest of the game is lackluster, things like this just add to the aggravation.\n\nAfter finishing the game and seeing the arguably anticlimactic ending, I was amazed that this went on to have a half dozen more sequels. (Though I've started into the next installment, and it's light-years ahead of this one in every way and will probably get a thumbs up from me.) My advice is to skip this one and go to the next in the series.","December 15, 2014","false","7.2"," 18 of 41 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","18","41","2","0"
