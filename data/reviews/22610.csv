You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.\n\nIt is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.\n\nIt's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.","April 19, 2015","true","25.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","0"

The gameplay is similar to the old Alien Breed with the addition of new weapons, enemies, and a 3d camera.  Despite some of the enemies having ranged attacks or special abilities, the AI will charge you the majority of the time or amble about a short distance away not using their abilities.  I'm not sure if this is any different on hard but that's how it is on normal.  This also means the weapons, of which there is a decent variety, are ultimately just another way to dispatch the rushing bugs as nothing requires a change in tactics.\n\nSimilar to the original Dead Space, your character, the chief engineer, will shuffle fom waypoint to waypoint fixing everything that needs fixing and believe me a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥ is broken.  This can get pretty tedious as the story is not advanced much in this first installment of the three episodes.\n\nIf you are planning on playing through all three episodes, be aware that your progress does not carry over from each game.  Each episode is a separate executable and there is no way to import a save file to carry over your progress.  This means at the start of episode 2, you have lost all your weapons, upgrades, and items acquired in episode 1.  This feels very strange considering how quickly each episode picks up from the end of the last one.","October 30, 2014","true","9.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

Simple story, nice graphics and even better atmosphere. Five maps in single player and three in co-op. Three difficulty levels, thirteen achievements, from what a few quite difficult to accomplish. Minuses - you can’t skip movies and dialogues and this can be annoying especially when you repeat missions to earn achievements. Logs we collect stay in our collection permanently if we save our progress with them – after we found any but died before saving our progress on terminal they disappear and we need to collect them once again. Irritating map, which needs to be minimized every time we access it to see it as a whole.

Logi, które zbieramy podczas misji znikają z naszej kolekcji jeśli zginiemy i trzeba je zbierać jeszcze raz, po czym dotrwać z nimi do zapisu aby się zachowały na stałe.

This game has a lot of potential with its weapons and atmosphere.  Overall it's very disappointing.  In isometric shooters the last thing you want is to constrain the movement of the character.  In many ways it felt like an on rails shooter with the illusion of character control.  It didn't matter what I did in each room.  The aliens would spawn predictably.  Start the routine for alien control: go for a corner where you can't be flanked, kite, run around in circles, save ammo with infinite pistol ammo, so on and so forth.  It's tedious, and it's the type of tedium that ruins whatever tension the game is desperately trying to create.  I had the most fun when there were more open areas with many different aliens running around, then it felt like a good shooter.  The uninspired key cards and missions make you feel ineffectual,  like there's no agency in this character.  It's sad when you can predict that the computer console will malfunction... Because on the map screen there's an area that you haven't explored yet.  At least it had secrets.  Overall, not worth it, but at least it didn't take too long to finish.","February 7, 2015","false","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/22610/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","I went into this thinking that I would have a separate section for each installment in this trilogy, but (after putting what I have deemed significant time into each of them) I have decided to lump them all in together as there wasn’t much difference between any of them. That being said, let’s get started shall we?\n\nI – Story [2/10]\n\nThe gist of the story is this: Conrad, the Chief Engineer of the Leopold, are trying to restore power to your ship whilst doing battle with hordes of aliens and contending with a possessed AI. And that, kids, is all she wrote. I realize this is a remake, but honestly? That’s all?\n\nII – UI [6/10]\n\nIn part one of the trilogy (Alien Breed: Impact) the UI (or User Interface for the less savvy among us) was colored blue and was infuriatingly hard to see at almost any given moment. Thankfully, in installments two and three, the color had been changed to green and was infinitely easier on the eyes. The mini-map was rather reliable, making it mostly unnecessary to consult the full map often. Apart from that, HUD was minimal and user friendly.\n\nIII – Gameplay [1/10]\n\nAltogether I found Alien Breed to be underwhelming practically at every turn. The game is played from a top-down angle with rigid and irritating camera controls. The objectives were mind-numbingly repetitive and I found myself getting overly bored about an hour into the first game. I present to you a dramatization of just about every thing you do in these games.\n\n“Turn on the cranky thing to put out the fires.”\n\n*Kills aliens*\n\n“Oh no, the cranky thing is broken. Go reboot six computers to fix the cranky thing.”\n\n*Kills aliens*\n\n“Good job on rebooting the computers. You can turn on the cranky thing now. Also, here are some more aliens for you to kill.”\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is quite seriously the entire game. Sure, you get an odd boss battle here and there, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t just as repetitive and underwhelming as the rest of the game. My other biggest complaint about all the games was the weapon upgrading system. This game is how far into the future and I can only have one upgrade installed on my weapon at a time? What kind of garbage is that?\n\nIV – Content [4/10]\n\nWith this being a trilogy, you’d assume they’d add some new content into each game right? Well, they did, but I had you going there didn’t I? Impact was easily the worst game in the trilogy. The campaign (in all three games, mind you) was downright awful. Part two (Alien Breed: Assault) added in a “Survival Mode” which was mildly entertaining. It was a billion times more fun than the campaign, that’s for sure. The enemies felt uninspired; most of them looked like the bugs from Starship Troopers only fatter and more ludicrous. The weapons were a bit boring as well, though I did particularly enjoy using the flamethrower. (Who doesn’t?)\n\nV – Visual [6/10]\n\nThere isn’t much to say here really. The graphics throughout the trilogy were consistently the same, with varying levels of obnoxious explosions everywhere. I realize the ship is crashing, but come on. That being said, the graphics weren’t too bad and the lighting was good.\n\nVI – Audio [4/10]\n\nI found the sound effects to be rather lacking. The guns weren’t thrilling in the least and the little, face-hugger-esque aliens, I would swear on my non-existant childrens’ graves’, were frog noises. Thank Cthulhu they got the explosion sounds down though. I can only assume that Michael Bay consulted with them on that.\n\nVII – Overall [3.9]\n\nIn closing, I’m glad I got this tripe from Humble Bundle and didn’t pay full price for it.","January 25, 2015","false","1.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

I've played through the second one as well (Assault).  It's a run and gun, isometric alien shoot-em-up.  It all takes place on ships infested and breaking apart.  You kill aliens, repair and bypass things, explode stuff, and reek havoc in general.  The gunplay feels really good because the aliens get knocked down and impacted by gunfire.  This makes even the generic machine gun feel good to use because you can keep aliens at bay with its stopping power.  I even played the second game occasionally with a controller and it felt pretty good (although I went back to kb/m because of the precision).\n\nThe story reads (literally) as a pulp sci-fi comic book, but it's interesting enough to frame the combat.

The game is centered around a spaceship that has been taken over by aliens, and you have to complete various tasks to ensure your survival.  At first, it is a fun game.  However, as you play, you will notice its greatest flaw: it is incredibly repetitive.   There is not much variation in the missions: get to a waypoint and kill things along the way.  There is also little variation in the environments.  Weapons are simple which fits this game well.  Each one has three attributes that can be upgraded: reload time, rate of fire, and damage per shot.  There is some strategy involved as only one of these can be upgraded at a time.\n\nI got about 6 hours out of this game, and I was taking my time looking for hidden items.

Then this trilogy might be worth those few cents you've invested in it. As a remake of the original Amiga title, it's great. But on its own...meh. Modern games just have higher standards. In every aspect, this game is mediocre.\nIt has just enough to get you going and want to finish it. But barely. Often, during the gameplay, I caught myself thinking: "Do I really want to finish it?" Because you just walk around, shoot aliens and fix/open doors or other mechanisms. That's it.  It's very repetitive. You do get weapon upgrades, and the weapons and aliens do change a bit in each part, but only a little. The game also throws in a bit of puzzles, there are a couple vacuum scenes, a few boss fights, but mostly it's about navigating through the mazes that are the two space ships in this game. Physics or logic? Don't expect scientific accuracy in this game. I wish you could fix something, by blowing it up in real life, too.\n\nThere's a lot of backtracking and forced camera angles/close ups. If you can tolerate it, then this trilogy might be worth a few evenings it takes to complete it. After the second half of the Alien Breed 2, I was hooked enough to find out how it all ends. With enough patience, you might be, too.\n\nOn a side note, the game has a nice design and a cool little comic story between the stages.\n\nAll parts in the trilogy are pretty much the same. Basically, it's one game, split in three parts, which I think is a cheap move.\n\nMy overall rating: 6/10","April 28","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neglesnacks/recommended/22610/","neglesnacks","neglesaks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neglesnacks/","40 products in account","I'm an Amiga veteran, going back to the release of the predecessors of this game, Alien Breed from 1991 and AB Special Edition '92, and of course the sucessors AB2, AB2 Tower Assault.\n\nI bought this because I thought it massively cool that Team 17 was back in action (though the old crew has moved on to different endavours), and because I wanted to see how well the game had been carried 20 years into the future.\n\nInitially, its seemed a nice change from the typical shooters, and you recognize both the straight-edged level layouts, as well as the cartoon-assisted story telling from the originals. 3D graphics, advanced effects, advanced audio etc. are of course new additions, which help a bit.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that the level design has you do a fair bit of back tracking, plus some of the ways to move through the levels are simplynot clearly visible until you've put a good deal of level scenery under close scrutiny, after which you'll moan in exasperation because it was otherwise (somewhat)-obvious what you should have done, yet you spent hours figuring it out. The ingame mapping function doesn't really help, because on the map, doorways are indistinguishable from regular bulkheads between adjacent rooms.\n\nThe alien "shock" effects get old and boring very quickly, and the game ends up feeling like a regular shooter with you hosing down the walls with lead in short order. Meh.\n\nLastly, the control system is a study in frustration, and that the dev team went with the system they did is deserving of criticism. I lost count of how often I accidentally turned instead of sidestepping, which may be due to me being keyboard handicapped, but still. It's not easy to learn, and its no fun at all being unable to properly control your character in the heat of battle because of mistaken keypresses. That, and the repeated inability to move in a certain direction because you haven't properly cleared a piece of debris, blocking your path, or because theres an actual, but barely visible, ALIEN IN THE WAY!\n\nI'll recommend that you *don't* buy this, with two exceptions:\n\n* You VERY much want to relive Alien Breed like I did.\n* The game is steeply discounted from its regular price (think 75%+ price reduction).\n\nIt saddens me to not recommend it by default, but oh well, times change.\n\n(Org. written 22feb2015)\n\nUpdate: There is a particular sequence of events on the second level where the keyboard control needs to be near-perfect to survive, and where you are not given the aid from the game of any autosave checkpoints. Having tried to do this several times, where minor imperfections in placement and keyboard control means certain death, this underscores the problems of isometric perspective gaming combined with wierd and occasionally problematic keyboard controls. I came very close to uninstalling the game entirely at that point, but kept on till I suceeded through pure persistence. Stuff like this is not only not entertaining, but it is not at all a worthy use of your time.\n\nUpdate 2 (26feb2015): Having finished the game (after an unintuitive end boss fight that I had to chickenshit out of by reading how to do it....) I can say that while the controls become comfortable after a while of learning them and thus removes an element of frustration from the game, the games repetitiveness in both combat and level objectives becomes more apparent. The game ending is essentially absent, it is merely an advertisement to buy the sequel.\n\nSummarised: This games controls are unwieldy and takes time to lean before you can play the game properly and not be terribly inconvenienced (or dead), the action is repetitive and gets boring quickly, the weapons are not much different from each other (flamethrower excepted), the weapon&items upgrades system is seemingly useless, the non-action aspects of the gameplay is likewise repetitive, there is no depth to the whole experience, and the ending is a disappointment. The comic-strip storytelling, the occasional pretty backdrops and likewise occasional shock change in environments helps a bit, but simply cannot save this game from its shortcomings.\n\nI have yet to try Co-op, and imagine that it can only help this failure of a game.\n\nI will still carry on and see how AB:Assault is, out of sheer tenacity... or masochism. I don't know.","February 21, 2015","false","17.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This was mainly due to the hum drum demo and the fact that Valve's team (at the time) had released Alien Swarm for free. But (as is always the way) I got this game free in a humble bundle at some point. And as luck would have it, this week, I was in the mood for some alien-shooting adventures!\n\nFirst up, the tone at the start of the game left me feeling unsure about things, with those weird comic-art-with-voiceover-on-top, bits. But, this quickly changed once I picked up a nice weapon and started performing my character's engineer tasks. And...once I started kicking bottom, too! Honestly, I enjoyed this game. There's very little to complain about, overall. However, as always, let me get some downers out of the way first...\n\nIt's too easy on Veteran (Normal) mode. Although there were some challenging rooms along the way, I probably died around 3-5 times overall. Two of which, were down to me dying from a gas filled room that I hadn't realised was killing my character! It's also worth mentioning that I killed the final boss on the first go, with very little effort! So, yeah, it's fun, but, too easy. Which, as you might imagine, means that there's not much challenge. Perhaps the next difficulty up, would be adviseable?? Oh, btw, the ending is very...abrupt. It felt like those old shareware games that teased the next episode. So, I didn't feel hugely accomplished once I'd beaten the game :P\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I wasn't totally sold on the comic bits at the beginning of each level. These fill in the story, but It felt like they cut corners here. They could've had simple in-engine cutscenes that would've fit, better. Still, that's just my opinion. Maybe they were going for a comic book type look at this point. Oh, and, your character is a little dismissive and arrogant towards your "friend," throughout. I remember saying out loud at one point, "you're a bit of a ♥♥♥♥, aren't you?"\n\nApart from that, I enjoyed what Alien Breed had to offer. There were a nice amount of weapons, decent action, a nice amount of enemy types to keep things interesting, and I enjoyed exploring the ship to see what I could find. It almost felt a teeny-tiny little bit Metroidvania. But only a tiny bit. I liked having to look for medkits, ammo and finding logs, etc. That gave it a little more substance.\n\nOverall, I give Alien Breed a thumbs-up!","January 31, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I just found it really hard to get myself to play this game, and I did it just because it was waiting for me there with the rest of the trilogy in my steam library, and I've already got enough backlog. But yeah, playing this game felt almost like a chore. It is definitely playable and I guess you may like it if you enjoy the 'hack and slash' genre but in my opinion this game gets boring very fast and everything you do within it  feels completely meaningless. The writing is horrible, the plot, if you can call it that, could as well not be there at all.\n\nI'll sum up this game quickly for you: Go there, kill all the aliens that pop up along the way, come back to the place where you started. Repeat again. And again...and again. "Sorry, your princess/generator is in another castle/part of the ship, go back through the same parts of the ship you have already ran through about 10 times and then come back here again."  Urgh, there is a fix number of times a gamer can go through the same corridor before he/she decides to stop playing. Oh, and the main protagonist looks a lot like a less cool Riddick. Conrad? Yeah, right.\n\nI'll probably eventually play Alien Breed 2, but I suspect it will be more of the same and it'll probably take me another 6 months... At least as long as it concerns the first one in the series, I'd say I don't recommend it unless you love shooting at great number of enemies in a game with no plot whatsoever in isometric view. If that's your thing, then go for it because this is your game. The two positive things I can recall from playing is that I think it's cool they muted almost all sounds while out in space, and also I think that using comics to tell the story is a valid strategy, specially for those games with no great budgets. Overall, however, this game is definitely a no.","April 18, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You loved Dead Space? You'll probably like Alien Breed (because Isaac Clarke and Conrad are stranded in a spaceship, with few survivors and they're alone in that hell).\n\nAlien Breed: Impact is apparently a reboot of an older game that I never played. Here, you're a member of a spaceship that found an old ship lost many many years ago. Well, found is perhaps soft as, if I remember correctly, you've collided with it. Anyway, Theo (aka you) has to survive in his ship, after loosing his family years ago, and has to trust a robot to guide him to the older ship. However, when weird creatures are appearing, Theo has to rely on guns and terminals to survive.\n\nThat's the solo campaign. You have a co-op campaign where you play with a friend as two other members of the ship and you're also trying to survive and to reach the older ship.\n\nThe game is seen in 3D isometric, meaning that you have a little time to adapt to the command and the view when you're used to 3rd person or 1st person game.\n\nI remembered enjoy the game, mainly because you have perhaps normal weapons but also a powerful one, that I should add, different in each Alien Breed game. Yeah, true, when you're in the high difficulty, you have to adapt your way of playing before a game over because you didn't check your health.\n\nAnyway, your PDA is also nice as you're finding also notes from other persons, you have also a nice map to see where you are... and the terminals are in reality a save point and a shop for ammo or health.\n\nThe HUD is blue, like the title in the header. So, everything (texts on the screen) will be blue too. The game is also told with cutscenes drawed as comics. And well, the blue is also the main color.\n\nAlien Breed: Impact is a nice game, though I'm kinda sad in co-op, it was kinda lagging and that we lost each time at the end of the level.

This game really does a lot of things right, but unfortunately falls just short of being a great game.  Let's start off with the premise of this game.  You are a battle hardened engineer (which I'm not sure those words go together) who is traveling on the massive ship, the Leopold.  You've just come out of a warp jump and your ship slams into a gigantic vessel that dwarfs your own.  Blah blah blah etc etc etc you can find out the rest in game, but the idea is basically having to go around and fix an enormous amount of problems that seem to never end on the Leopold, all while fighting off thousands of this never before seen alien species.  Nothing too original for the plot, and when it comes to the aliens, obviously borrows a lot from the Alien movies (which is not a bad thing).\n\nNow onto the game itself.  We'll go ahead and start with what the game does great and that is the graphics and environment.  The game looks phenomenal for it's price point and for when it was made.  The unreal engine in use here really shows off it's stuff as every room and enemy is very, very detailed.  Even the action itself looks downright awesome.  It's hard to get tired of obliterating countless aliens whenever the guns look this amazing in action.  Of particular note, the flamethrower looks incredible, and so do all of the fire physics.  The environment differences between the Leopold and the alien vessel are also a drastic shift.  While most of the electronics, doors, and corridors look the same (which raises a lot of questions), the alien vessel feels much more ancient and powerful than the Leopold just from the environmental shift.\n\nAfter that though, the game does start to falter.  The story is subpar throughout this first episode, but I will admit curiousity as to where that alien ship came from, and in general where those aliens came from.  After reading the logs, they speak of genetic experimentation that the aliens obviously went through so that only raises more questions.  At this time I'm halfway through the second game and very little more has been exposed.  Other than that, the characters are flat and predictable including the main character.  Any side characters besides MIA are quickly forgotten and seem to have no bearing on the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mildly entertaining.  Most of the time you'll be navigating from one room to another to fix *enter ship system here* while gunning down a number of random aliens that are constantly trying to murder you.  And....that's kind of the whole game.  There really isn't much else to speak of.  The guns are the generic AR, shotgun, flamethrower, pistol etc.  The enemy variety is also on the bland side as most of them will charge you relentlessly no matter what.  There's only one boss fight in the game and while slightly different from the normal gameplay, does nothing to change the status quo the game has already firmly set.\n\nOverall, if you can get this game on sale (like it is currently), go for it.  It's 5 hours of decent entertainment with maybe a few more hours stuffed in if you can find a co op partner.  Just don't be looking for an incredible game with endless hours of fun in store, because it's simply not there.\n\nScore - 6.5/10","November 28, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

In the entire four hour campaign of the game, there is one new gameplay mechanic introduced for the final boss. You are never taught the mechanic, but it is required to not only complete the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but to defeat the final boss.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay is essentially Alien Swarm, minus anything fun. The movement feels clunky, the environments feel too small, there are few weapons and the upgrades are forgettable. There is no multiplayer of any kind, which actually could have possibly saved this game.\n\nIt feels too short, and Team 17 are milking $30 out of people by selling three games that should be $5 each, or one $15 game.","July 30, 2012","false","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I've heard the other two games following this one have the exact same gameplay, with no improvement. The plot is not very memorable; all I know is that there is a ship that is always broken in one way or another and that the player has to fix it. That being said, it exposes way too much of the environment with this tactic.\n\nIt's always "go to this objective, kill aliens, fix it, kill aliens, go back to where you first started off, kill more aliens, rinse and repeat". They tried to revive the classic Alien Breed, but this developer isn't doing so well nowadays. If you're a fan of monotonous works, it's for you. Otherwise, steer clear of it.\n\nI'll be honest, I did TRY to enjoy it, thinking that it was just my preference of games that made this so unappealing to me to play, but after reading tens of reviews about the lackluster gameplay, I feel that I can stand by my review.","October 26, 2013","false","10.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I think there was more time clocked hearing the overhead intercom voice telling me the way I could not go, than actual cutscene dialogue.\nLike most games, I played this on the highest difficulty.  Right out of the gate, I play most of my games on the highest difficulty.  Mostly because I have 25 years of experience gaming, partly because I hate myself, but mainly, I hate the option when given.  Make the game one difficulty and don't ♥♥♥♥ with it.  Given the choice most people will go with easy and ♥♥♥♥♥foot their way through a game then claim they truly beat it and that bothers me.  Difficulty levels shouldn't exist. Developers should say, I'm going to make my game this hard, and if you can't beat it, that's your problem.\nAnyways, my point here is that I actually started this game two years ago when I first bought the trilogy and started it on the hardest mode for the achievement, didn't like it, and didn't touch it again until recently.  Still didn't like it, but I beat it and got all the achievements and I'm a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that this is a trilogy and I still have two more games to play.\nThe ambiance and graphics are nice, and the music knows when to pick up at just the right time to give those tough battles that extra punch.  The music is pretty cool as are the sound effects.  The controls are butt, the interface is butt and the game is slow with burps of enemies coming at you, then more "Access Denied."  This is why I stopped.\nI don't know if all the Alien Breed games play like this.  The first game out in 1991 and Team17 is pretty much a three trick pony. They have survived on aliens, frogs, and worms pretty much for twenty years, so they must be doing something right, and I am surprised this is one of those things.","April 22, 2014","false","21.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The game is set aboard a spaceship and the single player campaign lasts around 8-9 hours. Although the game mainly involves walking through dark corridors and shooting at giant alien bugs, it manages to maintain a good sense of atmosphere. The player gets to use 5 different weapons, several items, and faces a healthy variety of enemies, which does well at minimizing what could potentially have been a repetitive game. The situations vary greatly at times you might face one or two bugs at a time, and then at other times a whole wave would just burst out from the walls and floor around you and force you to battle for your own survival. The fact that enemies could come from anywhere doorways, vents, floor creates a sense of tension and keeps the player on edge. The plot is in a comic-book-style cutscenes, most of the things you do don’t seem to have much relevance. For most of the time when outside battles you just go around the huge ship searching dead people and lockers for spare ammo and credits (in-game money) and activate various computer systems in order to gain access to the next area. It could feel repetitive at times, but the main focus of the game is escaping from the aliens, so I suppose it’s not much of an issue really. There is also a chance to upgrade your weapons to give yourself a bit of an edge in combat. Each weapon has 3 different upgrade options: rate of fire, reload time, and damage per shot. Thought you can only ever have 1 upgrade active at a time for each gun, so the player will have to do some decision making and choose an upgrade that they feel is most suitable. This also opens a slight possibility for replay value. Without giving spoilers, I also want to mention that I was a bit disappointed with the final boss of the game. Its attacks kept repeating themselves over and over in a very repetitive pattern. However, this is only a mere 10-15 minutes of an otherwise very engaging and well-polished game. It’s quite simple at its core, but the quality of the presentation that it delivers is very respectable. Now after having completed the game, there are two more parts that await me and it seems the plot is still building towards something. This is not really a stand alone game, but more like a chapter of a book or an episode of a TV show. So I am quite eager to try out the second and third instalments in the series and see where this goes. Lastly to mention, the game also offers a co-op mode, which is a laught at time, thought it doesnt have the story-mode to it.","March 21, 2015","true","32.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Add to that more varied alien AI and missions and it would be a 7/10--a solid game. Sadly, it has neither of those.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this, even if you got it from a humble bundle for a dollar.

If you were not born in the early to mid 80ies, chances are pretty big you will not "get" what Alien Breed: Impact and it's sequels are about.\n\nBasically, this is an early 90ies game with modern visuals. The result is that this title feels somewhat bare-bones - if you need customization, deep storylines or complex mechanics you will be disappointed. However there are some lackluster attempts to modernize it, which make it seem like "Impact" is trapped between modern gaming and just being it's 20+ year old self.\n\nThe controls have evolved but feel a bit more loose on a gamepad using twinstick controls compared to back then on a Competetion Pro. The mazes have been reduced in size, but for some reason made much harder to navigate as they miss a lot of the visual aids the original had, like markings for decks and sectors you were entering or leaving. With the added waypoint-feature navigation and exploration are much less of a deal than they used to be. Something I actually did like and prefered over the original, which could be frustratingly hard if you had not planned your route correctly. All in all, it's a solid but simple affair that you most likely will only finish if you can snap back into that 90ies mindset.\n\nHowever, this game does have one very strong point. Atmosphere. It's basically all your favourite man vs. alien-stories combined into one big package. It's a bit of a poor man's Dead Space at times, with plenty of ALIENS and Space Hulk thrown into the mix - expect lots of dark corridors, flickering lights, distant growling and only glimpses of your doom as you see the horrors illuminated by the muzzle flash of your assault rifle while the motion tracker goes haywire. Alien Breed nails that fantasy and despite some of it's more obvious flaws made me actually want more.","January 27, 2013","true","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While the game is capable to grab the player from the beginning, its fast paced and has a story to tell, it has its faults which is coming out in the gameplay itself.\n\nThe controls are responsive, but if you ever played with Shadowgrounds, you would wish a similar controls instead of the one you have here, namely the camera and character control. Unlike in Shadowgrounds where you was able to attach the camera rotation to the character, here you have to rotate the camera independent from the character, which is a bit flustrating at few places, especially at one place where you have to escape from an enemy and the camera controls is very annoying.\n\nThe storyline is offering a mystery as your starship, the cruiser Leopold is crashing into a larger unknown craft.

You, Chief Engineer Conrad have to find out what this space ship of alien origin is, while you also have to ensure the safety of the Leopold.\n\nAs Alien Breed is an episodic release, you'll get all your answers in the second and third episodes, but unfortunately as you step onboard the alien ship in the first episode, Impact, some of the textures of the alien ship is spoiling some twists from the later episodes.\n\nThe game itself is a simple fastpaced shooter, with five huge levels to discover and the episode ends with a cliffhanger (Each episodes have 5 levels, so the whole game is 15 levels long.). In the game you may gather credits to buy ammo and upgrade weapons, even sentry guns, while you have to repair critical elements of your space ship and fight your way through dozens of waves of alien hordes.\n\nThe atmosphere is good, the environment is detailed and beautiful for this game, but the game can be a bit repetative at times. It's a decent shooter, which is not great, but its still a good experience in the very rare sci-fi, top-down isometric survivor shooter genre. But if you loved the original series or if you ever loved Shadowgrounds, give a try for Alien Breed: Impact.","November 29, 2013","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your character is this buffed out engineer that has the "badass" voice about him and is supposed to be seen as a man that can get the job done with little to no words. However, he just comes out as someone that seems continually butthurt that he didnt get his latte for breakfast. He repairs the engine and shoots some aliens, he goes to hydroponics and shoots some aliens, and then he boards the big ♥♥♥ ship that you crashed into and shoots some aliens with bigger better guns. Game ends with the main character kinda face to face with the biggest alien he's ever seen and quite frankely looks like he's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants with a streched frown on his face while muttering the words, "Gotta go" to the cyborg woman that is like, "the ♥♥♥♥ is going on over there?". Thats the game. 9 and a half hours of running around and shooting aliens while flippin switches.\n\nYep. Pretty bad.

Main character is unrelatable, zero character relations and the list goes on.. Perhaps the previous games in the series may have given some background but if you're to hop into this game without playing them, you're absolutely clueless as to what's going on.\n\nGameplay: 2/10\nThe only good part is its arcade-shootery feel. Those that like a simple shooter game may enjoy it. Other than that, pretty much flaws everywhere. Camera and movement control feels so linear and uncomfortable. Stage design is confusing and terrible, you'll get lost easily if you don't refer to your inventory map every now and then, needless explosions everywhere just to give a sense of urgency and danger.\n\nHere is the worst part: Majority of the time will be spent on pointless backtracking to activate something you passed by before you can progress to the next area. Essentially the game makes you run around like a headless chicken just to extend the "feel" of each mission length.\n\nProgression: 1/10\nHardly any here. All weapons have the same upgrade paths, its better rof, faster reload or higher damage, thats it. You can't develop your character in any other sense.\n\nVerdict\nWould I recommend this game?

The camera angle, and controls are BAD. You move around with the arrow keys, which makes it hard to use the mouse. You shoot using the mouse.

If you like the atmosphere and premise of the Dead Space series or DOOM 3, then theres a really good chance youll take to Alien Breed. If you go into it realizing its more of a mini-game than an all out AAA title, you wont be let down. While it may not be a true AAA title, the visuals and sound are of excellent production value. I can say that this game has better sound than half the games I play at 6 times the price. Its very atmospheric and well paced. One important caveat... PLAY THE GAME ON HARD (OR AS TEAM 17 CALLS IT, ELITE) If you play the game on hard, it becomes much more of a survival horror/shooter, where you have to economize your ammo and supplies, and you have to be careful of your next move around every corner.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/22610/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Since all three games are exactly the same this is the same review as the other two games.\n\nNot a great game but it has great weapons and really good graphics and very smooth gameplay. Why it's not a great game:\n\n1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane ♥♥♥♥ like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three.\n2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache.\n3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off.\n4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same.\n5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other.\n6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical.\n7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each.\n8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.\n\nIt's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.\n\nSince all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.","March 21, 2014","false","4.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Giger's aliens with the Antlions from Half Life 2.  And instead of James Cameron, it's directed by Michael Bay, because EVERYTHING explodes CONSTANTLY.  It's exhausting, really.  Then thrown in some characters from the Cliffy B. school of character design - one a busty android and the other a guy who hates androids - and give the lead a voice that's part Vin Diesel and part Michael Ironside but without the distinction of either.  Finally, slap on some "plot," and baby, you've got a game!\n\nIt's fun, though.  Nothing you haven't played before, but fun.  Not great fun, but moderate fun.  And it looks pretty.  I've completed the first game in the trilogy, but I'm not anticipating any surprises.\n\nThe game plays like this:\nGo to that [miscellaneous spaceship thing] 1/4 of the way across the level from where you are.\nThat thing is broken, go [operate misc. backup system] 1/4 of the way across the level.\nThe [misc. backup system] is broken.  Get [misc. backup system backup part] from room 1/4 of the way across the level.\nRepair and use [misc. backup system].\nGo back and finally use that [miscellaneous spaceship thing].\nGo through that door 1/4 of the way across the level.\nThat door is locked.\nGo [do/get that thing that unlocks doors], which happens to be located... you guessed it.\nWhile doing all that, loot a morally unacceptable number of corpses and kill hundreds of not-Antlions.\nRepeat over and over.  And over.\nAlien Breed abuses that formula so much - constantly, in fact - that it's comical.  Every single main objective is a recursive chain of things that don't work.\n\nThe game doesn't do much wrong, per se.  It's just up to its gills with mediocrity.  The only thing about Alien Breed that outright annoys me is the weapon upgrade system.  Each of the six guns has three upgrades available for purchase: rate of fire, reload speed, and damage.  You scavenge enough cash to buy maybe one upgrade per level.  Only thing is, upgrades don't stack.  If you buy a second upgrade, you lose the first.  You liked the first one better?  Tough luck, sucker, 'cause now you get to buy it again!  It's an awful system.\n\nTwo other things I don't get are the secrets and score.  Neither seem to have any impact on the game whatsoever.  Meh.\n\nStill, if you can pick up the trilogy for a couple bucks, it's probably worth it for days when you don't want to think and just zone out.","November 15, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problem I find is the controls with the character, always feels like it`s not turning the camera the way I want to face, however if you hold down the shift key the camera will stay behind your character so that sort of solves it except you need to keep the shift key pressed constantly whilst playing.\nAll in all it looked and felt just how I wanted it to.

Not a big variation of monsters/maps\n\n3. When i finally got to the old ship (not Leopold) i was like "Cool, it is completely overgrown with alien substance, and decaying bodies everywhere" but then suddenly a person stands in a dark room and gets killed by an alien (drops a keycard, much surprise) which kinda ruined the atmosphere for me sadly :/\n\n4. i played this on Veteran and a hint i saw was to save ammo as it would be scarce.... i was saving medkits/grenades/ammo to the point where i had 20+ of each and almost full ammo on all weapons since i thought i would need it.\n\n5. the last boss battle (i know, it continues in next game) but it still sucked balls.\n\n\nIn the end, do i recommend it?.............Yes i do, it was fun and worth the price i payed a few years back but dont expect alot out of it.\nIt feels alot like playing "Alien Swarm" which is a great game of same genre (though co-op).","January 26","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't the most exciting thing ever, but if you get it on sale it is worth it. The weapons are fun to use, and the aliens are pretty diversified. There are some cool effects- again nothing groundbreaking, but the way that they were implemented was fun. The only frustrating thing is if you get slammed into a corner with a lot of aliens raining down, you can't get any shots off and have to resort to melee which may or may not help. Also, there was a lot of backtracking, but I wouldn't say that it was annoying at any point because aliens are constantly ripping out of the floors and walls to attack. I took a lot of photos during gameplay because the atmosphere was nice as well. The only glitch was at the end boss second phase, the boss was glitching around all tweaked out, but it didn't prevent me from ending it.","November 15, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/22610/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Alien Breed: Impact is a trilogy of games from Team 17 that basically has Conrad, a hardened engineer, fighting his way through his own ship, the Leopold, and an unknown alien ship, in a third-person shooter. He is up against bajillion nasties clearly inspired by Aliens, complete with "squishy" floor, little "scorpion" type critters, and bigger insectoids, among others.\n\nConrad is given a bunch of weapons, from the good ol' pistol (infinite ammo) to assault rifle, shotgun, flamer, laser rifle, and "ion spike" (read: energy bazooka) as well as grenades, health kits, and other auxilary items. Most items need to be found though, and there are "credits" left around, as well as search corpses for additional goodies like ammo and credits. Credits can be spent on upgrades, ammo, and other bonuses at any Intex terminal, which also serve as mission save points (only 3 savegames allowed).\n\nThe graphics are quite good, but camera management is somewhat archaic, yet understandable. Most games that adopt 3rd person has auto camera, but this game has a manual camera system that you can manually rotate around the character in 45 degree increments. It feels weird but once you start playing you understand that this is actually good as enemies *can* come from all directions and this gives you more flexibility in determining which angle to view the action.\n\nThe game is very playable on a dualstick gamepad but can also be played with keyboard / mouse combo where the Q/E keys rotate the view. On a gamepad it would be the shoulder buttons.\n\nThe problem with this game is the gameplay gets repetitive very quickly on various "Fedex" missions. Every mission you go on has multiple complications, which requires you to do something else, which may yet require something else too.\n\nFor example, you're trying to get the mainframe online to control the engines. To reboot the mainframe you have to reinitialize the power source on three areas, then each area you will probably have to clear it to enemies, activate the fire supression system to clear the fire, then another to clear the toxic gas in the next room, etc. etc. There is a TON of backtracking, and that gets quite... boring.\n\nThe game also breaks up the action as you to loot every corpse (human corpse, not the alien ones) and locker along the way, as well as buy ammo (!?) if you run low or out. And often the looting yields nothing. Trigger discipline becomes second nature, as is switching weapons and use the infinite ammo pistol as much as you can. You need to save the money for upgrades, and money is NOT plentiful in this game (and if you spend it all on ammo you can't upgrade!)\n\nMusic is not bad, sound effects are decent, but the game play... Hmmm... As I said, it does get repetitive, and the other two games in the series can only be MOTS: more of the same.\n\nAll in all, Alien Breed is an action game, and a bit old. Buy it when it's on sale. As a full price title, not recommended.","November 5, 2015","false","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a big fan of the original game and so when this new and updated version came out I was pretty excited. From what I can remember of the 90's game, this seems to be pretty faithful to the original. Pick up a gun, kill aliens. Admittedly some of the mission tasks can be pretty repetitive, and the story.. exists... but thats not what this game is about. With the unreal engine behind it I sometimes felt that this is what XCOM would be if it was just the combat in real time.

Constant re-orientation screws up NSEW map memorization. One hit one kill monsters that you can't fight. Lots and lots and lots of backtracking, which makes the level BORING because you're not collecting powerups in areas you've already been through. There is WAY TOO MUCH ♥♥♥♥ING CAMERA SHAKING!!! The amount of environmental effects on screen is insanely stupid and annoying. Joystick controls are pretty meh, and your character has a tendency to lock aim in one of the 8 directions you might find in an older game. Far from increasing anxiety, the fact that you can run out of breath when running is really just annoying. There are entirely too many things that could be solved by blowing them up that the game does not allow you to do so. Grenades are worthless and dangerous.\n\nAlien Breed 1 Success:\n\nThe radar is well instituted, the amount of inventory/weapons/powers in the game are well chosen and not overwhelming, weapons are somewhat balanced, collection is actually fun because there are optional areas and you need every bullet since you can't buy them in unlimited quantities. The maps are quite well designed for modular maps, the lighting is good and when you're not being spammed to death with them the atmospheric effects are well done. Background noise is eerie and non-repetitive, and is carefully layered to stay that way. Encounters are short but intense. Much more stable than it was when first released.\n\nAlien Breed 1 WTF:\n\nThis is the WORST sci-fi game story I've seen in a long time. It's not that the premise is bad, but the writing is weak and the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. The comic segments are decent but noticably unfinished. I could give a ♥♥♥♥ about the character's background, oh look he's a super soldier and he's a double widower and he doesn't like artificial life forms because they killed his family boo hoo hoo. Missions seem very contrived. There are a surprising number of unarmed survivors on the ship.\n\nOverall this is a fun little game to pick up on the cheap, but it's pretty clear that Team17 can't get past their 8-bit / 16-bit roots with their remakes. If they can embrace analog controls, learn how a camera should work and try not to trip over their own feet with the effects they could be a contender.","December 1, 2012","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a top-down shooter style game, much like the old Alien Breed games of the 90's. The controls are pretty tight and the graphics still look great today, and while the story is not much to write home about and it is the typical "O noes, our ship just got itself halfway embedded into an alien ship coming out of hypespace! Halp!" fare it is still great fun.\n\nJust goes to show what a competent and experienced team can create. Team 17 has a long tradition of making this series and it shows.\n\nThis game series even has 2-player Co-Operative mode, which is something not many games have. This alone makes it a must buy for people who enjoy these kinds of games with a friend.

The graphics are on the Unreal Engine, and well done. The environments are varied, and though the story is linear and the style of telling it is something that is very old in style, it is done satisfactorily.\n\nThe complexity of this game is small enough and the design/playability simple enough that I would recommend this game be released on tablets, and maybe a dumbed down version for phones. This gave the impression to me like it was a very well made tablet game that had a PC release. I think there would be a mobile market for this game.\n\nIf the game is on sale, pick it up, if you are into this style.

I know this isn't the game's fault however it's still something to take in consideration before purchasing it. I actually needed to use a friends laptop to play this and the first time setup went smoothly then so I don't know what that's about. Anyway, it seems like a fun third person shooter but there's a couple of extreme annoyances that I felt made the game unplayable even on the easiest difficulty. The biggest one is that the fire button doesn't seem to work most of the time so your left clicking randomly while aliens beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. I don't know if there's some hidden mechanic I'm missing but if there is one it cenrtainly wasn't made clear. The other minor annoyance that I have is the constant Michael Bay level explosions that shake the hell out of the screen and are bright enough to obscure your vision. These are good every once in a while but they are INCREDIBLY frequent in the intro and the often make you miss aliens that are comnig after you.\nOverall, I feel it's a good premise but the fire button not working most of the time basically dooms you to die a million times for no reason which, in my opinion, makes the game not even worth touching unless you wanna rage at your guns.","December 24, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First couple of maps had alot of explosion everywhere, even if you walk a bit forward and then back again, the same explosions would happen again. (Felt like being in a Michael Bay movie)\n\n2. Not a big variation of monsters/maps\n\n3. When i finally got to the old ship (not Leopold) i was like "Cool, it is completely overgrown with alien substance, and decaying bodies everywhere" but then suddenly a person stands in a dark room and gets killed by an alien (drops a keycard, much surprise) which kinda ruined the atmosphere for me sadly :/\n\n4. i played this on Veteran and a hint i saw was to save ammo as it would be scarce.... i was saving medkits/grenades/ammo to the point where i had 20+ of each and almost full ammo on all weapons since i thought i would need it.\n\n5. the last boss battle (i know, it continues in next game) but it still sucked balls.\n\n\nIn the end, do i recommend it?.............Yes i do, it was fun and worth the price i payed a few years back but dont expect alot out of it.\nIt feels alot like playing "Alien Swarm" which is a great game of same genre (though co-op).","January 26","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
