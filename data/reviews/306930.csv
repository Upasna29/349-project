However, its obviously not going to be for everyone. To get started, there are a few major problems right off the bat.\n\n1) This game will constantly crash when attempting to launch the browser, forcing you to try it multiple times before getting to the sign in page.\n\n2) For me, my antivirus (AVG) kicks in at this point telling me its a threat, asking me to block it or add it to the exceptions list. (every time) The threats are flagged with both "behavioral detection" and "identity protection"\n\n3) after you manage to actually sign in and get around your antivirus, when clicking the play button there is a high probability it will crash yet again. Once it is finally loaded it is stable.\n\nIt is getting very frustrating to say the lest, and there are other things that annoyed me as well such as an "incomplete tutorial" that doesn't cover many key features. And a "worthless wiki page" not to mention there was a large number of minor bugs that I found in the short 7 hours I been playing.\n\nAs it stands right now I just can't recommending it to anyone.\n\nEdit: The antivirus AVG is causing a large number (if not all) of the crashes and disabling it for 10 min is the only way to log into the game.","January 10, 2015","false","35.0"," 193 of 218 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","193","218","12","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ENiXDev/recommended/306930/","ENiXDev","[OvO]wl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ENiXDev/","304 products in account","I actually really enjoyed this game. There's so much tactics, research, resource gathering, taking over entire systems. At one point, i got drunk and started a war over a missunderstanding. Two of the biggest galactic unions got involved and the fighting was absolutely relentless and brutal basically the entire galaxy became aligned to 2-3 unions and widespread civil war broke out because of a drunken missunderstanding. It lasted months. The fighting got so intense, people were booking days off work just to stay up all night and defend their unions. One person spent about 50 quid upgrading the stuff in game for better offensive capabilities due to an attack from my tier 5 ships. During this my tiny union put up such a fight came in 3rd in the world for offense and defence for that month.\n\nThis game is extremely tactical. For example, some battles you're up against a fight so heavy, there is no way on earth you can win it, so you need to beat a tactical retreat. You can do this by taking back systems as you leave, and the enemy can't progress through a system unless they own the system connected to the target system in its entirety. However taking a planet in a system uses up a flag, and also puts the planet under protection for an hour or so. It's also nice when you're retreating to leave some extremely powerful fleets and commanders fortifying occupied planets. When they come and take the planet, they get ambused and when they find that the stars ran red with their blood, they'll send everything they've got to that planet, a good policy then is to recall your fleets while their sorties are coming to attack the now unoccupied planet, this wastes their sortie points and leaves them wide open to a counter attack.\n\nA good tactic when you are being attacked, is to create a swamp of dozens of partially occupied systems around your homeworld system. Slowing down the enemy unions attack to crawl, hopefully giving you enough time to setup a defence. You have to be careful though each sortie whether successful or not takes time, and uses up action points on your commanders, and you only have so many action points. You also have a finite number of ships (although this is upgradable in the game). There will be times when you are playing this game, where you've found an equally matched enemy, and you've used up all your best ships, and you're both throwing improvised ships at each other, basically amounting to throwing mud and dirt in a frantic battle to death.\n\nYou want commanders who command large numbers of ships to be most effective. You upgrade commanders by fusing them together, losing a commander in the process, you can also raise the rank of your commander through fusing. There's different types of fusing, there's level fusing and skill fusing. You also get champion points which can be used to buy better commanders in the game.\n\nIn terms of the ships, there's dozens, with variable capabilities, and these will be altered by the quality of the commander, the commander's capabilities, your foes, the formation of the commander, and the relative strengths of your union versus the enemy union.\n\nThere have been times when i've rolled up into a conflict using cheap fully Tier 1 hyperdrive ships (very fast but poorly armed and armoured ships) and wiped out a number of large heavily armed Tier2 ships, simply because of the choice of formation, weapons capability, and commander.\n\nIn this game, big ♥♥♥♥♥ and powerful weapons mean absolutely nothing unless they are backed up with very careful tactics.\n\nYou do need to be part of a union. And you need to go and grab the nearest astroid, and astroids work as military bases in this game because the distances involved are insane, and attacks just don't work unless they are coordinated with teammates. Once you have captured a 'roid, and it's fortified by your union mates, you can relax a little. Although that didn't work for me, one season, i spawned in the middle of the Tartarus empire. I was knee deep in Tarts, and my prospects looked grim. Someone actually looked at where i was, and said that i was like Rambo, deep behind enemy lines fighting battles on 3-4 fronts simultaneously. Yeah, that was a rough season that was. Luckily after several weeks of bitter fighting, our unions merged into one of the top 3 unions in the galaxy. When that happens, you just have bury the hatchet and work together. Because there's always some greasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to steal parts of your empire and you need all the help you can get keeping the savages at bay. There's also frequent diplomatic "incidents" where a union member (usually new) doesn't understand political protocol or their military capabilities, decides to get all brave and takes on an enemy, not realising that they are one of the most powerful union presidents in the galaxy... These situations are where the political tactics come into play.\n\nAlso another feature of this game is, powerful unions are one thing, but sometimes they are part of even more powerful collectives who go around conquoring smaller unions. Until you're part of a larger union, it's not always clear what the power hierachies are. You also sometimes get spies in your union, people with the inside dirt on tactics, you've got to be careful out there.\n\nMost of the time it's about strategically managing resources so that you and your union produce a huge armada. There are regular events where the entire galaxy unit against alien invaders. I can't remember what they are called now.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nGetting drunk and destablising the delicate political balance of the top 5 unions, so that the entire galaxy plunges into widespread civil war is priceless.\n\nFor everything else, there's fully upgraded Tier 5 Ganymede ships, carefully supplemented by Tier 3 destroyers, torpedo and plasma ships.","January 23","true","780.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

The events are well spaced to let you grow in between the Invasions, but not so far apart to get boring for a patient person.\n\nThis game requires a lot of thought and patience, but the payoff in higher level PVP and Giant Planet raids is worth the wait. Finding a good Union is key (SPEED IS KEY, JACK) as is getting your resource production up and keeping it flowing.\n\nOverall, the stability and deep gameplay of Battlespace make up for it being a browser game which is, in my opinion, it's only deficit.","March 25, 2015","true","502.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","7","18","3","3"
