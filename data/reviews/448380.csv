Think Hotline Miami difficulty but the same kind of insane addictiveness and crazy gameplay, just in a top-down driving game.. and you have Escape: Close Call!  This game is mad fun!"\n\nHere's my First Impressions Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWtCgaM1Ipg\n\nHow can you last?  30 seconds?  A whole minute?  But OMG it's sooo much fun while you're playing and even though you feel like you don't last nearly long enough.. you will definitely want to getcha some more and more of this highly addictive fun!   ...Get your mind out of the gutter now, lol.. Yes I'm talking about this game!\n\nAwesome stuff. Drifting is super fun, and unlocking all the cars and perks should keep you coming back again and again.  Well worth the price of admission with tons of replay value, goals to achieve and online scores to beat!  Watch my video about to see all the reasons I gave this game an ultra high 96% score!  ..This game gets my ** MUST BUY! ** recommendation!","March 24","true","7.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","26","32","4","3"

So much fun drifting around and watching the police destroy each other except for when they all decide to group up on you at the same time leaving you trying to fight off 20 police cars all racing towards you...\n\nPros:\nCheap\nFun\nAddicting\nThe devs are awesome\nCool little zombies that make your screen go trippy\nSimple controls\nA shop to get upgrades which help in game\nOther vehicles to use which require certain milestones giving you something to work towards\n\nCons:\nThe police can be a little bit over powering at times when you first start off\n\nI really enjoyed this game and I will be playing a lot more of it.

It is hard, demanding, annoying at first contact and very grindy if you wanna live longer then 5 seconds. It doesn't really explain itself too well in my opinion, you must do a lot of guessing what to buy and what to actually do to score. Definitely something for those who like upgrading and progressing into better score/skill/performance.\nIt needs polish, maybe more game modes, maybe difficulty setting, maybe multiplayer, its hard for me to pinpoint. Graphics are basic but for this gameplay type they do the job. New players may bounce of difficulty and learning curve. Upgrades are also very linear, you just grind the hell out of it and eventually unlock everything.\n\nI give it a thumb up , but do watch some footage and reviews if its really what you want to invest your money in. It may or may not be something you will personally enjoy.","April 3","true","16.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

The only thought in your mind is “Only 10 minutes, I just need to keep them at bay for 10 minutes to escape!” It is definitely going to be a close call!\n\nEscape: Close Call is a frantic top down car game where you have to avoid being hit by police and other authority’s vehicles for ten minutes using all your driving skills, especially skids. Before you jump into your first game, I would strongly advise you to go through the twelve tutorial lessons.\n\nNow that you are somewhat familiar with the controls and how to score the perfect combos, it’s time for you to try to escape this mayhem of police cars. The gameplay is fairly simple but extremely addictive. You will be awarded points when you avoid a car by a hair’s breadth; evade several cars within a short period of time to create a combo which will multiply your points. If you manage to get the authority’s cars to collide, they will explode and then one of two things will happen - either you run into them within a few seconds, in which case you will receive points and it will be part of your combo, or, if you did not run into them, a zombie policeman will appear and you will be able to run him over for additional points. However, when you do hit them, the screen will look fuzzy for a little while and it will become tricky to avoid the new waves of upcoming cars. Ten minutes is an eternity in the game. Put it this way, after 6 hours of gameplay I only managed to survive two and a half minutes at a time.  With the points you collect, you can purchase power-ups such as the gun turret which will help you to clear some cars coming onto your path for a short period of time or the gas tank upgrade which will give you more fuel. Oh, I forgot to mention that you have to make sure your gas tank is always as full as possible or you will lose by running out of petrol.  Just run over the zombies and you will be fine. Another aspect of the game that I really enjoy is the tasks you have to achieve to gain a new level of difficulty. The tasks will appear very quickly at the start of each run.\n\nThere are 25 cars to unlock, including a limousine! (a limousine . . ? How on earth you are going to survive 10 minutes with that one?)\n\nI like the retro graphics in this game and the slow motion when you narrowly avoid cars or when you get caught out. The controls are good and responsive and you can play either with a gamepad or your keyboard.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun and addictive gameplay\n-	Good retro graphics\n-	Power-ups and upgrades to help you to survive 10 minutes\n-	25 cars to unlock\n-	Great price point\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegative:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Can be frustrating at times, especially when you die within a few seconds, several times in a row.\n\nEscape: Close call is surprisingly good fun! A must-have!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Time for the pros and the cons.\nPros: Quite a couple challenges to do, many cars to choose from and unlock. Slightly replayable if you want to try surviving for as long as possible.\nCons: First challenges are hard to do, and there are no tutorials on how to do an ultimate skid, other tricks newbies don't know how to do.\nThe game is very good, I truly love it. Read more for a tutorial on how to ingore the crash for windows 8 users on this game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can IGNORE the crash window for windows 8. You just make the game windowed when its starting up and hit ALT and then ENTER. and then see the window come up, and just click back to the game window.","March 31","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It starts off hard and making you feel like a fool but once you start figuring it out, succeeding even for a minute make you feel like an epic driver.  \\n\nYou get to make cops smash up their pretty little cars with lights, then watch them walk away as zombies, then you get to run them punks over, how cool is that?\n\nDrifts, slow motion, explosions, and groovy music.

Get in your car, drive, avoid the police and rampage the world with your skill and plenty power-ups! What's really nice in there is that you can play the same game two different ways : Play safe, survive the longest time, and try to reach 10 minutes of survival and escape to win. But you can also play for the score, be overly aggressive, make insane combos, watch hundreds of police cars smash into each others and drive over hundreds of zombies to score high ! Don't let the 30 first minutes of playtime fool you, the beggining can be hard and you might not understand how everything works (I suggest you to read the short begginer's guide), but once you get the game fine between your hands, you can just enjoy the show and feel the adrenaline pumping into your veins !","April 6","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Can be frustrating at times, especially when you die within a few seconds, several times in a row.\nI havent escaped once lol\n\njust what i like to be honest, a game that doesnt hold your hand,\nthis is a hidden gem of a game and is very fun even when you perform as poorly as i do in game.\n\nI like the upgrade system alot, plenty of variety of "perks" to choose from\n\nHowever it does need little improvements as i dont even know why the cops are after me plus rather than the tutorial i decided to just figure it out as i would rather have a narrator telling me stuff but that is my opinion as there are alot of tabs under the tutorial section (they are all live tutorials).\n\nI should have the review uploaded on my channel by the end of the week: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_mJig59jvK3aJ0H-6U1zA","April 29","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
