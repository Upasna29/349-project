It has some humor, a nice art style, and solid gameplay. I barely paid anything for it, and that’s really a shame. With all this fuss over engines and production values, it’s a shame that very few developers actually work towards making a substantial game that is more flesh than flash.\n\nStealth Edmund from Shakespeare's King Lear is a mix of puzzle, platforming, and stealth (of course) that takes cues from greats like the Portal series. Though there are definite shades of Glad0s written on the walls, Stealth Fitzroy manages to carve out its own identity. This game relies more on hasty stealth rather than the slow sneaking that other games of the genre tend to have. However, despite how much speed is required and encouraged, it is all still just as calculated as any other stealth game: there all kinds of hazards, patrolling guards, and time sensitive obstacles that will kill your clone over and over again.\n\nThere is lots of replay in the form of unlocks and leaderboards. Meeting certain goals, finding helices, and so on determine the gear that you can unlock to replay a level. The gear changes gameplay a bit, and making a top score might be a reward in itself if you so with it.\n\nIt is interesting that I finished this game after The Swapper. Both deal with similar subject matter and share at least one gameplay aspect (puzzle platforming), but they seem to handle it in a different way. Whereas The Swapper focused on the self and what it is to be, Stealth Son of Henry I has its own message delivered in a less subtle way. The game, while humorous, is quite dark. The sparse narration, wall writing, and gameplay all have some heavy implications.\n\nIt was my mistake not to play this game sooner: it’s a delightful challenge with character at a great value.\n\n*The DLC: I will leave the soundtrack up to the individual to decide, but The Teleporter Chambers are a must buy for fans: the freedom and strategy are raised along with the challenge.","March 4, 2014","true","19.0"," 121 of 129 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","121","129","21","5"

This is an expanded and much-polished remake, but despite the instant premise it takes a good few levels to warm up, as the opening takes its time to explain the basics when the stealth mechanic is really quite simple. You're either in the gloom and not visible, in dull light and partially visible, or in bright light and fully visible. Levels are made up of dark corners and big bright expanses, with all sorts of cubbyholes and grey areas in-between. They're all filled with switches, cameras, lasers, turrets and sensor beams that interlink, as well as light sources and terminals that need hacking. These ostensibly simple and easily-manipulated elements will kill you so many times it's untrue. SBD's that kind of game.No individual stage is too hard once you’ve figured out the gimmick, and the generous checkpointing lets you throw yourself into the action. Complete levels multiple times and you unlock toys such as holographic decoys to help bypass obstacles. First time through though, you’re on your own.SBD is almost worth playing for its Metal Gear-baiting subtitle, ‘Tactical Espionage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥’. Its mix of platforming and stealth, while both have been done better in more focused games, isn’t a bad reason either. It’s frustrating at times, but the kind where anything that looks impossible is usually a clue that you’ve not found the gimmick yet. A little more narrative wouldn’t have hurt, given the games in whose footsteps it treads. In the end though, you’ll be too busy dying to really care about the reason why.","September 17, 2014","true","5.0"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","37","39","0","1"

The levels can get repetitive in appearance, but the different puzzles you have to deal with help keep the game interesting. The music and sounds are very good and adds to the atmosphere of the game, although I prefer to play my own. An funny component of the game is text written on the walls - usually to help give you hints. Many times, however, it will change to mock you if you make a mistake and die.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn - I prefer using a controller, but the keyboard is just as good. The story and tutorial is quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with puzzle platformers - there are quite a number of timing-based puzzles, and I think these are the most difficult (and frustrating) parts of the game. Every few levels introduce new gameplay mechanics, and these occur at reasonable rates.\n\nGameplay consists of you moving around the map, unlocking the door to the next stage by triggering switches - as you progress through the game, you will have to trigger more and more switches. There are a variety of areas, each with their own levels - at the end of each area is a "boss" level, where an all-seeing eye must be avoided. Your character's stealth goggles will change color to indicate how visible your character is (red = completely visible; green = hidden; yellow = partially visible). If you are seen by enemy robots, they will instantly kill you depending on how close you are - if you are within their field of vision (this will always be visible as you play, indicated by a triangular cone), but not their kill range, then they will investigate the area where they last spotted you. Cameras may activate hazards, usually an insta-kill laser. As you progress, you will have to manipulate more things in each level. For example, initially, you just have to avoid patrolling robots. Later on, you will also have to move the robots (using switches) to position them on top of pressure-sensitive plates, allowing you to reach other parts of the level.\n\nUpon completing an area, you can replay levels you've already beaten to unlock new character suits for that stage. For example, after completing level 1-2 (area 1, stage 2) for the second time, you will unlock the stealth suit for that stage. If you unlock a suit for 3 levels of an area, you will unlock that suit for the entire area. Other suits include a teleporter - you can throw/drop 2 different teleporters (blue and orange); and a decoy suit - deploy a static image of yourself to fool cameras/robots. There is also a special collectible available in some of the levels, which take some extra work to get to.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of this game is the variety of puzzles you encounter - the way each new element is introduced and implemented is very well done. I am on area 4, and there have been many new challenges to deal with - some drove me absolutely crazy. A word of caution - if you like puzzlers, but do not favor timing-based ones, then you may be turned off by a few of the levels. Although the puzzles can be fairly difficult, the game is not particularly unforgiving - the checkpoint system is very good and will ensure you do not have to backtrack too often.\n\nOverall, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plays as a great puzzle platformer, and anyone interested in the genre - especially stealth themes and the potential for speedruns - should give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","April 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","33","37","18","0"

All of this comes together in a complete package  designed to challenge you.\n\n+80 levels across 8 sectors\n\n+ Each Sector introduces a new gameplay mechanic that adds to the challenge and fun. As you progress through the levels these mechanics are put to more creative uses.\n\n+ Each level contains a collectable, get all the collectables in a sector to unlock a new level.\n\n+After completing a level you are graded based on three factors, time, deaths and number of times being spotted. S -Rank is the highest rank you can achieve. Achieving S Rank in all levels in a sector unlocks a new level. This provides plenty of replay ability to the game.\n\n+ Different equipment to experiment with. Some equipment allows you become camouflaged, use a decoy, teleport etc. All of this is strictly optional, in fact to get an S-Rank you have to use no equipment, but it is nice they included these options for anybody who wants to try them out\n\n+Level Editor to make your own levels and share.\n\n+Lots of fan made levels that can easily extend your playtime\n\n+ Game provides a cute story  that fits nicely with the game\n\n+Great music\n\n+Surprisingly addicting.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-Some minor glitches,\n\n- Getting S-Rank in certain levels requires some luck\n\n- The game can get frustrating at times, especially if you are trying to unlock everything\n\nConclusion:\nI really loved this game mainly because I knew so little about it when I started. Though the game is called Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, "stealth" is a bit different than what you normally expect as this game is also about speed and precision platforming. What makes this game so good is how they were able to combine all these different elements together and make a great game.  If you are interested in any of these elements than I strongly recommend you check this game out.\n\n\n","October 10, 2014","true","28.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

You will repeat some levels so many times to unlock it fully, that it will become frustrating and stop being fun. After you restart a level a couple of times until you find the fastest course of action, you may become extremely volatile when you realise this game is not glitch/bug free and something won't just work on the 10th try (a switch may activate as you jump away from it, a robot may not move over a plain surface altough it should, etc.). Highscores are good and all but when each level is timed it will convey any other feeling but stealth.\n\nSound: The music is retro arcade style, which is not to say it's bad, it's just not something to keep you around for long. The sounds as well.\n\nVisuals: The visuals are fine, it's like a pixelated film-grain, this won't bother you, and it's good for the type of game SBD actually is.\n\nStory/Narrative/Context: Almost non-existing, and since it's displayed briefly on the walls as you pass by, you might miss a few while trying to move fast.\n\nConclusion: Don't get this game if you want a stealth game, but get it if you want a difficult platformer with fast paced action and some stealth nuances. The game is not bad, it's actually good for what it is, just don't be confused by the Stealth in the name since you'll regret paying for it.

This game has more of an trial an error and figuring out element that especially in Levels 2 and 3 start to be the name of the game. But the skill element is there too in some levels and it can get very frustrating as you spend a lot of time getting over a specific obstacle only to get stuck completely just before the exit. But as always with games like this the solution is usually simple so you can only point the finger at your self when you get stuck.\n\nNevertheless there is plenty to do. Achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/recommended/209190/","Selenography","Selenography","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Selenography/","653 products in account","Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe was one of the early games out of the Greenlight gate - prior to it becoming an open door three miles wide - and it shows how decent some of those first Greenlight games were. This was made in GameMaker Studio, but you can scarcely tell as the inventiveness on display here is outstanding, both in terms of art assets used and the gameplay itself. On the face of it, it's just another 2D puzzle-platformer in a market awash with titles from that genre, but this one has something a little different. The aesthetic is dark and brooding with a sharp sense of humour, suiting the setting well...and the soundtrack is similarly appropriate. But the gameplay is, as ever, the meat and potatoes.\n\nModern gaming is far from poor, but I've always felt that good level design is a dying art. Too many games are linear, have simplistic puzzling elements, and so forth. SBD bucks that trend in a big way, and while it is a puzzle-platformer, the emphasis is very much on the former. The level design is superb, and while it generally prizes planning and execution over multiple solutions, the puzzles are engaging and some of them are difficult. This is by far the greatest strength of the game, and it kept me on my toes for the entire duration.\n\nThe game has 8 chapters (2 more added with the recommended DLC), each with ten levels. The pacing is good, with each chapter focusing on a different gameplay element - whether it be an enemy, an ability or a level obstacle. It all comes together very well with the difficulty being scaled well. The gist is that you need to guide your very fragile clone through this series of levels and make it to the exit, often via reasonable complex paths that are not immediately obvious. You will die (a lot), but you'll also learn and the game never outright punishes you more than once.\n\nThe replayability is excellent. Once you complete levels in a chapter a certain number of times, you get access to pieces of equipment that you can replay the levels with - including camo suits, teleporters, and several others. They're particularly useful in finding the expertly hidden Helices, collectables that unlock an extra level at the end of the chapter. Getting an S Rank (no easy feat) on all levels does the same. The helices are often ingeniously hidden, and I'd recommend trying to find them all without a guide whenever you can.\n\nThere are a few downsides. The platforming is solid but unspectacular, with the controls feeling quite 'floaty' at first with momentum being something to get used to. Sometimes you'll be undone by an accidental button press when on a good run, or just not quite pushing something far enough. The DLC, while extremely fun, is also infuriatingly difficult compared to the main game.\n\nI have a lot time for this game. The setting won't be for everyone, and the backgrounds can get bland towards the end of the game, but the variety and creativity being showcased here really impressed me. If you like the genre, I'd suggest buying it immediately if you want to be tested without having to rely on crazy reflexes. It used to be a hidden gem on Steam, but I'm glad that more people have now been exposed to Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe via bundles and the recently released sequel. It has all the qualities that deserve attention.","May 13, 2015","true","35.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","16","18","4","0"

It seems that the "DeLuxe" part is due this game being first developed as a free game. It also seems that it can't be "b4stards" in the review text, so sorry for the 4.\n\nAnyway, title shenanigans aside, we have our little lovely clone, in the standard-post-aperture testing chambers, trying to get from A to B, where "B" is a closed door which usually has to be opened by "hacking" (Going to the terminal and press "B" for a small amount of time) some computers in points C,D, etc etc.\n\nHere the meat and bones are in how is and what is in the path from point Whatever to point Wherever. And here is when Stealth B4stard DeLuxe shines.\nThere are several "worlds". Each world introduces a new mechanic (be it portals, platforms that move in a specific moment, new sentries that hunt you down in different ways...) and mix it with previously seen mechanics, adding new stuff just when you were starting to get tired of the old stuff and mixing it to get new original combinations. And it works, and its fun: There are maps in which you have to think, maps in which you have to be quick, maps in which you have to be smart and know where to crouch, maps in which you have to have iron reflexes... you have to pull boxes, to crouch behind turrets, to make NPC's work for you by moving parts of the map, to jump and crouch everywhere in the right moment to get the desired output... there's a lot of things to do and, as I said, there's always something new to add to the bag of tricks the game has each few maps. And also find the secret DNA sequences.\n\nFor better or worse, though, the difficulty of the puzzles isn't exactly top tier. I had to stop to think several times (After getting killed over and over in the same spot), and more times I got killed because I didn't jumped in the right moment, but still I hadn't to scratch my head a lot to go through the standard game. The game's easy, but not "The Ball" or "Portal 2" easy, just a bit less, enough to make it a decent light after work challenge. (And most of the DNA sequences are really well hidden).\nBut you will die. Lot of times. And you will even get angry at the game. And that's great, as you will not die too many times and the reason for your demise will be, almost always, your fault.\n\nIt also has standard issue scoreboards (Finish the level in the shorter time), some extra items to help you move for an already solved test chamber, and an editor with lots of communitty made maps that most of us will never use, but hey, is good to know it exists and maybe tomorrow I'll give a try to the editor.\nYeah, tomorrow.\n\nIn short, a great, fun, balanced and very well designed small puzzle game.

You need to hide in darkness and pick your moments to leave cover so that you don't get detected. You have to solve a bunch of puzzles like moving blocks around through teleporters to put them onto switches so you can move through gates or deactivate lasers and that sort of thing. Lastly there's lots of carefully timed jumps to make so that you can get over lasers, saw-blades and robots. Some of the levels can be quite tricky, which makes it very rewarding to finally figure out a solution.\n\nDespite being a great stealth puzzle platformer I still felt that my time hadn't been that well spent. The game is technically very good, but it's just not that enjoyable. When shadows are so important to a game, they somehow made them emanate at some really weird angles. It would have been nice if they made clear light sources so you could more easily see the platforms and predict the shadow that would appear behind them. I want to get caught and die because I'm bad at a game, not because of faulty physics making objects cast shadows at weird angles from no clear light source.\n\nWhile playing this game, I kept feeling that I was a minion from the animated film "Dispicable Me", who had been thrust into a cheesy "Portal" knock-off. Why did it feel like a "Portal" knock-off? Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is based on testing chambers through which you are guided by condescending text projections (lets not even mention the blue/orange teleporters) which were supposed to provide instruction and humour, but just came across as being pretentious. I know I should have expected some lame smack-talking humour from a game with a name like "Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥", but still, this game left me disappointed because the gameplay was pretty much spot on, but the style and mood was lacking and abrasive.\n\nThe bottom line? If you want a great stealth based puzzle platformer, then this game is for you, but only if you can get past being a minion in a poorly lit, and slightly Portal flavoured (though somewhat sour) testing facility.\n\n5/10 would not test.\n\nPlease note: I played this entirely on my laptop on the train so due to poor mobile internet connections my play time might not be accurate.

The game does not stop you from proceeding further just because you suck a doing a level perfectly or really fast.

Makes you feel creative and accomplished once you figure things out or get to the exit.  Your surroundings can constantly change, so this game rewards being observant -- especially now that there are secrets to be found.  And if you're a perfectionist, there are challenge conditions to be met as well.\n\n8 areas with 8 levels each, plus two bonus levels per area.  So the base game is 64 levels.  Even if you've got no patience to perfect your gameplay, you can still unlock one bonus level per area by getting the hidden item in each level, so that's 72 levels to play.  (Challenge conditions unlock the other 8 bonus levels.)  And once you complete each level you can use new equipment that gets you more abilities to play with, in that level.\n\nPLUS...several truckloads' worth of community-made levels!  If you're ever bored with the main levels, you can always check these out and you never know what you'll find.  Or if you're feeling creative, you can make your own!\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the humor.  It's not just stealth platforming, but stealth platforming with great theming -- an industrial/cyberpunk dystopian espionage feel, seasoned with some quite amusing dark humor.  The visuals, music, and other elements -- including the way the many traps in the game are designed -- add perfectly to this.  And then there's the writing on the walls...literally...\n\nI first played this game in its freeware version, which is just called "Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥".  I liked it enough that when I saw it in a Humble Bundle I picked up this version.  And it's just as good.\n\n(Disclosure: I got this game from the Humble Bundle with Android 6.)","May 21","true","12.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

When I heard of this game, and how it brings aspects of stealth with platforming and quick thinking, in a timed environment that is fast paced, I was immediately interested. I was able to buy this game and was not disappointed with what was promised. The game is challenging, with a good difficulty increase rate, the equipment is helpful when you know when and where it's appropriate to use it, the everpresent self challenge of beating your times, pushing yourself to think quicker and outsmart the system is amazing and the music is fun to listen to. I bought the bundle with the soundtrack and Teleport Chambers. The controls work depending on how you like to keybind. The default is with arrow keys and Z for movement and jumping. I didn't like that, but Curve put in the option to customise controls. I now play with WASD and Space. Windowed mode also allows you to use the mouse in the menus, which is more efficient for me. The game has charming aesthetics and design. The game has a tendency to talk to you by means of text on the walls in a manner that seems a lot like the sarcasm of GLaDOS. Level design is usually very fair and brilliant. Figuring out the puzzle of each chamber is rather satisfying, especially with bosses. Whether you refer to the game by the PC name 'Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' or the console name 'Stealth Inc.', it's a great game. Most definately worth the price, but if you can catch it during one of Steam's famous sales, it would be great. You could even buy some copies for your friends whilst picking it up for yourself at the same price.","November 30, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Buy it.\n\nThe game has a simple premise: fast(er) paced stealth. You know those stealth games where you spend up to 5 minutes waiting until you get a clear path? Right, in this game, try five seconds. The game doesn't offer just that, though. With it's mechanics, it ends up offering an experience that kind of resembles a fast-paced puzzler.\n\nThe game has a big focus on staying in the shadow and not making noise. Most enemies can't see you if you aren't doing any of these things. However, puzzle elements also enter the mix and things just get amazing when you get on a platform with a laser coming in from above and the only way out is doing some amazing stunt.\n\nThe campaign has 8 chapters (more if you buy the teleporter chambers dlc) with 10 levels each: 7 main levels, 1 boss and two secret levels unlocked by uncovering secrets and doing amazing in levels. These secret levels and also characters unlocked by completing the levels add up to plenty of replay value.\n\nFinally, the big epic: the level editor. This nifty tool is amazing. It allows you to create levels, like you'd expect. But the amazing thing is, it's the EXACT SAME TOOL used to create the actual game levels. As you might guess, this gives you a LOT of freedom. I myself have made two levels so far. It's actually pretty nifty and not as hard to use as one might think. Sadly, most users make dumb levels with close to no challenge and simply don't bother putting effort into making them look good. Still, occasionally you might run into a good level. Occasionally.\n\nAnyway, that's my recommendation. Get this game, trust me. You won't regret it.","July 2, 2013","true","45.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A quick description would be Metal Gear Solid meets Super Meat Boy. The game combines platforming, wall jumping puzzles with a light based steath system, with cameras, lasers, and robots. The gameplay is fast, fun, and addictive. The graphics have that retro sprite feel, but don't look cheap, using cool lighting effects and distortion to really make the most out them. The music is a wonderful fit, that could easily have come out of Shadow Run or Deus ex. Add some cool powerups and a level editor and you've got a home run right here.

When you screw up, there's an exaggerated blood spray death animation--doesn't bother me because it's kinda cartoony, but it's too gruesome for the kids.\n\nAlso, my daughter can read now, and the title has the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it, so....\n\nIf Mark of the Ninja and Super Meat Boy had a baby, this would be it.","September 7, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I say this not in anger. It is a really neat game.  It is especially good if you have a lot of friends who also 'gotta go fast!' as there are both 'World' and 'Friend' leaderboards. Merely completing a level is not enough as you must achieve an 'S' rank in a level in order to unlock everything.  Achieving an 'S' rank is appropriately hard and takes into account time completed, times spotted, and deaths.

The game is very level-design centered. The player has very few capabilities; crouch, jump, ledge-grab, crawl, hide in shadows... that's about it.

You take control of a clone trying to escape a deadly facility using merely planning and precise platforming skills, while “someone” gives you hints and snarky comments about your performance as you progress through each room.  Often as I failed to properly plan my course of action I was greeted with a “you really though that would work?”   from my mysterious watcher, or even a “I  like your thinking” as I realize the use of a puzzle piece. These comments not only serve as great tools to complement what can only be considered as great level design, but also set a humorous tone to the experience, turning many times a frustrating attempt into an amusing misstep.\n\nUnlike several games in the stealth genre, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe does not suffer from the “waiting syndrome”. Despite the fact that timing is key to  successfully traverse  many of the levels, you rarely find yourself simply waiting for an enemy to reach certain position or for a switch to active. This allowed a more fluid gameplay and also a higher difficulty without becoming punishing. This fluidity, coupled with the fact that every sector introduces a new element, which drastically alters the gameplay, gives this game a greatly satisfying pace.\n\nThis is a game I certainly recommend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/209190/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was born from the desire to create a fast-paced stealth game, and it's easily succeeded. I've heard it likened to Super Meat Boy here and there, and I can't disagree with the comparison. There's more than a hint of that same style of trial-and-error platformy goodness - though I personally feel that Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ never reaches the same level of ridiculous difficulty as SMB.\n\nOf course, I'd hesitate to bill SB first and foremost as a platformer, or even as a stealth game for that matter. More than anything, it strikes me as a puzzle game. Each level is a new problem to figure out. How to get around obstacles, how to manipulate enemies into unwittingly assisting you, how to hack terminals without being seen... it's all one big puzzle. It's just that it's a puzzle in which you run and jump and hide and sneak as fast as you can.\n\nIn each of the 80 levels, including boss stages, the goal is always the same: hack all of the terminals and then reach the exit, preferably alive. Each sector of the game introduces a new mechanic or mechanics. For instance, the first sector teaches the basics, the second introduces patrolling robots, and then the third throws laser tripwires into the mix to liven things up.\n\nThe levels are very cleverly built. Everything is deliberate, and levels typically flow quite nicely whether you are trying to find your way through for the first time, or speedstealthing to acquire that delicious S-rank. Later levels somewhat lose the deliberate feel when they start getting into things like sound mechanics and AI pathfinding manipulation. But on the whole, the game never strays too far from the light. Or the dark, rather.\n\nThere are 8 sectors in total, and every sector has 10 levels. 7 normal levels, 1 boss stage, and 2 bonus levels that are unlocked by S-ranking the first 8 levels and by finding the double helix DNA strand hidden within each of them (respectively). Some helixes are relatively easy to find, but others can be quite devious, indeed. Still others are simple to spot, but difficult to reach. I recommend having a go at them. S-ranks, however, are an entirely different story.\n\nTo earn an S-rank on a level, you must complete that level within a certain amount of time, while being spotted less than a certain number of times, and all without dying once. It's certainly possible to get an S-rank on every level, but for some of them it can be a little gruelling. I recommend doing what you can, but not torturing yourself trying to S-rank absolutely every last one unless you've enjoyed the game enough that you need the extra challenge and extra levels.\n\nEach of the first five times you complete a level, a piece of equipment is unlocked for use in that level. These range from handheld teleporters, to deployable darkness.  While these items have their own leaderboards and cannot be used to achieve S-ranks, they can come in VERY handy for seeking out helixes. Plus, it's just darn fun to run back through a difficult level with the power of invisibility at your disposal.\n\nThere is a level editor, and it's not too tough to get the basic hang of. For those advanced hangs, however, you might think yourself in circles a few times. It's not TOO difficult to master. It's just not always very intuitive when it comes to some of the more complicated elements. But if I managed to understand as much as I did with all of my dumb, I see no reason why the rest of you shouldn't be able to program Far Cry 3 into the thing.\n\nThe current collection of user-made levels uploaded and available for play are... kind of a crapshoot. Some are easy. Most are not. Some are abstract test levels never intended for human consumption. You'll just kind of have to sort through on your own.\n\nStealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was unexpectedly enjoyable from start to finish. Minus a number of S-ranks which are mostly a blur of swearing to me, now. It accomplished what it set out to do: to make a great stealth game, but without the tauntingly slow pace. It's stealth, it's platforming, and it's a puzzler.\n\nBut mostly it's just a lot of fun.","September 30, 2013","true","39.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun, it enjoys mocking the player, and it has some fun jokes to tell. The mechanics are consistent and masterable. There's a ton of secrets that I haven't gotten a chance to get into, so I'm probably missing about 16 unlockable levels, but the game is challenging enough that without a walkthrough I don't know how long it would take me to unlock and play all those. I'd like to play more, I do enjoy the game quite a bit. I like puzzle-platformers and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is no exception. It's got a Mega-Man visual quality to it with lighting that reminds me of Gish.  The game is very level-design centered. The player has very few capabilities; crouch, jump, ledge-grab, crawl, hide in shadows... that's about it. But each of the 8 worlds introduces unique and interesting mechanic, and the game is great about teaching you how to deal with new challenges as you approach them.\nI recommend Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","May 15, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mental challenge relates to figuring out how to avoid enemies, which order to press buttons in, and how to keep switches weighted down. The physical challenge comes from performing jumps quickly and accurately enough to avoid traps. Sometimes theres very little room for error, and dying repeatedly can be a bit frustrating. However, it also feels good when you finally nail a level. There are frequent checkpoints, so when you die, you wont lose too much progress. There are eight sectors, each with eight maps, and each new sector introduces a new type of hazard which keeps the game fresh. Theres alot of scope for replayability, unlocking gadgets, trying for a better rank by getting fast times and low number of deaths, and community created maps. Overall a pretty good game, worth a look, especially considering the low purchase price.","January 25, 2013","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the platforming isn't always as silky smooth as in SMB and the stealth mechanics aren't as fully fleshed out as in MotN, it's still able to strike a nice balance between the two and create a fun experience. If you've already played the free version of Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then Deluxe will have you feeling right at home. It plays identical to the original while adding more excellently-designed levels, more devilish obstacles/traps, and a few various gadgets (which are more of a novelty than anything and strip the game of its challenge. Thankfully they can be skipped entirely). Deluxe also features a good sense of humor that taunts you for your failures, a robust custom level editor, and a strong electronica-based soundtrack. The game feels a little trial-and-error at times which can result in a lot of unexpected deaths, but the checkpoint system is fairly generous and gives you the freedom to take risks.\n\nIn all, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is a nice blend of puzzle platforming and stealth gameplay that features some fantastic, intelligent level-design and a healthy challenge. If you enjoyed the original free version, the Deluxe is easily recommended for the price.","May 9, 2013","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As the game progresses, you unlock various 'perks', giving your suit additional abilities, such as decoys and invisibility, opening up several different routes and escape opportunities for the player each level.\n\nThe game also features a Mapmaker mode, where you can design and upload your own death gauntlets for your fellow clones to be eviscerated and or vapourised within!

Potentially a lot of replay value if you enjoy going back and getting faster completions or collecting the hidden items, which unlock extra levels. One thing I think could have been better was the user created maps and the level editor. Not the easiest system to browse levels and often buggy. Not sure if it's just me, but loading user levels caused reproducible crashes on many occasions.\n\nDespite these issues, I recommend the game.

While the platforming isn't always as silky smooth as in SMB and the stealth mechanics aren't as fully fleshed out as in MotN, it's still able to strike a nice balance between the two and create a fun experience. If you've already played the free version of Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then Deluxe will have you feeling right at home. It plays identical to the original while adding more excellently-designed levels, more devilish obstacles/traps, and a few various gadgets (which are more of a novelty than anything and strip the game of its challenge. Thankfully they can be skipped entirely). Deluxe also features a good sense of humor that taunts you for your failures, a robust custom level editor, and a strong electronica-based soundtrack. The game feels a little trial-and-error at times which can result in a lot of unexpected deaths, but the checkpoint system is fairly generous and gives you the freedom to take risks.\n\nIn all, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is a nice blend of puzzle platforming and stealth gameplay that features some fantastic, intelligent level-design and a healthy challenge. If you enjoyed the original free version, the Deluxe is easily recommended for the price.","May 9, 2013","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're in the shadows, you're hidden. Your goggles always point out whether you're fully or partially hidden with their color, so there's never any question and enemies have vision cones to make skirting around them a breeze. Each stage is one huge puzzle full switches, platforms, and strategic placement of lights and shadow that will require a lot of playing around with to see how everything works. Nearly all of Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s challenges are executed well, with almost every victory being cemented by a tense, skin of your teeth escape.\n\nThe only blemish on the game is the final world's introduction of "Seeker" enemies. These enemies require near pixel-perfect maneuvering to avoid and at times their placement feels really unfair. More than a few times, their placement required a complete stage restart upon death because the checkpoints don't reset enemy positions.\n\nOther than that, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is a fine game, full of great content and fantastic tunes that deserves your attention if you're looking to spice up your platforming love a bit.","April 8, 2013","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your receive a letter grade (A-D) for your performance which takes into account time/death/# times spotted. This part of the game is thoroughly enjoyable. Taking your time to explore the level and solve the puzzles is atmospheric and challenging.\n\nThen the PROBLEM is that in order to achieve the best grade S (for stealth) you should complete the puzzle in a very short time without being spotted at all. And now  the game turn into a very tight timed platformer, where you must be very precise in your moves and jump. Hopefully the controls are quite good and the character is very agile and capable of changing direction in mid air. Yet getting a S grade on some level can be very hard and you may have to repeat the level many times to get a perfect result. BE WARNED that this part can be really nerves wrecking, and you'll realize why there is the B.....D word in the game title.\n\nNote that each stage is mad of 8 levels and getting a S grade on the 8 level is not necessary to move to the next stage, it merely unlock a bonus 9th level on each stage.","September 1, 2014","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take control of a clone trying to escape a deadly facility using merely planning and precise platforming skills, while “someone” gives you hints and snarky comments about your performance as you progress through each room.  Often as I failed to properly plan my course of action I was greeted with a “you really though that would work?”   from my mysterious watcher, or even a “I  like your thinking” as I realize the use of a puzzle piece. These comments not only serve as great tools to complement what can only be considered as great level design, but also set a humorous tone to the experience, turning many times a frustrating attempt into an amusing misstep.\n\nUnlike several games in the stealth genre, Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe does not suffer from the “waiting syndrome”. Despite the fact that timing is key to  successfully traverse  many of the levels, you rarely find yourself simply waiting for an enemy to reach certain position or for a switch to active. This allowed a more fluid gameplay and also a higher difficulty without becoming punishing. This fluidity, coupled with the fact that every sector introduces a new element, which drastically alters the gameplay, gives this game a greatly satisfying pace.\n\nThis is a game I certainly recommend.

The twist at the end is remarkable, and left me wanting answers, as well as craving more. It's amazing that this game isn't getting more attention, because it deserves it.","January 17, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developer taunts you as you try to complete each level, and he will ocassionally pat you on the back...but mostly he taunts you.  Challenges will take a combination of wit and platforming skills to complete and it's pretty satisfying when you do.  Levels are designed with a lot of creativity, and new concepts are continually introduced throughout the entire game which ensures that you're not just repeating the same puzzles over and over again.

It likes to remind me of my failures.  It likes to take a stupid situation in which I die because of my impatience or negligence for the range of enemies and rub it in my face.  And I love it for it.\n\nStealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is the pay version of the previously FTP Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, made on the Game Maker engine.  While a lot of people complain about Game Maker and its limitations (especially the free version), games like Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are a great reminder that the Game Maker engine can actually perform its job well.  With its amazing art style and fun mechanics, this game is like a blast from the past; complete with unlockable levels based on either item acquisition (DNA Helixes) or completing the level by accomplishing certain requirements and recieving S-rank (which is absolutely bloody hard to do).  It is a form of gaming that, sadly, has become obselete in today's world by simple nature that selling levels for DLC content is far more popular by game companies because, like electricity, the web, cable tv, and the latest HIV vaccine, it is far easier to make more money by cutting things apart and selling it in pieces; a tactic that is incredibly and obviously stupid, yet we fall for it anyway (yes, shots fired).\n\nThe best part about this version to the best of my knowledge is that it also includes a community level editor.  I am currently finished with the main vanilla game and fully intend to complete all the extra levels and then play some of the player-made levels.  A quick advice to anybody making games in the future; please, please, please, PLEASE make level editors.  Your game's lifespan will last infinitely longer if you include player-made content regardless of whether or not your game is good.  I mean, look at Kinetic Void and Ace of Spades; those games are terrible and they are still played every now and again due to the ship/level editors.","September 30, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It likes to remind me of my failures.  It likes to take a stupid situation in which I die because of my impatience or negligence for the range of enemies and rub it in my face.  And I love it for it.\n\nStealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is the pay version of the previously FTP Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, made on the Game Maker engine.  While a lot of people complain about Game Maker and its limitations (especially the free version), games like Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are a great reminder that the Game Maker engine can actually perform its job well.  With its amazing art style and fun mechanics, this game is like a blast from the past; complete with unlockable levels based on either item acquisition (DNA Helixes) or completing the level by accomplishing certain requirements and recieving S-rank (which is absolutely bloody hard to do).  It is a form of gaming that, sadly, has become obselete in today's world by simple nature that selling levels for DLC content is far more popular by game companies because, like electricity, the web, cable tv, and the latest HIV vaccine, it is far easier to make more money by cutting things apart and selling it in pieces; a tactic that is incredibly and obviously stupid, yet we fall for it anyway (yes, shots fired).\n\nThe best part about this version to the best of my knowledge is that it also includes a community level editor.  I am currently finished with the main vanilla game and fully intend to complete all the extra levels and then play some of the player-made levels.  A quick advice to anybody making games in the future; please, please, please, PLEASE make level editors.  Your game's lifespan will last infinitely longer if you include player-made content regardless of whether or not your game is good.  I mean, look at Kinetic Void and Ace of Spades; those games are terrible and they are still played every now and again due to the ship/level editors.","September 30, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this is less the "sneaky-sneaky slow" kind of stealth game and more of a "puzzle-platform, stay out of the light" kind. The levels can be completed prety quickly and there are leaderboards for how fast you can go. Each level has a hidden collectible to find and a threshhold for time/deaths/times spotted to earn the S-rank. Collecting all the collectibles in a world and beating the S-rank unlocks bonus stages, one for each, respectively.\n\nMy major gripes with this game are that the checkpoint system has a few flaws. Sometimes it would not save my progress in places that it should have and other times it would checkpoint me in strange places, like in the middle of a jump that was sending me into a hazard, or checkpoint me while I was dying and forcing me to restart the level. Stage 7-8 had this particularly bad when I fell into a teleporter next to a laser and the checkpoint saved there, causing me to start the level again.\nThe AI for the clones is also very obnoxious. Their actions are based on triggers, so depending on where you are standing, they will move. On one level, I was standing on a moving platform trying to hack a console and the clone kept switching the platform and interrupting me. Luckily, this is only a problem on two or so levels.\n\nThe music isn't anything to write home about, but it's suitable and it's not annoying, which is really all I ask for. I beat the game in about 4 hours and there's plenty of content left if I should decide to unlock the bonus stages, speedrun stages or try again with the unlockable equipment. Playing a stage multiple times will unlock equipment that can be used to beat the level in creative ways such as a camo suit, holographic decoy, noisemaker or teleporters. Unlocking these is somewhat annoying because you have to play 3 different stages about 5 times each to unlock the equipment for the whole world.\n\nIn closing, Stealth B Deluxe is a fun game and it's worth picking up.","January 25","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
