It's a good story for a game that focuses on the gameplay, and while it boils the game down to simple concepts, it does a good job of keeping your attention and adding a couple of layers to the strategy. The color portion for the strategy does do a reasonable job of keeping things interesting, and the units differences do help in terms of keeping things interesting enough. While the level design needed a bit more variety then it gave, it was able to make up for it with some good music and some good animations. While the game is a port of the iOS version (which despite the fact is “Free” on the store, it's a demo and you have to pay for it), it's reasonable controls despite some quirks. It's good basic strategy fun, although if you're looking for high levels of strategy: you're not going to get it here, as there's a limit to its tricks. Look, it's not going to blow you away, it's a game that's 5 dollars. But you do seemingly get bang for your buck.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2q5UvoRFWM\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nBasic strategy elements work reasonably, and have a couple of little wrinkles that keep things interesting.\nHaving to research to get your next monsters/traps did help the game a bit. Had a “collect them all mentality”\nReasonable amount of content for a 5 dollar game with some replayability in chasing the silver and gold medals.\nLike the active skill choices making a difference reasonably in battle, and it can actually help in progression.\nIt's got some reasonable artwork, and the animations are nice to see.\nA good soundtrack that actually surprised me.\nNegatives:\nIt does get repetitive.\nLevel Design could have used more elements to change things up in terms of mechanics. While there's a level or two that has you with limited resources, things that slowed you down or had alternate objectives would have gone a long way.\nThe lack of the A+D for the keyboard controls to move things left and right on the screen was annoying.\nSometimes rebinds its own keys with the building purchases during match, which is annoying. It shows you what it rebinds it to, but yeah, don't mess with the keys that are already there.\nThe same price for it on the iOS, and it fits better there. Still, it can work here, it just doesn't do the best of jobs.","May 27","true","5.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalldrexx/recommended/441510/","kalldrexx","Kalldrexx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalldrexx/","322 products in account","Great indie game.  Glad to be able to play it on my laptop now instead of only on my tablet.\n\nCore gameplay involves you strategically picking units to take into each level, and strategically deploying them to defeat the enemy's base, in a tug of war style scenario.  There is a lot of depth on picking which units you want to use for each scenario (based on the opponent's makeup) and how to best use each unit.  As you beat scenarios you will research new units that you'll be able to use, encouraging a fun feedback loop of maximizing beating each level with trying to research as many units as you can (there are a lot).\n\nThe units are well designed and balanced, the story is clever and entertaining, the challenges are strategically hard in a rewarding way, and there is lot's of replayability to try and unlock everything.\n\n","May 29","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Solid, whimsical, well-balanced fun. A teacher once told me it's a little unfair to judge games on a set of criteria (like furniture), and I agree, but let's go down the checklist anyway:\n\n- Dialogue is witty, lighthearted, and gives great characterization.\n- Creature/ability variety is ridiculous. So many fun, crazy things available to the player. So many!\n- Tutorials are skillfully embedded in gameplay and wrapped with adorable, creative dialogue - I don't think I've ever picked up the mechanics of a strategy game so quickly.\n- Mechanics are tight. Building rooms, deploying creatures, and selecting abilities is intuitive.\n- The difficulty curve is spot-on. Excellent balancing.\n- I didn't like that the antagonist was the protagonist with a different color scheme. It made for a couple funny jokes, but a whole new character would have been more fun.\n- It also irked me that naturalism was the excuse for the little battles. Again, it made for some cute jokes, but I wasn't buying the research/science angle.\n- Great art, both world and character. The little animations and level variety really help make the game memorable.\n- The music is great too - before playing, I was puzzled that an OST is being offered for such a game of this size. But now I get it.\n\nDelightful gameplay, wondrous variety, exquisitely silly premise! Worth the money!","June 2","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The plot revolves around an expedition gone wrong, a evil look-alike, and all the slugs you can eat.  There's not much else to say about the game.  While I entered the game with high-hopes, I left slightly disappointed with it.  The formula has been done before, and better at that, and FlatRedBall doesn't really innovate at all.  The fact that I can sum up the entire gameplay in a single short sentence says a lot.  There are some other mechanics such as spending gold to unlock more slots, a hatchery for slugs, a shovel that reduces prices, but nothing that hasn't been done before in similar games.  For the same price, or even for free on my cellphone, I can get Battlepillars which has more extensive mechanics and, honestly, does the genre better.  That being said, the devs aren't lying when they said the graphics are beautiful.  The word doesn't even come close to describing the smooth animations and gorgeous scenery.  The sprites and backgrounds are amazing and the devs should feel proud of this accomplishment.  The whole ascetic works well with the plot which focuses on comedy and the almost childish behaviors of the cast.  Based on these simple design choices I can recommend the game for those looking for an RTS with a good story.  If you are hoping for more depth in your game, however, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.","May 31","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you get to the island you find out that Norab is the one to blame for tinkering with your robots.\n\nThe game has 3 worlds with 10 levels each. When you finish one world on the Story difficulty you unlock the Silver difficulty for that world. And when you finish that world on Silver difficulty you unlock the Gold difficulty also for that world.\n\nYou have 45 creatures to research. After finishing the three worlds on Story difficulty and the world 1 on Silver difficulty I was able to unlock 15 creatures. So if you want to unlock all the 45 creatures and get the related achievement you'll need to finish the game in all difficulty settings.\n\nAt the beginning of each level you must choose your units based on the color of the enemies units.\n\nRating:\n7/10\n\nPros: Great tutorial\nFunny dialogue\nGreat variety of units/creatures\nGreat soundtrack\nNice 16-bits graphics\nCons: The game gets repetitive\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com]","June 5","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
