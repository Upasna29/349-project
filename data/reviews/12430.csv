"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/recommended/12430/","thordred","Thordred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/","2085 products in account","SlamIt Pinball offers just one single table, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and at this point I would have liked to tell you something about how it plays.\n\nBut the game gave me a challenge I wasn't up to: Some moments into a match the game crashed... every time. Rarely I've experienced such a bug-ridden, broken piece of software. The fact that its release dates back to 2007 and its still in an unplayable state today is a clear hint that the devs abandoned their game. There are even options in the main menu, for example the controller settings, that make the game crash when you click on them.\n\nYes, apparently the game was supposed to have the option to be played with a Xbox 360 controller. But the main feature SlamIt Pinball owes its name to involves the keyboard. Slamming your keyboard in different regions nudges the table in a corresponding direction. This innovative mechanism posed one problem: In Windows some keys and key combinations are assigned to specific functions and by slamming wildly onto your keyboard you are bound to hit one of them. And this is the solution the devs came up with: Starting the game adds an entry to your Windows registry that disables all the functions that could get in the way of playing the game. Closing the game removes that entry. This would actually work if the game wouldn't crash regularly but if the game isn't properly closed through the main menu the registry entry stays. I didn't know about that and after I finally gave up on SlamIt Pinball and uninstalled it I noticed that none of the keys were working, Windows key for the start menu, Ctrl+Alt+Del for the task manager, etc... nothing. Took me quite some time to figure out the cause.\n\nStay away from this utterly broken game and satisfy your pinball needs with Pinball Arcade (if you prefer authentic recreations of real-life tables) or Pinball FX2 (for a diverse selection of fantasy tables) instead.","December 14, 2013","false","0.5"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","55","60","0","0"

How could I completely resist a crime-themed pinball table--almost like a cross between pinball and PAYDAY! It's a shame this game is bug-ridden and will never be fixed, because the table seems pretty cool. You can play as a cop or a crook, meaning you'll get to try different missions on the table depending on which side you chose. The table looks good and the pinball seems like it might be pretty good. Unfortunately, the more I try it the more bugs I find. Forget portrait mode--the freaking menus will remain in landscape orientation, so you'll have to tilt your head sideways! Forget using a gamepad on this because it seems to be mapped incorrectly and you can't remap the controller at all. The files appear to be encrypted, so forget about trying to fix it that way. Really, this broken game should probably not be sold by any vendor any more.","December 1, 2013","false","0.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

You can play the game two ways. First time you go up a colored ramp you are picking that side to play for. Either cop or robber. The table took some slight adjustments in the editor till it was the angle I am comfortable with but after that it is a very deep game when it comes to unlocking the vault and breaking into the bank. The safe combo has sweet effects to it too and multiball gets nuts. Great table for the price.","December 24, 2013","true","2.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"
