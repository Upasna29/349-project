You have two game modes to choose from and one of the best online multiplayer lobbies I've ever seen in my life. There is the Skirmish mode, which is a free for all single life per round game mode. First to get eight kills wins the match. Second there is the Run mode, two teams try to reach the opposite side of the map. First team to cross, or eliminate the other team, wins. Match is the best of five rounds. There are simple yet distinct classes to choose from, based on classic shooter archetypes.\n\nAnd the lobby is seriously entertaining too. Hang out and chat at the barrista, play a pick up game of 2D basketball, or pick up a fancy outfit or a pet. Of course you can always spend your hard earned winnings the old fashioned way and get hammered at the bar.\n\nThe game also boasts crisp and responsive controls and totally over the top physics. Round that out with online and local multiplayer with full bot support so you never have to go without a game. Totally worth the price of entry and then some.","April 9","true","4.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/262100/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","If you were a fan of King Arthur’s Gold then I have some delightful news to share with you – if you weren’t already aware. Transhuman Design are back with their second Steam game. This time the indie geniuses have put their mind to a multiplayer intended action game that features a sweet singleplayer mode for those who can’t get into a multiplayer game. To date Steamified have featured several multiplayer (including local multiplayer only) games that have been pretty much presumed dead on arrival for a lack of a competent singleplayer mode. I’d like those developers to cast a watchful eye over this game and study it. You can create a game that is fully intended to be played as a multiplayer game – which I believe Trench Run is – and have a successful and well implemented singleplayer mode. It may not save your game entirely but it will give those who gave you their hard earned cash the ability to play your game and not immediately utilize Steam’s refund system.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I have yet to get into a local or online multiplayer game of Trench Run. This could have annoyed the hell out of me. I could have screamed blue murder at the developer but they implemented one hell of a singleplayer mode that makes me think that the game is a worthy purchase even if you never end up playing the fully realized multiplayer game. Yes, I’d love to get a game but  I haven’t had any luck yet. That’s okay because I play on the Australian servers and usually at weird times. I’m certain that I will get into a game at some point. I can try to play on other servers but as is generally the case with region specific servers I fear that the lag would make the game unplayable for me and that I would be at such a disadvantage as to not make the game a particularly enjoyable experience. This is not on the hands of the developers but a simple reality given the quality of Australia’s Internet and the distance data must travel.\n\nThe lobby is one of the best for any online game I have ever seen. I love the fact that there is quite a bit to do in this mode while you wait for other players to come on board unless you want to get straight to the action and play the single player mode which is, I believe, the same as games with real players but where you play against bots so that you can get into games quicker. The bots aren’t just a pathetic challenge either as their AI has been programmed very well. Other players, who I hope to play with at some point, have argued that their AI is much better than a lot of the players that they’ve had actual matches with so I have to give kudos to the devs on a job well done.\n\nThe pixel graphics are fantastic but that was one of the trademarks of King Arthur’s Gold so it is a continuation of what we have come to expect from the devs. I love the choice of music as it really meshes with the gameplay that I have experienced thus far and it makes for a fantastic touch to the lobby.\n\nJust as I was about to quit my session another player came on and we were able to have a game with bots. Thanks to ‘Iron Raccoon’. The game was fun and very similar to the normal bot games but Iron Racoon ended up winning the game and doing very well.\n\nUnfortunately the game currently lacks achievements and trading cards so I hope that they are added in the future.","May 2","true","0.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

In short, it's sort of a Smash Bros. take on 2D arena combat games like... well, like Soldat. Except it's kind of pared down. You have two real game modes: free-for-all and team play, supporting up to 4 and 8 players respectively. The twist is that nobody ever dies; although you score "kills" for walloping the hell out of another player, it's more like a game of tag. If you're "killed" you're reduced to crawling and hopping around at a gimped rate, and can't attack. If you can snag a random medkit, you're back in the game but the healthier players can and will swipe these to keep them from you.\n\nThere are all of two modes available: Free-for-all deathmatch, and team play (4 and 8 players respectively). Free-for-all is simply a series of single-screen arenas that will shuffle when one player is left standing, and the first one to 10 kills wins. Team play features objectives like "reach the other team's end zone" and maybe other stuff I dunno.\n\nWhen starting a game you can pick a class that determines what two things you can do; sniper can disguise as a bush and snipe, demolitions can chuck missiles and set mines disguised as crates, etc. This is all well and good, but... it's where I start to realize that the game is minimalist to a fault.\n\nThere are two bare-bones game modes. The maximum players in any game is either 4 or 8, even online. The arenas are tiny. You have two action buttons per character. Only the winner gets coins to spend in the lobby, on things like booze, coffee, costumes, and pets which only persist in the lobby where you can't really do anything. On top of all this the game's color palette, which while undoubtedly an accurate recreation of an EGA palette or something, hurts my eyes. It's predominantly sickly tones of yellow, brown, and green.\n\nAnd finally, we're about two days out from the Steam launch and the servers are DEAD. As I type this there are no player-hosted servers, and nobody at all on the US server. There was apparently a record of 31 people playing throughout the entire day.\n\nI admire the concept and it's briefly amusing to watch the sprites ragdoll all over the place, but I just don't think it has an ounce of staying power as it is now. It looks like it's maybe still in active development(?), but if that's the case it really should've been listed as Early Access.\n\nPlease just put Soldat on Steam, already.","April 9","false","0.3"," 30 of 53 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","30","53","3","1"

The game is very fast paced, with explosions all over the place, corpses flying across the map, buildings getting blown up, it's very hectic and hilarious to see.\n\nThere are 5 classes available that play quite differently:\n- the assault has an automatic rifle and grenades\n- the demolition has a rocket launcher and C4\n- the commando has a knife, flash grenades, can climb walls and defuse C4\n- the sniper has a sniper and can camouflage\n- the medic, only available in “Run” mode, has a shield, ammo boxes, and can revive his teammates\n\nThere are 2 game modes: Run and Skirmish. Skirmish is self-explanatory, it's 4 players trying to kill each other, the player with the most kills win.\n\nRun is a team vs team mode where the goal is to run to the other end of the map while dodging enemies and killing them. There's a bit of tactic involved : you can try to be sneaky, hiding in a bush or using a flash grenade, or defend a strategical corridor from a window, or be a medic and help your teammates with ammo and health.\n\nOutside of the 2 main modes there's a lobby where players can meet in between matches, chat, play basketball, buy pets and costumes and drink beers.\n\nThere could easily be new modes, maps and even classes created for the game as it's entirely moddable, and you can run your own private servers.\n\nSo this game is awesome, but it has a population problem. There's generally always someone to play with, but the most I've seen online was 6 players and sometimes I have to wait 10 minutes in the lobby for someone to connect. You can still play with bots, they're not too bad, but playing with real people is obviously way more fun. If you're lucky and have irl friends who are into fun games, you could play with them in local multiplayer too (up to 4 players).","April 10","true","15.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seanharrs/recommended/262100/","seanharrs","Seanharrs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seanharrs/","77 products in account","A truly enjoyable game, this. It's actually really quite fun sometimes, with the "no death" rule, because you still get affected by others' attacks in (rather unpredictable) ways, and of course you only need one medkit to get back up and fighting. This can lead to situations such as getting hit by a grenade whilst "downed" that sends you flying off of one side of the map only to appear on the other side (another nice feature) and land on a health crate, conveniently right in range of an enemy. You of course kill said enemy, leading to plenty of laughs from the both of you! Of course, this works so much better when you're playing with friends, but since the community is small right now (few days after launch), you can make friends easily.\n\nOf course there's also the little mentioned feature of getting absoultely WASTED - in game. Get drunk as all hell and then try shooting straight you damn sniper, you, I'll bet you can't fricken do it twice! You might not have much luck with your demolitions missiles, either...\n\nHonestly, my only "issue" is the lack of appeal to the Medic class in Run games. In case you're unaware, Trench Run has the "Skirmish" mode, and the "Run" mode. Skirmish is a 4 player gamemode where you simply shoot the hell out of each other in small, screen-sized maps, it's essentially just a 1v1v1v1 deathmatch, and any class except Medic is available to use. Run, however, is a 10 player gamemode with larger maps, and it's based on cooperation. It's a 5v5 where you either wipe out the other team, or you reach their "spawn" side before they reach yours. The Medic is available here but there's not much appeal to it. Your primary action is blocking with a shield, and your secondary is throwing out ammo to allies, and you passively heal downed allies. Not much fun if you want to blow people up.","April 11","true","5.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Overall I feel this game is pretty disappointing. The core game itself is pretty shallow. There are two game modes. One is FFA, and one is Team Battle mode. The games last on average between 2-5 minutes. This game is very fast-paced. You will spend an equal time waiting between matches as you will playing them.\n\nThe game tries to redeem itself with a lobby area. Here you can buy things with coins (earned from winning games) such as beer, wine, clothes, pets. This part of the game feels pretty tacked on, and is unrelated to the main part of the game. There are not very many people online right now, and filling up games is very difficult. The game seems to be using the exact same engine as KAG, which makes the experience feel more like a cheap reskin than a full new game.\n\nI felt the core game to be pretty uninteresting, and you can see the majority of gameplay in about 20 minutes. This game definitely feels like an Early Access game, and I was suprised it wasn't one. I hope the developers can turn it around, because at the moment I feel that purchasing this game is not worth the price.","April 11","false","2.9"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","6"

The unpredicatable mechanics turn every sniper shot into a cross map scenic flight, grenades into trick shotting basketballs and rockets into ridable objects of mass destruction.\n\nSome people may be put off by the 'aim with wsad or arrow keys' for sniper shots, rockets, grenades, basketballs and flashbangs. It takes a while to get used to it, but once learnt makes the games so much more enjoyable. Heated battles are ensured when a commando is running up behind you, and your sniper aim is pointing the other way. Who will win?\n\nThe fact that you can be blown across the map, into a medic kit and instantly start shooting again adds another dimension. You are no longer the 'spectating, bored, dead kid' when shot. Now you can watch people slash at your crawling, feeble corpse or jump in front of a sniper shot and get flung into a building.\n\nAnd the lobby, don't get me started on the lobby. You can 'booze out' with your friends, buying wine, beer, cigars and even coffee with coins earnt winning games. You can grab a insulting parrot, a fluffy bunny, a crocodile or even a boring old potted cactus or fern at the pet shop, Or why not dress up as your favourite class, a horses butt, a stylish shoot or the rare IM RICH suit. You could also play fetch with a dog, bounce on your croc or try to play fetch with your pet fern. You can also chill with your friends playing basketball, or throw your pet chicken at each other.\n\nThe fact that the matches last for no time at all, allow collecting coins quickly. I spent half an hour to get a pet fern, then a chicken, a horse butt costume then finally an assault class costume.\n\nThe only downside at the moment is the lack of players, but that is due to the fact that it has just been released.\n\nBuy it, you are missing out. Also explosions, many, many explosions.","April 11","true","6.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Can't reccomend a multiplayer game with no multi-players.","May 24","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
