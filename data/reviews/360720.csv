No Steamworks features, it's a quick and sloppy port over from iOS, there's even a iOS Gamecenter button still present. Hell, there's not even any way to exit the game if you're playing in full screen, you need to ALT+Tab out to the desktop and close the window from there. Only four bucks though, and there appears to be about 100 levels of increasing difficulty, so it's hardly the worst deal in the world. I just have a hard time giving a thumbs up to a game you can't even exit from properly.","May 27, 2015","false","0.3"," 72 of 73 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","72","73","0","5"

It starts rather simple, but by the time I got to level 4 I have having a hard time even finishing the levels! And there are 10 stages to complete, so there is still quite a bit of game left. I'm really happy so far, keeps me coming back.","May 22","true","1.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

I thought when I watched the videos that the game might be too easy, how wrong i was. I could play it fine and got through the first couple of levels with no problem. Things quickly ramped up by the time I was a level 5, I was doing everything I could to finish the levels the first time. After a few tries, I was able to get a hang of pattern, and I finished level 6. Still working on finishing, but I'm having a good time trying.","May 26","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
