Pathetic.\n\nThis was a total waste of my $29.99,  I bought it under the pretense of Multiplayer being released first major patch after final release from my Friend who recommended the game.  The Developer has come to the conclusion that by changing the Engine and flushing out his original Idea for a game, that he can now  make ANOTHER game and wants money for it, the full game that he originally wanted to make but couldn't.   This is the result made by a very poor decision long ago to use the wrong Engine <Sunburn> for his project, an engine that Microsoft dropped and everyone in the know knew was a dead-end, months before Zero decided to release the game as Final.  Nothing about the programme changed between final beta release and the first day of Final Release in April.\nThe above mentioned Steam Group is a place for free discussion about Stardrive, and its Developer that You are going to purchase a beta, abandoned game from.  The Developer will finish it on his whim alone, that could be years or decades.  These are all direct from the developer, but sadly I can't direct you to the correct site to see them, he has, or has had his Minions, delete threads full of direct quotes from Zero you simply wouldn't believe if I wrote them here, thinking I was a Troll.  I hope this shows I gave 90+ hours trying to play this game, and never completing 1 game.  Buy this game if you like someone lying to you all the time, some do I suppose.","November 26, 2013","false","90.8"," 887 of 1,004 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","887","1","0","30"

The store page continued to promote features that were never implemented for months after it was clear that they were never going to be added to the game. Making matters worse, the developer has demonstrated extremely bad judgment when interacting with customers that shows a lack of professionalism. This combined with a loyal but rabid fan base make this game a toxic property that is best avoided.","October 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 595 of 665 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","595","665","12","12"

Multiplayer was NEVER added and none of these features we were told would be implemented, made it in to the game. The Developer secretly worked on the second game behind the scenes, using our money to fund his work rather than finishing the first one and then even having the cheek to Kickstart the second game for even more money? Only to then sell this second game back to us again, at full price! Complete rip-off. Now we're left with nothing but a broken demo. I will NOT be buying the second game and funding such a dirty, cheap money making scheme and I'd advise that others do the same.

What's the worst that could happen?  It sucks and you're out a dollar?  Don't be a fool.  Listen to me, I used to be like you...naive.  I paid the dollar, positively gitty at my thrifty yet philanthropic purchase, but I discovered there are far worse fates than not liking the game.  Oh yes, much to my dismay, I learned you could absolutely LOVE the game.  Specifically, I learned that someone, some magical gameweaver of a developer, had somehow discovered a way to craft all of my 4x RTS dreams into one perfect game.\n\nImagine having all this only to find out after hours of gameplay that the mystical Dev had just M. Night Shyamalan'ed your ♥♥♥ by abandoning the game deep in development, leaving gamebreaking glitches unpatched, and giggling all the way to the bank with your hopes and dreams.  Now there will forever be a void in my heart where the finished version of this game should be.  I would've rather spent my dollar on paying someone to kick me in the balls.  At least that paid would go away eventually.\n\nTo be fair, I'm only whining because I love what this game could've been.  Wasting that much potential should be a crime.  The finished, patched version would have been one of the best 4x games of all time.  Unfortunately this game was abandoned to begin development on a sequel that will be turn-based, not real time, and therefore more of a completely different game than a sequel.  While I love turn-based strategy, the RTS version of this game is the one I wanted and now I will never be able to play a polished version of it.  As such, I simply can not recommend it.","December 18, 2014","false","17.5"," 236 of 248 people (95%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","95","236","248","71","0"

The Steam forum is pretty heavily moderated and the developer has a habit of deleting threads and banning people left and right before and during a big sale, so this is where people go to talk about the game however they like and not risk having their threads deleted because they didn't like the game.\n\n***\n\nI bought this game when it was in Early Access and... I thought it was amazing. Full of promises and ideas. Back then, the developper was promising updates pretty much left and right. Multiplayer was to be added to the game. Rare resources, laying mines, better diplomacy, being able to make joint operations with allies; all of these things were to be added to the game... But none -- NONE -- were implemented. The game you can buy right now is very much the same game I bought in Early Access, minus a few bugs. Hell, some core features such as the freighters are still buggy...\n\nSo, that being said, is this a good game? Well, it's an okay game. I spent several hours on it so obviously it's not totally terrible. But the thing is, most of these hours (I'd say two third of them -- yes, that much) was trying mods and messing around waiting for the content update to come. When the Developper announced that he screwed up and decided the game was done and could not be updated anymore because of engine limitations, I stopped playing altogether.\n\nTo make up for it, the owners of StarDrive will get a discount on his next title and access to some kind of multiplayer mini-game is going to be free. The thing is : his next game is going to be a turn-based strategy game. I bought a real-time strategy game. His next game is going to get as close to a MoO2 clone as he can. Good things for the fans, I guess, but that's not what I bought.\n\nSo, to sum things up: this game is half-finished, features are lacking, it lacks polish and is very, very rough around the edges and is developped by one of the worst indy dev ever as far as PR and "I care for my customers" are involved. There are better games out there to spend your money on.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\n***\n\nEdit #1: the multiplayer mini-game has been abandoned as well. Yes, that is yet another fail to put on Zero Sum Games resume. Also, that discount I was talking about? The one the owners of StarDrive will get? That will just be a Steam coupon with an expiration date. Great, eh? Way to tell your customers to hurry it up or screw you, Zero. Way to go indeed.","January 31, 2014","false","83.4"," 242 of 256 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","242","256","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightninground/recommended/220660/","lightninground","A Lightning Round","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightninground/","259 products in account","This game had a ton of potential but was abandoned by the developer for greener pastures after he decided it would be good to start on a sequel while charging full price to everyone (including the people who have bought this unfinished project). It was initially released with a ton of bugs and still has many things that have yet to be fully fleshed out much less finished in any considerable degree. The ship designer and the battles that rarely take place are the only positives to take out of this game.\n\nThe diplomacy part of the game is very shallow indeed. With races declaring war on you with little motivation beyond your empire's progression crossing a line set by their predetermined level of aggressiveness. The same goes with positive interaction. It's very much a game of watching a bar go up or down to get them to do something you want to do.\n\nEmpire building is also shallow and unfinished. There is almost no internal management other than building a shallow level of building sets that make all your colonies resemble one another after only a colony or two. Rebellion takes place when your treasury drops below a certain level and only in this manner. Civilization 2 has more in depth internal management than this title.\n\nMilitary matters are hampered by two things: The lack of any meaningful artificial intelligence and the small tech tree present in the game. The tech tree is the smallest tree I've seen in a 4x game (and smaller than some RTS games like Rise of Nations or even Age of Empires). The AI assembles the same, tired fleet makeup and then throws it at you. This means pretty much every single game plays out the same way regardless of the galaxy size. The one saving grace in enemy behavior is that the game saves your custom ship designs and then uses them against you in subsequent games should you choose another race to play as. I would love to see other 4x games incorporate this feature into their titles so I'm faced with much more difficult fleet makeups since they were designed by myself or other players who post their designs for others to use.\n\nAll in all, I'm very disappointed in not only the way this game turned out, but the developer's behavior on the steam forums once people heard he was abandoning any serious development on the game on an interview. He would ban people who warned others about the state of development and has had meltdowns on multiple gaming forums when confronted about the issue. Do not give your money to this studio. Other 4x's like Galactic Civilizations II or Distant Worlds do this genre much more of a service.","November 25, 2013","false","1.0"," 481 of 549 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","481","549","0","1"

It could have been so good. Unfortunately, many game mechanics are broken and will never get fixed. Trade ships don't work properly which will render your population starving despite having a food surplus.

But it's supposed to be a feature-complete, finished game, right?).\n\nThe game still do not feature alterable gameplay options, leaving you with only the options of adjusting video and audio.\n\nThe game's features such as customizing races are great, and the shipyard ship-designing is really fun - but if it doesn't matter in the slightest, it isn't really that much of a draw, is it?\n\nI don't really think that I can recommend this game as it is at this stage. It has a lot of really cool stuff going for it, but when crucial elements of the game remains broken, that's really just bad.

And given that you have to do through a, by default, hidden folder to reach the saves directory then not everyone is going to know how to manually delete them.\n\nI've wiped my saves folder a few times. The first was after Pre-Warp mode was released. I wiped three gigs of save files. The next was after I decided to start using Tech Level Mod, and I wiped 2 gigs worth of save files. Eventually, I wiped those saves out as well clearing out roughly 3 gigs of space.\n\nI wiped my save folder again recently, hadn't done it for a long time, and got rid of 6.3 gigs worth of saves. Counting all these saves, I had roughly 14.5 gigs worth.\n\nThat's practically the size of a completely new game. And if I didn't know how to reach the saves folder, I'd have never thought about cleaning the folder out because well... how large can something as simple as save files get?\n\nGiven how much space you can eventually rack up in saves, it's rather sad that Stardrive doesn't include a easier way to get rid of them.","October 16, 2014","false","268.4"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","86","103","3","7"

Although you can pause and set the speed to 4x normal (although it would be nice if it could go even faster).\n\nThe UI stinks. You can't control planetary production or spies as a whole, in groups, auto-repeating, etc. It becomes very grindy just setting up production clicking to add, next planet, click to add, next planet, etc. There's way too much of that crap.\n\nThe game crashes in longer games.\n\nThe game doesn't handle too many ships very well. It should really have a unit cap or something but it doesn't and so you can build too many units and mess up your gameplay.\n\nThere's no multiplayer.\n\nThe AI interaction sucks. There's not much you can get the AI to do. You can't really coordinate anything with them. It is a shame since 4x games are fun to play cat and mouse with the npcs and pit them at war with each other.\n\nAlso when you get someone to join your alliance they become part of your race or whatever and they vanish out of existence and you just control all of their units. This also reduces the amount of AI interaction because everyone either joins with someone you don't like or with you and then it's just a 1 v 1.\n\nThere's a lot of other reasons why this game fails. I have to admit...it is a great genre and the real time space fights especially since you get to custom build them (although it's not as good as it could be but that's another issue) are really fun to watch...but in the end, there are just a waterfall of shortcomings that make this game something nobody will remember.\n\nGet it if it is super cheap like a few bucks and you like 4x and RTS.

Ship customisation was nearly as in-depth as Galactic Empires V (less techs/weapons, but firing angles matter) and loads of good ideas were there in the making.

Instead of carefully planning each turn and building each world, you are constantly under the gun to move as fast as possible and blaze through reflexively.  Its a shame because otherwise the style and production of the game is quite high and would have more than carried it for me for a long while.\n\n(Admittedly, I really do not like RTS play to begin with, and my main score reflects coming into the game expecting it to have been a turn based 4x title along genre norms.  The second score applies for people who do prefer the more highly energetic RTS style gameplay over turn based strategy)","September 29, 2014","false","9.3"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","2"

Wow, a real-time 4X game? Sounds great!\n\n...\n\nIt's terrible!\n\nI don't like to have to say this about a game that I put money into, but it has to be said for the good of humanity / the steam community. But why such a harsh approach?\n\n1. The interface lacks any polish. It's bad, everything is hard to manage. You will feel the pain once you are 10 minutes into the match as it becomes impossible to manage anything. There is no good notification system and you will probably neglect something important for a good 5 minutes of the game.\n2. The game isn't finished. Yep, it's broken. There are many bugs left in the game and it is NOT feature complete as it says on the steam page. Yes the game is playable, that does not mean it's done. Many of the features the developer promised never made it into the game, and he is making no effort to fix any of the issues the community has presented. Which brings me to my next point.\n3. The developer has abandoned the game. He has ditched the project and is now working on StarDrive 2, which is basically StarDrive 1 but actually polished. The developer has even gone to the extent to delete all threads which criticize the game. So now everything on the community page looks positive and isn't showing the truth about the game. Luckily he can't delete steam reviews, so I have one last hope to convince you the reader to save your money for a better game.\n4. The game is just over-priced! I mean really. There are so many better games for half the price or even less. It's not even worth the money. Please buy a real game.

It has one of the worst interfaces I've seen in a strategy game which at the very offset of a new game, ruins the entire experience.  Even the tutorial videos aren't done very well as the music eventually overtakes the speaker!  The entire project seems more like an abandonded Frankenstein than a thought-out game.  Additionally, taking a quick tour of the forums tells that the developer is already working on a sequel!?  My advice to the developer is to hire someone who is good with interfaces and the other various front-end facing pieces of the project.

The AI was weak and it very quickly became an AI curbstomp in my first game while still learning the mechanics.  The game is strategically shallow.  There is an obvious need to spam troops.  A good technology tree is essential and this game was distinctly lacking in that respect.  The ground invasion mechanic is very simplistic.\n\nThe ship design is cool.  The combat is okay but I vastly prefer Sins of a Solar Empire.  I didn't really notice any of the bugs and missing features that some people go on about but then for $8 my expectations were low.\n\nThe Developer takes an extremely hard line to Moderation which is often unfair and unreasonable.  I've recently seen a poster banned and all his posts deleted despite the fact not a single forum rule was broken.  Some of my posts have also been deleted despite also never breaking a forum rule.  Unfortunately the Developer is stuck in the habit of shooting himself in the foot with respect to the future of his own community.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions/0/\n\nI really don't understand why some consider the game groundbreaking. I would rate Distant Worlds Universe, Endless Space, Galactic Civilisation 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion all as significantly better games, each in their own way.  You can see the potential but a lot is unrealised.\n\nThere are patches but they are very slow and limited compared to games like Distant Worlds Universe.\n\nThere is hope with the Stardrive Extended Mod and perhaps there will be a vastly improved effort with Stardrive 2.   It's possible I could really get into them so I'll stay involved.\n\nPost Review Note: Along with others I have now been banned and all my posts deleted despite breaking no forum rules.

It feels like the developers tried just a little too hard to differentiate it. "What if we did MoO2 but real time?

I can understand possibly having ship TRAVEL and colonization on the same scale, but combat is vastly, vastly faster.  However, it's still on the same time scale.\n\nThe user interface is abysmal. Tooltips aren't really tips. The user icons aren't extremely desciptive, but can be memorized. It's not explained what some of the icons are. It took a few google searches to figure out that the swirlies next to system or planet names means there's an exploration anomaly. Nothing in the game indicated this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/recommended/220660/","ephewe","ephewe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/","229 products in account","Despite it initially having amazing potential to be a near-flawless modern equivalent of Moo2 (Master of Orion 2 - the quintessential 4x strategy game from the 90s), the developer has effectively ceased meaningful work on this project.\n\nI, like many Steam members, purchased this game during the so-called "beta" stage with the intention of ultimately playing the game in a fully-functional completed state. Unfortunately, this will never happen as the developer (a guy going by the name of "Zero") simply proclaimed the same beta-level product as "final" and proceeded to publicly state that any future progress will be solely at his own personal "whims".\n\nAt the time of this writing (10/10/13), the game is known to be *extremely* buggy with large swaths of functionality crippled or non-existant. Past promises of additional features go unfullfilled (multiplayer, etc.). Further, anyone with the gall to complain about the situation (however civil they may be) on the developer or Steam forums is promptly banned and any associated content is deleted (I know this because I have similarly been banned from the StarDrive Steam forums). NOTE: My specific offense... The action that immediately prompted my banning... was that I noticed that a particular thread which was critical of StarDrive was deleted and so I asked why. I suspect that the aggressive action being taken against anyone who complains is a result of the game currently being on-sale, advertised on the Steam main page as a "daily deal" (Zero surely wouldn't want customers' 100% valid concerns & complaints to negatively affect sales of this very dead project).\n\nCheck the StarDrive forums on Steam for yourself and you will certainly come across content from angry customers who (rightly) feel cheated - that is, if you get to it before said posts are deleted. As I write this, StarDrive is being advertised & sold on Steam's front page. I sincerely pity anyone unfortunate enough to purchase this steaming pile only to inevitably find out how they've been robbed.\n\nWhat's most offensive (aside from the literal theft which is being perpetrated - that is, the game being advertised as beyond beta and fully functional), is the *EXTREME* arrogance displayed by the developer. Observe a snippet from a forum post on the official StarDrive website (before it was deleted):\n\n"Zero: I'll be as clear as I can be... I think StarDrive vanilla is a fine game. I'm happy with it. I'll be patching it here and there as my whims take me. If you feel cheated by StarDrive, kindly scroll up to the upper right portion of your browser screen and click the "Logout" button. I don't want to hear it."\n\nThere you have it, directly from the horse's (Zero's) mouth. The game, in its currently crippled and bug-riddled state will only be worked on if Zero's "whims" allow. Further, if you purchase the game only to find out that it's unplayable in many ways, don't bother complaining because he absolutely does not care (after all, he already has your money).\n\nWould *you* knowingly purchase something from a person or company which displays such a low opinion of the customer's (absolutely valid) concerns? I didn't think so. Neither would I. Do not support this developer. Such behavior in business should absolutely not be rewarded.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!\n\nUpdate (10/11/13): Immediately following the end of the StarDrive front-page sale on Steam, I found myself no longer banned on the forums. While I guess it's a "good" thing that I'm no longer banned, it speaks quite loudly for the theory that the recent aggressive ban-hammer usage was indeed due to the developer not wanting negative forum posts to affect sales (regardless of their validity). In addition, the forums are back to being predominantly full of complaints where as yesterday such threads were being deleted as fast as they could be posted.","October 26, 2013","false","6.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Unless its on Sale, then it may be worth it if you enjoy this type of game. If I we're you however, right now considering buy StarDrive, I would spend my money of Galactic Civilation 3. It's the same game has this, in fact I would say this game is a bad copy of Gal Civ 2 which is a 'banging' game, although not as graphically nice as StarDrive gameplay is so much better. So if you can afford it Gal Civ 3. if you want to save money gal civ 2. Anything but StarDrive.\n\nRight, so I've had a rant but objectively what wrong with the game. Weirdly not alot. It crashes for time to time normally because I'm tabbing out but autosaves stops that from been a big issue, and few minute roll back max is not really anything to get worked up over. The AI is bad, there are times that it seems slow and dumb, not even able to get off the starting planet. Other time as soon as they make contact they declare war and within 5 mins I have two invasion fleets heading to two different systems, this with the first 20mins of the game. I suppose you could agrue a degree of dynamic realism with the AI but it doesn't feel like that it just seems break. Hypo active somethings and hyper active other times never a good balance. The Gameplay is very long but that not really a fault of the game, more the genre. The tech tree is a bit bland as it's a standard tech tree discuss what race you play has.\n\nIn final conclusion; I enjoy playing the game, it has some nice features to it and a good about of variety when it come to ship design and weapons. However the game feels unfinished whenever I play Stardrive I have fun but i'm not satified and its for that reason I can't recommend it.\n\n","January 17, 2015","false","96.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

What's the worst that could happen?  It sucks and you're out a dollar?  Don't be a fool.  Listen to me, I used to be like you...naive.  I paid the dollar, positively gitty at my thrifty yet philanthropic purchase, but I discovered there are far worse fates than not liking the game.  Oh yes, much to my dismay, I learned you could absolutely LOVE the game.  Specifically, I learned that someone, some magical gameweaver of a developer, had somehow discovered a way to craft all of my 4x RTS dreams into one perfect game.\n\nImagine having all this only to find out after hours of gameplay that the mystical Dev had just M. Night Shyamalan'ed your ♥♥♥ by abandoning the game deep in development, leaving gamebreaking glitches unpatched, and giggling all the way to the bank with your hopes and dreams.  Now there will forever be a void in my heart where the finished version of this game should be.  I would've rather spent my dollar on paying someone to kick me in the balls.  At least that paid would go away eventually.\n\nTo be fair, I'm only whining because I love what this game could've been.  Wasting that much potential should be a crime.  The finished, patched version would have been one of the best 4x games of all time.  Unfortunately this game was abandoned to begin development on a sequel that will be turn-based, not real time, and therefore more of a completely different game than a sequel.  While I love turn-based strategy, the RTS version of this game is the one I wanted and now I will never be able to play a polished version of it.  As such, I simply can not recommend it.","December 18, 2014","false","17.5"," 236 of 248 people (95%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","95","236","248","71","0"

The Steam forum is pretty heavily moderated and the developer has a habit of deleting threads and banning people left and right before and during a big sale, so this is where people go to talk about the game however they like and not risk having their threads deleted because they didn't like the game.\n\n***\n\nI bought this game when it was in Early Access and... I thought it was amazing. Full of promises and ideas. Back then, the developper was promising updates pretty much left and right. Multiplayer was to be added to the game. Rare resources, laying mines, better diplomacy, being able to make joint operations with allies; all of these things were to be added to the game... But none -- NONE -- were implemented. The game you can buy right now is very much the same game I bought in Early Access, minus a few bugs. Hell, some core features such as the freighters are still buggy...\n\nSo, that being said, is this a good game? Well, it's an okay game. I spent several hours on it so obviously it's not totally terrible. But the thing is, most of these hours (I'd say two third of them -- yes, that much) was trying mods and messing around waiting for the content update to come. When the Developper announced that he screwed up and decided the game was done and could not be updated anymore because of engine limitations, I stopped playing altogether.\n\nTo make up for it, the owners of StarDrive will get a discount on his next title and access to some kind of multiplayer mini-game is going to be free. The thing is : his next game is going to be a turn-based strategy game. I bought a real-time strategy game. His next game is going to get as close to a MoO2 clone as he can. Good things for the fans, I guess, but that's not what I bought.\n\nSo, to sum things up: this game is half-finished, features are lacking, it lacks polish and is very, very rough around the edges and is developped by one of the worst indy dev ever as far as PR and "I care for my customers" are involved. There are better games out there to spend your money on.\n\nBut hey, that's just my opinion.\n\n***\n\nEdit #1: the multiplayer mini-game has been abandoned as well. Yes, that is yet another fail to put on Zero Sum Games resume. Also, that discount I was talking about? The one the owners of StarDrive will get? That will just be a Steam coupon with an expiration date. Great, eh? Way to tell your customers to hurry it up or screw you, Zero. Way to go indeed.","January 31, 2014","false","83.4"," 242 of 256 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","242","256","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightninground/recommended/220660/","lightninground","A Lightning Round","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightninground/","259 products in account","This game had a ton of potential but was abandoned by the developer for greener pastures after he decided it would be good to start on a sequel while charging full price to everyone (including the people who have bought this unfinished project). It was initially released with a ton of bugs and still has many things that have yet to be fully fleshed out much less finished in any considerable degree. The ship designer and the battles that rarely take place are the only positives to take out of this game.\n\nThe diplomacy part of the game is very shallow indeed. With races declaring war on you with little motivation beyond your empire's progression crossing a line set by their predetermined level of aggressiveness. The same goes with positive interaction. It's very much a game of watching a bar go up or down to get them to do something you want to do.\n\nEmpire building is also shallow and unfinished. There is almost no internal management other than building a shallow level of building sets that make all your colonies resemble one another after only a colony or two. Rebellion takes place when your treasury drops below a certain level and only in this manner. Civilization 2 has more in depth internal management than this title.\n\nMilitary matters are hampered by two things: The lack of any meaningful artificial intelligence and the small tech tree present in the game. The tech tree is the smallest tree I've seen in a 4x game (and smaller than some RTS games like Rise of Nations or even Age of Empires). The AI assembles the same, tired fleet makeup and then throws it at you. This means pretty much every single game plays out the same way regardless of the galaxy size. The one saving grace in enemy behavior is that the game saves your custom ship designs and then uses them against you in subsequent games should you choose another race to play as. I would love to see other 4x games incorporate this feature into their titles so I'm faced with much more difficult fleet makeups since they were designed by myself or other players who post their designs for others to use.\n\nAll in all, I'm very disappointed in not only the way this game turned out, but the developer's behavior on the steam forums once people heard he was abandoning any serious development on the game on an interview. He would ban people who warned others about the state of development and has had meltdowns on multiple gaming forums when confronted about the issue. Do not give your money to this studio. Other 4x's like Galactic Civilizations II or Distant Worlds do this genre much more of a service.","November 25, 2013","false","1.0"," 481 of 549 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","481","549","0","1"

This game is an unfinished product. It is, at best, “glitchy”. It's an “early access” with no chance of being fixed. Apparently, for reasons beyond the developer, he isn't allowed to work on the engine of the game any more, or something.\n\nThis is rather sad because the game needs optimization, badly. The controls and interface of the game aren't adequate. It makes an obtuse game with a steep learning curve even more convoluted. Basic RTS controls, like finding idle workers or rally points aren't implemented. At least one technology in the science tree doesn't work as described. Ships, especially freighters, lack a good path-finding, making them delay deliveries of vital goods, but it happens to offensive fleets too. Trading technologies requires you look up, -or know the cost by heart-, of everything in the science tree or risk the ire of the IA. The planet managing screen lacks clarity and the possibility for quick changes. The ship building interface refuses to show critical information, like the rate of fire, the global ammunition consumption per second or the global energy consumption. While it can be nice to figure out this puzzle, you have to recalculate everything as soon as you improve your design with new technologies. Having to look up the wiki for vital weapon-data is also unforgivable for a game that requires such precision in its main mechanic from the player. Personalising larger ship becomes a tedious chore.\nSpeaking of ship building, while it is nice to modify them depending on your style, it doesn't take into account how the game works as a whole. The IA isn't a big threat later on in the game as much as it is in the beginning, and that can be circumvented as soon as you realise what variable the computer uses for it's moves: the size of your fleet. Just build a big fleet, and you've won. You don't even need to research, or spend hours personalising cruisers. In the end, it is completely pointless, because you will already be winning by the time you get to bigger spacecrafts, making their puzzle-like personalisation moot and time wasting.\nWorse, this system isn't as open as it pretends to be: you cannot build viable ships if you deviate from a certain type of fighter. If you are thinking of building a huge flying fortresses which shoots at everything in all directions, think again: one ship attacks one ship. Sure, the area of effect damage might hit others too, but that's leaving it up to chance, or worse, the IA. The attacks your ships employ are always the same: charge! There is an option to turn on a “broadside” tactic but it doesn't work according to the forums.\nWhen you get right down to it, the changes you make to your ships are quantitative, not qualitative. You decide the weapons and the defences, and how much of each, and then try to figure out the best way to power the whole thing and keep sufficient ammunition. In essence, this more open system is just more complex than the one in Endless Space, replacing the straightforwardness of it with inconvenient and pointless creation tools. Also, Endless Space has more tactics during the combat phases, with three different phases, defining tactics for each, heroes and hero abilities. In Endless Space, the ships are not just flying towards each other like a Middle Age jousting competition.\n\nIt's a shame since Stardrive sounds good on paper. A better IA and path-finding across the board would have gone a long way. An IA that changes tactics depending on difficulty, rather than giving it a boring bonus to resources to compensate for it's inadequacies, would also give a more organic and challenging experience. Being able to annexe other civilizations peacefully by building a federation is great but removes diversity from the game world, by having the player taking control over the planets and fleets of the ally, making end game seem even more without challenge when you suddenly control half the map.\n\nFinally, on a positive note, the aesthetic of the game, the design of the races and the ships, are very pleasing and enjoyable even thought there are basically references to other media (like the Wing Commander series, the mythos of Cthulhu, the Asari from Mass Effect, etc.). The mixture of all the references kind of creates its own style. The rest of the game though needed a lot more polish.","April 1, 2014","false","36.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Here's why:\n\n1) You can discover the entire galaxy with literally your first scout ship with almost no impunity.  No need to develop a drive or anything.\n\n2) You can seemingly spend your time waiting on research building way points that connect virtually everywhere (seemingly no drawbacks or economic penalty for doing this).\n\n3) Economy is ENTIRELY population based.  Expanding your empire's economy relies on you NOT building any actual buildings (at least early).  Maintenance costs on buildings that are designed to increase food, defenses, or production ALL drain more out of your income than actual ships, so it's better to just colonize and send colonists and food to the planets for seemingly forever till they have enough people to grow.  Just a bizarre concept that doesn't feel rational to me, there really is no option to have a small, but robust empire. It's zerg expansion or die.\n\n4) Conquering enemies, likewise, involves nothing more than zerg tactics (i.e. spamming smallers missle ships and troops).  All you have to do is land more troops on the planet than the enemy has and it's soon yours, you can actaully do that by flying right past their defense fleet and zerg landing while a small number of attacks ships keeps their fleet busy.  Very silly strat but works easily.\n\n5) Diplomacy is haywire. People either love you to death regardless of your actions or they want to murder you out right.  Then they simply want to join with you or your enemy, effectively taking the diversity out of the galaxy and matching one big against another big.  Really saps the interest in the game.\n\n6) Ship design is convoluted and seemingly pointless.  You don't know what you need to put and where and there is no manual whatsoever to figure it out.  Simply putting a power source on a ship isn't enough, you need to add wiring that connects the guns or the shields or the bridge to that power source....at the expense of things like armor.  It's like a really terrible game of minesweep to be honest and I like complexity in games, I play 4x games and Paradox games like EU, CK2, and Hearts of Iron....but this ship design leaves me baffled.\n\nAll in all, this just feels like a very incomplete game that could have been much better if things like the economy and diplomacy had been fleshed out.  The battle system is fun to an extent, but it boils down to zerg tactics.  Bring enough cheap to produce missle frigates and focus fire for the win, leave the tactics at home.\n\nI can't recommend this game.","May 5, 2014","false","17.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

A fine product in the making with aspirations for greatness. We, the ones who bought in early in development, had further dreams of playing this complex and (even in early stages) fun game.\n\nThen it started.

And given that you have to do through a, by default, hidden folder to reach the saves directory then not everyone is going to know how to manually delete them.\n\nI've wiped my saves folder a few times. The first was after Pre-Warp mode was released. I wiped three gigs of save files. The next was after I decided to start using Tech Level Mod, and I wiped 2 gigs worth of save files.

This also reduces the amount of AI interaction because everyone either joins with someone you don't like or with you and then it's just a 1 v 1.\n\nThere's a lot of other reasons why this game fails. I have to admit...it is a great genre and the real time space fights especially since you get to custom build them (although it's not as good as it could be but that's another issue) are really fun to watch...but in the end, there are just a waterfall of shortcomings that make this game something nobody will remember.\n\nGet it if it is super cheap like a few bucks and you like 4x and RTS. There aren't many RTS crossed with 4X so it's still nice to play for a bit.\n","August 29, 2015","false","61.7"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","51","55","0","1"

First off your an alpha designer if you look around steam most quality alphas only charge 19.99 for thier games you should charge that for newcomers and half for people who own star drive 1.

At the time, it was a very good looking EA full of potential. Artwork was pretty awesome and in the line of Master of Orion and the 4X real-time game concept was pretty interesting (MOO meets Sins of a Solar Empire?). Ship customisation was nearly as in-depth as Galactic Empires V (less techs/weapons, but firing angles matter) and loads of good ideas were there in the making. UI was a bit awkward, but still functional once you had a grip on it and it did not seem impossible to improve.\n\nNearly 3 years later I decided to see how it evolved. Well, it did not. At all.\n\nI read the negative reviews and I understood why. The dev went to make the sequel Stardrive 2 instead of delivering a good product. Apparently, that sequel is even more ambitious (yet reuse most of the Artwork) but also even more flawed, unpolished and unfinished). Basically he repeated the same pattern.\n\nIt is very sad this Zerosum had 2 golden chickens in his hands and instead of collecting eggs over decades, he chose to break their necks and eat them immediately.

Oh, the disappointment.\n\nIt started great.  Bought this on early access, it had some problems, a couple major ones in fact, but it was close enough that you could see the point of it all, even then, and could see the few hops and leaps it'd take to get the foundations in place and really start cranking out an awesome game.\n\nInstead, what we got were sweet nothings and empty promises from ZeroSum, tales of how we would get X Y and Z features or fixes.  Trade is still broken, warping still doesn't work properly, warp nodes and defensive emplacements are still prohibitively expensive, the AI is still crap and consistently allows itself to get rolled over in stupid and meaningless ways, often outright killing themselves due to what should be only one or two MINOR circumstances regarding their worlds and infrastructure...  No balance, no design, no polish, the damn game isn't even finished.\n\nZeroSum took a game, created a clear image, started tapping serious potential...  And then turned around and flipped their entire customer-base for this game the bird.  Zero literally said he would fix the problems and get the game working...  After saying this, he never even got around to the first major gameplay problem, the broken Freighters...  And then announced StarDrive 2.\n\nDo not buy this game, do not support ZeroSum games, do not support Iceberg Interactive until they drop ZeroSum, because at the very least, ZeroSum Games is nothing more than a shady, cash-grab studio who does not deserve to be called a Games Developer, and Iceberg deserves to same insults and utter lack of respect for as long as they intend on keeping such a disingenuous, malicious individual/studio under their umbrella.\n\nStarDrive is a game to AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","June 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","9"

Wow, a real-time 4X game? Sounds great!\n\n...\n\nIt's terrible!\n\nI don't like to have to say this about a game that I put money into, but it has to be said for the good of humanity / the steam community. But why such a harsh approach?\n\n1. The interface lacks any polish. It's bad, everything is hard to manage. You will feel the pain once you are 10 minutes into the match as it becomes impossible to manage anything. There is no good notification system and you will probably neglect something important for a good 5 minutes of the game.\n2. The game isn't finished. Yep, it's broken. There are many bugs left in the game and it is NOT feature complete as it says on the steam page. Yes the game is playable, that does not mean it's done. Many of the features the developer promised never made it into the game, and he is making no effort to fix any of the issues the community has presented. Which brings me to my next point.\n3. The developer has abandoned the game. He has ditched the project and is now working on StarDrive 2, which is basically StarDrive 1 but actually polished. The developer has even gone to the extent to delete all threads which criticize the game. So now everything on the community page looks positive and isn't showing the truth about the game. Luckily he can't delete steam reviews, so I have one last hope to convince you the reader to save your money for a better game.\n4. The game is just over-priced! I mean really. There are so many better games for half the price or even less. It's not even worth the money. Please buy a real game.

Not because it is terrible as it is, but because I feel like I have been cheated on this one, and paying the dev of this game more money is supporting quitter.\n\nI was promised many improvements, patches and possibly multiplayer after launch. I was suspicious of multiplayer, which did not happen, but neither did the patches and improvements.\n\nThis game outside of the starting menu screen is exactly the same as it is when I bought it when it was new to steam, now that it is "released". When I first time played it and I did succesful empire, my game crashed quite few times when I was too long on planet invasion screen or exited it improperly... is that bug still there? Yes. Back then I even went to trouble of taking the screen shot of the error message and posting it to Stardrive forums in good belief that it´d be fixed, and I went back to that old picture when it happened to me again 3 days ago, and YES! it was same error message, related to ground invasion screen, it is same bug! what a fool I am.\n\nAnd now the dev has ditched this game to make... Surprise surprise, Stardrive 2, with people that made Endless Space. Will I buy that game? Hell No! I will jump on board of Galciv 3 or planetary annihilation, they are most likely out at reasonable price (and reviewed so I know if I should buy them or not) when Stardrive 2 comes out or goes to alpha to beg for money to "finish" it.\n\nDev of this game has lost his credibility to me. He pretty much cheated me 30€ which is ridiculous now that I think I could have bought two or three reasonably priced, well reviewed and recommended indie strategies.\n\nIn the end, if you want decent single-player space RTS, buy this, but if you even little care what kind of business model or people your money is going to, please dont.\n\nBe responsible consumer.","May 21, 2014","false","18.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It was in alpha/beta though and Steam was nice enough to point me at the products webpage, because as handy as steam is they cant list all of a products features on their little webpage (I dont think it had the read more tabs at the time).  Looking at the developers product page and seeing youtube videos of what you are going to purchase is just good consumer behavior so that you know what you are purchasing.   It looked really interesting and offered things such as\n\nMoo2 like but RTS 4x\nMultiplayer\nCreate your own fleet designs\nSpecial Missions in which you assume control of an individual ship instead of a whole side\nA sandbox mode with an engaging storyline.\nNeutral factions like remeneant and pirates\nA variety of random Galaxy events.\n\nShortly after buying in the developer said he was temporarly removing multiplayer to work out the kinks. Of course the sandbox storymode wasnt finished yet but thats ok it was in beta and we saw how it was going to work with researching technologys and contacting a neutral planet and yadda yadda.  And watching the WTF is, along with other videos I knew what to expect with late game latency, so when people bashed on it I spoke up for it, telling people to give it time.  As a one person developer a 1-2 year wait for him to fix things up was acceptable.  Especialy for a game that had already been in development for something like 4 years.  But it was nearly done,  so we should hold on before making judgements.  I made guides, tried to help people out,and gave suggestions.\n\nBut the longer it went on the more sour it got.  A couple weeks out of its -short- Beta when we could no longer get refunds there was a 50% off sale.  A couple months after that we were told Multiplayer would never make it to the game and that maybe in a stardrive 2 we would get it.   Special missions were abandoned all together.  The Galaxy events were restricted to simple planatary shifts for fertility/richness.  The Remenent story-arc was removed (and then later reintroduced in a shoddy manner).  Some of the AI's were just left in a crippeled state.   And then afterall of that there was a Fertility/abundance nerf across all difficultes (that the AI ignores) that you cant disable... Why nerf fertility/abund in a single player game?  A -lot- of players got banned from the message boards for silly things and it was a pretty rage induceing time all around.\n\nBut thats ok I thought,  I decided to give him more time.  He said development would 'slow' while stardrive 2 was in development but we could expect improvements.  I decided to wait for SD2 to get finished before looking back and seeing what has changed.\n\nSo this last week I gave it a try again.  And I have to say i am not very happy with it.  I enjoyed the game more during beta and after 'release' with the late game slowdown then I do now.  Sure some small bugs were fixed with fire arcs and its a little bit smoother.  But several AI's just sit there and let other AI's conquer them with out putting up a fight, several races just refuse diplomacy of any sort (usualy the ones that are conquering other ai's),  and the AI still cheats up the wazzoo building fleets it cant possibly support.  And overall it feels really bad fighting over a 4 population planet with a 1.2 fertility and 1.1 richness because thats the best there is out there.\n\nIn the end the game currently (may 2015) feels unfinished (even more so then during beta), and in need of a good AI patch, a balance patch, a few new galaxy option sliders to combat what was done post release, and maybe a gamemode paid DLC.\n\nI'm gratefull for the 33% discount on SD2 for SD1 owners,  its a nice gesture.  And I really do hope SD2 turns out well, and can compete with other games in the turn based strat genre. But in the end this game also made me deicde to hold off on SD2 until its cheep as dirt.. because no matter how good it looks 'now'  it could be a lot worse in 6 months.   And thats just not something I ever really expected to say about a game.\n\n\nps- yes I know my spelling sucks. Hopefully it wasnt too bad.","May 9, 2015","false","171.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It will never be finished nor its bugs fixed. Some of these bugs are game-breaking and there are many features that are either incomplete (to name but one: game mode. You can choose it when you start a new game, you get to choose only one option, though -_-) or inexistant.\n\nNow to the game itself, it is an ok game that appears to be a rip-off of a lot of games, but the ship designer as well as space battles are genuinely fun. I would almost call the initial ships being crappy a stroke of genius since it gives you a nice challenge to build good ships for each faction and possible tech configurations etcetera, this part is really fun. The automation of building them is ok, and putting them in fleets is very nicely done with the fleets manager.\n\nThe gameplay itself, not so much. You initially start with one planet, and the one whom colonizes the most suitable planets the first is generally the first to win. If your race has improved metabolism that is every planet with 0.8+ fertility. Mind you those planets tend to be rare (10-15% of all colonizable planets I think?), which only makes it worse that you can also choose to make your race cybernetic. Combine that with industrious and improved metabolism and suddenly your requirements have changed to all planets with 0.8+ production instead (assuming 20-25% tax rate). This basically means 75% of all colonizable planets, most of them being uninteresting to other races except the Opteris (cybernetic), mainly for this reason, that race can actually pose a challenge in the hands of the ai.\nGranted, you can research stuff to make all planets viable for colonization or bother with crappy food transportation, but that goes against colonizing fast.\n\nSo combat: by default, you are at peace with every race. If you have troops/fleets in orbit of each of their planets cabable of annihilating them in a few seconds they will not care. If they intercept one spy they are likely to declare war, but with war you get space battles! Still, if you choose the best possible strategy, there will be no space battles: as long as your military strength is higher than your opponents', only the Opteris will ever dare attack you. And even when it is not, half the ai players will generally just seek peaceful relations (pacifist/cunning/honourable ais). There are also planetary battles: capturing planets through troops. Troops cost no maintenance, though, so flooding each of your planets with troops is a sure way to win: the ai will never bomb your planets.\n\nRemember the game-breaking bugs? One of them involves unlimited production! It involves having shipyard, you spend 10 spare production on a ship, get 13 invested, cancel it, and now you have 13 spare! The shipyard effect even stacks with multiple shipyards, so I don't think I need to tell you how horrible it is to leave this bug in the game.\n\nOverall I give this game a 4.0/10\nKicking dumb ai asses does make me feel better, but you are better off with something like Distant Worlds.","March 14, 2015","false","74.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I thought that it was going to keep being developed and completed (like Minecraft was).  What happened was progressed slowed, and now the developer has moved on to the sequel while the original is still a very broken game.  There are "quests" that don't work, the game is unbalanced, and good luck finishing a game that has a larger map than medium.  I am so disappointed because this game was everything I ever wanted in a space 4x.

The AI was weak and it very quickly became an AI curbstomp in my first game while still learning the mechanics.  The game is strategically shallow.  There is an obvious need to spam troops.  A good technology tree is essential and this game was distinctly lacking in that respect.  The ground invasion mechanic is very simplistic.\n\nThe ship design is cool.  The combat is okay but I vastly prefer Sins of a Solar Empire.  I didn't really notice any of the bugs and missing features that some people go on about but then for $8 my expectations were low.\n\nThe Developer takes an extremely hard line to Moderation which is often unfair and unreasonable.  I've recently seen a poster banned and all his posts deleted despite the fact not a single forum rule was broken.  Some of my posts have also been deleted despite also never breaking a forum rule.  Unfortunately the Developer is stuck in the habit of shooting himself in the foot with respect to the future of his own community.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions/0/\n\nI really don't understand why some consider the game groundbreaking. I would rate Distant Worlds Universe, Endless Space, Galactic Civilisation 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion all as significantly better games, each in their own way.  You can see the potential but a lot is unrealised.\n\nThere are patches but they are very slow and limited compared to games like Distant Worlds Universe.\n\nThere is hope with the Stardrive Extended Mod and perhaps there will be a vastly improved effort with Stardrive 2.   It's possible I could really get into them so I'll stay involved.\n\nPost Review Note: Along with others I have now been banned and all my posts deleted despite breaking no forum rules.

Primarily the promise for multiplayer, Other than that area the game was a good spiritual successor to Masters of Orion 2, I won't lie and say it had amazing diplomacy, mainly because it didn't. But I loved the ability to design my ships and it did well on that, It does or did have a collision issue with ships ramming into your ship through armor and shilds and doing internal damage, but to be honest not doing a proper build of your ship is the end cause of the failure.  I would definitely not pay the full price, and I wouldn't belive anything this developer says at this point, but the game was fun by itself, would have been amazing if it actually had multiplayer as promised.\n\nGame devoper says he never promised anything like that however the kickstarter that funded the game said it was a feature in the game. Everything pointed that it would have multiplayer but sadly he has said its not going to happen.\nIts true part of the issue comes from the engine losing support but that is not our fault or responsibility and version two is turn based.

Towards grand-stategy and 4X-Games. They have been my personal guilty pleasure for the longest time. However, even with the enjoyment i get from them. There are examples of the genre that are not exactly the best and unfortunately StarDrive falls to that category.\n\n\nThis is easily explained, the game is dull. Bloody dull...  In all of my 140+ Hours of playing it, i have completed it only thrice.\nAnd every time, the end-game played out the same. Every single time, not counting the time i went all Borg with the Opteris. This is mainly due to design issues with the Tech- political- and AI-systems, they feel unfinished and in many ways they still are. The game still crashes now-and-again and some of the mods that have been made for the game only make it even more unstable. (This just might be only on my end, but its still a noteworthy issue.)\n\nAnd for a game that is aesthetically very similiar to the good old Master of Orion series, the problems only make it worse. Since in its core, the game is broken and even with the patching the developer has done (and if memory serves it was just one guy.) the game is still broken.\n\nAnd i'm really sad about it, since the idea is so good. A spiritual successor to Master of Orion, with better graphics, sound and all the other fluff. StarDrive tries to be that game and in some ways it has succeeded, but the technical and design issues are the things that kill the experience, not to mention the pacing.\n\nIn all, StarDrive is a decent game. Even with all of its obvious problems, it is somewhat enjoyable. But not by much. It gets dull really fast and with the pacing being off, i really doubt that you could squeeze more than few playthroughs out of it. And even the modular ship building system, can only squeeze so much fun out of it.\n\nStarDrive.\n\nI think a C , is the best grade i can settle for. This coming from the game being still mostly incompleted and the modding only helps so much. But to give a yes or no on the recommendation option, i think i still need to put a yes on it. Since Steam has no "neutral"-option in the recommendation thing..\n\nFurthermore, i would not recommend paying full price, buy this when it goes on sale. Since the content isnt there for 30€ (or regional equivelant.).","May 6, 2014","true","146.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It's basically the same exact thing as Star Ruler, only less NPC factions, and you get to somewhat customize your horribly designed ships that aren't even remotely symetrical half the time.  5 hours of playing and I barely managed to get very far at all, and the planet building sucks.  It's just not worth the 75% off that I paid.  I wouldn't buy this for any less than 90% off.  Seriousy, just wow.  I'm gonna go find something different for a while.

It feels like the developers tried just a little too hard to differentiate it. "What if we did MoO2 but real time? TOTALLY AWESOME, AMIRITE?"\n\nThe most glaring problem is that the sense of time scale is normalized. Ships fight in the same time that planets are colonized. I can understand possibly having ship TRAVEL and colonization on the same scale, but combat is vastly, vastly faster.  However, it's still on the same time scale.\n\nThe user interface is abysmal. Tooltips aren't really tips. The user icons aren't extremely desciptive, but can be memorized. It's not explained what some of the icons are. It took a few google searches to figure out that the swirlies next to system or planet names means there's an exploration anomaly. Nothing in the game indicated this. It was my third play attempt that I figured this out.  The tooltip time to show is very long, so I'm waiting 15~30s to figure out what that button does.\n\nShip design is nice, but not my cup of tea. I have no idea what gun is better than another.  There are too many variables to balance.\n\nThis game is definitely not for me. Looking for something that's difficult to learn and master? Perhaps this is for you. To me, this is a nice beta product. Needs s-loads of polish.","November 22, 2014","false","2.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

The game was released fairly quickly - some would say a bit too quickly - and while it did receive several significant patches and updates after release, the post-launch development was not nearly as comprehensive as the community, in my opinion, deserved. As of the writing of this review, ZeroSum Games has already announced that they are making a sequel. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but it seems as though this first game was really little more than a test run designed to iron things out and bilk some folks out of the money that the studio decided they needed to create the 'real' game. I can only hope that this sequel does more to address the issues that StarDrive had and provides a more satisfying 4x experience.\n\nEven at the supposed 'end' of its relatively short development cycle, the game still suffers from a number of glitches and bugs, as well as incomplete or poorly-executed gameplay systems. Ships and fleets often suffer from poor pathfinding and an inability to carry out simple orders. Up until the last update, the few 'random events' that made up the in-game 'storyline' were still incomplete or did not work properly. The lack of any sort of scaleable engine technology or range limitations on your ships pretty much allows any player to scout out the entire map in the blink of an eye, destroying any sense of gradual exploration and leaving you susceptible to zerg rushes from any 'warmonger' races you have the misfortune of rolling up a new game map alongside.\n\nPlanet development, research, and economics are serviceable but pretty bare-bones. The short tech tree is ridiculously easy to blow through with 'standard' pacing, and really needed to be at least 50% larger than what it was; several branches were seriously underdeveloped. Terraforming is almost nonexistent and the greatest variety of planet facilities is in defenses; there are no more than two or three facilities each for farming, industry, and research. The economic system had the potential to be quite intricate with its system of freighters physically transporting goods between planets; however, the limit of only three resources (food, industry, people) and the seeming lack of promised effects from the economic-related techs don't contribute to a realistic economic model and make it hard to afford much infrastructure.\n\nGame setup doesn't provide a lot of options compared to other 4x games (Endless Space, GalCiv 2, and MoO2 - which this game purports to be emulative of - come to mind). Even the largest map size doesn't seem to be quite big enough, particularly given how sparse most star systems are and how many turn out to be crap - which, given the lousy terraforming options, make meaningful expansion of your empire difficult. Locations such as volcanic and ice worlds, gas giants, and asteroid belts, rather than providing additional options, are instead little more than eye candy, contributing nothing of value to the overall game when they could've added whole new dimensions to the tech tree and gameplay.\n\nThe game's seven races are fairly original, for the most part - conforming to the usual tropes, but distinctive in their own ways, though some are considerably more derivative than others. The diplomatic options are good, if not outstanding, and  the responses provided in the course of shooting the breeze with a particular species are amusing, while providing a gist of each race's personality and culture - though there's not a great deal of background information to be gleaned during the course of gameplay. The diplomacy system gives you an idea of how a given species feels about you, but no feedback on what you can do to improve relations. Espionage provides a number of options for stealing or sabotage in a fairly good, time-duration assignment system that relies on hiring spies and advancing them in rank.\n\nI do have to say that the game's ship design system is solid, allowing you to get down into the nitty-gritty of customizing each vessel to the last component. Everything comes down to power; each component has to be within range of a reactor or power conduit or it won't function. Design a ship with too many power-hungry systems but not enough power generators, and systems will shut down once its reserves run dry. Ship-to-ship combat happens in real time on the system maps (a la Sins of a Solar Empire) and hit detection and damage is location-based, with external systems taking damage first before the guts of the ship can be hit.\n\nWhat this means is that ship design must be well thought-out and involves compromise. With only so many slots on a particular hull - and only so many internal and external slots available - you have to strike a balance between power systems, weapons, and defenses. Ships with heavy armor on the outer edges will have less space available for weapons ports; shield generators have limited coverage bubbles and must be positioned to protect the whole ship; reactors are volatile and will cause splash damage to surrounding components if they are destroyed - do you have the space to spare for internal bulkheads, or do you trust your ship's armor and shielding? Each weapon can be given an individual arc, allowing you to construct aggressive, maneuverable, front-heavy gunfighters or well-defended, multi-turreted line warships capable of massive broadsides - or anything in between. All that's needed is a way to lock each weapon in position so it can't be moved - errant clicks while upgrading or changing designs can skew a turret's alignment clear out of whack, which can lead to whole fleets with frakked up aim if you happen to not notice.\n\nStarDrive does have some good points and interesting design features, but overall the game feels incomplete. I could go on about other aspects of the game that suffered from clunky design or thin or incomplete treatments, but the message has been stated - StarDrive is not worth picking up, at least not at this point. Clearly it has been popular enough to warrant a sequel, and hopefully the developer will take the time to get things right in the second game. StarDrive 2 definitely needs a far greater level of depth and sophistication in its gameplay if it wants to stand out from its competition in this fairly crowded field of space empire-building games, and needs to have the glitchy systems and underdeveloped features of its predecessor ironed out in order to deliver a satisfying experience. Hopefully the sequel will prove to be a game that greatly improves on its 'trial run' predecessor and is able to succeed because it is well-designed and provides deep gameplay options - something that the original game has not succeeded in delivering.","March 26, 2014","false","25.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.\n\nAs for the specific issues with the game:\n\nPROS-\n\n1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.\n\n2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.\n\nCONS-\n\n1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.\n\n2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can't do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.\n\n3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.\n\n4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn't appear to have any strategic element either.\n\n5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn't say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their "new" game.\n'nuff said.\n\n\n\nSuch a pity, really.

You can learn all the tricks in mere minutes and there's not much to do after that.\nMost annoying is the tech tree: it is just too shallow and all-visible at start (well, there's something like 1-6 upgrades in 1-3 tech trees in each of five tiers plus one 'hidden' tier). Upgrades are completely evolutional, improving just main characteristic of shield/armor/weapon/etc.\nSpace combat is really nasty too: no matter how much time you spend designing your ships combat result is mostly determined by ability to sustain DPS and hit the target (like a not-so-large pack of cheapest fighters with ammo-less lasers easily destroy something like cruiser). Moreover ships in fleet do not keep formation during combat thus there's no such thing concentrated fire or support ships staying in safe position delivering ammo/repairs to the hot zone.\nAs for diplomacy, well there's none out there. First Civilization had as much diplomatic choices as we have here and it is not the simplicity you want.\n\nTo be honest there's a couple of things that are good: it is ship designer (however you cannot fit your design with latest weapons/armors just developed by your techs, you need to do it manually) and 'turnless' strategic mode, however there're many space strategies which include these pros and doesn't have so much cons.

But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete.

The game looks exactly like Distant Worlds and attempts to play very similar but is a far inferior product and I'd reccomend that game over this any day, on account of it being a complete and enjoyable product, unlike StarDrive.","December 10, 2013","false","14.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

It offers a unique experience and I find myself coming back again and again to play it. That being said I would not reccomend it unless it was on at least a 75% sale as the game is not complete and pretty much never will be because the dev dropped it.\n\nNow you can play the game, isn't broken you can play and finish a scenario but this game was abandonned and a lot of promises that were made were broken by the dev so there is lack of content and after a few games you get the gist of how things will go and the prospect of losing goes out the window even on the hardest difficulty. The Blackbox mod can fix this a bit but overall it's a problem. In addition you will suffer a lot late game due to poor optimisation that even a really powerful system can't power through. I put a lot of time into this game on my 3570k which was overclocked to 4.8Ghz and on the larger universe settings I still had significant slowdowns and juttering which can and will render the zoomed in direct fleet control unplayable. It basically leads to you sending massed fleets into enemy held systems and hoping that the AI can take care of things.\n\nThe best thing to do is the leave the universe size to normal and use the Blackbox mod to limit the number of ships the AI can have because if you don't you will quickly find that the AI will continue to pump out droves of ships and each one will make the game run a bit worse after a certain point. That being said if you have a recent Intel based chip(Sandy or newer) your system should easily be able to handle around around a thousand ships in the universe without significant slowdowns.\n\nProbably my favorite thing about the game is the ship customization. In a word it's friggin cool and it really makes you feel good when your ship you designed is good enough to take on three or four ships of an equivalent class of ship and come out on top. That is I think the thing that really keeps me coming back because I keep finding better and better ways to build my ships and it feels really engaging.\n\nTo wrap up this game had loads of potential but it was let down by poor choices made by the dev in both the way they made the game and how the handled the abandonment of it. It is in no way worth the standard $30 asking price, you can pick it up for the unique experience but only if it's less than $10.","March 8","false","313.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This little planet gives you the start of a quest in a pop up window but then it can never be continued. The planet is now removed which is like taking the only city state in Civ 5 out of the game leaving you with 8 war hungry monsters.\n\nThe game promised multiplayer, Never came.\n\nThere is also options for more then 1 game type but you'll only play one.

HE ABANDONED THIS GAME TO MAKE ANOTHER. Another good reason to not go into early access.

It's buggy and shallow with few saving graces. After 57 hours of gameplay I can say without a doubt it was not worth the $7.50 I paid for it.\n\nI wanted to like this game. It has a lot of things I like but it is too frustrating to play. I spent the first five hours of this game just figuring out how to play, finding a good path up the tech tree, creating an initial build queue and understanding the UI to be decent player. That's was OK because I thought after I had that down things would get better but as time went on it just left me on a plateau and I was no more satisfied than when I first figured out how to play.\n\nThings I did enjoy- fitting your own ships with armor, weapons , subsystems and powergrid. Terraforming an ice planet turns it into an ocean planet. The artifacts are a nice touch and assimilation is very useful but comes too late in the tech tree becasue it is not retroactive.\n\nMy first successful empire was based on the good luck of finding a planet with 5 thought crystals. This gave and immense boost to my research abilities and I was quickly outpacing the computer. So whipped up a good ship design and threw it into production immediately and soon I had a decent size fleet ready to be mobilized on anything and I learned my first combat lesson just as quickly. Projectiles and missiles suck pretty hard in this game and energy beam weapons are way overpowered.\n\nWhy? Projectiles miss quite often and require ammo to use which means less space on your ship for armor/shield/powergrid mods and require resupply unless you have the painfully slow ammo fabricator. Missiles are slow and are easily avoidable if you maneuver your ships away from them and also require ammo. Beam weapons almost never miss (I had a beam weapon miss a few times when I paused the game and gave an order to attack then unpaused and the computer fired all weapons even though I was facing the opposite direction from my target? Still haven't figured that one out.) and require no ammo so making a good beam boat or two pretty much seals victory every time.\nAlso want to touch on the "phased ordinance" tech here as this tech allows for a 50% chance of projectiles penetrating shields. You can unlock it twice so you can get 100% penetration but the first unlock is waaaay to early in the tree and there is only one other tech cheaper to start. It seems this was done to compensate for the low hit ratio of projectiles but it just breaks the game for shield users way early on. Don't even get me started on projectile armor penetration as well.\n\nSo I went back and rebuilt my ships with beams and ventured back out this time to steamroll everything in sight and that was pretty fun. After the initial wave of attacks I had reduced my enemies fleet to just freighters and they never seemed to recover. They never built another fleet of any size comparable to the first and this happened every time in every game I played with every race. You have one good fleet fight with the AI and its GG from them.\n\nAlso found out the hard way to never EVER press escape in the fitting window with the arcs overlay. I thought escape would drop the overlay and put you back to the fitting window while actually it will drop you from the fitting screen entirely without the chance to save your design. I always did the weapon arcs last so I lost a few good designs to an errant key press and I quit the games a few times doing that. The escape key is not consistent in the UI and lead me to believe it was more a "go back" button then a "close window" button.\n\nAnd don't forget completely broken ground combat where if you take over from the AI and move your own guys it will allow your troops to automatically fire on each other as if they were the enemy and you have no way of stopping them until the unit dies!!

The amount that goes on in this game after a while starts to get crazy.\n\nThe concept is simple... zoom in and out with the mouse to view the star systems. The navigation that this game play provides is smooth and allows you to get to which system you need to view. The managing system of seeing all of your empires/planets and being able to allocate production is sophisticated enough but the user interface for it was done simply and made easy to use. Diplomacy can work for or sometimes quickly against you with an opposing empire declaring war. Trade routes, non-aggression pacts, war declaration, and even colony claims can be through diplomacy. Planets come in different varieties such as gas planets, Terran, swamp, barren and a few variants. Be sure to start exploring early and claim good planets, but doing so exposes you to aliens. You will find yourself addicted to this game after a while if you like micro and macro managing planets and a multitude of ships. You are also able to create your own ships (from colony ships to cruisers) and the creation system is a neat one at that. There is also an in game fleet design system that by itself makes the game much more easier to play (and to defend against enemies).\n\nWhy I support this game even though it has a lag issues (sometimes with and without the mod) is there is a community out there trying to improve this game. Moreover and more importantly for me, you are able to control a SINGLE UNIT and tell them what to fire. You can't say exactly which guns to use, but none the less this is the right idea in my mind to create a new genre : RPG meets first person shooters. Literally, any unit that's out there, choose to control. I wish more games did this in the sense. Imagine playing Starcraft and you can control a marine. Your marine that you are controlling dies so you automatically jump to the next one or go back to the RPG screen. This to me is brilliant and perhaps even game changing in the future.\n\nI will have to give it a\n\nRATING : 7.9/10\n\nDue to lag issues and a need for a mod but either than that I recommend it - especially on sale. Just be extremely wary about the lag issue.","December 19, 2014","true","12.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

However, the developer is a bit of an idiot. He has abandoned the game to go on the a sequel. WITHOUT COMPLETEING THE FIRST GAME!!! (but it will have much better land combat, but no more real time space combat :( ) As well some of the promised features never ended up in game, and I would really, really love multiplayer! (which was promised) And finally, the ship design system is awsome and is completely modular so youu can change, edit and completely remake every ship. As a result, I belive you should either try this game for its realatively unique real time space (most other 4x games do this due to preformance problems) or wait for the sequel for a hopefully improved game.\n\nEdit:\nI'm now more optimistic(watched thexpgamer's video on it) about stardrive 2 cause it does have real time combat, but you can only place ships right in front of the enemy and can't get reinforcements in battle. So I might try and mod that in if it isn't that hasn't been done already(pasted directly from my comment, sorry for gramatical issues)","March 5, 2015","true","96.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","5"

I would have liked to see some multiplayer though or even some more fleshed out storyline (the game has a kind of story you can figure out as you play).\n\nThe races you meet have very unique looks, especially the space samuri bears.  The ships look and feel amazing and each one can be totally customized and upgraded with research and the shipyard.  With stardrive 2 coming out soon though I might just hold off buying this one and get the sequel (which should have much more added in).\nAll in all I will be buying the sequel, so that should tell you how much I like this game.","February 26, 2015","true","49.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/recommended/220660/","ephewe","ephewe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephewe/","229 products in account","Despite it initially having amazing potential to be a near-flawless modern equivalent of Moo2 (Master of Orion 2 - the quintessential 4x strategy game from the 90s), the developer has effectively ceased meaningful work on this project.\n\nI, like many Steam members, purchased this game during the so-called "beta" stage with the intention of ultimately playing the game in a fully-functional completed state. Unfortunately, this will never happen as the developer (a guy going by the name of "Zero") simply proclaimed the same beta-level product as "final" and proceeded to publicly state that any future progress will be solely at his own personal "whims".\n\nAt the time of this writing (10/10/13), the game is known to be *extremely* buggy with large swaths of functionality crippled or non-existant. Past promises of additional features go unfullfilled (multiplayer, etc.). Further, anyone with the gall to complain about the situation (however civil they may be) on the developer or Steam forums is promptly banned and any associated content is deleted (I know this because I have similarly been banned from the StarDrive Steam forums). NOTE: My specific offense... The action that immediately prompted my banning... was that I noticed that a particular thread which was critical of StarDrive was deleted and so I asked why. I suspect that the aggressive action being taken against anyone who complains is a result of the game currently being on-sale, advertised on the Steam main page as a "daily deal" (Zero surely wouldn't want customers' 100% valid concerns & complaints to negatively affect sales of this very dead project).\n\nCheck the StarDrive forums on Steam for yourself and you will certainly come across content from angry customers who (rightly) feel cheated - that is, if you get to it before said posts are deleted. As I write this, StarDrive is being advertised & sold on Steam's front page. I sincerely pity anyone unfortunate enough to purchase this steaming pile only to inevitably find out how they've been robbed.\n\nWhat's most offensive (aside from the literal theft which is being perpetrated - that is, the game being advertised as beyond beta and fully functional), is the *EXTREME* arrogance displayed by the developer. Observe a snippet from a forum post on the official StarDrive website (before it was deleted):\n\n"Zero: I'll be as clear as I can be... I think StarDrive vanilla is a fine game. I'm happy with it. I'll be patching it here and there as my whims take me. If you feel cheated by StarDrive, kindly scroll up to the upper right portion of your browser screen and click the "Logout" button. I don't want to hear it."\n\nThere you have it, directly from the horse's (Zero's) mouth. The game, in its currently crippled and bug-riddled state will only be worked on if Zero's "whims" allow. Further, if you purchase the game only to find out that it's unplayable in many ways, don't bother complaining because he absolutely does not care (after all, he already has your money).\n\nWould *you* knowingly purchase something from a person or company which displays such a low opinion of the customer's (absolutely valid) concerns? I didn't think so. Neither would I. Do not support this developer. Such behavior in business should absolutely not be rewarded.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!\n\nUpdate (10/11/13): Immediately following the end of the StarDrive front-page sale on Steam, I found myself no longer banned on the forums. While I guess it's a "good" thing that I'm no longer banned, it speaks quite loudly for the theory that the recent aggressive ban-hammer usage was indeed due to the developer not wanting negative forum posts to affect sales (regardless of their validity). In addition, the forums are back to being predominantly full of complaints where as yesterday such threads were being deleted as fast as they could be posted.","October 26, 2013","false","6.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

A welcome addition to the crew.”\n\nthis says it all nicely but is largely understated. As a whole the management and construction of an empire works quite well but in combination with wonky AI; a civ 5-esque diplomacy screen with reduced options and strange reactions (allies will quickly turn hostile if the wrong trade is proposed); no counterspying option leaves you to get ravaged by enemy spies; many incomplete or just missing features; no multiplayer; and late-game performance issues (I play it on a laptop so it may just be that) the fun factor quickly turns to frustration late in the game.\n\nA lot of features were also just left out, despite being advertised as either implemented or coming soon on the steam store, and will most likely never be implemented as Zero Sum basically dropped everything in development for the game and focused on the production of a sequel, leaving the first game feeling very incomplete\n\nBUT there are many aspects that work quite well:\n\nThe shipyard feature, for example, is amazing. it allows you to arrange unlocked systems on a ship frame so you can create specialized designs (ie resupply, strike, scout, coloyization etc) and allows you to control thier performance levels.\ntoo many systems bogs down the power supply, shields over armor can be a vulnurability and more massive means slower travel. to name a few things.\n\nthe game is visually stunning. you are able to scale the map from a galactic map down to a single star with orbiting planets. the alien races are all fantastically concieved and there are 8 playable races which can be customized to have a number of positive and negative traits upon starting a new game. each race has its own ship designs, and most of them have unique ground units\n\nI really liked that this game was 4x so that The game flows continuously and allows space battles to occur in real time while the construction and research aspects are turn based progressions. i thought this system worked really well, especially since you can increase the time scaling up to 4x (or more, but not on my laptop) and speed up the slow early stages of the game.\n\n\nUnfortunately the features that i liked did not make up for its short comings, for me at least, and it looks like they will be carried through to the sequel along with countless improvements/features that should have been in this game.\n\nVERDICT: this game is not worth $33CAD\nIf this game appeals to you, then I would wait for the sequel\nIf you've read a fair number of reviews and still want to try it, then wait for a sale to drop the price to $5-10 as there are some mods out there that really add a lot to the game and the game is still enjoyable\n\n","December 30, 2014","false","64.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You'd almost certainly enjoy Star Ruler's much simpler scheme, which ends up achieving far more creative possibility, or GalCiv and skip the hour-long battleship design process entirely.\n\nAutomation? Sounds good, but the AI is pretty terrible at minding itself. If you want to get much done, you're forced to take it into your own hands, and deal with the horrid hotkeys, UI, and the rediculous WASD-control of ships, which makes them unavailable for scrolling around the map. You also can't click-drag. You're stuck with arrow keys or zoom-popping like a schizophrenic rabbit. If you want your empire to do its own thing(but also the way you tell it to), play Distant Worlds, because that game has true and almost total automation options that is as capable as the actual enemy AI(which can get rather brutal, unlike stardrive's rather easy bots).\n\nShip combat doesn't even look that good, or play well. If you want something with tactics, go play MOO, and if you want actual cinematic splosion glory, go GalCiv or endless space. Small ships are gross pixel blobs and large ships just tend to look like a bunch of sausages flopping around.\n\nThere is very little customization available other than the standard race min/maxing before a game starts. Want to slog through a massive galaxy of mostly barren worlds? nope. Want a quick fight between factions already up against each other's shoulders? too bad. Square maps that all play the same. Why not any other game I previously listed, some allowing you to play on 3-d barbell, spherical, or perpedicular galactic arrangements while all allow much more map control. Why was this overlooked?\n\nSo even if you actually get used to panning around on the arrow keys like a geriatric, navigate your way through obtuse and uninformative UI, and after spending hours plugging your ship's weapons into power sockets, what do you get? Well, you'll be dealing with micromanagement forever. Yep, like Civ5 lategame, but more like all game. Governors are idiots, and basically anything you want to do you're going to have to pause the game and painstakingly order it out so that fleet doesn't fly apart in transit and make sure you pay attention to your ground forces so they don't sit there for days doing nothing!\n\nYou don't so much play this game as try to bear it. No matter what your tastes, what you really want is something else.","December 12, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I read all the various reviews and comments, and delayed purchasing it as a result.  I eventually picked it up in a "Humble Bundle."  Frankly, it is one of the better 4X games I've played.\n\nPros:\n\n17hrs in, I've experienced no bugs, crashes or artifacts.\n\nGraphics and music are both moody and appropriate.\n\nColony development is easy, and very Galactic Civilization-like.  It isn't difficult to stay on the "plus" side of the economy.\n\nCombat is is satisfying, both visually and tactically.  You can see which weapons are most effective, and you soon realize combat requires a combined-arms mix of ship types for success.\n\nUnlike Distant Worlds, the AI requires some hand-holding: the game does not play itself.\n\nCons:\n\nLack of information: you are not informed when a ship is in combat, so your scout ships just disappear without warning.\n\nThe tutorials are insufficient to get you started.  There is now a UK manual on Steam, but I had to refer to the user guides on the Steam website before I felt reasonably confident with the game.\n\nShip design is clumsy: you MUST fill every slot on the design matrix, even if your ship would be functional without the extra equipment.  Also, I miss an "UNDO" feature on the design screen.  If a creation isn't working out, you must either change it slot-by-slot, or delete it completely.\n\nAll of my comments are effectively moot: Star Drive 2 is less than a week away from release, so this game will see no further development or polishing.\n\nBottom line: I've gotten much more than my money's worth for this title (which was less than $1 in the Humble Bundle), and my purchasing it gives me a significant discount on the new game (SD2).  I recommend Star Drive to anyone interested in 4X games, particulaly if you can purchase it at the fire-sale prices on Humble Bundle or Bundle Stars.","April 5, 2015","true","33.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I missed the Kickstarter for this game but got it as soon as it was available. The game met every expectation I had for it and has been a huge time sink. The ways ships are designed is one of the best systems I have seen implemented in a game and one I wish other studios would adopt.\n\nNow I did not have many of the problems mentioned by most reviewers so I may have been lucky in that regard. The few crashes I did have were after marathon sessions of 12+ hours of playing. Over the years I tend to encounter very few bugs or other issues in games so I may just be very lucky.\n\nSome of the mechanics weren't well explained but a little trial and error would produce the answer. In my experience if no explanation or trial and error is needed to figure out how a game works then the game has been dumbed down and will offer very little.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the developer not finishing the game and other issues but it ended up being exactly what I expected it to be. Personally, I got my money's worth of entertainment from this game and then some.

There's not much point researching ships bigger than frigates - all you need are some ships to keep the enemy's ridiculously weak fighter fleets at bay while you infantry rush them.\n\n"Not finished", as others have said, in the sense that the whole game feels very shallow, but it's not buggy enough to really be considered a beta either - I'd call it a finished product, though it's not a great one. Not a bad game in some ways, but very little replay and not worth $30.\n\nYeah, I know I have like 170 hours on this despite saying very little replay. To be frank, I don't usually complete my 4X games because I get frustrated with the late game grindy-ness, and thusly, I did get quite a bit of time on Stardrive, which does certain parts of the mid-game reasonably well. Besides that, I bet at least 100 of those hours was spent designing ships, which is probably the best designed aspect of the game.\n\nBut unfortunately, that is the big issue with the game as well - designing ships, the most interesting part of the game, is not really actually all that important in terms of gameplay. You can certainly min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your transport ships, and design ultra-badass capital ships with hangers (which don't work, by the way) and plague bombs (because you can't blow up planets) and death rays, but in the end it doesn't really matter because you are really only going to build a bunch of frigates armed with super-missiles to crush the pathetic enemy fleet while you infantry rush him. Did I mention you can't blow up planets?\n\nIt sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a specific tactic that works too well, and that someone with my hours is probably just good at the game. What I'm really trying to do here is save you money - this is not the easiest way to win the game, it's how you play the game, period. If you don't do it, the ultra-slow AI will eventually do it to you after several hours of ingame time, or at least try to. I personally used that time to build up a giant empire and a fleet of death ships that squished his little army without me having to do much of anything. Then quit and restarted because I realized that, nope, that was it, and now I'd have to spend two hours invading defenseless planets after I stocked up on cans of SPAM.\n\nNot that you need an empire. You can easily ♥♥♥♥ everyone's day up with 10 planets if you are smart about what you build and research. Hint: Build and research everything, because the AI is slow as a turtle in concrete and will still be using popguns while you rock rocket launchers. There's also only a dozen or so things to build, and everyone has the same research trees, so you don't really need to prioritize well.\n\nAll of this is somewhat redeemed by the multiplayer mode, though. Because humans are not slow as ♥♥♥♥, you actually need to play the game in a fashion that bears some semblance to strategy. Infantry spamming is still the only tactic, but you now do need a proper navy in order to get your troops to the ground. The community is vibrant and great, and you'll find that the people you play against generally are good folks who want to play the game rather than use these kinds of tactics however.\n\nOh, right. :p","May 28, 2014","false","175.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It's got some interesting races, sure, some humor as well, a decent amount of exploration, but at nearly every turn you run into something that just seems... unfinished. Ship classes? Not all implemented for all races yet, so some people get titans, some don't. Follow up an ancient mystery? Your reward is... fighting a giant ship. More than once, if you'd like. First contact? Never mind, that's been cut. Endings? Blow up everyone you're not allied to, that's the only way to win last I checked. The end-game optimization was also lacking, causing the game to choke horribly during battles.\n\nIn short? If you want a great 4X game, buy something like Master of Orion 2 off GoG. It'll be cheaper AND provide more fun than this game, in its current state.","December 31, 2013","false","11.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Most of those are upset that the developer apparently stopped working on this game before it was complete to start on the sequel. Some because the game is -- indeed -- in an unfinished state in some places. (The tech tree is incomplete, and the story-line is most definitely so: it stops advancing barely after it starts!) The game obviously has flaws.\n\nWith that said, I really like the game. Great atmosphere and animation, the shipbuilding is detailed and the combat is fun, the rest is adequate at worst. I was also hoping that the game would be finished, but -- if you like 4x games and the game is on-sale -- I'd definitely recommend the game.","December 18, 2015","true","24.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Initially I kept getting crushed every game, leading me to concur with negative review posse. However, after giving StarDrive a chance,I feel like it will depend on the individuals 4x gaming expectation. Although there are some issues, StartDrive is a little more nuanced in some areas than others have indicated,for instance, you can join or form alliances, develope a spy network to gain tactical advantage by stealing tech or by sabotaging rival civs covertly. Designing ship loadouts is cool cause it lets you upgrade your fleets tactical capabilities as needed to expand your empire,strengthen alliances and crush the opposition. I enjoyed using covert methods to aquire, or to sabotage a rival civ .I found that SD offers an unpredictable, quirky style that might change whats expected in a 4x space title. In summary SD marries an asymetrical  universe with challenging 4x game play, Stardrive marches to its own drummer  with some in game quirks, but I its worth the price of admission. By the way, the Black Box Mod expands player options and reduces a lot of the the unwanted quirks.

I have to say I have had more fun it would seem than other when playing this game, however, most of the things I see them point out are valid, in that, the game is fairly bad for being a 4x game. Other games like Galactic Civilization and Sins of a Solar Empire I feel better fit and are better overall in tech research, interface, interaction, combat options, etc. However, that doesn't mean I dislike the game overall but if you are looking for a good space strategy I would personally look else where because there are better. I will lastly add that the thing I was most aggervated at was the teraforming as I normally enjoy them but it is just bad as it could take me and hour to get two or three squares open for industry and agriculture and it was a late game thing when, in my opinion, the pace of the game should have made it early to mid game. My favorite thing was the races and how they were designed not really a game thing I know (and I dont mean the A.I.) but i like the concept of them especially the bear and the race with the owl slaves as you can assist the owls in revolting.

I should have known better than to purchase a game without reading the reviews. As stated by the reviews, the game was unplayable due to excessive bugs and lag when first downloaded. However, one thing that I have found very strange about this game is that the more you play it and the more you explore, the less likely bugs are to occur (kindof like the exact opposite of Minecraft). IDK if this happens on everyone's computer or if it is just a wierd quirk of mine, and I have no idea how this could happen in terms of programming, but for about the last hour of playtime (about at 10ish hrs.), I have never seen any lag or not registering clicks to the degree that I first experienced it in the game. I still have some pretty significant trouble with the game not registering my mouse clicks, but it has become at least playable, and the problem is now only a minor annoyance, unlike the total hairpulling frustration upon first download. Sometimes, due to lag, it still registers that I clicked on something that I moused over earlier, rather than what I actually have my mouse over at the time of the click. I wonder if a similar phenomenon caused the programmer(s) to think that the bugs were fixed when they were unable to reproduce reported bugs.\n\nIf you have the patience for the bugs, the game itself isn't too bad. The ability to adjust your species for tactical, RP, or mixed  gameplay allows you to play a species according to your own interpretation of how they are or what they could be. I prefer a much more strategic and magical Vulfen to the brutish, early-game swarmers version that they are set to by default (retaining their militaristic tendancies, because IMO Vulfen aren't really Vulfen if they are too peaceful, but upon player preferance this could be changed too). It does have a fairly Star Trek/Babylon 5 type feel, which I very much appreciate. Diplomacy is critical, and there is a high degree of intrigue involved (though taking the few abilities and technologies for intrigue that exist will make it very simple, as max rank agents can pretty much do as they please at this point, only occasionally getting discovered or even foiled but not killed). Players should keep in mind, however, that there are few guides to this game, and the videos that are out there regarding this game often do not involve enough information to really give you the feel for things. With no tutorials missions, you will likely be completely lost in the beginning, even with deep research. For this reason, I would advise setting up your first species to give you a large margin for error. Additionally, I found race customization to be very confusing initially, but once you get it, it is very straightforward.\n\nI have come to enjoy the game in time, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game for its current price. It is simply too high.","February 16, 2014","false","39.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

It is already well polished for an Early Access game and I daresay is better that some AAA titles that have been released in their final stages.\n\nThe races are varied and interesting on it's own and it even allows you to customize them to suit your own needs while still remaining in a somewhat balanced state.\n\nThe ship building is easy and fun, if I had one critique though, I wish there was a way to test my builds before seeing them utterly fail in battle because I didn't know how a module will react. That said, as it is now is plenty good enough to enjoy the game.\n\nPros:\n- Playable and polished even in early stages, loads of fun to be had\n- Races are a joy to behold as they are varied and rather humorous in their depiction\n- Easy to learn, difficult to master makes this something even a newbie in the genre can pick up.\n\nCons: *but this could change*\n- Currently, ship building doesn't have a way to test builds so guides might be necessary there\n- Increasing tax doesn't seem to have any negative impact at the moment or no value for measurement (ex: colonist morale)\n- Enemy ships don't display their insignia so it could take some practice to know who's fleet is whose in game.","March 17, 2014","true","97.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So lets begin.\n\nWhile the game isn't buggy or unpolished by any means, it's because of the majority of it's design is absolutley awful, not to say everything is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, just most of it. Like the music, a fundamental part of any strategy game whether it's Master Of Orion or Civilization, the music is there to make you feel like a commander of a thousand fleets or a cultured world leader, and in both of the games mentioned the game does a great job doing that. But in StarDrive it's... uhhh... ♥♥♥♥. The music sucks ♥♥♥, It's a bunch of dreary melodies with a few space feeling instrumentals but all of them lack any sense of excitment. And that's the main problem, this game lacks excitment... or fun... or a reason to exist.\n\nI like ProJared's description of the game in his One Minute Review of the game. Hopefully ProJared doesn't mind that I'm gonna quote him.\n\n"It's like they took Master Of Orion 2 and made it realtime and then SUCKED all the fun right out of it."\n\nThat sentence alone can describe the whole game. Really, I could've stopped over a paragraph ago because that perfectly describes this game. And did I mention how this game is as slow as a snail in molases in a slow motion field? Even on the highest speed setting before you start, everything goes so SLOOOOWWWWW that you get bored after five minutes, even with the slightly cool shipyard (I say slightly cool because the best ship designs are the presets so you'll never need to use the shipyard) and the very amusing races. The game is so drab that it counteracts the good, and the game IS UNFORGIVABLY UNFAIR, meaning even on the easiest difficulty the A.I will CRUSH YOU UNDER THEIR BOOTS OF UNBEARABLE CRUELTY AND DELERIUM.\n\nLong story short, don't buy this overpriced crap, buy Endless Space, or hell, If your feeling nostalgic go on GOG.com and pick up Master Of Orion 1+2 for £5 or less.

The AI can be overly aggressive, but it draws a good balance between races which attack weaker prey, races who declare war because they see you as a threat, and races who could be peaceful allies (on conquerable foes, depending on your gaming style.)\n\nI'd like to see some small additions, like the ability to save custom race settings and either have them in a droplist or loadable from a file like they already have for custom ship designs.\n\nI really enjoy StarDrive.

Also colony managment can get tedious if you have a lot of them . So yes the game does have some flaws but imho its a good game also nice graphics ans sounds make it immersive -> im a great fan of this genre so i love it ;) but some ppl might not like it -> due to tediousness or relatively slow dynamic at first.

The ability to design each ship piece by piece and then set their AI. Want a large slow ship with all weapons pointing forward to hammer other large ships? What about making it lighter and pointing all the weapons to the sides and have it strafe through destroying smaller ships? Swap out those weapons for fighter bays and launch swarms of fighter ships. Don't like cannons? Switch out to missiles or lasers. Load it with emp weapons to disable other ships or tractor beams to bring fast ships to a halt and rip them apart with cannon fire.\n\nEach race oozes with their own personality. From samuri space bears to mechanical hive mind of the Opertis.\n\nBuild a grand empire of planets. Forge treaties and even a federation with long time allies.

Is it the complete experience you've long for? Unfortunately, no, probably not.  However, a good selection of features, and the module layout based ship creator, allow for some classic MoO style fun and enjoyment.\n\nThe original launch of the game in early access had some issues from what I've read, but StarDrive was one of those games on my "To Play" list for almost a year before finally coming around to it after the latest patch (1.15 of this writing).  The core gameplay is there, but a tech tree that's lacking much depth is probably the most glaring flaw I've experienced in my playthroughs.\n\nThis lack, thankfully, can be remedied with a mod which adds much more MoO-like tech tree into the game.  The current non-mod tech layout allows for a very balanced approach that was likely intended for multiplayer(which as of yet hasn't surfaced), with early ship designs still being marginally useful against even high tech ships late in the game.  For fans of MoO2 and it's tech singularity that often happened late game (Psilons, anyone?), this is a mixed blessing.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the ship creator is the main feature of the game, and the one I've had the most enjoyment from.  Going in blind, you'll come up with design iteration after iteration, and love each one as much as the one before.  Every module has a certain length and width that you try and shoehorn into the various ship hulls, with each race having a specific design.  There's generally an overall "feel" for each race's ships (such as long, relatively narrow hulls that allow for greater head on armor layouts for Terrans, or a greater number of possible weaponry on Kulrathi), and even the actual shape of the ship's hull can have very drastic effect when combat comes to your fleets.\n\nThere is a slew of ease of use features in the game which makes play more friendly on the UI front.  Unfortunately, a lack of any decent game provided documentation makes some of these a complete secret until they're stumbled upon and discovered.  Definately do some searching for UI tips and tricks for this one.\n\nThe tougher AI levels allows for some challenge, but expect the game to be a fairly easy breeze until you design some better ships for the AI to utilize.  The game has some of the spark of MoO, but it's not a drop-in replacement for it.\n\nOverall, I'm in love with StarDrive for what it is, not what it was promised or wished to be.  At it's core, it's engaging and enjoyable.  Hopefully the next offering from Zero Sum will be full spiritual successor that we long for, but this one is better than most MoO clones that pop up now and again.","February 25, 2014","true","40.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

It was buggy, incomplete, and, as a result, it entirely deserved the low scores it received.\n\nSince release, however, the developers have worked hard to plug the holes and fill the gaps. The game is now, especially on sale, one that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.\n\nThe strongest differentiator that sets StarDrive apart from competitors is the ship design. While some games allow you to choose your ship's weapons or shields, in StarDrive you build a ship from an empty hull to a bristling space cruiser. You select exactly where you want bulkheads, power plants, command centers, weapon banks, and sheild generators to be placed. As the research tree fills in, you'll open up even more opportunities to build new, larger hulls or moditfy your existing blueprints.\n\nAnother area I enjoyed in StarDrive was the factions. Each faction is extremely unique in design and carries with it a lot of flavor. Whether your negotiating with the honorable but militant pandas or the robotic faction that's enslaved a race of owls - you'll find interactions to be a lot more interesting than the sterile diplomacy of many other games in this genre.\n\nIn the end, StarDrive is exactly what it sets out to be: a 4x Space Strategy game with a robust ship builder and real time combat. If that sounds like it's up your alley, then I think you won't be dissapointed.","July 15, 2013","true","21.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

Where do I start with you? You're the most promising space-themed Strategy game I've played, and that's both good and bad. You can be challenging at times, and despite having the re-playability of a 10 year-old's view of Peace and War, terrible, the fact that you are updated once every now and then has me sitting in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering, "What will be next?" This game has far to go before reaching the elite status, but the steps it must take are simple things to add. This game has one play mode, Sandbox, in which starting out, you have one planet and a few spaceships, and you must find a way to colonize beneficial planets on the road to galactic empire. Other alien species will be right next door, and your actions can (possibly) decide whether or not war will ensue. There is a full tech tree and a very simple, yet important management system that you, as leader, must lead. Sweet and ultimate victory will not be achieved until every species you meet is either your friend (boring) or completely eradicated to the point of extinction (yay). If you decide to be an Adolf Hitler, you can with the ability to bombard any planet's (and I mean ANY) surface with nuclear weapons and murder every last thing that resided there. Did I mention there is also a full ship constructor as well? You can create your own vision of whatever the Super Star Destroyer was in Episode VI of Star Wars during the two minutes it was on screen, and giant, flying pieces of metal with a million death rays are always fun. But this game is SOOOO repetitive! Every game you start up will have the same sequence of events happen, and no matter what you do, they always seem to take place. There's no multiplayer(Note to creator of StarDrive: Make this happen!), and even with mod support, what is in the game to be modded will take a LOT of creativity to make something out of. This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but in order for a consumer to get his/her money's worth PLEASE wait for a sale(like me).

Ship designing:\nThis is excellent; module positioning really matters in combat. If you fill the interior with lots of reactors, they'll blow up when destroyed and will probably destroy your ship from the inside out.\nShields are not 'all around' your ship but instead only protect areas they're near to, so don't forget to place lots of armour to soak up the hits that get through.\nThere really aren't enough ship hulls and modules; each empire only gets 1 hull for each hull type (i.e. frigate, cruiser, battleship, titan etc.). Reactors never get an upgrade. Sub-light maneuvering speeds are much too low.\n\n2. AI:\nThe AI for the other players is poor - they don't expand very much and they have a tendency to get angry about every single system you colonise. They are very, very bad at fighting and will only cause you trouble if you ignore your military for the entire game (which they'll also taunt you for doing). Their art however is really nice and each empire has its own set of ship types.\nThere's a nice automation dialogue that lets you automate the building and usage of scouts, freighters, and subspace projectors.\n\n3. Research:\nResearch feels a little slow for me. The tech tree is pretty sparse and could use some more mid/end-tier stuff.\nThere are two (maybe three?) 'discovered' secret techs which appear according to what you do in the game. This is something the developer never got around to adding more of, which is a real shame.\n\n4. Early Access 'dev didn't implement X':\nI hear this a lot, and it seems to make up most of the reviews here. This game does feel like the dev gave up when it was 80% finished. I didn't buy this game in Early Access (Humble Bundle had it for $4) so if you're not sure, buy this on sale.","December 20, 2014","true","33.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

But you can built a empire!\n\n\nShip design is for me the heart of the game, ship hulls are different for different civilizations. The fun part is how you use different components into the ship design to beat the other civilizations. since they have access to the same tech research as you. seeing your superior designs destroy them!! LIke a fleet of meat into your meatgrinder!\n\nFor example my favorite is the Kulrathi aka bearmen their ships might not be the fastest(not too many engine slots, you can put in different type of engines into that slot). but their fighter are the largest in the game. I love putting in fighter bays(they spawn fighters(free fighters)) into all my Titan ships(they are the largest hull type every civilization gets, each civilization has different sizes and shapes of that hull). I love putting in remnant shields onto the fighters and tons of weapons and no wrapdrive only thrust. They can be respawn from the carrier. Park the carrier slightly farther away from the fighting. wave after wave of fighters just destroy anything in their path.\n\nWith many patches later they fix the Remnant quest.

I am a fan of this game but there could be a lot more to it seeing how old it is. However for the time, effort, and abilities of Zerosum Games it is a good game. There are ups and downs to the game. (A lot of downs)\nThere are a few bad things about the game though. First there are some lag issues and stability problems. The game lags a bit when a lot of action is going on in a large galaxy. Second is mods. The whole game relies on mods at this stage to keep players interested and the game has a open mod folder to simply load one into. The website even comes with a tutorial on how to mod the game. Third is you have to be very meticulous to see what is going on when and where.\nThe game focuses more on combat than economy or events. The game has events but none have any significance or really game changing results whether that'd be good or bad. Events have changed over the year this game has officialy been out, that means a few events were removed, others added or tweeked. Economy is good but needs more to it as well. The game has two resources, food and production. Food is used to feed your race and production is used from building structures to ships. Other than that it doesnt get any more complicated. The only tricky thing about economies is taxing and distributing resources.\nCombat offers a lot to the game seeing how that is the soul focus of gameplay. Ships can be custom designed with a traditional grid pattern and using moduels to fill them in. The possibilities are practicaly endless when it comes to combat.\nDev did abandon the game unfortunatly. After the full game came out updates have become rare. The game has absolutely no purpose but sort of sandbox game letting you do as you please. The only downside to that is there is no story to the game, no story or big explanation about the mysterious "Remnant" race. All we get as far as story to any AI alien race is a short three sentence paragraph FROM the AI. And all we get for story behind the "remnant" is a short mini event quest that, when summed up, gives literaly a short two paragraph explanation on them.\nThe game feels very open and at times too open. There needs to be more content before this becomes a real game because at this stage it does seem like a very high quality app than a full game.","April 27, 2014","true","143.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

During skirmishes with opponents a player can take direct control of any unit subordinate to it, which greatly enlivens the battle. The creators also took care of the possibility of customization of weapons and equipment of each spacecraft. With the appropriate modules, each of the spacecraft can be adapted to specific tasks (for example,. Putting mines, shielding other units, transportation of raw materials).\nThe game is distinguished by aesthetic visuals.

The one downfal is how essential your starting placement is.  Dont have enough early colony's available with some expansion planets in them you will have a severe disadvantage moving forward.  That said, the long game is just that, long.  Expect to dedicate time to keeping your fleet up to date and include it in your stratagey.  Multiple smaller fleets are the way to push ahead so one can be out expanding your empire while another is defending it while another is being refit.  All in all I do say a 60% is a deserving score, and not bad for a first game out.  While there are better 4X games out there, I dont feel I got shorted on what I payed.  Put more than enough hours in to justify the money.  Its a shame that he has to scrap the whole game to change direction, but making the move to turn based in the sequil will play better with the modular ship design.","September 14, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Okay first off I won't lie. I was worried about putting down 30 bucks for this game when I first came across it, even though I LOVE 4x space games. It's Metascore  is only a 61, but came across it during the Summer Sale and it was as low as 10 bucks.\nSo I went ahead and bought it.  LOVING IT!!!  It's how I wish Sins of a Solar Empire had played. Love everything about it. From building my own ships, to the races you can use, to how the map is random each and everytime.\n\nI've heard it tends to crash on people, but I haven't had this happen yet. Are there bugs in the game? Sure. IS the dev working on them? Yes he is. Slowly but surely.\n\nIt's worth the 30 bucks, plus it give money to the guy who deserves it!\n\nMy score for this one is 8/10\n\nUpdate:\n\nMy rating above still stands for the version of the game I bought and played abck then. I believe it was patch number 1.13. I could be wrong. But after the next patch to follow which brought to the game the pre-warp idea. The way "ALL" ships would fly around changed.\nI'm pretty sure it was suppose to be just fighters that got this change, but in the end even Cap ships would fly around acting like fighters. Kind of funny watching them do big ♥♥♥ U-turns and wide ♥♥♥ swings (going way off the screen and turning around to hend back into the fight.)\nI and a few others posted about this problem along with how it seems the weapons on your ships would all fire at the same time in all directions and missing just about every shot.\n\nSo mt score stands the same for the older version I bought and played. The new one I give a 2 out of ten, as this one thing throws my whole game out of the window for me.\n\nMaybe in another 4 or so months I'll give this another try and see if it was ever fixed.\nBut seeing the Dev has stated that it was done and he was happy where it was and off to work on another game with a new engine based on SD....Yeah.

Unless its on Sale, then it may be worth it if you enjoy this type of game. If I we're you however, right now considering buy StarDrive, I would spend my money of Galactic Civilation 3. It's the same game has this, in fact I would say this game is a bad copy of Gal Civ 2 which is a 'banging' game, although not as graphically nice as StarDrive gameplay is so much better. So if you can afford it Gal Civ 3. if you want to save money gal civ 2. Anything but StarDrive.\n\nRight, so I've had a rant but objectively what wrong with the game. Weirdly not alot. It crashes for time to time normally because I'm tabbing out but autosaves stops that from been a big issue, and few minute roll back max is not really anything to get worked up over. The AI is bad, there are times that it seems slow and dumb, not even able to get off the starting planet. Other time as soon as they make contact they declare war and within 5 mins I have two invasion fleets heading to two different systems, this with the first 20mins of the game. I suppose you could agrue a degree of dynamic realism with the AI but it doesn't feel like that it just seems break. Hypo active somethings and hyper active other times never a good balance. The Gameplay is very long but that not really a fault of the game, more the genre. The tech tree is a bit bland as it's a standard tech tree discuss what race you play has.\n\nIn final conclusion; I enjoy playing the game, it has some nice features to it and a good about of variety when it come to ship design and weapons. However the game feels unfinished whenever I play Stardrive I have fun but i'm not satified and its for that reason I can't recommend it.\n\n","January 17, 2015","false","96.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

THE most fun thing to is obviously the ship design. In my experience, you can take the basic frieght ship from the start of the game, outfit it with nuclear reactors, and then crash them into the enemy. You can create ships, that spew out dozens of tiny fighter drones. You can create ships bristling with poisonous spores, and then bombard your helpless enemies ground forces. You can assume direct control over titan ships, driving them like Jesse Pinkman in the Need for Speed movie. You can launch an armada of mobile space marines that can board and control enemy ships. I could keep going for a long time.\n\nEvery piece of this game isn't just a statistic that somehow affects the game. If you research something, you will be able to see it, and use it. If you give some technology to another race, they will remember your kindness (even if they remember it as they are using that same technology to annihalate you).\n\nIve gone on for longer than i intended which just goes to show how much I like this game.

The 3d graphics look very nice and are very well done, but at the expense of gameplay. It's far too easy to click on the wrong thing, and when you finally get it you're not sure what to do with it. This may have been easily remedied with some-holding on the developer's part, but the "tutorial" is almost nonexistent, just a bunch of static pages hanging off of the main menu that do little to describe what's going on.\nMy biggest disappointment isn't with what this game is. It has obviously had alot of effort and care poured into it. My biggest disappointment is what it could have been with just a little more.","December 16, 2014","false","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It isn't outstanding either.\nIt has some nice ideas especially the shipdesigner is great, probably the best around and watching the spacebattles is real fun (I say "watching", because the pilots do not really need your help once the dogfight starts). On the other hand the empiremanagement is very unchallengeing, almost nothing to do and to put it blunt: Best you leave it to the AI so you can concentrate on the big picture.\n\nNow, what is the problem with this game? Why wouldn't I recommend it?\nWell my downgrade has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself, but with the simple problem that the developer didn't implement all the features promised, but instead realises them in a different version of the game named "Stardrive 2". I wouldn't complain if he simply made part 1 and then turned to work on a better part 2, like many other developers do. But he's implementing features in part 2 that were explicitly promised for part 1.\nSo, downgrade for bad management.\n\nBut if you enjoy ship desinging and watching space combat, you might give it a shot if you can get it for a 75% discount.","October 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It felt like I was playing against a group of stroppy children (not helped by the Pollop race's dialog) and after a while it ceased being humerous and just became annoying.\n\nThe space combat is... interesting, the developers have obviously tried to use newtonian physics in the combat and it actually does feel quite good.... until your cruiser power-slides round a planet or your ships refuse to orbit a planet.\n\nThe ground combat is..... horrific, and not in an amusing way either. it's clunky and feels like a bad browser game interface.\n\nThe ship customisation though is a serious strong point for this game and for me it almost outweighs all the annoyances and the learning curve. I probably spent almost as much time in the shipyard over the past couple of days as I have actually playing the game.\n\nThe tech tree and progression is okay, though it's pretty obvious that half the tech concepts are inspired by, if not simply ripped from, the Star Trek universe. Polaron, phasor (yes, they just swapped an e for an o), disruptor etc.\n\nIn summary, if you get it with a bundle or you REALLY want to try it and it's a slow weekend then go for it. For all it's issues, I found the experience enjoyable overall... even if I probably won't be playing the game any more.","January 31, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So I shelfed it thinking that the Developer would finish the game via patches, add the content promised during funding, and make the game more enjoyable and stable. I came back about a year later to suffer the same errors and buggy gameplay I did on release.

The AI does not think long-term and the UI is very limited.\n\nThat said, the mods section leads to some very impressive mods, and has an excellent Star Trek mod on ModDB (recommend).

It has good looks.\n\nIt unfortunately lacks polish.\n\nThe game is unfinished in many regards, but to me more than anything else is the balancing system within it. It just doesn't feel rounded out well enough to truly be considered finished. There are some bugs, glitches, and at times a good deal of rough edges to it. The gameplay is clunky, its approach leaves it too easy to overlook the time spent and the overal mechanics are hit and miss. That issue of the feel hits me in two regards, and the major one is how the empire grows and develops feels forced, and does it in a way that makes growth sluggish untill you hit a stage of performance where you just jump leaps and bounds. the staggering hiccup there just jarrs the whole gameplay on edge. It shows in combat if you don't hit the growth right before the AI does and you try combat.\n\nSpecifically the combat. systems designed to fulfil certain roles just don't. Many instances of the combat I am frustrated with how the AI will always outperform the player, and even on basic combat levels it shows to a starkingly annoying degree. The fleet system and ship controls on it sound good, but lacking that final polish to really make it a good system leaves much to be desired in combat - especially if you need to travel with ships capable of different speeds.\n\nI like the lpooks, some of the mechanics are done well I think - but lacking that balance and refinement to really turn this into a good game.\n\nIf you want to see, wait for a good sale maybe, but I would argue just stay away.","October 12, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Glitches, crashes, saves corrupting, it all sucks. The basic gameplay is fun, but the game is unfinished, as-in prelaunch. It's a beta, not a finished product. The developers have completely moved onto a sequel instead of finished the game they already produced, and the reviews I'm hearing for that game sound exactly like this review. User content patches do what they can, but they can't finish the game for the producers.\n\nThe overall gameplay is fun, if you can get past the awkward GUI.\n\nShip building is complicated and fun. Building and conquering is well balanced. I just can't get past the GUI.\n\nFrankly, the GUI in this game is terrible, it's my number one complaint of this whole game. This is strange coming from the developers of Endless Space which has a perfect, smooth, awesome GUI.\n\nWhat's wrong with the GUI you ask? Several things.\n-Clicking on a button doesn't "always" click it. It just doesn't respond... it just.... doesn't....\n-Opening and closing the windows is awkward. The close button changes locations on every screen and disappears completely on others.\n-They tried to integrate some UI stuff from Endless Space, such as right clicking a window to make it close. However, it's not availble on every screen, so it just takes some testing and memorizing to find out which screen closes with right click which screen doesn't.\n-Information on several screens is just a mess, while on others it's just a massive block of text. Nothing seems to be organized very well or effeciently.\n-Ship selection is the biggest complaint I have of the GUI.\n-You can make control groups just fine, but shift + # doesn't add the current selection to the #'d control group. Having the control group you want to add to selected and shift+click-drag doesn't help either because that selects non-military ships as well.\n-You can't unselect a ship from the selection panel in the bottom left corner.\n-Ships move at different speeds, but there's no way to make a fleet/control group to move at the speed of the slowest ship.\n\n\nOverall, it just feels strange to navigate the UI. Some may call this nit-picking, but I don't. A game like this needs a smooth and fluid UI to be able to manage everything easily and quickly, while getting all the information you need on the fly. This game does not deliver on that.\n\nAnother con of this game is the sound design. When ships are fighting, most of the time, you don't hear anything at all. Sometimes you hear the ship firing, and you get a 1/100 chance for the sound of the weapons firing to BLOW OUT your speakers. Turning the volume down doesn't help because then you can't hear any of the other sounds in the game. So, inevitablly, you just end up turning off the sound completely to avoid the jump scare every few minutes.\n\nAfter muddling through this game's crummy GUI, getting my ears checked by my doctor, and reloading the game through the crashes and the MASSIVE glitches, I'd give this game a D. Would not recommend this headache.","July 28, 2015","false","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can publish a list of features that you desire to add if possible, but you only promise the core elements.  And then once in production, you do not just abandon the project to start a new game, especially a sequel.  It is an unwritten contract between the dev and the buyer that you will deliver a working game with as few bug as possible.\n\nAs this game exists, the dev simply wasted to many development hours on a single feature.  The ship designing options in this game are hands down one of the best that I have seen.  You have so much control within the constraints put in place.  However, the whole purpose of a ship design is to utilize it in its function, typically combat.  And while combat is decent and some what fun, you need an economy to support it, and Stardrive simply does not have a well working economic model.\n\nIn fact, the game ends up punishing you for the 1st 30 min to hour of play.  1st by making you feel like you need to grind a bunch of base technologies just to be capable of performing the basic functions of a 4x game.  You will need new planets to expand you economic abilities, but you will feel you need 4 technologies before you can successfully colonize a planet: a food tech, a production tech, an income tech, and the ability to expand on to prohibited terrain.  However, if you focus on these techs to quickly start expanding, the AI comes and smacks you around because your military is weak.  So lets say you focus on military techs (like guided missiles and armor; yah, no armor before this tech), your units are capable of carrying a basic fight, but the AI has now colonized any half-decent planet on the map.  But then you say to yourself, I've got a big military I will just invade a weaker AI.  Welp, hope your like rebels suddenly poping up on your worlds with no prior indication of unrest because your income rate cannot support even a half decent fleet unless you colonize new worlds.  But wait you say, I'll just build a smaller but higher tech fleet; nope.  Not enough fire power to successfully invade a AI held world because unsuprisingly the AI has a fleet just as big if just a bit smaller but like 3x the troops you were able to build.  And all of this early game will determine whether you will win or loose late game.\n\nHowever, this is not to say you cannot do well.  If you get lucky, the random map has placed habitable planets as neighboring systems, given you one of the less aggressive races as a neighbor, and not block those systems with hostile drones.  If you can survive this early game, the game can be a good bit of fun.  At least up until some late game bug or unfixed feature ends your fun.\n\nA game should not punish players for trying to perform the tasks the game demands or make them slog through a list of Techs that can make or brake their game just to successfully perform those tasks.","May 27, 2015","false","31.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you aren't aware of these games or their significancant contributions to the genre than I simply could not even begin to lend any insight with mere words. On the other hand the game does feel... Unfinished. It has blockbuster potential for a niche crowd, and without keymapping within the game's options it does have a particularly cumbersome control scheme, which very well could turn away even the most enthusiastic of novice players. I also found myself strongly desiring far more depth of interaction dynamics between the various species. If you haven't any experience with this type of game, you almost assuredly will dislike this game. For me though, two thumbs up.","November 12, 2014","true","28.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Research. Build. Conquer.\n\nThe same thing in all of them pretty much and i had alot of problems deciding wich one i'd settle with.\nSure. This one might not have the graphics but it has alot of gameplay value. I love it and it didnt take long before it became my favorite space-sim.\nMostly because of the sole fact that you can build your own spaceships. Decide what components goes where and strategically place the guns, engines, armor, fuel, batteries, sheilds, ammo, mass fabricators, wires, command modules... And the list goes on and on.\nResearch and always be one step ahead of the enemy in various fields. Wether you try to improve the economy and food production or expansion. Wether that'd be by force or settleing on uncharted worlds.\n\n\nBut building those capital-ships with onboard nukes. Boarding parties. Massive guns and fighter hangars? Wow. I love spending hours upon hours deciding the tiniest detail on my newest weapon of war.\n\n8/10 for this type of game.

This game is an unfinished product. It is, at best, “glitchy”. It's an “early access” with no chance of being fixed. Apparently, for reasons beyond the developer, he isn't allowed to work on the engine of the game any more, or something.\n\nThis is rather sad because the game needs optimization, badly. The controls and interface of the game aren't adequate. It makes an obtuse game with a steep learning curve even more convoluted. Basic RTS controls, like finding idle workers or rally points aren't implemented. At least one technology in the science tree doesn't work as described. Ships, especially freighters, lack a good path-finding, making them delay deliveries of vital goods, but it happens to offensive fleets too. Trading technologies requires you look up, -or know the cost by heart-, of everything in the science tree or risk the ire of the IA. The planet managing screen lacks clarity and the possibility for quick changes. The ship building interface refuses to show critical information, like the rate of fire, the global ammunition consumption per second or the global energy consumption. While it can be nice to figure out this puzzle, you have to recalculate everything as soon as you improve your design with new technologies. Having to look up the wiki for vital weapon-data is also unforgivable for a game that requires such precision in its main mechanic from the player. Personalising larger ship becomes a tedious chore.\nSpeaking of ship building, while it is nice to modify them depending on your style, it doesn't take into account how the game works as a whole. The IA isn't a big threat later on in the game as much as it is in the beginning, and that can be circumvented as soon as you realise what variable the computer uses for it's moves: the size of your fleet. Just build a big fleet, and you've won. You don't even need to research, or spend hours personalising cruisers. In the end, it is completely pointless, because you will already be winning by the time you get to bigger spacecrafts, making their puzzle-like personalisation moot and time wasting.\nWorse, this system isn't as open as it pretends to be: you cannot build viable ships if you deviate from a certain type of fighter. If you are thinking of building a huge flying fortresses which shoots at everything in all directions, think again: one ship attacks one ship. Sure, the area of effect damage might hit others too, but that's leaving it up to chance, or worse, the IA. The attacks your ships employ are always the same: charge! There is an option to turn on a “broadside” tactic but it doesn't work according to the forums.\nWhen you get right down to it, the changes you make to your ships are quantitative, not qualitative. You decide the weapons and the defences, and how much of each, and then try to figure out the best way to power the whole thing and keep sufficient ammunition. In essence, this more open system is just more complex than the one in Endless Space, replacing the straightforwardness of it with inconvenient and pointless creation tools. Also, Endless Space has more tactics during the combat phases, with three different phases, defining tactics for each, heroes and hero abilities. In Endless Space, the ships are not just flying towards each other like a Middle Age jousting competition.\n\nIt's a shame since Stardrive sounds good on paper. A better IA and path-finding across the board would have gone a long way. An IA that changes tactics depending on difficulty, rather than giving it a boring bonus to resources to compensate for it's inadequacies, would also give a more organic and challenging experience. Being able to annexe other civilizations peacefully by building a federation is great but removes diversity from the game world, by having the player taking control over the planets and fleets of the ally, making end game seem even more without challenge when you suddenly control half the map.\n\nFinally, on a positive note, the aesthetic of the game, the design of the races and the ships, are very pleasing and enjoyable even thought there are basically references to other media (like the Wing Commander series, the mythos of Cthulhu, the Asari from Mass Effect, etc.). The mixture of all the references kind of creates its own style. The rest of the game though needed a lot more polish.","April 1, 2014","false","36.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

After being released a while ago it still feels like an unfinished beta version of the game. Based on the forums, it doesnt look like the developer will ever finish the game because they've already started on thier next one. The game freezes, crashes, wierd buggyness, confusing as hell and is not polished in a lot of areas, but that all being said, its a lot of fun.\nThink a much slower and less refined civ game based in space. I dont want to compare it to the other space games. I put it on easy mode, researched everything explored every nook and such and still didnt understand some of the mechanics. Then i built several massive dreadnaut class capital warships with intertial dampeners, filled one with nukes and another with the best shields and weapons money could buy and just walked through everything. That was fun. I really wish the devs would take the time to really finish this game, build in the tooltips and not make it impractical to research and such.\nShip building is awesome, its a bit much for me but if you really get into it, theres some crazy things you can do with it.\nResource management is like any other civ game. Its a bit quirky but theres some nice differences to set it apart from the rest.\nThe diplomacy stuff is meh, I was never good at dimplomacy but the 'tone' option you have on all responses really is a neat thing.\nThe slowness is a good and bad thing, sometimes a speed adjustment would be nice, but other times I couldnt hit the pause button quick enough.\nAside from any other unpolished based complaints, my big issue was with the notification system. My fleet could have gotten into a huge ambush or intercepted by the 'remnant' forces and I would have never known. It got me quite a bit of times and I'd never want it to be like civ which I think has notification overload but there needs to be more. I had a smaller map and its just too much to keep track of.\n\nI dont know the cost of the game now, its definitely worth checking out, I only spent like 8 bucks on the sale so that was worth it, but dont expect it to be the next MoO and if you dont know what that is, then thats good, just go with it. I'll check it out six months from now and maybe I'll change my tone from 'threatening' to 'pleading' for forgiveness and like the wasteland 2 game I hope it happens, but this isnt even an early release.

I played it for almost 60 hours and I'm not sure what they are talking about.  It's a fun game for anyone who likes space exploration / building /  combat, micromanaging (somewhat, there's always the auto button for skipping that part of the game...), and building their own ships.  If you have played any of the earlier Civilization games (up through ~3), you know how to get a ship built fast and how important the details for your cities, er planets are for getting things done.  I had a blast and this game is in my Favorites list.\n\nIf you're struggling to get Space Empires V to run on Windows 7, give this one a try!","November 28, 2014","true","58.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

And given the negative reviews I kept reading about it, I lowered my expectations greatly and bought the game on massive sale.\n\nOnce I actually played the game, I actually wound up enjoying it quite a bit.   I can't recall how many hours I've spent and how many "races" I've created in trying the game.  I'll try to rate the game on a 5-star system on each of the areas that I can think of:\n\n1.) Graphics - 4/5\n- I truly enjoyed the graphics.  I really did.  Being able to zoom in to my ships, the combat animations, the effects of each weapon being unique in their own right.  I especially like the unique ship designs for each race which attempted to match their species.  A little cliched, but then again, what game isn't nowadays?\n\n2.) UI - 3/5\n- Simple enough and inuitive.  A few grips would be on some screens where it seems like the UI was designed with a different resolution in mind.  I have an old monitor only capable of 1280 x 1024 and it stuggles on the setup screen due to odd text wrapping.  Other than that however, I felt the UI easy enough to navigate.\n\n3.) Gameplay - 3.5/5\n- I found myself in several sleepless nights playing that "one more turn" (or in this case, one more minute given it's real time).  The racial creation allows for varied types of empires to play around with and with each game randomizing the different empires behavior, it's always been a treat for me.  However, there is one glaring bug around the "plot" where if the AI winds up wiping out the triggers, you're SoL if that was your main goal for that particular round of gameplay.  I've actually had to go in to the XML save files to try to re-trigger the events which is never a good sign.  Still, that plot isn't the end-all-be-all of the game and isn't a deal-breaker for me.\n- Another nice twist is the actual race creator.  Unlike a true "creator", you simply overwrite a species for the current game.  However, any designs you create while playing that "race" become available to the AI in succeeding games so you eventually wind up fighting your own designs which was a real treat when I saw it happen.\n\n- Related to gamelay, there are a few things which could have been improved on in my opinion.   Tech Tree, for one, is smaller compared to other 4X games.  It only feels large due to the amount of research points needed to unlock higher tiers.  The AI also sometimes behaves oddly despite their racial setting at game time (i.e. an Honorable AI will sometimes keep stealing from you despite being in an non-agression pact).\n\n4.)  Replayability - 3/5\n- I admit I keep replaying the game.  For me, it's been enjoyable.  However, I do see 2 problems which can hinder it in other cases:\na) Memory optimization: unlike other RTS games (which this game has flavors of), there is no unit cap other than your bank account (i.e. turn-by-turn income).  This is both a blessing and curse.  This means that you can build up quite the fleet and swarm your way through the galaxy.  Unfortunately this also means unless you've got godly amounts of RAM (and I'm talking 16+ GB of RAM), your game can quickly grind to a halt and crash as the AI will spam ships like no tomorrow.   Even the "final plot story" can break your game should you unlock it given that it also spams ships like no tomorrow (without the limitation of a factory's output to slow it down).  Related to this, beware of designing "cheap" gunboats.  As the race creator "overwrites" a species, any design you create becomes available to that AI race and it tends to favor spamming those cheap gunboats.\nb) No multiplayer.  I never expected this feature as I never was an early backer.  I can see how this would put off others as the challenge of beating down your frenemies always extends the life of a game.  The lack of this feature can put off many people from getting the game.\nc) Lack of a real "custom" race.  MOO2 had the same issues but it would have been nice to have a custom race that didn't overwrite existing ones.\n\n5.) Overall - 3/5\n- I liked MOO3.  Yes, I said it.  I actually came to like game.  StarDrive feels like what MOO3 tried to be.  4X strategy with RTS gameplay.  StarDrive for me is an enjoyable single-player 4X game which allows for some small to medium scale games.  Large games are completely out of the question due to the memory problem which would have raised the game to 4/5 or me.  If you ignore what was originally promised and take the game for what it is now, it's actually worth a try.\n\nI would purchase it when it's at least 50% off given the isssues and replayability challenges it may give others.\nFor the current price of $32.99 CDN, I would instead spend it on Space Empires V or Pandora as they have a bit more replayability for most in my opinion.","January 3, 2015","true","220.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I've probably put in around 20-30 hours now, and I must say I find this game really addicting. The user interface takes a little time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, the game's dynamics are pretty fun. The game is technically turn based in a sense, but turns are measured by time (every 5 seconds) which you can alter during gameplay, or even pause to get your orders out first, so the game is actually played as if all in realtime. In ship combat, you basically just tell your ships to attack the bad guys, so if you like to manuever fleets and such this game may not be for you. You manage just about everything for your species, which is pretty neat. And of course, you design your ships if you want. It may be time consuming, but is pretty fun. You choose a hull type, and then you are responsible for setting up the rest. Also, when you create a new ship, don't name it the same as ships you already have in play, because then you won't be able to refit your current ships. All in all, I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10. It is fun, and as you keep progressing, you can't help but to want to stick around and see what comes next. The graphics are fine, nothing super spectacular, but are still decent enough. I wouldn't pay 30 bucks for the game, but for 10, absolutely.","March 17, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

What is so frustrating that it wouldn’t take much to fix the issues, as far as I see them, and make it fantastic. Unfortuanly I have owned the game for several months and no update has come out and I don’t think one will unless no buys the sequel because of all the negative reviews of this one, which basically all say exact same thing.\n\nThis game really frustrates me. I like the idea and the game play. I really like the ship building element but due to the lack of different weapons it is a bit limited. The idea behind the remnant is very nice.\nThat’s the good part but now onto the bad.\nFor one it isn’t finish and if this is the finished game then there are some major issues with it. For starters even though every different spices has their own ship designs, which I like, they all use the same weapons and that irritates me. I know it makes it easier for stealing tech or giving it as a gift but to me it looks like a cop out.\nThe story line with the remnant is simply not finished. You build the finial building and suddenly you win and there is no explanation of what they were, where they came from and what happened to them that only powerful robotic ships are left.\nThe Ai is really predicable and irritating. You can be nice to one spices and get them to ally with you become your friend but if you make one trade proposal they don’t like you can lose all your trust with them in one go just like you weren’t even allies with them and you had just met. If you are allies with someone then that only means they won’t attack you, unless they revoke the alliance, but they will still try and steal you tech and have no consideration about the planets they take.\nThe game as so much potential and, before I realised that the developer had dropped it to work on a sequel, I was really looking forward to multiplayer to be introduced. I paid £25, ish I can’t remember the exact amount, for a game has been published and then not completed.  Having said that the game is good and I like it but after a while its problems have started to really annoy me and I for one won’t be buying the sequel until I know for sure the developers haven’t published and unfinished game again.","September 26, 2014","true","111.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I sank a decent number of hours into this game but that was mainly because the pace of the game is slow, and after a while I ran out of new content ( wasn't worried though as I knew it was early access - my mistake ).\n\nMy advice, buy Stardrive2, it looks like how I assumed Stardrive1 was GOING to be before the developer(s) up and left it, abandoned. I'm just glad I got this game on sale 75% off, so I can't be too salty about it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have just played Stardrive 2\nThey changed the best parts of Stardrive completely, turns no longer play in real-time, the shipyard is worse - however they did add the ability to add upgrades to modules which I liked, the research system meant that you couldn't unlock every tech in the game without a silly race attribute, the space combat is slow and boring, ground combat is simple and the graphical 'improvements' make the game look weirdly cheap.\n\nBearing all this in mind...\nMy new advice, do NOT buy Stardrive 2 unless you want a more MOO3 type game, do buy Stardrive 1 - when it goes on sale - and mod it, with a community mod or something.

It still feels like it's in dev because there's still enough bugs and patches that are needed but it's still playable. Sadly the game feels like there is so much more potential yet it hasn't or will not tap into.\n\nThe game itself allows you to customize your own ships with a large variety of weapons, shields, armor, equipment, and whatnot. You can then make fleets of those ships and fight against other factions. The diplomacy in the game is better than what the civilization series has accomplished. You actually get rewarded quite well for being diplomatic instead of being completely warlike. Also the galaxy exploration is fun too. You can send out scouts looking for suitable planets for colonization and you can build your solar galaxy in between planets and can connect them with trade systems and territorial markers.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you love sci-fi space battles and the civilization series.","July 13, 2013","true","59.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

You are also giving different ship frames where you can customize how it is armored and armed square by square. It's an interesting thing, but this leads to a few problems.\n\nShip battles don't really have any sort of micromanagement, even smaller ships turn slowly. Ship AI is also lacking.  Also building new ship designs is also a timesink, especially when constantly researching new weapons.  This would be a huge problem in multiplayer.. which unfortunately there is none.\n\nThe game is still getting updates, but it's hard to justify a fullpricetag.\n\nIf it's on sale, it's is worth the time.\n\n","July 13, 2013","true","53.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The big emphasis on combat makes it a ♥♥♥♥ benchmark for the "4x space strategy genre". Galaxy looks and feels lifeless, exploration doesn't feel as rewarding. Combat is good though with lots of pew pew pew. Think of it is a nice bigger scale RTS with some planetary development/colonisation attatched. Ship design is okay but because of a modular design based on visual schematics you are limited in what you can make. This is not the grand epic galaxy brought to life 4x game.

Dynamic planets were also a cool positive that added some randomness to resource distribution throughout the galaxy. I do also know there are several mods out for this game that are free, but have never tried them. The main problem was with the game (imo) was the AI. They are not very intelligent and it can be really difficult beginning a new game because if you encounter a hostile race they will more than likely troop rush you and destroy you within 15 minutes.

Eventually, all 4X games become compared to it.\nStarDrive has many positive aspects - friendly interface, interesting gameplay, starship constructor (in which alone, you'll spend hours, customizing your ships). But all-in-all, in my opinion, it failed to implement these into a balanced game. Notorious AI and ship movement, bugs, balancing issues, weak diplomacy. Abscence of a storyline is OK for me, neither MoO did have one, but StarDrive feels in every way incomplete. Short tech-tree, strategy flaws (you can win almost every game in minutes, by producing soldiers and landing them onto enemy homeworlds - no defence for that. Ka-pow! And the enemy is either extict, or thrown into a stone age.)\nMoreover - as of 1.15 patch, it seems that there'll be no more updates, as developer focused on a second installement. Some complained it was a hit-and-run move, but I sense logic there. No use of trying to sew together a Frenkenstein. It's far easier and wiser to start from scratch, avoiding mistakes learned. Looking forward to trying the second game out.\nMy opinion - the game is worth trying out, although overpriced.

What drew me to it the most is its innovative and thorough approach to ship design and combat.  If you'd enjoy spending 20 thought-filled  minutes crafting a customized inter-system war machine, this one's for you.  I should add that watching said war machine ply its trade is beautiful and enjoyable as well.  I loved almost everything about the design and implementation of the space combat in StarDrive.  Its real-time approach encompasses fighters, boarding parties, attack, defense, reinforcements, re-arming, repairing, bombarment, trade, support structures, warp speed and manuevering.\n\nHowever, I must also acknowledge that this game never overcame a certain lack of polish.  Confused AI, glitches, and underdeveloped or dead-ending side stories riddle the game.  In order to fully enjoy its excellent space combat system, you must learn how to work with the game's quirks and carefully guide the challenge level into an ideal range with practiced care.  I am amazed and impressed with what this game's creator(s) were able to accomplish.  At the same time, I can see why its metacritic score didn't make it to the 90s; its great strengths are forced to associate with a series of weaknesses.","September 28, 2014","true","249.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Moving them in combat formations even more so. some definate bugs with landing ground troops on planets and so on.\n\nThe unfinished random events and bugs in this prevent it from being a breath of fresh air in a stangant genre and coming out like a waft of stale perfumed vapror of a fancy tomb.","June 1, 2013","true","19.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

You can assume manual control over your "flagship" but this is sort of useless; I find myself never making use of the ability.  That, coupled with the fact that there's a game type selector but no game type except the default, tells me that this game started with the intent to develop something akin to StarFlight or Star Control II, but that inability to manage scope led it to becoming just another Sins of a Solar Empire clone.\n\nThat said, the AI is challenging, though it tends to make odd choices at times.   Unfortunately, the races are very predictable in behavior, and seem a bit like ripoffs themselves.   The Kulrathi warrior bear race reminds me a little much of the Kilrathi warrior cat race from old Wing Commander.   There's a race of squid-beings that have ships and philosophy very similar to the Reapers from Mass Effect.\n\nI did enjoy playing this game for one or two playthroughs, and the modification of the ships is an interesting mechanic, but I found myself going back to Sins of a Solar Empire to get this sort of fix.   Between the lack of creativity on the alien races and the clear false-start of creating an "adventure" mode, I was never able to shake the feeling that the game was completed halfway and the rest was just phoned in.   It's a game worth playing if you can grab it on Steam Sale, but it's also a lesson in how scope creep can turn a great idea into an unfinished project.","February 5, 2014","true","27.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

However, as I learned my way around the contrls and began combat, I realised how much fun this game can seriously get. The combat in this is tons and tons of fun, least of all because of the creative control you have on your ships. You get the blueprint of your ship, and then fill its insides with weapons, power, bridges, the lot. You then test your design out in combat. It has great visuals and beautiful weapon effects, all the races ships feel different and look cool. Its only downside is Empire building and the economy is pretty shallow.

I've not found it as complex as the others, not turn based and for me, it's easing me into how 4x games essentially work.\n\nI can't say much about the negativity surrounding the game because I'm only new to the genre but as a game, I'm finding that it functions great so far.\n\nGraphically I can not complain, the music and sounds are nice. I'm sure as I play more, I'm going to find things I don't like and once I get used to the genre I'll start playing other 4x space games then look back on this and make comparisons but for now, this seems like a great entry level game to the genre.","November 1, 2014","true","13.2"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","1"

Here's why:\n\n1) You can discover the entire galaxy with literally your first scout ship with almost no impunity.  No need to develop a drive or anything.\n\n2) You can seemingly spend your time waiting on research building way points that connect virtually everywhere (seemingly no drawbacks or economic penalty for doing this).\n\n3) Economy is ENTIRELY population based.  Expanding your empire's economy relies on you NOT building any actual buildings (at least early).  Maintenance costs on buildings that are designed to increase food, defenses, or production ALL drain more out of your income than actual ships, so it's better to just colonize and send colonists and food to the planets for seemingly forever till they have enough people to grow.  Just a bizarre concept that doesn't feel rational to me, there really is no option to have a small, but robust empire. It's zerg expansion or die.\n\n4) Conquering enemies, likewise, involves nothing more than zerg tactics (i.e. spamming smallers missle ships and troops).  All you have to do is land more troops on the planet than the enemy has and it's soon yours, you can actaully do that by flying right past their defense fleet and zerg landing while a small number of attacks ships keeps their fleet busy.  Very silly strat but works easily.\n\n5) Diplomacy is haywire. People either love you to death regardless of your actions or they want to murder you out right.  Then they simply want to join with you or your enemy, effectively taking the diversity out of the galaxy and matching one big against another big.  Really saps the interest in the game.\n\n6) Ship design is convoluted and seemingly pointless.  You don't know what you need to put and where and there is no manual whatsoever to figure it out.  Simply putting a power source on a ship isn't enough, you need to add wiring that connects the guns or the shields or the bridge to that power source....at the expense of things like armor.  It's like a really terrible game of minesweep to be honest and I like complexity in games, I play 4x games and Paradox games like EU, CK2, and Hearts of Iron....but this ship design leaves me baffled.\n\nAll in all, this just feels like a very incomplete game that could have been much better if things like the economy and diplomacy had been fleshed out.  The battle system is fun to an extent, but it boils down to zerg tactics.  Bring enough cheap to produce missle frigates and focus fire for the win, leave the tactics at home.\n\nI can't recommend this game.","May 5, 2014","false","17.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The mechanics make sense, and the player can make informed choices to wring out advantages to actually win battles, wars, and the game. Custom ship designs are a key part of the value proposition of the game, and the implementation here is meaty and satisfying.\n\nThose good things said, the game has some big flaws in usability/playability. There is often only one way to perform an action  (scrap/refit a ship, scroll the map) when there should be several; information displays like the known-planets list and ships list are missing key features. Also, while the ship design module is a lot of fun early in the tech tree, as ships get larger the lack of any automated support makes filling in all the boxes of a design tedious instead of fun.\n\nI picked StarDrive up as part of the holiday sale, and I can say it was worth the discounted price to me, but I'm not sure it would be worth full price.\n","January 3, 2014","true","52.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","4"

This is a solid game with a very distinct art style. It looks really good and yet very simple, which is not a bad thing. The game is very easy to learn and is quite deep in it's ship customization and you will spend many hours designing and perfecting your ship designs. There is nothing more satisfying than having your custom badass capitalship send out a swarm of your custom fighters and totaly anhialate an enemy fleet.\n\nCompared to a lot of other 4X games, Stardrive does not have as big of a techtree, there is still plenty of things to research but compared to games like Endless Space it's far from enough. One thing I really miss is more ways to improve your planets and concidering all the buildingspace you have left, there is room for a lot more.\n\nPros:\n- Short learning curve\n- Deep shipdesign\n- Real-time gameplay\n- Addicting\n\nCons:\n- Not enough to research\n- Ground battles\n- Game crash after a few hours of play\n- Save files are way to big","November 7, 2014","true","50.3"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

The scale, depth and presentation is wonderful. The developer has managed to achive something amazing given both that this is his first game and that he's working solo.\n\nThe early game is wonderful, the ship designer is interesting, there's a good variety of planets, anomalies and the races all look brillient.\n\nBut, and it is a bit but, this game is also rather tragic. The potential it has was vast, and while some of it has been lived up to, due to poor engine choices and the dev choosing to remake the game in unity and create a sequal, the game is unlikely to get any better. Preformance is buggy, especialy later on. Late game is dull and will have you either compleatly dominate or be wiped out in the early game. Lack of multipalyer limits the games's life time signifigantly, and things such as the half finnished remnets plotline just make me want to cry.\n\nThat said, despite all it's faults I've still put in around 60 hours at time of writing, from multiple playthoughts, meaning that the cost per hour is less then 50p.\n\nWhile the games has it's moments, the problems coupled with the fact that a remake and a sequal is arriving soon makes me recomend that you don't buy unless your fine with a incompleat, thought still impressive experiance. Wait till the sequal.","December 3, 2013","false","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

It's rather quite fine, but sadly also buggy. Some issues make it crash during diplomacy, others during deploying ground troops, and I also encountered a crash as I colonized a world.\n\nThe game looks neat, as far as it runs, it's of course not as polished as it could be, but there are already a lot of options. Sadly there is no more official support to this by the developer, but the fans still try to update it on a regular basis.\n\nPros:Collection of several races, that can even further be tweaked with traits.The player decides the size, and resources of the galaxy or sector. Systems can have a good variety of planets.\nCons:The game is buggy and crashing regulary, safe often.Not well supported by the developer, because the second part is out already.\nNot recommended for everyone\nThe game is nice, sadly it's both no longer supported by the devs and it's buggy and crashy. But there still is hope, there is an inofficial patch for the game, that gets updated on a regular basis, and alone those Fanbase make the game still a good game. But, you have to know the basics of modding, and you have to keep in mind that the game still isn't running as smoothly as it should.\n\nGiven the issues with the bugs, crashes and lacking support, the positive things about the game are you can play it, though you will have to install and upkeep the patch. I encountered several problems during the first three or four tryouts, it's unclear why - because the final patching worked perfectly fine and I did nothing different.\n\nIf you are fan of the 4x Space Exploration genre, this game might be for you. Especially if you aren't afraid to mod your games and give it a try. But if you are inexperienced with modding, have problems with finetuning your software or system, then this game might be not for you - it will try out your patience and may pull the strings of your nerves.Don't buy the game when you want a fast, and relaxing playing experience.","November 30, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drop the price of your mistake down to atleast 9.99 to the value its worth so that anyone who reads the reviews and realizes they are getting ripped off they spend the 2.00 its worth on a sale. I think you owe your community Zero, i think with star drive 2 you should put some incentive to star drive 1 owners as an apology. First off your an alpha designer if you look around steam most quality alphas only charge 19.99 for thier games you should charge that for newcomers and half for people who own star drive 1. An apology to us for wasting our money on lies and half truth broken promisis. The community can kill your future in gaming as a company. You Should also Finish and live up to any promisis you make for star drive 2. because i can assure you if you realease star drive 2 the way you did star drive 1 you might end up with a class action lawsuit. So id be weary of the thieving style development... That being said stardrive 1 had massive potential till the dev dropped support and didnt complete the game as was stated. This review is harsh but true, i dont like backing companies that lie and cheat, I back companies so no matter thier success they can make the best game they can.

Oh, the disappointment.\n\nIt started great.  Bought this on early access, it had some problems, a couple major ones in fact, but it was close enough that you could see the point of it all, even then, and could see the few hops and leaps it'd take to get the foundations in place and really start cranking out an awesome game.\n\nInstead, what we got were sweet nothings and empty promises from ZeroSum, tales of how we would get X Y and Z features or fixes.  Trade is still broken, warping still doesn't work properly, warp nodes and defensive emplacements are still prohibitively expensive, the AI is still crap and consistently allows itself to get rolled over in stupid and meaningless ways, often outright killing themselves due to what should be only one or two MINOR circumstances regarding their worlds and infrastructure...  No balance, no design, no polish, the damn game isn't even finished.\n\nZeroSum took a game, created a clear image, started tapping serious potential...  And then turned around and flipped their entire customer-base for this game the bird.  Zero literally said he would fix the problems and get the game working...  After saying this, he never even got around to the first major gameplay problem, the broken Freighters...  And then announced StarDrive 2.\n\nDo not buy this game, do not support ZeroSum games, do not support Iceberg Interactive until they drop ZeroSum, because at the very least, ZeroSum Games is nothing more than a shady, cash-grab studio who does not deserve to be called a Games Developer, and Iceberg deserves to same insults and utter lack of respect for as long as they intend on keeping such a disingenuous, malicious individual/studio under their umbrella.\n\nStarDrive is a game to AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","June 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","9"

Back then I even went to trouble of taking the screen shot of the error message and posting it to Stardrive forums in good belief that it´d be fixed, and I went back to that old picture when it happened to me again 3 days ago, and YES! it was same error message, related to ground invasion screen, it is same bug! what a fool I am.\n\nAnd now the dev has ditched this game to make... Surprise surprise, Stardrive 2, with people that made Endless Space. Will I buy that game? Hell No! I will jump on board of Galciv 3 or planetary annihilation, they are most likely out at reasonable price (and reviewed so I know if I should buy them or not) when Stardrive 2 comes out or goes to alpha to beg for money to "finish" it.\n\nDev of this game has lost his credibility to me.

It was in alpha/beta though and Steam was nice enough to point me at the products webpage, because as handy as steam is they cant list all of a products features on their little webpage (I dont think it had the read more tabs at the time).  Looking at the developers product page and seeing youtube videos of what you are going to purchase is just good consumer behavior so that you know what you are purchasing.   It looked really interesting and offered things such as\n\nMoo2 like but RTS 4x\nMultiplayer\nCreate your own fleet designs\nSpecial Missions in which you assume control of an individual ship instead of a whole side\nA sandbox mode with an engaging storyline.\nNeutral factions like remeneant and pirates\nA variety of random Galaxy events.\n\nShortly after buying in the developer said he was temporarly removing multiplayer to work out the kinks. Of course the sandbox storymode wasnt finished yet but thats ok it was in beta and we saw how it was going to work with researching technologys and contacting a neutral planet and yadda yadda.  And watching the WTF is, along with other videos I knew what to expect with late game latency, so when people bashed on it I spoke up for it, telling people to give it time.  As a one person developer a 1-2 year wait for him to fix things up was acceptable.  Especialy for a game that had already been in development for something like 4 years.  But it was nearly done,  so we should hold on before making judgements.  I made guides, tried to help people out,and gave suggestions.\n\nBut the longer it went on the more sour it got.  A couple weeks out of its -short- Beta when we could no longer get refunds there was a 50% off sale.  A couple months after that we were told Multiplayer would never make it to the game and that maybe in a stardrive 2 we would get it.   Special missions were abandoned all together.  The Galaxy events were restricted to simple planatary shifts for fertility/richness.  The Remenent story-arc was removed (and then later reintroduced in a shoddy manner).  Some of the AI's were just left in a crippeled state.   And then afterall of that there was a Fertility/abundance nerf across all difficultes (that the AI ignores) that you cant disable... Why nerf fertility/abund in a single player game?  A -lot- of players got banned from the message boards for silly things and it was a pretty rage induceing time all around.\n\nBut thats ok I thought,  I decided to give him more time.  He said development would 'slow' while stardrive 2 was in development but we could expect improvements.  I decided to wait for SD2 to get finished before looking back and seeing what has changed.\n\nSo this last week I gave it a try again.  And I have to say i am not very happy with it.  I enjoyed the game more during beta and after 'release' with the late game slowdown then I do now.  Sure some small bugs were fixed with fire arcs and its a little bit smoother.  But several AI's just sit there and let other AI's conquer them with out putting up a fight, several races just refuse diplomacy of any sort (usualy the ones that are conquering other ai's),  and the AI still cheats up the wazzoo building fleets it cant possibly support.  And overall it feels really bad fighting over a 4 population planet with a 1.2 fertility and 1.1 richness because thats the best there is out there.\n\nIn the end the game currently (may 2015) feels unfinished (even more so then during beta), and in need of a good AI patch, a balance patch, a few new galaxy option sliders to combat what was done post release, and maybe a gamemode paid DLC.\n\nI'm gratefull for the 33% discount on SD2 for SD1 owners,  its a nice gesture.  And I really do hope SD2 turns out well, and can compete with other games in the turn based strat genre. But in the end this game also made me deicde to hold off on SD2 until its cheep as dirt.. because no matter how good it looks 'now'  it could be a lot worse in 6 months.   And thats just not something I ever really expected to say about a game.\n\n\nps- yes I know my spelling sucks. Hopefully it wasnt too bad.","May 9, 2015","false","171.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It will never be finished nor its bugs fixed. Some of these bugs are game-breaking and there are many features that are either incomplete (to name but one: game mode. You can choose it when you start a new game, you get to choose only one option, though -_-) or inexistant.\n\nNow to the game itself, it is an ok game that appears to be a rip-off of a lot of games, but the ship designer as well as space battles are genuinely fun. I would almost call the initial ships being crappy a stroke of genius since it gives you a nice challenge to build good ships for each faction and possible tech configurations etcetera, this part is really fun. The automation of building them is ok, and putting them in fleets is very nicely done with the fleets manager.\n\nThe gameplay itself, not so much. You initially start with one planet, and the one whom colonizes the most suitable planets the first is generally the first to win. If your race has improved metabolism that is every planet with 0.8+ fertility. Mind you those planets tend to be rare (10-15% of all colonizable planets I think?), which only makes it worse that you can also choose to make your race cybernetic. Combine that with industrious and improved metabolism and suddenly your requirements have changed to all planets with 0.8+ production instead (assuming 20-25% tax rate). This basically means 75% of all colonizable planets, most of them being uninteresting to other races except the Opteris (cybernetic), mainly for this reason, that race can actually pose a challenge in the hands of the ai.\nGranted, you can research stuff to make all planets viable for colonization or bother with crappy food transportation, but that goes against colonizing fast.\n\nSo combat: by default, you are at peace with every race. If you have troops/fleets in orbit of each of their planets cabable of annihilating them in a few seconds they will not care. If they intercept one spy they are likely to declare war, but with war you get space battles! Still, if you choose the best possible strategy, there will be no space battles: as long as your military strength is higher than your opponents', only the Opteris will ever dare attack you. And even when it is not, half the ai players will generally just seek peaceful relations (pacifist/cunning/honourable ais). There are also planetary battles: capturing planets through troops. Troops cost no maintenance, though, so flooding each of your planets with troops is a sure way to win: the ai will never bomb your planets.\n\nRemember the game-breaking bugs? One of them involves unlimited production! It involves having shipyard, you spend 10 spare production on a ship, get 13 invested, cancel it, and now you have 13 spare! The shipyard effect even stacks with multiple shipyards, so I don't think I need to tell you how horrible it is to leave this bug in the game.\n\nOverall I give this game a 4.0/10\nKicking dumb ai asses does make me feel better, but you are better off with something like Distant Worlds.","March 14, 2015","false","74.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Primarily the promise for multiplayer, Other than that area the game was a good spiritual successor to Masters of Orion 2, I won't lie and say it had amazing diplomacy, mainly because it didn't. But I loved the ability to design my ships and it did well on that, It does or did have a collision issue with ships ramming into your ship through armor and shilds and doing internal damage, but to be honest not doing a proper build of your ship is the end cause of the failure.  I would definitely not pay the full price, and I wouldn't belive anything this developer says at this point, but the game was fun by itself, would have been amazing if it actually had multiplayer as promised.\n\nGame devoper says he never promised anything like that however the kickstarter that funded the game said it was a feature in the game. Everything pointed that it would have multiplayer but sadly he has said its not going to happen.\nIts true part of the issue comes from the engine losing support but that is not our fault or responsibility and version two is turn based.

Towards grand-stategy and 4X-Games. They have been my personal guilty pleasure for the longest time. However, even with the enjoyment i get from them. There are examples of the genre that are not exactly the best and unfortunately StarDrive falls to that category.\n\n\nThis is easily explained, the game is dull. Bloody dull...  In all of my 140+ Hours of playing it, i have completed it only thrice.\nAnd every time, the end-game played out the same. Every single time, not counting the time i went all Borg with the Opteris. This is mainly due to design issues with the Tech- political- and AI-systems, they feel unfinished and in many ways they still are. The game still crashes now-and-again and some of the mods that have been made for the game only make it even more unstable. (This just might be only on my end, but its still a noteworthy issue.)\n\nAnd for a game that is aesthetically very similiar to the good old Master of Orion series, the problems only make it worse. Since in its core, the game is broken and even with the patching the developer has done (and if memory serves it was just one guy.) the game is still broken.\n\nAnd i'm really sad about it, since the idea is so good. A spiritual successor to Master of Orion, with better graphics, sound and all the other fluff. StarDrive tries to be that game and in some ways it has succeeded, but the technical and design issues are the things that kill the experience, not to mention the pacing.\n\nIn all, StarDrive is a decent game. Even with all of its obvious problems, it is somewhat enjoyable. But not by much. It gets dull really fast and with the pacing being off, i really doubt that you could squeeze more than few playthroughs out of it. And even the modular ship building system, can only squeeze so much fun out of it.\n\nStarDrive.\n\nI think a C , is the best grade i can settle for. This coming from the game being still mostly incompleted and the modding only helps so much. But to give a yes or no on the recommendation option, i think i still need to put a yes on it. Since Steam has no "neutral"-option in the recommendation thing..\n\nFurthermore, i would not recommend paying full price, buy this when it goes on sale. Since the content isnt there for 30€ (or regional equivelant.).","May 6, 2014","true","146.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Aún así, el desarrollador lo ha dejado a medio hacer, y eso se nota mucho. A continuación enumero las las cosas que más me han sacado de quicio:\n\n1-No hay tutorial. Hay un hermoso botón donde dice "tutorial" pero se trata tan solo de una pequeña presentación que te muestra lo básico de lo básico. En un juego que se vanagloria de tener tanta profundidad como éste tal cosa no es aceptable.\n\n2-El juego tiene amplias opciones de automatización (admistración automática de planetas y flotas, recursos, etc). Sería genial, si no fuera porque no funciona. Deja un planeta en manos de la IA y te lo joderá seguro.\n\n3-En las partidas avanzadas, la incesante actividad de flotas y las constantes batallas por todo el mapa ralentizan de forma considerable el juego. No es un problema de mi máquina, pues ha sido documentado por mucha más gente en los foros.\n\n4-En mi caso, después de una larga partida de algo más de 10 horas, al día siguiente el juego se niega a funcionar correctamente, congelándose la pantalla cada 4 ó 5 segundos. Por esa razón lo he desinstalado.\n\nEn conslusión, si lo encuentras barato (menos de 7-8 eur), puedes jugártela y comprarlo si tienes muchas ganas. Pero ten en cuenta que si encuentras algún bug gordo o te molesta alguna de las cosas anteriores, ningún desarrollador lo va a solucionar.\n\nCONSEJO: SI ESTÁS BUSCANDO UN JUEGO DE ESTRATEGIA 4X, VE A POR LOS TÍTULOS MÁS CONSOLIDADOS QUE ÉSTE.\n\n\nENGLISH\n\nThe game has a lot of content and features very good ideas, however the developer left it incomplete to work on another project (see Stardrive 2). The fact that this game is unfinished and unpolished is really evident sometimes. Let me show you the 4 things that angry me the most:\n\n1-No tutorial. Yeah, there is a big shiny button tagged "Tutorial" in the main menu, but it's just a slideshow that provides little to no useful info. In a game which aims to be so deep and complex, this is a serious issue.\n\n2-Automatization. The game let's you give control of various tasks to the AI. Almost anything from planet management to Empire defense can be managed by the machine. Problem is, the AI is stupid.  Give it control of a planet and all the population will be dead in no time.\n\n3-The endgame CPU consumption will kill your computer. Although this game is not exactly FarCry 3 graphics wise, the constant battles and endless activity during an advanced game will cause freezing and periodic stuttering. This issue has already been documented in various forums.\n\n4-In my case, after 10 hours of "successful" playing, now the game refuses to even work properly, causing stuttering even when I'm at the main menu and taking about 5 minutes to load. For this reason I uninstalled it.\n\nIn conclussion: if you really like the concept of this game or feel like playing, buy it if you find it at a good price (less than 8 eur). Keep in mind, however, that this game is already considered "complete" by the developer, and so none of the issues explained above, along with those that you find, are going to be fixed.\n\nADVICE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 4X GAME, GO FOR THE MORE POLISHED TITLES","June 23, 2014","false","34.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Aún así, el desarrollador lo ha dejado a medio hacer, y eso se nota mucho. A continuación enumero las las cosas que más me han sacado de quicio:\n\n1-No hay tutorial. Hay un hermoso botón donde dice "tutorial" pero se trata tan solo de una pequeña presentación que te muestra lo básico de lo básico. En un juego que se vanagloria de tener tanta profundidad como éste tal cosa no es aceptable.\n\n2-El juego tiene amplias opciones de automatización (admistración automática de planetas y flotas, recursos, etc). Sería genial, si no fuera porque no funciona. Deja un planeta en manos de la IA y te lo joderá seguro.\n\n3-En las partidas avanzadas, la incesante actividad de flotas y las constantes batallas por todo el mapa ralentizan de forma considerable el juego. No es un problema de mi máquina, pues ha sido documentado por mucha más gente en los foros.\n\n4-En mi caso, después de una larga partida de algo más de 10 horas, al día siguiente el juego se niega a funcionar correctamente, congelándose la pantalla cada 4 ó 5 segundos. Por esa razón lo he desinstalado.\n\nEn conslusión, si lo encuentras barato (menos de 7-8 eur), puedes jugártela y comprarlo si tienes muchas ganas. Pero ten en cuenta que si encuentras algún bug gordo o te molesta alguna de las cosas anteriores, ningún desarrollador lo va a solucionar.\n\nCONSEJO: SI ESTÁS BUSCANDO UN JUEGO DE ESTRATEGIA 4X, VE A POR LOS TÍTULOS MÁS CONSOLIDADOS QUE ÉSTE.\n\n\nENGLISH\n\nThe game has a lot of content and features very good ideas, however the developer left it incomplete to work on another project (see Stardrive 2). The fact that this game is unfinished and unpolished is really evident sometimes. Let me show you the 4 things that angry me the most:\n\n1-No tutorial. Yeah, there is a big shiny button tagged "Tutorial" in the main menu, but it's just a slideshow that provides little to no useful info. In a game which aims to be so deep and complex, this is a serious issue.\n\n2-Automatization. The game let's you give control of various tasks to the AI. Almost anything from planet management to Empire defense can be managed by the machine. Problem is, the AI is stupid.  Give it control of a planet and all the population will be dead in no time.\n\n3-The endgame CPU consumption will kill your computer. Although this game is not exactly FarCry 3 graphics wise, the constant battles and endless activity during an advanced game will cause freezing and periodic stuttering. This issue has already been documented in various forums.\n\n4-In my case, after 10 hours of "successful" playing, now the game refuses to even work properly, causing stuttering even when I'm at the main menu and taking about 5 minutes to load. For this reason I uninstalled it.\n\nIn conclussion: if you really like the concept of this game or feel like playing, buy it if you find it at a good price (less than 8 eur). Keep in mind, however, that this game is already considered "complete" by the developer, and so none of the issues explained above, along with those that you find, are going to be fixed.\n\nADVICE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 4X GAME, GO FOR THE MORE POLISHED TITLES","June 23, 2014","false","34.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game was released fairly quickly - some would say a bit too quickly - and while it did receive several significant patches and updates after release, the post-launch development was not nearly as comprehensive as the community, in my opinion, deserved. As of the writing of this review, ZeroSum Games has already announced that they are making a sequel. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but it seems as though this first game was really little more than a test run designed to iron things out and bilk some folks out of the money that the studio decided they needed to create the 'real' game. I can only hope that this sequel does more to address the issues that StarDrive had and provides a more satisfying 4x experience.\n\nEven at the supposed 'end' of its relatively short development cycle, the game still suffers from a number of glitches and bugs, as well as incomplete or poorly-executed gameplay systems. Ships and fleets often suffer from poor pathfinding and an inability to carry out simple orders. Up until the last update, the few 'random events' that made up the in-game 'storyline' were still incomplete or did not work properly. The lack of any sort of scaleable engine technology or range limitations on your ships pretty much allows any player to scout out the entire map in the blink of an eye, destroying any sense of gradual exploration and leaving you susceptible to zerg rushes from any 'warmonger' races you have the misfortune of rolling up a new game map alongside.\n\nPlanet development, research, and economics are serviceable but pretty bare-bones. The short tech tree is ridiculously easy to blow through with 'standard' pacing, and really needed to be at least 50% larger than what it was; several branches were seriously underdeveloped. Terraforming is almost nonexistent and the greatest variety of planet facilities is in defenses; there are no more than two or three facilities each for farming, industry, and research. The economic system had the potential to be quite intricate with its system of freighters physically transporting goods between planets; however, the limit of only three resources (food, industry, people) and the seeming lack of promised effects from the economic-related techs don't contribute to a realistic economic model and make it hard to afford much infrastructure.\n\nGame setup doesn't provide a lot of options compared to other 4x games (Endless Space, GalCiv 2, and MoO2 - which this game purports to be emulative of - come to mind). Even the largest map size doesn't seem to be quite big enough, particularly given how sparse most star systems are and how many turn out to be crap - which, given the lousy terraforming options, make meaningful expansion of your empire difficult. Locations such as volcanic and ice worlds, gas giants, and asteroid belts, rather than providing additional options, are instead little more than eye candy, contributing nothing of value to the overall game when they could've added whole new dimensions to the tech tree and gameplay.\n\nThe game's seven races are fairly original, for the most part - conforming to the usual tropes, but distinctive in their own ways, though some are considerably more derivative than others. The diplomatic options are good, if not outstanding, and  the responses provided in the course of shooting the breeze with a particular species are amusing, while providing a gist of each race's personality and culture - though there's not a great deal of background information to be gleaned during the course of gameplay. The diplomacy system gives you an idea of how a given species feels about you, but no feedback on what you can do to improve relations. Espionage provides a number of options for stealing or sabotage in a fairly good, time-duration assignment system that relies on hiring spies and advancing them in rank.\n\nI do have to say that the game's ship design system is solid, allowing you to get down into the nitty-gritty of customizing each vessel to the last component. Everything comes down to power; each component has to be within range of a reactor or power conduit or it won't function. Design a ship with too many power-hungry systems but not enough power generators, and systems will shut down once its reserves run dry. Ship-to-ship combat happens in real time on the system maps (a la Sins of a Solar Empire) and hit detection and damage is location-based, with external systems taking damage first before the guts of the ship can be hit.\n\nWhat this means is that ship design must be well thought-out and involves compromise. With only so many slots on a particular hull - and only so many internal and external slots available - you have to strike a balance between power systems, weapons, and defenses. Ships with heavy armor on the outer edges will have less space available for weapons ports; shield generators have limited coverage bubbles and must be positioned to protect the whole ship; reactors are volatile and will cause splash damage to surrounding components if they are destroyed - do you have the space to spare for internal bulkheads, or do you trust your ship's armor and shielding? Each weapon can be given an individual arc, allowing you to construct aggressive, maneuverable, front-heavy gunfighters or well-defended, multi-turreted line warships capable of massive broadsides - or anything in between. All that's needed is a way to lock each weapon in position so it can't be moved - errant clicks while upgrading or changing designs can skew a turret's alignment clear out of whack, which can lead to whole fleets with frakked up aim if you happen to not notice.\n\nStarDrive does have some good points and interesting design features, but overall the game feels incomplete. I could go on about other aspects of the game that suffered from clunky design or thin or incomplete treatments, but the message has been stated - StarDrive is not worth picking up, at least not at this point. Clearly it has been popular enough to warrant a sequel, and hopefully the developer will take the time to get things right in the second game. StarDrive 2 definitely needs a far greater level of depth and sophistication in its gameplay if it wants to stand out from its competition in this fairly crowded field of space empire-building games, and needs to have the glitchy systems and underdeveloped features of its predecessor ironed out in order to deliver a satisfying experience. Hopefully the sequel will prove to be a game that greatly improves on its 'trial run' predecessor and is able to succeed because it is well-designed and provides deep gameplay options - something that the original game has not succeeded in delivering.","March 26, 2014","false","25.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.\n\nAs for the specific issues with the game:\n\nPROS-\n\n1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.\n\n2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.\n\nCONS-\n\n1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.\n\n2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can't do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.\n\n3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.\n\n4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn't appear to have any strategic element either.\n\n5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn't say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their "new" game.\n'nuff said.\n\n\n\nSuch a pity, really.

You can learn all the tricks in mere minutes and there's not much to do after that.\nMost annoying is the tech tree: it is just too shallow and all-visible at start (well, there's something like 1-6 upgrades in 1-3 tech trees in each of five tiers plus one 'hidden' tier). Upgrades are completely evolutional, improving just main characteristic of shield/armor/weapon/etc.\nSpace combat is really nasty too: no matter how much time you spend designing your ships combat result is mostly determined by ability to sustain DPS and hit the target (like a not-so-large pack of cheapest fighters with ammo-less lasers easily destroy something like cruiser). Moreover ships in fleet do not keep formation during combat thus there's no such thing concentrated fire or support ships staying in safe position delivering ammo/repairs to the hot zone.\nAs for diplomacy, well there's none out there. First Civilization had as much diplomatic choices as we have here and it is not the simplicity you want.\n\nTo be honest there's a couple of things that are good: it is ship designer (however you cannot fit your design with latest weapons/armors just developed by your techs, you need to do it manually) and 'turnless' strategic mode, however there're many space strategies which include these pros and doesn't have so much cons.

The diplomacy is pretty light, though not the worst in the world. But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete. So many features seem unfinished or rushed and there's no word from the DEV on fixes or further development.

It offers a unique experience and I find myself coming back again and again to play it. That being said I would not reccomend it unless it was on at least a 75% sale as the game is not complete and pretty much never will be because the dev dropped it.\n\nNow you can play the game, isn't broken you can play and finish a scenario but this game was abandonned and a lot of promises that were made were broken by the dev so there is lack of content and after a few games you get the gist of how things will go and the prospect of losing goes out the window even on the hardest difficulty. The Blackbox mod can fix this a bit but overall it's a problem. In addition you will suffer a lot late game due to poor optimisation that even a really powerful system can't power through. I put a lot of time into this game on my 3570k which was overclocked to 4.8Ghz and on the larger universe settings I still had significant slowdowns and juttering which can and will render the zoomed in direct fleet control unplayable. It basically leads to you sending massed fleets into enemy held systems and hoping that the AI can take care of things.\n\nThe best thing to do is the leave the universe size to normal and use the Blackbox mod to limit the number of ships the AI can have because if you don't you will quickly find that the AI will continue to pump out droves of ships and each one will make the game run a bit worse after a certain point. That being said if you have a recent Intel based chip(Sandy or newer) your system should easily be able to handle around around a thousand ships in the universe without significant slowdowns.\n\nProbably my favorite thing about the game is the ship customization. In a word it's friggin cool and it really makes you feel good when your ship you designed is good enough to take on three or four ships of an equivalent class of ship and come out on top. That is I think the thing that really keeps me coming back because I keep finding better and better ways to build my ships and it feels really engaging.\n\nTo wrap up this game had loads of potential but it was let down by poor choices made by the dev in both the way they made the game and how the handled the abandonment of it. It is in no way worth the standard $30 asking price, you can pick it up for the unique experience but only if it's less than $10.","March 8","false","313.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

For one thing a reason why I dont reccomened is IT"S NOT FINISHED! There is a variety of features in this game that have been started and will never be finished.\n\nFor example, Revoran the games one and only quest and never finsihed. This little planet gives you the start of a quest in a pop up window but then it can never be continued. The planet is now removed which is like taking the only city state in Civ 5 out of the game leaving you with 8 war hungry monsters.\n\nThe game promised multiplayer, Never came.\n\nThere is also options for more then 1 game type but you'll only play one. There are no other game types.\n\nThese are just a few unfinished things. Everything could of been in depht alot more but the developer just slaped a price tag on it and said done. HE ABANDONED THIS GAME TO MAKE ANOTHER. Another good reason to not go into early access. The game is just one giant war leading to your victory, There may be 1 or 2 other secret things to win but they are so hard to do you might as well just declare war on everyone.\n\nMy time came from nearly mods and that only.","January 24, 2014","false","147.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's buggy and shallow with few saving graces. After 57 hours of gameplay I can say without a doubt it was not worth the $7.50 I paid for it.\n\nI wanted to like this game. It has a lot of things I like but it is too frustrating to play. I spent the first five hours of this game just figuring out how to play, finding a good path up the tech tree, creating an initial build queue and understanding the UI to be decent player. That's was OK because I thought after I had that down things would get better but as time went on it just left me on a plateau and I was no more satisfied than when I first figured out how to play.\n\nThings I did enjoy- fitting your own ships with armor, weapons , subsystems and powergrid. Terraforming an ice planet turns it into an ocean planet. The artifacts are a nice touch and assimilation is very useful but comes too late in the tech tree becasue it is not retroactive.\n\nMy first successful empire was based on the good luck of finding a planet with 5 thought crystals. This gave and immense boost to my research abilities and I was quickly outpacing the computer. So whipped up a good ship design and threw it into production immediately and soon I had a decent size fleet ready to be mobilized on anything and I learned my first combat lesson just as quickly. Projectiles and missiles suck pretty hard in this game and energy beam weapons are way overpowered.\n\nWhy? Projectiles miss quite often and require ammo to use which means less space on your ship for armor/shield/powergrid mods and require resupply unless you have the painfully slow ammo fabricator. Missiles are slow and are easily avoidable if you maneuver your ships away from them and also require ammo. Beam weapons almost never miss (I had a beam weapon miss a few times when I paused the game and gave an order to attack then unpaused and the computer fired all weapons even though I was facing the opposite direction from my target? Still haven't figured that one out.) and require no ammo so making a good beam boat or two pretty much seals victory every time.\nAlso want to touch on the "phased ordinance" tech here as this tech allows for a 50% chance of projectiles penetrating shields. You can unlock it twice so you can get 100% penetration but the first unlock is waaaay to early in the tree and there is only one other tech cheaper to start. It seems this was done to compensate for the low hit ratio of projectiles but it just breaks the game for shield users way early on. Don't even get me started on projectile armor penetration as well.\n\nSo I went back and rebuilt my ships with beams and ventured back out this time to steamroll everything in sight and that was pretty fun. After the initial wave of attacks I had reduced my enemies fleet to just freighters and they never seemed to recover. They never built another fleet of any size comparable to the first and this happened every time in every game I played with every race. You have one good fleet fight with the AI and its GG from them.\n\nAlso found out the hard way to never EVER press escape in the fitting window with the arcs overlay. I thought escape would drop the overlay and put you back to the fitting window while actually it will drop you from the fitting screen entirely without the chance to save your design. I always did the weapon arcs last so I lost a few good designs to an errant key press and I quit the games a few times doing that. The escape key is not consistent in the UI and lead me to believe it was more a "go back" button then a "close window" button.\n\nAnd don't forget completely broken ground combat where if you take over from the AI and move your own guys it will allow your troops to automatically fire on each other as if they were the enemy and you have no way of stopping them until the unit dies!!

The game is also highly mod friendly, which is a huge plus in my book.\n\nYou colonize planets, design ships, build fleets, and conquer the galaxy. Simple enough.\n\nProblem is that the game is highly buggy, full of memory leaks and other instabilities. This is a real shame considering how brilliant the game design is.

The amount that goes on in this game after a while starts to get crazy.\n\nThe concept is simple... zoom in and out with the mouse to view the star systems. The navigation that this game play provides is smooth and allows you to get to which system you need to view. The managing system of seeing all of your empires/planets and being able to allocate production is sophisticated enough but the user interface for it was done simply and made easy to use. Diplomacy can work for or sometimes quickly against you with an opposing empire declaring war. Trade routes, non-aggression pacts, war declaration, and even colony claims can be through diplomacy. Planets come in different varieties such as gas planets, Terran, swamp, barren and a few variants. Be sure to start exploring early and claim good planets, but doing so exposes you to aliens. You will find yourself addicted to this game after a while if you like micro and macro managing planets and a multitude of ships. You are also able to create your own ships (from colony ships to cruisers) and the creation system is a neat one at that. There is also an in game fleet design system that by itself makes the game much more easier to play (and to defend against enemies).\n\nWhy I support this game even though it has a lag issues (sometimes with and without the mod) is there is a community out there trying to improve this game. Moreover and more importantly for me, you are able to control a SINGLE UNIT and tell them what to fire. You can't say exactly which guns to use, but none the less this is the right idea in my mind to create a new genre : RPG meets first person shooters. Literally, any unit that's out there, choose to control. I wish more games did this in the sense. Imagine playing Starcraft and you can control a marine. Your marine that you are controlling dies so you automatically jump to the next one or go back to the RPG screen. This to me is brilliant and perhaps even game changing in the future.\n\nI will have to give it a\n\nRATING : 7.9/10\n\nDue to lag issues and a need for a mod but either than that I recommend it - especially on sale.

When I bought it I just left it and never played for about 6 months. But when I picked it up and modded it with Tim's mod,  couldn't stop playing, I haven't had any problems with it, though that might just be because I have a gtx970. And with that mod it was amazing. However, the developer is a bit of an idiot. He has abandoned the game to go on the a sequel. WITHOUT COMPLETEING THE FIRST GAME!!! (but it will have much better land combat, but no more real time space combat :( ) As well some of the promised features never ended up in game, and I would really, really love multiplayer! (which was promised) And finally, the ship design system is awsome and is completely modular so youu can change, edit and completely remake every ship. As a result, I belive you should either try this game for its realatively unique real time space (most other 4x games do this due to preformance problems) or wait for the sequel for a hopefully improved game.\n\nEdit:\nI'm now more optimistic(watched thexpgamer's video on it) about stardrive 2 cause it does have real time combat, but you can only place ships right in front of the enemy and can't get reinforcements in battle.

As a whole the management and construction of an empire works quite well but in combination with wonky AI; a civ 5-esque diplomacy screen with reduced options and strange reactions (allies will quickly turn hostile if the wrong trade is proposed); no counterspying option leaves you to get ravaged by enemy spies; many incomplete or just missing features; no multiplayer; and late-game performance issues (I play it on a laptop so it may just be that) the fun factor quickly turns to frustration late in the game.\n\nA lot of features were also just left out, despite being advertised as either implemented or coming soon on the steam store, and will most likely never be implemented as Zero Sum basically dropped everything in development for the game and focused on the production of a sequel, leaving the first game feeling very incomplete\n\nBUT there are many aspects that work quite well:\n\nThe shipyard feature, for example, is amazing. it allows you to arrange unlocked systems on a ship frame so you can create specialized designs (ie resupply, strike, scout, coloyization etc) and allows you to control thier performance levels.\ntoo many systems bogs down the power supply, shields over armor can be a vulnurability and more massive means slower travel. to name a few things.\n\nthe game is visually stunning. you are able to scale the map from a galactic map down to a single star with orbiting planets. the alien races are all fantastically concieved and there are 8 playable races which can be customized to have a number of positive and negative traits upon starting a new game. each race has its own ship designs, and most of them have unique ground units\n\nI really liked that this game was 4x so that The game flows continuously and allows space battles to occur in real time while the construction and research aspects are turn based progressions. i thought this system worked really well, especially since you can increase the time scaling up to 4x (or more, but not on my laptop) and speed up the slow early stages of the game.\n\n\nUnfortunately the features that i liked did not make up for its short comings, for me at least, and it looks like they will be carried through to the sequel along with countless improvements/features that should have been in this game.\n\nVERDICT: this game is not worth $33CAD\nIf this game appeals to you, then I would wait for the sequel\nIf you've read a fair number of reviews and still want to try it, then wait for a sale to drop the price to $5-10 as there are some mods out there that really add a lot to the game and the game is still enjoyable\n\n","December 30, 2014","false","64.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You'd almost certainly enjoy Star Ruler's much simpler scheme, which ends up achieving far more creative possibility, or GalCiv and skip the hour-long battleship design process entirely.\n\nAutomation? Sounds good, but the AI is pretty terrible at minding itself. If you want to get much done, you're forced to take it into your own hands, and deal with the horrid hotkeys, UI, and the rediculous WASD-control of ships, which makes them unavailable for scrolling around the map. You also can't click-drag. You're stuck with arrow keys or zoom-popping like a schizophrenic rabbit. If you want your empire to do its own thing(but also the way you tell it to), play Distant Worlds, because that game has true and almost total automation options that is as capable as the actual enemy AI(which can get rather brutal, unlike stardrive's rather easy bots).\n\nShip combat doesn't even look that good, or play well. If you want something with tactics, go play MOO, and if you want actual cinematic splosion glory, go GalCiv or endless space. Small ships are gross pixel blobs and large ships just tend to look like a bunch of sausages flopping around.\n\nThere is very little customization available other than the standard race min/maxing before a game starts. Want to slog through a massive galaxy of mostly barren worlds? nope. Want a quick fight between factions already up against each other's shoulders? too bad. Square maps that all play the same. Why not any other game I previously listed, some allowing you to play on 3-d barbell, spherical, or perpedicular galactic arrangements while all allow much more map control. Why was this overlooked?\n\nSo even if you actually get used to panning around on the arrow keys like a geriatric, navigate your way through obtuse and uninformative UI, and after spending hours plugging your ship's weapons into power sockets, what do you get? Well, you'll be dealing with micromanagement forever. Yep, like Civ5 lategame, but more like all game. Governors are idiots, and basically anything you want to do you're going to have to pause the game and painstakingly order it out so that fleet doesn't fly apart in transit and make sure you pay attention to your ground forces so they don't sit there for days doing nothing!\n\nYou don't so much play this game as try to bear it. No matter what your tastes, what you really want is something else.","December 12, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I read all the various reviews and comments, and delayed purchasing it as a result.  I eventually picked it up in a "Humble Bundle."  Frankly, it is one of the better 4X games I've played.\n\nPros:\n\n17hrs in, I've experienced no bugs, crashes or artifacts.\n\nGraphics and music are both moody and appropriate.\n\nColony development is easy, and very Galactic Civilization-like.  It isn't difficult to stay on the "plus" side of the economy.\n\nCombat is is satisfying, both visually and tactically.  You can see which weapons are most effective, and you soon realize combat requires a combined-arms mix of ship types for success.\n\nUnlike Distant Worlds, the AI requires some hand-holding: the game does not play itself.\n\nCons:\n\nLack of information: you are not informed when a ship is in combat, so your scout ships just disappear without warning.\n\nThe tutorials are insufficient to get you started.  There is now a UK manual on Steam, but I had to refer to the user guides on the Steam website before I felt reasonably confident with the game.\n\nShip design is clumsy: you MUST fill every slot on the design matrix, even if your ship would be functional without the extra equipment.  Also, I miss an "UNDO" feature on the design screen.  If a creation isn't working out, you must either change it slot-by-slot, or delete it completely.\n\nAll of my comments are effectively moot: Star Drive 2 is less than a week away from release, so this game will see no further development or polishing.\n\nBottom line: I've gotten much more than my money's worth for this title (which was less than $1 in the Humble Bundle), and my purchasing it gives me a significant discount on the new game (SD2).  I recommend Star Drive to anyone interested in 4X games, particulaly if you can purchase it at the fire-sale prices on Humble Bundle or Bundle Stars.","April 5, 2015","true","33.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

It runs in real time as do the space battles. Ships can be commanded in space battles for full control of targeting.\n\nShip design is really neat.

It may be missing some fleshed out things but the game is definitely playable and fun.\n\nOh, and ground battles are turn based with control over each troop.

I always feel that if i get a buck an hour worth of fun out of a game its worth it.  I also enjoyed the game becuase I did not buy into the game during the early access, so I knew going in that it was going to be only single player, and knew what it had when i got it. I didnt research enough before i got Stardrive or i might not have bought it.  Game does have a few bugs still and i am disappointed with that and the fact that no more updates or multiplayer will be added.

Any 4X, complex strategy game should put a lot of effort into their tutorial otherwise they outcast newcomers to the genre. I'm not a veteran 4X gamer, but I've played my fair share. I eventually did sort of get the hang of everything, but the fact that I was forced to learn mostly manually made my choices very stilted and boring. Like I didn't want to declare war on anybody since I didn't really understand if I'd win or not. I also focused solely on economy because everything else seemed a bit more advanced.\n\nThat said, the game was pretty decent, I just have zero interest in learning a new 4X game without proper learning tools.

The ways ships are designed is one of the best systems I have seen implemented in a game and one I wish other studios would adopt.\n\nNow I did not have many of the problems mentioned by most reviewers so I may have been lucky in that regard. The few crashes I did have were after marathon sessions of 12+ hours of playing. Over the years I tend to encounter very few bugs or other issues in games so I may just be very lucky.\n\nSome of the mechanics weren't well explained but a little trial and error would produce the answer. In my experience if no explanation or trial and error is needed to figure out how a game works then the game has been dumbed down and will offer very little.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the developer not finishing the game and other issues but it ended up being exactly what I expected it to be.

There's not much point researching ships bigger than frigates - all you need are some ships to keep the enemy's ridiculously weak fighter fleets at bay while you infantry rush them.\n\n"Not finished", as others have said, in the sense that the whole game feels very shallow, but it's not buggy enough to really be considered a beta either - I'd call it a finished product, though it's not a great one. Not a bad game in some ways, but very little replay and not worth $30.\n\nYeah, I know I have like 170 hours on this despite saying very little replay. To be frank, I don't usually complete my 4X games because I get frustrated with the late game grindy-ness, and thusly, I did get quite a bit of time on Stardrive, which does certain parts of the mid-game reasonably well. Besides that, I bet at least 100 of those hours was spent designing ships, which is probably the best designed aspect of the game.\n\nBut unfortunately, that is the big issue with the game as well - designing ships, the most interesting part of the game, is not really actually all that important in terms of gameplay. You can certainly min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your transport ships, and design ultra-badass capital ships with hangers (which don't work, by the way) and plague bombs (because you can't blow up planets) and death rays, but in the end it doesn't really matter because you are really only going to build a bunch of frigates armed with super-missiles to crush the pathetic enemy fleet while you infantry rush him. Did I mention you can't blow up planets?\n\nIt sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a specific tactic that works too well, and that someone with my hours is probably just good at the game. What I'm really trying to do here is save you money - this is not the easiest way to win the game, it's how you play the game, period. If you don't do it, the ultra-slow AI will eventually do it to you after several hours of ingame time, or at least try to. I personally used that time to build up a giant empire and a fleet of death ships that squished his little army without me having to do much of anything. Then quit and restarted because I realized that, nope, that was it, and now I'd have to spend two hours invading defenseless planets after I stocked up on cans of SPAM.\n\nNot that you need an empire. You can easily ♥♥♥♥ everyone's day up with 10 planets if you are smart about what you build and research. Hint: Build and research everything, because the AI is slow as a turtle in concrete and will still be using popguns while you rock rocket launchers. There's also only a dozen or so things to build, and everyone has the same research trees, so you don't really need to prioritize well.\n\nAll of this is somewhat redeemed by the multiplayer mode, though. Because humans are not slow as ♥♥♥♥, you actually need to play the game in a fashion that bears some semblance to strategy. Infantry spamming is still the only tactic, but you now do need a proper navy in order to get your troops to the ground. The community is vibrant and great, and you'll find that the people you play against generally are good folks who want to play the game rather than use these kinds of tactics however.\n\nOh, right. :p","May 28, 2014","false","175.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It really did.\n\nUnfortunately, the best I could say about this game is "unfinished". It's got some interesting races, sure, some humor as well, a decent amount of exploration, but at nearly every turn you run into something that just seems... unfinished. Ship classes? Not all implemented for all races yet, so some people get titans, some don't. Follow up an ancient mystery? Your reward is... fighting a giant ship. More than once, if you'd like. First contact? Never mind, that's been cut. Endings? Blow up everyone you're not allied to, that's the only way to win last I checked. The end-game optimization was also lacking, causing the game to choke horribly during battles.\n\nIn short? If you want a great 4X game, buy something like Master of Orion 2 off GoG. It'll be cheaper AND provide more fun than this game, in its current state.","December 31, 2013","false","11.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The game obviously has flaws.\n\nWith that said, I really like the game. Great atmosphere and animation, the shipbuilding is detailed and the combat is fun, the rest is adequate at worst.

Initially I kept getting crushed every game, leading me to concur with negative review posse. However, after giving StarDrive a chance,I feel like it will depend on the individuals 4x gaming expectation. Although there are some issues, StartDrive is a little more nuanced in some areas than others have indicated,for instance, you can join or form alliances, develope a spy network to gain tactical advantage by stealing tech or by sabotaging rival civs covertly. Designing ship loadouts is cool cause it lets you upgrade your fleets tactical capabilities as needed to expand your empire,strengthen alliances and crush the opposition. I enjoyed using covert methods to aquire, or to sabotage a rival civ .I found that SD offers an unpredictable, quirky style that might change whats expected in a 4x space title. In summary SD marries an asymetrical  universe with challenging 4x game play, Stardrive marches to its own drummer  with some in game quirks, but I its worth the price of admission. By the way, the Black Box Mod expands player options and reduces a lot of the the unwanted quirks.

I have to say I have had more fun it would seem than other when playing this game, however, most of the things I see them point out are valid, in that, the game is fairly bad for being a 4x game. Other games like Galactic Civilization and Sins of a Solar Empire I feel better fit and are better overall in tech research, interface, interaction, combat options, etc. However, that doesn't mean I dislike the game overall but if you are looking for a good space strategy I would personally look else where because there are better. I will lastly add that the thing I was most aggervated at was the teraforming as I normally enjoy them but it is just bad as it could take me and hour to get two or three squares open for industry and agriculture and it was a late game thing when, in my opinion, the pace of the game should have made it early to mid game. My favorite thing was the races and how they were designed not really a game thing I know (and I dont mean the A.I.) but i like the concept of them especially the bear and the race with the owl slaves as you can assist the owls in revolting.

I should have known better than to purchase a game without reading the reviews. As stated by the reviews, the game was unplayable due to excessive bugs and lag when first downloaded. However, one thing that I have found very strange about this game is that the more you play it and the more you explore, the less likely bugs are to occur (kindof like the exact opposite of Minecraft). IDK if this happens on everyone's computer or if it is just a wierd quirk of mine, and I have no idea how this could happen in terms of programming, but for about the last hour of playtime (about at 10ish hrs.), I have never seen any lag or not registering clicks to the degree that I first experienced it in the game. I still have some pretty significant trouble with the game not registering my mouse clicks, but it has become at least playable, and the problem is now only a minor annoyance, unlike the total hairpulling frustration upon first download. Sometimes, due to lag, it still registers that I clicked on something that I moused over earlier, rather than what I actually have my mouse over at the time of the click. I wonder if a similar phenomenon caused the programmer(s) to think that the bugs were fixed when they were unable to reproduce reported bugs.\n\nIf you have the patience for the bugs, the game itself isn't too bad. The ability to adjust your species for tactical, RP, or mixed  gameplay allows you to play a species according to your own interpretation of how they are or what they could be. I prefer a much more strategic and magical Vulfen to the brutish, early-game swarmers version that they are set to by default (retaining their militaristic tendancies, because IMO Vulfen aren't really Vulfen if they are too peaceful, but upon player preferance this could be changed too). It does have a fairly Star Trek/Babylon 5 type feel, which I very much appreciate. Diplomacy is critical, and there is a high degree of intrigue involved (though taking the few abilities and technologies for intrigue that exist will make it very simple, as max rank agents can pretty much do as they please at this point, only occasionally getting discovered or even foiled but not killed). Players should keep in mind, however, that there are few guides to this game, and the videos that are out there regarding this game often do not involve enough information to really give you the feel for things. With no tutorials missions, you will likely be completely lost in the beginning, even with deep research. For this reason, I would advise setting up your first species to give you a large margin for error. Additionally, I found race customization to be very confusing initially, but once you get it, it is very straightforward.\n\nI have come to enjoy the game in time, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game for its current price. It is simply too high.","February 16, 2014","false","39.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

It is already well polished for an Early Access game and I daresay is better that some AAA titles that have been released in their final stages.\n\nThe races are varied and interesting on it's own and it even allows you to customize them to suit your own needs while still remaining in a somewhat balanced state.\n\nThe ship building is easy and fun, if I had one critique though, I wish there was a way to test my builds before seeing them utterly fail in battle because I didn't know how a module will react. That said, as it is now is plenty good enough to enjoy the game.\n\nPros:\n- Playable and polished even in early stages, loads of fun to be had\n- Races are a joy to behold as they are varied and rather humorous in their depiction\n- Easy to learn, difficult to master makes this something even a newbie in the genre can pick up.\n\nCons: *but this could change*\n- Currently, ship building doesn't have a way to test builds so guides might be necessary there\n- Increasing tax doesn't seem to have any negative impact at the moment or no value for measurement (ex: colonist morale)\n- Enemy ships don't display their insignia so it could take some practice to know who's fleet is whose in game.","March 17, 2014","true","97.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So lets begin.\n\nWhile the game isn't buggy or unpolished by any means, it's because of the majority of it's design is absolutley awful, not to say everything is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, just most of it. Like the music, a fundamental part of any strategy game whether it's Master Of Orion or Civilization, the music is there to make you feel like a commander of a thousand fleets or a cultured world leader, and in both of the games mentioned the game does a great job doing that. But in StarDrive it's... uhhh... ♥♥♥♥. The music sucks ♥♥♥, It's a bunch of dreary melodies with a few space feeling instrumentals but all of them lack any sense of excitment. And that's the main problem, this game lacks excitment... or fun... or a reason to exist.\n\nI like ProJared's description of the game in his One Minute Review of the game. Hopefully ProJared doesn't mind that I'm gonna quote him.\n\n"It's like they took Master Of Orion 2 and made it realtime and then SUCKED all the fun right out of it."\n\nThat sentence alone can describe the whole game. Really, I could've stopped over a paragraph ago because that perfectly describes this game. And did I mention how this game is as slow as a snail in molases in a slow motion field? Even on the highest speed setting before you start, everything goes so SLOOOOWWWWW that you get bored after five minutes, even with the slightly cool shipyard (I say slightly cool because the best ship designs are the presets so you'll never need to use the shipyard) and the very amusing races. The game is so drab that it counteracts the good, and the game IS UNFORGIVABLY UNFAIR, meaning even on the easiest difficulty the A.I will CRUSH YOU UNDER THEIR BOOTS OF UNBEARABLE CRUELTY AND DELERIUM.\n\nLong story short, don't buy this overpriced crap, buy Endless Space, or hell, If your feeling nostalgic go on GOG.com and pick up Master Of Orion 1+2 for £5 or less. Don't bear the same pain that I did.","January 18, 2014","false","14.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Starting the game for example takes several minutes before I even get the intro videos everybody always skips.\n\nNonetheless, once in the game I generall have a great time. The AI can be overly aggressive, but it draws a good balance between races which attack weaker prey, races who declare war because they see you as a threat, and races who could be peaceful allies (on conquerable foes, depending on your gaming style.)\n\nI'd like to see some small additions, like the ability to save custom race settings and either have them in a droplist or loadable from a file like they already have for custom ship designs.\n\nI really enjoy StarDrive.

Although there are some aspects to the game that is lacking, in particular the weak diplomacy system, the combat is thrilling, and taking over the galaxy is always a good time.\n\nCons, as I stated the tutorials are just non-existant. The AI can be predictable if not boring. And frankly I'm not sure why they even implemented their diplomacy system. Maybe I just don't understand it's mechanics yet, but after playing for nine hours I feel like I should've mastered it, assuming it was functional. The lack of options within the menu can be annoying, there are no difficulty settings. The AI just automagically decide how hard they want to kill you. There are still a lot of annoying bugs. Specifically speaking, large capital ships tend to get "stuck" although their icons continue to move. Ships randomly decide they dont want to attack, but that's more infrequent.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8/10. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is into large scale space battles.","January 17, 2014","true","24.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The ability to design each ship piece by piece and then set their AI. Want a large slow ship with all weapons pointing forward to hammer other large ships?

The diplomacy system is not ground breaking but quite adequate.\n\nThe only down side, and it's a big one, is the slow down you experience late game.

Is it the complete experience you've long for? Unfortunately, no, probably not.  However, a good selection of features, and the module layout based ship creator, allow for some classic MoO style fun and enjoyment.\n\nThe original launch of the game in early access had some issues from what I've read, but StarDrive was one of those games on my "To Play" list for almost a year before finally coming around to it after the latest patch (1.15 of this writing).  The core gameplay is there, but a tech tree that's lacking much depth is probably the most glaring flaw I've experienced in my playthroughs.\n\nThis lack, thankfully, can be remedied with a mod which adds much more MoO-like tech tree into the game.  The current non-mod tech layout allows for a very balanced approach that was likely intended for multiplayer(which as of yet hasn't surfaced), with early ship designs still being marginally useful against even high tech ships late in the game.  For fans of MoO2 and it's tech singularity that often happened late game (Psilons, anyone?), this is a mixed blessing.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the ship creator is the main feature of the game, and the one I've had the most enjoyment from.  Going in blind, you'll come up with design iteration after iteration, and love each one as much as the one before.  Every module has a certain length and width that you try and shoehorn into the various ship hulls, with each race having a specific design.  There's generally an overall "feel" for each race's ships (such as long, relatively narrow hulls that allow for greater head on armor layouts for Terrans, or a greater number of possible weaponry on Kulrathi), and even the actual shape of the ship's hull can have very drastic effect when combat comes to your fleets.\n\nThere is a slew of ease of use features in the game which makes play more friendly on the UI front.  Unfortunately, a lack of any decent game provided documentation makes some of these a complete secret until they're stumbled upon and discovered.  Definately do some searching for UI tips and tricks for this one.\n\nThe tougher AI levels allows for some challenge, but expect the game to be a fairly easy breeze until you design some better ships for the AI to utilize.  The game has some of the spark of MoO, but it's not a drop-in replacement for it.\n\nOverall, I'm in love with StarDrive for what it is, not what it was promised or wished to be.  At it's core, it's engaging and enjoyable.  Hopefully the next offering from Zero Sum will be full spiritual successor that we long for, but this one is better than most MoO clones that pop up now and again.","February 25, 2014","true","40.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

It was buggy, incomplete, and, as a result, it entirely deserved the low scores it received.\n\nSince release, however, the developers have worked hard to plug the holes and fill the gaps. The game is now, especially on sale, one that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.\n\nThe strongest differentiator that sets StarDrive apart from competitors is the ship design. While some games allow you to choose your ship's weapons or shields, in StarDrive you build a ship from an empty hull to a bristling space cruiser. You select exactly where you want bulkheads, power plants, command centers, weapon banks, and sheild generators to be placed. As the research tree fills in, you'll open up even more opportunities to build new, larger hulls or moditfy your existing blueprints.\n\nAnother area I enjoyed in StarDrive was the factions. Each faction is extremely unique in design and carries with it a lot of flavor. Whether your negotiating with the honorable but militant pandas or the robotic faction that's enslaved a race of owls - you'll find interactions to be a lot more interesting than the sterile diplomacy of many other games in this genre.\n\nIn the end, StarDrive is exactly what it sets out to be: a 4x Space Strategy game with a robust ship builder and real time combat. If that sounds like it's up your alley, then I think you won't be dissapointed.","July 15, 2013","true","21.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"

This game has one play mode, Sandbox, in which starting out, you have one planet and a few spaceships, and you must find a way to colonize beneficial planets on the road to galactic empire. Other alien species will be right next door, and your actions can (possibly) decide whether or not war will ensue. There is a full tech tree and a very simple, yet important management system that you, as leader, must lead. Sweet and ultimate victory will not be achieved until every species you meet is either your friend (boring) or completely eradicated to the point of extinction (yay). If you decide to be an Adolf Hitler, you can with the ability to bombard any planet's (and I mean ANY) surface with nuclear weapons and murder every last thing that resided there. Did I mention there is also a full ship constructor as well? You can create your own vision of whatever the Super Star Destroyer was in Episode VI of Star Wars during the two minutes it was on screen, and giant, flying pieces of metal with a million death rays are always fun. But this game is SOOOO repetitive! Every game you start up will have the same sequence of events happen, and no matter what you do, they always seem to take place. There's no multiplayer(Note to creator of StarDrive: Make this happen!), and even with mod support, what is in the game to be modded will take a LOT of creativity to make something out of. This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but in order for a consumer to get his/her money's worth PLEASE wait for a sale(like me). ZeroSum, you have a rough diamond here, and polishing has been done, but it is far from the Hope Diamond. 7.25/10.","February 14, 2014","true","30.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Ship designing:\nThis is excellent; module positioning really matters in combat. If you fill the interior with lots of reactors, they'll blow up when destroyed and will probably destroy your ship from the inside out.\nShields are not 'all around' your ship but instead only protect areas they're near to, so don't forget to place lots of armour to soak up the hits that get through.\nThere really aren't enough ship hulls and modules; each empire only gets 1 hull for each hull type (i.e. frigate, cruiser, battleship, titan etc.). Reactors never get an upgrade. Sub-light maneuvering speeds are much too low.\n\n2. AI:\nThe AI for the other players is poor - they don't expand very much and they have a tendency to get angry about every single system you colonise. They are very, very bad at fighting and will only cause you trouble if you ignore your military for the entire game (which they'll also taunt you for doing). Their art however is really nice and each empire has its own set of ship types.\nThere's a nice automation dialogue that lets you automate the building and usage of scouts, freighters, and subspace projectors.\n\n3. Research:\nResearch feels a little slow for me. The tech tree is pretty sparse and could use some more mid/end-tier stuff.\nThere are two (maybe three?) 'discovered' secret techs which appear according to what you do in the game. This is something the developer never got around to adding more of, which is a real shame.\n\n4. Early Access 'dev didn't implement X':\nI hear this a lot, and it seems to make up most of the reviews here. This game does feel like the dev gave up when it was 80% finished. I didn't buy this game in Early Access (Humble Bundle had it for $4) so if you're not sure, buy this on sale.","December 20, 2014","true","33.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I simply love this space space strategy game. its almost like old school turn base but its real time. so use pause alot when clicking on some things. reminds me of starcontrol and starcontrol two. But you can built a empire!\n\n\nShip design is for me the heart of the game, ship hulls are different for different civilizations. The fun part is how you use different components into the ship design to beat the other civilizations. since they have access to the same tech research as you. seeing your superior designs destroy them!! LIke a fleet of meat into your meatgrinder!\n\nFor example my favorite is the Kulrathi aka bearmen their ships might not be the fastest(not too many engine slots, you can put in different type of engines into that slot). but their fighter are the largest in the game. I love putting in fighter bays(they spawn fighters(free fighters)) into all my Titan ships(they are the largest hull type every civilization gets, each civilization has different sizes and shapes of that hull). I love putting in remnant shields onto the fighters and tons of weapons and no wrapdrive only thrust. They can be respawn from the carrier. Park the carrier slightly farther away from the fighting. wave after wave of fighters just destroy anything in their path.\n\nWith many patches later they fix the Remnant quest. Also remnant tech is always the most powerful in game. There are a few mods out there but the ones that still out there is fun.","February 6, 2014","true","557.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Star Drive a unique 4x game in that it does everything in real time. Now, Sins of a Solar Empire did the same, but get this: no phase lines here!  Go any where you want!\n\nThis can lead to some preformance issues, as when you have transport ferrying things between planets and a  fleet fighting a bunch of ships at the same time things can slow down a bit.\n\nAlso keep in mind this is not Space Empires, the rules here are differnt, you will have a bit of a learning curve here to learn the rules of this game. The Galaxy is also kinda bland. There are not many features in it besides Planets and Stars, you will not be encountering asteroids, a  Black Hole, or nebulas.\n\nHowever, the game it's self is fun and worth a look if you are a fan of 4X space games. The ability to design your own ships is nice, and the game has some cool visual effects. The differt empires you come across are full of character and varied.  The same planet rush situation is present in this game, grab what you can when you first start, but make sure you chose rigth and supply the planet with food until it can produce on its own!\n\nCons\n-  not all features in when it first came out\n-  tech tree not that extensive... but there are mods you can easly add in.\n-  Map has planets and Stars, not a whole lot more then that.\n\nPros\n-  Unique real time 4X game for those of you tired of hitting the end turn button. ships go boom.\n-  Exploring the galaxy and encountering the races is alwasys fun in this game.\n-  Mod support.\n-  Designing your own ships is fun.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent game..... When its on sale. I don't know about the $30 price tag. But if you are willing to support an indie developer with some cool ideas then give it a shot.","September 19, 2014","true","135.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I am a fan of this game but there could be a lot more to it seeing how old it is. However for the time, effort, and abilities of Zerosum Games it is a good game. There are ups and downs to the game. (A lot of downs)\nThere are a few bad things about the game though. First there are some lag issues and stability problems. The game lags a bit when a lot of action is going on in a large galaxy. Second is mods. The whole game relies on mods at this stage to keep players interested and the game has a open mod folder to simply load one into. The website even comes with a tutorial on how to mod the game. Third is you have to be very meticulous to see what is going on when and where.\nThe game focuses more on combat than economy or events. The game has events but none have any significance or really game changing results whether that'd be good or bad. Events have changed over the year this game has officialy been out, that means a few events were removed, others added or tweeked. Economy is good but needs more to it as well. The game has two resources, food and production. Food is used to feed your race and production is used from building structures to ships. Other than that it doesnt get any more complicated. The only tricky thing about economies is taxing and distributing resources.\nCombat offers a lot to the game seeing how that is the soul focus of gameplay. Ships can be custom designed with a traditional grid pattern and using moduels to fill them in. The possibilities are practicaly endless when it comes to combat.\nDev did abandon the game unfortunatly. After the full game came out updates have become rare. The game has absolutely no purpose but sort of sandbox game letting you do as you please. The only downside to that is there is no story to the game, no story or big explanation about the mysterious "Remnant" race. All we get as far as story to any AI alien race is a short three sentence paragraph FROM the AI. And all we get for story behind the "remnant" is a short mini event quest that, when summed up, gives literaly a short two paragraph explanation on them.\nThe game feels very open and at times too open. There needs to be more content before this becomes a real game because at this stage it does seem like a very high quality app than a full game.","April 27, 2014","true","143.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Star Drive a unique 4x game in that it does everything in real time. Now, Sins of a Solar Empire did the same, but get this: no phase lines here!  Go any where you want!\n\nThis can lead to some preformance issues, as when you have transport ferrying things between planets and a  fleet fighting a bunch of ships at the same time things can slow down a bit.\n\nAlso keep in mind this is not Space Empires, the rules here are differnt, you will have a bit of a learning curve here to learn the rules of this game. The Galaxy is also kinda bland. There are not many features in it besides Planets and Stars, you will not be encountering asteroids, a  Black Hole, or nebulas.\n\nHowever, the game it's self is fun and worth a look if you are a fan of 4X space games. The ability to design your own ships is nice, and the game has some cool visual effects. The differt empires you come across are full of character and varied.  The same planet rush situation is present in this game, grab what you can when you first start, but make sure you chose rigth and supply the planet with food until it can produce on its own!\n\nCons\n-  not all features in when it first came out\n-  tech tree not that extensive... but there are mods you can easly add in.\n-  Map has planets and Stars, not a whole lot more then that.\n\nPros\n-  Unique real time 4X game for those of you tired of hitting the end turn button. ships go boom.\n-  Exploring the galaxy and encountering the races is alwasys fun in this game.\n-  Mod support.\n-  Designing your own ships is fun.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent game..... When its on sale. I don't know about the $30 price tag. But if you are willing to support an indie developer with some cool ideas then give it a shot.","September 19, 2014","true","135.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Okay first off I won't lie. I was worried about putting down 30 bucks for this game when I first came across it, even though I LOVE 4x space games. It's Metascore  is only a 61, but came across it during the Summer Sale and it was as low as 10 bucks.\nSo I went ahead and bought it.  LOVING IT!!!  It's how I wish Sins of a Solar Empire had played. Love everything about it. From building my own ships, to the races you can use, to how the map is random each and everytime.\n\nI've heard it tends to crash on people, but I haven't had this happen yet. Are there bugs in the game? Sure. IS the dev working on them? Yes he is. Slowly but surely.\n\nIt's worth the 30 bucks, plus it give money to the guy who deserves it!\n\nMy score for this one is 8/10\n\nUpdate:\n\nMy rating above still stands for the version of the game I bought and played abck then. I believe it was patch number 1.13. I could be wrong. But after the next patch to follow which brought to the game the pre-warp idea. The way "ALL" ships would fly around changed.\nI'm pretty sure it was suppose to be just fighters that got this change, but in the end even Cap ships would fly around acting like fighters. Kind of funny watching them do big ♥♥♥ U-turns and wide ♥♥♥ swings (going way off the screen and turning around to hend back into the fight.)\nI and a few others posted about this problem along with how it seems the weapons on your ships would all fire at the same time in all directions and missing just about every shot.\n\nSo mt score stands the same for the older version I bought and played. The new one I give a 2 out of ten, as this one thing throws my whole game out of the window for me.\n\nMaybe in another 4 or so months I'll give this another try and see if it was ever fixed.\nBut seeing the Dev has stated that it was done and he was happy where it was and off to work on another game with a new engine based on SD....Yeah.

The one downfal is how essential your starting placement is.  Dont have enough early colony's available with some expansion planets in them you will have a severe disadvantage moving forward.  That said, the long game is just that, long.  Expect to dedicate time to keeping your fleet up to date and include it in your stratagey.  Multiple smaller fleets are the way to push ahead so one can be out expanding your empire while another is defending it while another is being refit.  All in all I do say a 60% is a deserving score, and not bad for a first game out.  While there are better 4X games out there, I dont feel I got shorted on what I payed.  Put more than enough hours in to justify the money.

THE most fun thing to is obviously the ship design. In my experience, you can take the basic frieght ship from the start of the game, outfit it with nuclear reactors, and then crash them into the enemy. You can create ships, that spew out dozens of tiny fighter drones. You can create ships bristling with poisonous spores, and then bombard your helpless enemies ground forces. You can assume direct control over titan ships, driving them like Jesse Pinkman in the Need for Speed movie. You can launch an armada of mobile space marines that can board and control enemy ships. I could keep going for a long time.\n\nEvery piece of this game isn't just a statistic that somehow affects the game. If you research something, you will be able to see it, and use it. If you give some technology to another race, they will remember your kindness (even if they remember it as they are using that same technology to annihalate you).\n\nIve gone on for longer than i intended which just goes to show how much I like this game.

If you dont thing the game itself goes into detail like it should then try a mod, there are plenty out there that do a good job at giving you even better immersion. Tihs game still has plenty going for it and is amazing in my opinion. (This is why i have so many hours put into it)\n\nHowever there is one thing that kills it where it lies and that is the fact the developer does not update the game. Also this game is not finished as it looks like it was stoped in the "work in progress" area of the game development. It is sad that this has been done to a game with so much potential.\n\nOne thing that still makes this game buyable is the fact that you can go and get mods for the game which will make it much more enjoyable.","May 16, 2013","true","238.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They have seemed minor from my perspective, and far from game breaking. Crashing is infrequent once you realize what settings your computer can handle as it is a hardware hungry game. Don't play with anything less than the reccomended equipment.\n\nThere are some things that I would have loved to see done differently but I'm not the one who created the game, I'm a player that, like all other players, wants things in my favor.

However from an objective standpoint i can't possibly call it a bad game, quite the opposite. As a person who doesn't play alot of strategy games but enjoys a select few, i not only think this game is excellent but my favorite space strategy game that I have ever played. The controls and interface are both simple and easy to use/learn, the graphics are excellent (for an indie game) and the diplomacy is amazing where you start in a neutral position and actually have options besides war against some races. The ship building is deep and complex and requires alot of thought and balancing. The whole game is exceptionally balanced (weapons, armor, species creation) and finally the races are varied and each have their own distinct personallity. If I have any gripes it would be that the "tutorial" doesn't really tell you much and there is alot you will need to figure out yourself (or google). I for one am looking foward to the sequel and also hope the developer has learned his lesson from all the negative reviews.","December 14, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It felt like I was playing against a group of stroppy children (not helped by the Pollop race's dialog) and after a while it ceased being humerous and just became annoying.\n\nThe space combat is... interesting, the developers have obviously tried to use newtonian physics in the combat and it actually does feel quite good.... until your cruiser power-slides round a planet or your ships refuse to orbit a planet.\n\nThe ground combat is..... horrific, and not in an amusing way either. it's clunky and feels like a bad browser game interface.\n\nThe ship customisation though is a serious strong point for this game and for me it almost outweighs all the annoyances and the learning curve. I probably spent almost as much time in the shipyard over the past couple of days as I have actually playing the game.\n\nThe tech tree and progression is okay, though it's pretty obvious that half the tech concepts are inspired by, if not simply ripped from, the Star Trek universe. Polaron, phasor (yes, they just swapped an e for an o), disruptor etc.\n\nIn summary, if you get it with a bundle or you REALLY want to try it and it's a slow weekend then go for it. For all it's issues, I found the experience enjoyable overall... even if I probably won't be playing the game any more.","January 31, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It isn't outstanding either.\nIt has some nice ideas especially the shipdesigner is great, probably the best around and watching the spacebattles is real fun (I say "watching", because the pilots do not really need your help once the dogfight starts). On the other hand the empiremanagement is very unchallengeing, almost nothing to do and to put it blunt: Best you leave it to the AI so you can concentrate on the big picture.\n\nNow, what is the problem with this game? Why wouldn't I recommend it?\nWell my downgrade has nothing to do with the quality of the game itself, but with the simple problem that the developer didn't implement all the features promised, but instead realises them in a different version of the game named "Stardrive 2". I wouldn't complain if he simply made part 1 and then turned to work on a better part 2, like many other developers do. But he's implementing features in part 2 that were explicitly promised for part 1.\nSo, downgrade for bad management.\n\nBut if you enjoy ship desinging and watching space combat, you might give it a shot if you can get it for a 75% discount.","October 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can publish a list of features that you desire to add if possible, but you only promise the core elements.  And then once in production, you do not just abandon the project to start a new game, especially a sequel.  It is an unwritten contract between the dev and the buyer that you will deliver a working game with as few bug as possible.\n\nAs this game exists, the dev simply wasted to many development hours on a single feature.  The ship designing options in this game are hands down one of the best that I have seen.  You have so much control within the constraints put in place.  However, the whole purpose of a ship design is to utilize it in its function, typically combat.  And while combat is decent and some what fun, you need an economy to support it, and Stardrive simply does not have a well working economic model.\n\nIn fact, the game ends up punishing you for the 1st 30 min to hour of play.  1st by making you feel like you need to grind a bunch of base technologies just to be capable of performing the basic functions of a 4x game.  You will need new planets to expand you economic abilities, but you will feel you need 4 technologies before you can successfully colonize a planet: a food tech, a production tech, an income tech, and the ability to expand on to prohibited terrain.  However, if you focus on these techs to quickly start expanding, the AI comes and smacks you around because your military is weak.  So lets say you focus on military techs (like guided missiles and armor; yah, no armor before this tech), your units are capable of carrying a basic fight, but the AI has now colonized any half-decent planet on the map.  But then you say to yourself, I've got a big military I will just invade a weaker AI.  Welp, hope your like rebels suddenly poping up on your worlds with no prior indication of unrest because your income rate cannot support even a half decent fleet unless you colonize new worlds.  But wait you say, I'll just build a smaller but higher tech fleet; nope.  Not enough fire power to successfully invade a AI held world because unsuprisingly the AI has a fleet just as big if just a bit smaller but like 3x the troops you were able to build.  And all of this early game will determine whether you will win or loose late game.\n\nHowever, this is not to say you cannot do well.  If you get lucky, the random map has placed habitable planets as neighboring systems, given you one of the less aggressive races as a neighbor, and not block those systems with hostile drones.  If you can survive this early game, the game can be a good bit of fun.  At least up until some late game bug or unfixed feature ends your fun.\n\nA game should not punish players for trying to perform the tasks the game demands or make them slog through a list of Techs that can make or brake their game just to successfully perform those tasks.","May 27, 2015","false","31.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first played the game, it was glitchy and lacking in AI complexity. The amount of enjoyment (frustration) I got from the amount of time invested just didn't make sense for me to continue playing the game in it's initial release form. So I shelfed it thinking that the Developer would finish the game via patches, add the content promised during funding, and make the game more enjoyable and stable. I came back about a year later to suffer the same errors and buggy gameplay I did on release. Now in 2016, several years after release, I find that the game only recieved updates for the first year or so: http://www.stardrivegame.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=9&sid=624bfa8276f66f0aa7b92e807eb641b3\n\nTo make matters worse - I now see the developer has made StarDrive 2.

The AI does not think long-term and the UI is very limited.\n\nThat said, the mods section leads to some very impressive mods, and has an excellent Star Trek mod on ModDB (recommend).

It has good looks.\n\nIt unfortunately lacks polish.\n\nThe game is unfinished in many regards, but to me more than anything else is the balancing system within it. It just doesn't feel rounded out well enough to truly be considered finished. There are some bugs, glitches, and at times a good deal of rough edges to it. The gameplay is clunky, its approach leaves it too easy to overlook the time spent and the overal mechanics are hit and miss. That issue of the feel hits me in two regards, and the major one is how the empire grows and develops feels forced, and does it in a way that makes growth sluggish untill you hit a stage of performance where you just jump leaps and bounds. the staggering hiccup there just jarrs the whole gameplay on edge. It shows in combat if you don't hit the growth right before the AI does and you try combat.\n\nSpecifically the combat. systems designed to fulfil certain roles just don't. Many instances of the combat I am frustrated with how the AI will always outperform the player, and even on basic combat levels it shows to a starkingly annoying degree. The fleet system and ship controls on it sound good, but lacking that final polish to really make it a good system leaves much to be desired in combat - especially if you need to travel with ships capable of different speeds.\n\nI like the lpooks, some of the mechanics are done well I think - but lacking that balance and refinement to really turn this into a good game.\n\nIf you want to see, wait for a good sale maybe, but I would argue just stay away.","October 12, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Glitches, crashes, saves corrupting, it all sucks. The basic gameplay is fun, but the game is unfinished, as-in prelaunch. It's a beta, not a finished product. The developers have completely moved onto a sequel instead of finished the game they already produced, and the reviews I'm hearing for that game sound exactly like this review. User content patches do what they can, but they can't finish the game for the producers.\n\nThe overall gameplay is fun, if you can get past the awkward GUI.\n\nShip building is complicated and fun. Building and conquering is well balanced. I just can't get past the GUI.\n\nFrankly, the GUI in this game is terrible, it's my number one complaint of this whole game. This is strange coming from the developers of Endless Space which has a perfect, smooth, awesome GUI.\n\nWhat's wrong with the GUI you ask? Several things.\n-Clicking on a button doesn't "always" click it. It just doesn't respond... it just.... doesn't....\n-Opening and closing the windows is awkward. The close button changes locations on every screen and disappears completely on others.\n-They tried to integrate some UI stuff from Endless Space, such as right clicking a window to make it close. However, it's not availble on every screen, so it just takes some testing and memorizing to find out which screen closes with right click which screen doesn't.\n-Information on several screens is just a mess, while on others it's just a massive block of text. Nothing seems to be organized very well or effeciently.\n-Ship selection is the biggest complaint I have of the GUI.\n-You can make control groups just fine, but shift + # doesn't add the current selection to the #'d control group. Having the control group you want to add to selected and shift+click-drag doesn't help either because that selects non-military ships as well.\n-You can't unselect a ship from the selection panel in the bottom left corner.\n-Ships move at different speeds, but there's no way to make a fleet/control group to move at the speed of the slowest ship.\n\n\nOverall, it just feels strange to navigate the UI. Some may call this nit-picking, but I don't. A game like this needs a smooth and fluid UI to be able to manage everything easily and quickly, while getting all the information you need on the fly. This game does not deliver on that.\n\nAnother con of this game is the sound design. When ships are fighting, most of the time, you don't hear anything at all. Sometimes you hear the ship firing, and you get a 1/100 chance for the sound of the weapons firing to BLOW OUT your speakers. Turning the volume down doesn't help because then you can't hear any of the other sounds in the game. So, inevitablly, you just end up turning off the sound completely to avoid the jump scare every few minutes.\n\nAfter muddling through this game's crummy GUI, getting my ears checked by my doctor, and reloading the game through the crashes and the MASSIVE glitches, I'd give this game a D. Would not recommend this headache.","July 28, 2015","false","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will run into a few problems though. The AI, DOES NOT LIKE TO LOSE. You WILL get a start point bordered on all sides by aggressive civilizations. HALF OR MORE of all worlds within easy warp distance will be inhabited by "remnants" (hostile powerful aliens) or one terrible planet or none habitable. HALF OR MORE or all colonies you establish that are not close to your capital will be destroyed by enemy raiders unless you have the credits to employ a large and useless early military that drags your economy down. The game WILL let you create a race with traits that will make it a completely unviable race. IF you do not research the agricultural/biodome line first, you will probably lose, but if you don't get to planetary defenses fast enough after, you will still lose.\n\nGood game, but still rough around the edges in the balance category. 7/10 - Fun but frustrateing.","December 31, 2013","true","55.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

After being released a while ago it still feels like an unfinished beta version of the game. Based on the forums, it doesnt look like the developer will ever finish the game because they've already started on thier next one. The game freezes, crashes, wierd buggyness, confusing as hell and is not polished in a lot of areas, but that all being said, its a lot of fun.\nThink a much slower and less refined civ game based in space. I dont want to compare it to the other space games. I put it on easy mode, researched everything explored every nook and such and still didnt understand some of the mechanics. Then i built several massive dreadnaut class capital warships with intertial dampeners, filled one with nukes and another with the best shields and weapons money could buy and just walked through everything. That was fun. I really wish the devs would take the time to really finish this game, build in the tooltips and not make it impractical to research and such.\nShip building is awesome, its a bit much for me but if you really get into it, theres some crazy things you can do with it.\nResource management is like any other civ game. Its a bit quirky but theres some nice differences to set it apart from the rest.\nThe diplomacy stuff is meh, I was never good at dimplomacy but the 'tone' option you have on all responses really is a neat thing.\nThe slowness is a good and bad thing, sometimes a speed adjustment would be nice, but other times I couldnt hit the pause button quick enough.\nAside from any other unpolished based complaints, my big issue was with the notification system. My fleet could have gotten into a huge ambush or intercepted by the 'remnant' forces and I would have never known. It got me quite a bit of times and I'd never want it to be like civ which I think has notification overload but there needs to be more. I had a smaller map and its just too much to keep track of.\n\nI dont know the cost of the game now, its definitely worth checking out, I only spent like 8 bucks on the sale so that was worth it, but dont expect it to be the next MoO and if you dont know what that is, then thats good, just go with it. I'll check it out six months from now and maybe I'll change my tone from 'threatening' to 'pleading' for forgiveness and like the wasteland 2 game I hope it happens, but this isnt even an early release.

And given the negative reviews I kept reading about it, I lowered my expectations greatly and bought the game on massive sale.\n\nOnce I actually played the game, I actually wound up enjoying it quite a bit.   I can't recall how many hours I've spent and how many "races" I've created in trying the game.  I'll try to rate the game on a 5-star system on each of the areas that I can think of:\n\n1.) Graphics - 4/5\n- I truly enjoyed the graphics.  I really did.  Being able to zoom in to my ships, the combat animations, the effects of each weapon being unique in their own right.  I especially like the unique ship designs for each race which attempted to match their species.  A little cliched, but then again, what game isn't nowadays?\n\n2.) UI - 3/5\n- Simple enough and inuitive.  A few grips would be on some screens where it seems like the UI was designed with a different resolution in mind.  I have an old monitor only capable of 1280 x 1024 and it stuggles on the setup screen due to odd text wrapping.  Other than that however, I felt the UI easy enough to navigate.\n\n3.) Gameplay - 3.5/5\n- I found myself in several sleepless nights playing that "one more turn" (or in this case, one more minute given it's real time).  The racial creation allows for varied types of empires to play around with and with each game randomizing the different empires behavior, it's always been a treat for me.  However, there is one glaring bug around the "plot" where if the AI winds up wiping out the triggers, you're SoL if that was your main goal for that particular round of gameplay.  I've actually had to go in to the XML save files to try to re-trigger the events which is never a good sign.  Still, that plot isn't the end-all-be-all of the game and isn't a deal-breaker for me.\n- Another nice twist is the actual race creator.  Unlike a true "creator", you simply overwrite a species for the current game.  However, any designs you create while playing that "race" become available to the AI in succeeding games so you eventually wind up fighting your own designs which was a real treat when I saw it happen.\n\n- Related to gamelay, there are a few things which could have been improved on in my opinion.   Tech Tree, for one, is smaller compared to other 4X games.  It only feels large due to the amount of research points needed to unlock higher tiers.  The AI also sometimes behaves oddly despite their racial setting at game time (i.e. an Honorable AI will sometimes keep stealing from you despite being in an non-agression pact).\n\n4.)  Replayability - 3/5\n- I admit I keep replaying the game.  For me, it's been enjoyable.  However, I do see 2 problems which can hinder it in other cases:\na) Memory optimization: unlike other RTS games (which this game has flavors of), there is no unit cap other than your bank account (i.e. turn-by-turn income).  This is both a blessing and curse.  This means that you can build up quite the fleet and swarm your way through the galaxy.  Unfortunately this also means unless you've got godly amounts of RAM (and I'm talking 16+ GB of RAM), your game can quickly grind to a halt and crash as the AI will spam ships like no tomorrow.   Even the "final plot story" can break your game should you unlock it given that it also spams ships like no tomorrow (without the limitation of a factory's output to slow it down).  Related to this, beware of designing "cheap" gunboats.  As the race creator "overwrites" a species, any design you create becomes available to that AI race and it tends to favor spamming those cheap gunboats.\nb) No multiplayer.  I never expected this feature as I never was an early backer.  I can see how this would put off others as the challenge of beating down your frenemies always extends the life of a game.  The lack of this feature can put off many people from getting the game.\nc) Lack of a real "custom" race.  MOO2 had the same issues but it would have been nice to have a custom race that didn't overwrite existing ones.\n\n5.) Overall - 3/5\n- I liked MOO3.  Yes, I said it.  I actually came to like game.  StarDrive feels like what MOO3 tried to be.  4X strategy with RTS gameplay.  StarDrive for me is an enjoyable single-player 4X game which allows for some small to medium scale games.  Large games are completely out of the question due to the memory problem which would have raised the game to 4/5 or me.  If you ignore what was originally promised and take the game for what it is now, it's actually worth a try.\n\nI would purchase it when it's at least 50% off given the isssues and replayability challenges it may give others.\nFor the current price of $32.99 CDN, I would instead spend it on Space Empires V or Pandora as they have a bit more replayability for most in my opinion.","January 3, 2015","true","220.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I've probably put in around 20-30 hours now, and I must say I find this game really addicting. The user interface takes a little time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, the game's dynamics are pretty fun. The game is technically turn based in a sense, but turns are measured by time (every 5 seconds) which you can alter during gameplay, or even pause to get your orders out first, so the game is actually played as if all in realtime. In ship combat, you basically just tell your ships to attack the bad guys, so if you like to manuever fleets and such this game may not be for you. You manage just about everything for your species, which is pretty neat. And of course, you design your ships if you want. It may be time consuming, but is pretty fun. You choose a hull type, and then you are responsible for setting up the rest. Also, when you create a new ship, don't name it the same as ships you already have in play, because then you won't be able to refit your current ships. All in all, I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10. It is fun, and as you keep progressing, you can't help but to want to stick around and see what comes next. The graphics are fine, nothing super spectacular, but are still decent enough. I wouldn't pay 30 bucks for the game, but for 10, absolutely.","March 17, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

What is so frustrating that it wouldn’t take much to fix the issues, as far as I see them, and make it fantastic. Unfortuanly I have owned the game for several months and no update has come out and I don’t think one will unless no buys the sequel because of all the negative reviews of this one, which basically all say exact same thing.\n\nThis game really frustrates me. I like the idea and the game play. I really like the ship building element but due to the lack of different weapons it is a bit limited. The idea behind the remnant is very nice.\nThat’s the good part but now onto the bad.\nFor one it isn’t finish and if this is the finished game then there are some major issues with it. For starters even though every different spices has their own ship designs, which I like, they all use the same weapons and that irritates me. I know it makes it easier for stealing tech or giving it as a gift but to me it looks like a cop out.\nThe story line with the remnant is simply not finished. You build the finial building and suddenly you win and there is no explanation of what they were, where they came from and what happened to them that only powerful robotic ships are left.\nThe Ai is really predicable and irritating. You can be nice to one spices and get them to ally with you become your friend but if you make one trade proposal they don’t like you can lose all your trust with them in one go just like you weren’t even allies with them and you had just met. If you are allies with someone then that only means they won’t attack you, unless they revoke the alliance, but they will still try and steal you tech and have no consideration about the planets they take.\nThe game as so much potential and, before I realised that the developer had dropped it to work on a sequel, I was really looking forward to multiplayer to be introduced. I paid £25, ish I can’t remember the exact amount, for a game has been published and then not completed.  Having said that the game is good and I like it but after a while its problems have started to really annoy me and I for one won’t be buying the sequel until I know for sure the developers haven’t published and unfinished game again.","September 26, 2014","true","111.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I sank a decent number of hours into this game but that was mainly because the pace of the game is slow, and after a while I ran out of new content ( wasn't worried though as I knew it was early access - my mistake ).\n\nMy advice, buy Stardrive2, it looks like how I assumed Stardrive1 was GOING to be before the developer(s) up and left it, abandoned. I'm just glad I got this game on sale 75% off, so I can't be too salty about it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have just played Stardrive 2\nThey changed the best parts of Stardrive completely, turns no longer play in real-time, the shipyard is worse - however they did add the ability to add upgrades to modules which I liked, the research system meant that you couldn't unlock every tech in the game without a silly race attribute, the space combat is slow and boring, ground combat is simple and the graphical 'improvements' make the game look weirdly cheap.\n\nBearing all this in mind...\nMy new advice, do NOT buy Stardrive 2 unless you want a more MOO3 type game, do buy Stardrive 1 - when it goes on sale - and mod it, with a community mod or something.

It still feels like it's in dev because there's still enough bugs and patches that are needed but it's still playable. Sadly the game feels like there is so much more potential yet it hasn't or will not tap into.\n\nThe game itself allows you to customize your own ships with a large variety of weapons, shields, armor, equipment, and whatnot. You can then make fleets of those ships and fight against other factions. The diplomacy in the game is better than what the civilization series has accomplished. You actually get rewarded quite well for being diplomatic instead of being completely warlike. Also the galaxy exploration is fun too. You can send out scouts looking for suitable planets for colonization and you can build your solar galaxy in between planets and can connect them with trade systems and territorial markers.\n\nI would highly recommend this game if you love sci-fi space battles and the civilization series.","July 13, 2013","true","59.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

You are also giving different ship frames where you can customize how it is armored and armed square by square. It's an interesting thing, but this leads to a few problems.\n\nShip battles don't really have any sort of micromanagement, even smaller ships turn slowly. Ship AI is also lacking.  Also building new ship designs is also a timesink, especially when constantly researching new weapons.  This would be a huge problem in multiplayer.. which unfortunately there is none.\n\nThe game is still getting updates, but it's hard to justify a fullpricetag.\n\nIf it's on sale, it's is worth the time.\n\n","July 13, 2013","true","53.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

It did have some issues initially, but as updates have been released they have become increasingly less common. The technology tree was kinda small, but it was enough for me frankly because of the time it took to research the best things. Dynamic planets were also a cool positive that added some randomness to resource distribution throughout the galaxy. I do also know there are several mods out for this game that are free, but have never tried them. The main problem was with the game (imo) was the AI. They are not very intelligent and it can be really difficult beginning a new game because if you encounter a hostile race they will more than likely troop rush you and destroy you within 15 minutes.

Eventually, all 4X games become compared to it.\nStarDrive has many positive aspects - friendly interface, interesting gameplay, starship constructor (in which alone, you'll spend hours, customizing your ships). But all-in-all, in my opinion, it failed to implement these into a balanced game. Notorious AI and ship movement, bugs, balancing issues, weak diplomacy. Abscence of a storyline is OK for me, neither MoO did have one, but StarDrive feels in every way incomplete. Short tech-tree, strategy flaws (you can win almost every game in minutes, by producing soldiers and landing them onto enemy homeworlds - no defence for that. Ka-pow! And the enemy is either extict, or thrown into a stone age.)\nMoreover - as of 1.15 patch, it seems that there'll be no more updates, as developer focused on a second installement. Some complained it was a hit-and-run move, but I sense logic there. No use of trying to sew together a Frenkenstein. It's far easier and wiser to start from scratch, avoiding mistakes learned. Looking forward to trying the second game out.\nMy opinion - the game is worth trying out, although overpriced.

What drew me to it the most is its innovative and thorough approach to ship design and combat.  If you'd enjoy spending 20 thought-filled  minutes crafting a customized inter-system war machine, this one's for you.  I should add that watching said war machine ply its trade is beautiful and enjoyable as well.  I loved almost everything about the design and implementation of the space combat in StarDrive.  Its real-time approach encompasses fighters, boarding parties, attack, defense, reinforcements, re-arming, repairing, bombarment, trade, support structures, warp speed and manuevering.\n\nHowever, I must also acknowledge that this game never overcame a certain lack of polish.  Confused AI, glitches, and underdeveloped or dead-ending side stories riddle the game.  In order to fully enjoy its excellent space combat system, you must learn how to work with the game's quirks and carefully guide the challenge level into an ideal range with practiced care.  I am amazed and impressed with what this game's creator(s) were able to accomplish.  At the same time, I can see why its metacritic score didn't make it to the 90s; its great strengths are forced to associate with a series of weaknesses.","September 28, 2014","true","249.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

You can assume manual control over your "flagship" but this is sort of useless; I find myself never making use of the ability.  That, coupled with the fact that there's a game type selector but no game type except the default, tells me that this game started with the intent to develop something akin to StarFlight or Star Control II, but that inability to manage scope led it to becoming just another Sins of a Solar Empire clone.\n\nThat said, the AI is challenging, though it tends to make odd choices at times.   Unfortunately, the races are very predictable in behavior, and seem a bit like ripoffs themselves.   The Kulrathi warrior bear race reminds me a little much of the Kilrathi warrior cat race from old Wing Commander.   There's a race of squid-beings that have ships and philosophy very similar to the Reapers from Mass Effect.\n\nI did enjoy playing this game for one or two playthroughs, and the modification of the ships is an interesting mechanic, but I found myself going back to Sins of a Solar Empire to get this sort of fix.   Between the lack of creativity on the alien races and the clear false-start of creating an "adventure" mode, I was never able to shake the feeling that the game was completed halfway and the rest was just phoned in.   It's a game worth playing if you can grab it on Steam Sale, but it's also a lesson in how scope creep can turn a great idea into an unfinished project.","February 5, 2014","true","27.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

However, as I learned my way around the contrls and began combat, I realised how much fun this game can seriously get. The combat in this is tons and tons of fun, least of all because of the creative control you have on your ships. You get the blueprint of your ship, and then fill its insides with weapons, power, bridges, the lot. You then test your design out in combat. It has great visuals and beautiful weapon effects, all the races ships feel different and look cool. Its only downside is Empire building and the economy is pretty shallow.

I've not found it as complex as the others, not turn based and for me, it's easing me into how 4x games essentially work.\n\nI can't say much about the negativity surrounding the game because I'm only new to the genre but as a game, I'm finding that it functions great so far.\n\nGraphically I can not complain, the music and sounds are nice.

The mechanics make sense, and the player can make informed choices to wring out advantages to actually win battles, wars, and the game. Custom ship designs are a key part of the value proposition of the game, and the implementation here is meaty and satisfying.\n\nThose good things said, the game has some big flaws in usability/playability. There is often only one way to perform an action  (scrap/refit a ship, scroll the map) when there should be several; information displays like the known-planets list and ships list are missing key features. Also, while the ship design module is a lot of fun early in the tech tree, as ships get larger the lack of any automated support makes filling in all the boxes of a design tedious instead of fun.\n\nI picked StarDrive up as part of the holiday sale, and I can say it was worth the discounted price to me, but I'm not sure it would be worth full price.\n","January 3, 2014","true","52.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","4"

This is a solid game with a very distinct art style. It looks really good and yet very simple, which is not a bad thing. The game is very easy to learn and is quite deep in it's ship customization and you will spend many hours designing and perfecting your ship designs. There is nothing more satisfying than having your custom badass capitalship send out a swarm of your custom fighters and totaly anhialate an enemy fleet.\n\nCompared to a lot of other 4X games, Stardrive does not have as big of a techtree, there is still plenty of things to research but compared to games like Endless Space it's far from enough. One thing I really miss is more ways to improve your planets and concidering all the buildingspace you have left, there is room for a lot more.\n\nPros:\n- Short learning curve\n- Deep shipdesign\n- Real-time gameplay\n- Addicting\n\nCons:\n- Not enough to research\n- Ground battles\n- Game crash after a few hours of play\n- Save files are way to big","November 7, 2014","true","50.3"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

The scale, depth and presentation is wonderful. The developer has managed to achive something amazing given both that this is his first game and that he's working solo.\n\nThe early game is wonderful, the ship designer is interesting, there's a good variety of planets, anomalies and the races all look brillient.\n\nBut, and it is a bit but, this game is also rather tragic. The potential it has was vast, and while some of it has been lived up to, due to poor engine choices and the dev choosing to remake the game in unity and create a sequal, the game is unlikely to get any better. Preformance is buggy, especialy later on. Late game is dull and will have you either compleatly dominate or be wiped out in the early game. Lack of multipalyer limits the games's life time signifigantly, and things such as the half finnished remnets plotline just make me want to cry.\n\nThat said, despite all it's faults I've still put in around 60 hours at time of writing, from multiple playthoughts, meaning that the cost per hour is less then 50p.\n\nWhile the games has it's moments, the problems coupled with the fact that a remake and a sequal is arriving soon makes me recomend that you don't buy unless your fine with a incompleat, thought still impressive experiance. Wait till the sequal.","December 3, 2013","false","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

It's rather quite fine, but sadly also buggy. Some issues make it crash during diplomacy, others during deploying ground troops, and I also encountered a crash as I colonized a world.\n\nThe game looks neat, as far as it runs, it's of course not as polished as it could be, but there are already a lot of options. Sadly there is no more official support to this by the developer, but the fans still try to update it on a regular basis.\n\nPros:Collection of several races, that can even further be tweaked with traits.The player decides the size, and resources of the galaxy or sector. Systems can have a good variety of planets.\nCons:The game is buggy and crashing regulary, safe often.Not well supported by the developer, because the second part is out already.\nNot recommended for everyone\nThe game is nice, sadly it's both no longer supported by the devs and it's buggy and crashy. But there still is hope, there is an inofficial patch for the game, that gets updated on a regular basis, and alone those Fanbase make the game still a good game. But, you have to know the basics of modding, and you have to keep in mind that the game still isn't running as smoothly as it should.\n\nGiven the issues with the bugs, crashes and lacking support, the positive things about the game are you can play it, though you will have to install and upkeep the patch. I encountered several problems during the first three or four tryouts, it's unclear why - because the final patching worked perfectly fine and I did nothing different.\n\nIf you are fan of the 4x Space Exploration genre, this game might be for you. Especially if you aren't afraid to mod your games and give it a try. But if you are inexperienced with modding, have problems with finetuning your software or system, then this game might be not for you - it will try out your patience and may pull the strings of your nerves.Don't buy the game when you want a fast, and relaxing playing experience.","November 30, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My favorite part about it is the races - they're very cool and very well designed, and have some great animated assets, and I love the take on race customization the game uses.\n\nUnfortunately, however, this game seems to have been thrown together in the 4X space formula without any polish, refinement, or novel central ideas, and the gameplay suffers terribly because of it. I literally cannot get through a full game in StarDrive. Everything is quirky, unbalanced, hard to find, and unpredictable. Even more of a shame considering the ship designer is one of the less obtuse examples I've seen in games like this.
