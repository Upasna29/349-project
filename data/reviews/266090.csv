It's a little-known fact that, during the development of Starlite: Astronaut Rescue, highly intelligent individuals who once helped put man on the moon were forced to simulate having no scientific education. The result is a game with physics that are all wrong and only 20 minutes of plodding, unrealistic content—all they could manage to create under these conditions before giving up. A real eye-opener, and a future none of us want to live in.","October 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","57","65","8","4"

When you were younger did you put on a tin foil helmet, tie a sheet around your neck, and climb piles of dirty clothes pretending you were walking on Mars...  If so you were probably super stoked for this game...   I never did these things though .....  (shifting my eyes from side to side to hide the fact I'm not being honest)...\n\nI figured for less than a dollar I'd grab this game, try it out for the 20 or so minutes that people claimed I'd get from it, pat myself on the back for taking a trip to the red planet and feel joy.\n\nUnfortunately that didn't happen, this game glitches like crazy..... the first glitch was the work bench, it wouldn't let me combine the items....  After trying about 1000 different directions I decided to check on line to see what I was doing wrong.... I did nothing wrong the game just didn't want to register that I was crafting....\n\nSo I finally get past this glitch and nearly immediately afterward I'm hit with a puzzle.... awesome...  I solved the puzzle using the calculator.....  sigh... again the game glitches up.\n\nIt's not the worst thing in the world, but gets kind of annoying that you need to continually restart from the beginning after every glitch..   I can't recommend this game at all, even for .89 cent.  It's far too short and bug ridden to be worth a purchase at all.\n\nSave your money for something else.  The only saving grace is the fact that buying the game will allow you to get it's 1 achievement fairly easily...  Is that enough to purchase the game.... well ask yourself if the extention of your e-peen is worth whatever price the game is selling for...  I don't personally think it is.","June 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","18","20","4","1"

Nevermind. It's a "mini-adventure", sporting "Unity Terrain Mars Environment and Shadows, Futuristic advanced rover setting, advanced biosuit space suits, professional voice acting, realistic physics, original story and dialogue; and advanced robotic navigation".\n\nEvery single one of the aforementioned features are over-exaggerated. This cough game cough is what you'd expect from one of those 100 Games on 1 Disc compilations for Windows 95. It's truly awful, but luckily it lasts only 15 minutes.\n\nMy single positive for this title is that I encountered zero bugs/issues with my short experience. But, bugs/glitches are directly proportional to content, and so this is expected.\n\nIn your short experience you'll control a rover and a human character. The looking action is awful, and movement is just as bad thanks to really terrible mouse acceleration. It feels as if the player is on ice. This problem is disguised as 'realistic physics'. It's annoying, plain and simple. Jumping and staying in the air for 2 seconds longer, and walking with longer strides is realistic physics. Not releasing the W key and waiting 2 more seconds for your character to come to a halt. Eugh.\n\nThe story is a generic rescue mission, which is outlined in the title of the game. Going along as usual, someone had an accident, you have to find them by completing abstract tasks and finally you're rewarded by landing back at square one. There are a grand total of three 6th grade maths problems that need to be solved, a 30 seconds crafting bit (with a cluttered interface) and then a short driving and positioning part with a rover. Oh and someone said some words at one point.\n\nAvoid.","April 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","4"

It was made with the support of NASA and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, along with a few other supporters. The title is also really short, like 20 minutes short. It feels like a tablet game in the interactive section of a museum. Moving the camera was difficult, and felt more like I should be dragging my finger around, not pointing a mouse. It doesn’t help the cursor wouldn’t stay in my main monitor either, so I couldn’t get it back in the middle to click on things. The gameplay involves doing basic tasks, like go here, click on this and then it explains stuff to you in a really neat way. It also had you do a math problem that I just couldn’t figure out. Thank god I review games, not build rockets. This short title is a neat thing, and it’s still in early access, with a promised multiplayer mode coming out soon along with some more content once they get it all worked out. Hopefully it isn’t like the Mars Mission and set for a timely 2025 release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t4n4Xxqpf8\n","February 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

Unlike some other "unsatisfied people", It is  quite enjoyable. Although, the only thing that really was out of place, was the "action-adventure music". (It wasn't bad, but it felt like it didn't belong there.)\n\nThe voice acting is quite nice and graphics are "ok". Not really up-to-date graphics, but for what the "game" was meant to be, it is acceptable.  The game doesn't really tell much information about why you are there and doesn't really let you explore things, unfortunately.  "the story" is over before you know it.\n\nSo your question is, is it worth the money/time?\n\nFor someone who is looking for a game, I don't think this is your thing.\nIf you are looking for something short and unique? Then sure, why not? It's not like it's a lot of money.\n\nI rate this "mini-adventure" a 6.5/10","January 27, 2014","true","0.3"," 45 of 81 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","45","81","0","0"

If you can get past that, keep reading.\n\nAstronaut Rescue is a very short adventure.  There are places you could go a little off the beaten path, but it's not open world, it's not sandbox, and...well, it's Mars.  There isn't that much to see and do besides the adventure, which is linear in nature and your hand is held through much of it.\n\nAll that said, it's a fun little game and well worth the $1.79 sale price.  The story's plot is interesting and tightly scripted, the voice action is excellent, and while you don't get to drive the Minerva (picture 5, above), you do get to drive around the Sams (picture 3) in low gravity.  You even (potentially) learn a little bit along the way.\n\nWell worth $1.79.

It isn't terrible per se, but it can do with a LOT of improvement.\n\nFor starters, the player moves around like a steady-cam; Everything is smoothed out, from the movement over hills down to the motion of the mouse. It feels unnatural to the point it seems you're playing a drone of sorts.\n\nThen there is the geometery; Terrain smoothing has been around for about a decade now, and it could have been used to some extent and look better than it does right now. Even with graphics set to the max I can see the edges a mile away. It is sloppy and it shouldn't have to be that way. And this doesn't go for just the terrain. The objects, entities and vehicles themselves look bad because of this. It is impossible to make a curved geometery that works on all hardware, but there are shaders and filters and all sorts of tricks that are very effective on that front.\n\nTexture quality; Well, there is some, just not a whole lot. This is again one of those points that would have been acceptable a decade ago. With an option 'Beautiful' I expect to see high resolution textures.\n\nThis would all be acceptable in a simulator, which I suppose this falls under, if the actual simulation demanded high detail or amount of calculations that would justify sacrificing graphical fidelity. And that is probably what upsets me the most; It looks and feels quickly assembled in a Unity editor with little to no attention to detail or features.\n\nIt looks and feels like a demo, which, at the time I bought it (a few years ago) was a bit more expensive than the 5 bucks (if not less) that's advertised these days.\n\nIt does a good job as an educational tool, however, for both children who want to be astronauts and game developers alike (the latter probably isn't a complement though). It has some nice lessons in frequencies and stuff, but that's about the only thing it has going for it. Wel...it has the NASA logo up front, and it pained me to see the Gates Foundation in there as well, especially since it has the tendancy to crash when ALT+TABbing, but that may just be me.\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend this for what it is. I love the idea, but there is no game here. What little simulation it has is completely on rails and there is no way to mess up or discover something that deviates from the main story, which plot also escapes me...\n\nI hope some developers got a lot of experience out of this, and I'm not sure about it's current price, but if you see this for anything over 50 cents, just leave it be.\n\nOne final sidenote, this is an alpha test for Starlite: Astronaut Academy, to be released in 2014. That was a year ago. It has been sold (and still is) as seperate full-release title (There is no Steam Early Access disclaimer on the store page). These 2 things don't bother me as much as the fact that over the years there have been no updates, improvements or anything that indicates this being a work in progress or part of a bigger project which is still in progress (although I'm pretty sure that one's dead as well).","November 14, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In saying that I am not sure if it is worth buying, it does fell diffrent to most games that have come out recently but is that a good thing? Sometimes trying a diffrent approach to others can end up being bad in the end. You must also remember this is not NASA's first attempt at trying to create an educational game. Their first project Moonbase Alpha was a free to play game and I'm guessing it was a test to see the appeal of Space Simulation games. Due to the amount of downloads I assume their went ahead with the Starlite game. What they have to remeber is Moonbase Alpha was free, Starlight is a paid game and they should have considered that. Although Starlite does try diffrent things to moonbase. Even thought it is short every task is diffrent to the last and that's nice considering how repetetive Moonbase Alpha was, so atleast they tried to change up the gameplay this time.

I heard that Starlite was an MMO spiritual successor to Moonbase Alpha, and I have been looking forward to it for that reason. However, this is not that game. There is no depth, the crafting and problem solving in the description refer to dragging a wire onto a radio twice and to dividing two numbers together using an in game calculator, and the fact that the developers chose to call this an 'RPG' or 'Simulation' is flabbergasting. The 'game' is too short and simple to be interesting, and the controls are too awkward to be fun.\n\nIf this release was meant to get people excited about the eventual release of a real Starlite game, then it has failed miserably. Despite the fact that my time is far more valuable to me than the price of this 'game', I'm considering trying to get my money back simply to make a point.

Play it with a controller or don't bother. The mouse mode doesn't even trap the cursor, so get used to accidentally clicking away from the game window while trying to turn.\n\nThe only point of hope I see here for the continuing Starlite project is the visual design. While not AAA-level, the designs are interesting and engaging. And if the robots look a little cartoony... well, real space assistant robot design is headed that way anyway, if Japan has anything to say about it.\n\nBottom line, even as a sneak preview, this should never have been released on its own.

You must use the power of math and science in order to accomplish this relatively simple task. It doesn't take long to do, and the work involved is not that difficult either, just some fairly simple algebra and walking.

The game is rough in a lot of ways. Graphically it's sub-par, flat textures, stiff and/or missing animations, very low-poly models; this may make the game run better on a wider variety of hardware, but it makes it look rough, even for an indie game. The controls are floaty and slow, though that may be by design given the lighter gravity of Mars. The gameplay consists mostly of "walk here and press E/LMB", so it's not the most intense or involved game, and although you're on a resuce mission to save a pilot running out of oxygen... there is never a real sense of urgency.\n\nStill, all that said, it's somehow charming. And it's cool to see a non-violent, science-based video game, even if it's just a rough-edged 20 minute sampler of what the developers have planned. If it were more expensive, I might judge it more harshley, but for the price, I think it's still worth it even given all the issues mentioned above.

Maybe I should trademark it as marswalk.\nThe space between those giant MNRV-wheels contains invisible walls.\nYou can't skip cutscenes, neither can you click "next page" (or whatever, I won't start the game again to look up the original term) during text briefings for a certain time (until you totally understood what they told you!)\n.\n"Constructing a habitat" means "take some box out of a drawer and put it to some pre-assigned target position".\n"Craft tools" means "combine two out of two possible items".\n"Flag down the medevac" means "stand near the MNRV and wait for the ship to land at the other end rather than near the position where you 'flag it down'".\nLet's don't talk about the physics again. Best moment in the whole game is when you drive that small rover out of the MNRV (whatever that means, btw) and jump over the ledge, disregarding the oh-so-realistic gravity.\n\nHonestly: worst. game. ever.

The audio (conversation, spacecraft sounds) and strange controls need to be erased and completely reworked from the ground up. The calculator needs clarification on it's operation it took me 10 minutes to figure out I needed to use the num pad to punch in the answers (it was a late night).\n\nWith a little work the game could really be turned into something quite attractive visualy, with new textures, an extended sight range, and some kind of post fx, I wouldn't complain. It's still in alpha I believe, at least that's the impression I got from visiting their Vanilla site, so there is the chance that the whole thing could really be fine-tuned.

The gameplay is a little wonky and doesn't handle the movement+camera positioning very well. There is only really one objective and a math solution to solve in the entire game. The ingame calculator takes a moment to get used to it. But if you are a fan of achievements or care about NASA it might be worth the twenty minutes for the extremely cheap price. That is if the proceeds are giving to NASA in some way.","February 1, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is 20 minutes in length, but it's also cheap and gives you access to the beta. Which for most beta accesses this is a steal. The game gives a good taste of what the final version will be like, but it's still clear that it's not in beta yet. The missions needed to complete the game were a little simplistic; however, on th whole it was still fun and for a short moment you feel like you're on Mars. Only hickup I had while playing full screen was the mouse look didn't always behave as expected. Annoying, yes, dealbreaker for something this early, no.","February 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a preview for a potentially great game.  I recommend waiting for a sale if you don't want to spend $3 for a 20-30 minute game.\n\nActually, some images look rather familiar, from those days when I worked in room 183 and passed White Card all the time.  I'm in room 301 now, so I don't go by that room often, but it's pretty cool that I work in the same building as the Project White Card team.  I should get autographs on a printed image of my badge before you all move out. :D\n\nKeep up the good work, I look forward to a full-length, and hopefully you get the mouse control fixed.
