I say this because so many have complained about the graphics in Max Payne 3. Yet every single location you play through looks so believable, no environment looks vacant of life or detail. Just as impressive is how varied these environments are. You will play through apartment buildings, a cemetery, a prison, and so on. Sure these kinds of environments are almost common place in most action games, but in Max Payne 3 they have a level of detail that is so impressive you can't help but appreciate them more.\n\nGameplay wise, Max Payne 3 does not stray too far from the first two games in the series. As you take out enemies your bullet time meter fills up, once you have the amount you need you can trigger it to slow down time. Enemies, bullets, grenades, and other hazards are easier to avoid in bullet time, not to mention how impressive the feature still looks. Shoot dodge also returns, letting you dodge in any direction (left, right, forward, or backwards) in slow motion. This time around you do not even need to have any bullet time in your bullet time meter to use shoot dodge (although some will be consumed if you do use shoot dodge while having bullet time left).\n\nMax Payne 3 really is a great action game and a great game period. It is not perfect, but the good aspects without question outweigh the bad ones. Whether or not your a fan of the first two installments in the series, Max Payne 3 is definitely worth playing.","November 30, 2013","true","11.2"," 351 of 421 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","351","421","0","23"

If you are someone who wants raw action, and doesn’t want to see a lot of cutscenes or kill-cams: then you may not enjoy this. However, if you are someone who enjoys games that play like movies, this is something you must play.  In my opinion, Max Payne 3 is one of the best cinematographic-action games ever made and likely will be for a long time.\n\nThe first aspect I will highlight in defense of my opinion is the writing and dialogue. Max Payne 3 easily has some of the best writing I have ever encountered in a video game.  The overall narrative is interesting and entertaining, but the real beauty of the writing shines through in the dialogue.  There are several lines throughout the game that will evoke that inner-thought of: “that was a good one.”  And the excellent voice acting ices the cake to ensure the cutscenes have an A-one quality that rivals Hollywood movies.\n\nBesides the main cutscenes that give life to the actual narrative, there are also many other cinematic features woven deep into the gameplay mechanics.  You can activate Bullet Time® and Shootdodge™ as you play through the fight scenes in each level; doing so will slow time and allow you to perform elaborate kill sequences.   Further, bullet-cams and kill-cams will pop up periodically to show some nasty kills.  There are also level-specific “special” kills that will slow time and create cinematic opportunities.\n\nThe fight scenes encompass the vast majority of the actual gameplay of Max Payne 3.  The game is very linear and generally ushers you from one shootout to the next, with a cutscene in between to show more plot development.  There are some secret areas and collectibles, but generally the areas where you are in control are rather small and undeviating.  However, this is perfectly aligned with the movielike feel of the game; and the levels are well-designed and diverse, so they never feel boring or plain.\n\nThe whole experience is brought together nicely by solid graphics and animations, a high level of attention to detail, and advanced physics and particle effects.\n\nNow, Max Payne 3 is the third installment in the franchise.  It is technically a direct sequel, although it feels a bit more like a spiritual successor.  You can easily enjoy this game without having played the first two.  (Of course, it is still best to learn what happened in the story during the previous games).  Also the first two installments in the Max Payne franchise were created by different people than this one.  This game does go in a bit of a different direction compared to the earlier installments.  For example, it isn’t quite as dark and noir; and also eases a bit on the deep, psychological inner-war concept.  These, and other differences, upset some fans of the franchise (as seems to be a common theme in new installments of long-standing franchises). So be aware of this. I personally feel that all three games can be appreciated for what they are.\n\nArcade-mode, timed-mode, higher difficulties, and achievements all contribute to the possibility of many gameplay hours.  There is also a multiplayer mode that is pretty fun.  During the time I played, there was a decent amount of people who played regularly; although there were times I couldn’t find a game.  I actually liked the multiplayer a lot and played it for dozens of hours, but I will admit that most people will probably find it lackluster.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend Max Payne 3 to anyone who would enjoy a heavily cinematic action-shooter and who would appreciate the amazing writing.  It is one of the best “plays-like-a-movie” games ever made.  Having said that, I can understand some of you just want action.  If you want pure gameplay and/or generally skip cutscenes in games, you definitely should look elsewhere for your next shooter.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 27, 2015","true","113.8"," 188 of 212 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","188","212","11","6"

Some are a little lengthy and the fact that they are also shown during the arcade modes is even more annoying.\n-People are reporting issues getting the game installed recently. I myself can't really speak on this but check the forums before purchase and make sure it's all sorted out now. A lot of people were reporting it during the winter sale.\n-Rstar's "social club" DRM is unnecessary imo and is another minor bump in the road when getting the game installed.\n-Multi is very different form other games, pistols are very powerful and movement speed is restricted by weight which is determined by loadout. None of this is explained very well to new players and can be overwhelming or confusing. It's fun but it makes people rage out before they really know what's going on a lot I think. Some of the killstreaks are goofy too like one that makes allies appear as enemies and another that can make the player look like the opposing team for a period of time. Once again interesting, different and fun but it's hell on noobs.\n\n\nRstar's version of Max Payne is a bullet ballet set to a salsa soundtrack. A drunken narcotic fueled blur of John Woo. The game is a must own for any action-shooter fan however I would suggest waiting for a sale as it often gets discounted and sells for less than 10$ with all DLC. Thanks for an amazing game, Rstar. Gta5 comes out on pc in less than a month and I'm getting kind of misty thinking of moving past Max Payne. We popped pills together. Shot bad guys together. raged on hackers together.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonfx/recommended/204100/","neonfx","Neon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonfx/","695 products in account","Before the release, there has been a lot of controversy regarding the new setting of the game. While the predecessors have been placed in New Noir York City, a large part of Max Payne 3 is set in São Paulo, Brazil. Indeed, the grim, dark streets filled with Russian mobsters and Valkyr junkies are no longer here, instead they have been replaced with nightclubs, favelas and luxurious cruise ships. After the events of Max Payne 2, our antihero returns to his home in New Jersey, where he lives the life of self-pity. That is until he meets Raul Passos, a former colleague from the police academy, who is doing a private security job for the Branco family. Max and his friend engage themselves in a conflict with the mob, and soon Max is forced to move out to Brazil as well. As you might suspect, things don’t work out well for him. Seriously, has things ever worked out for him?\n\nThe old comic-panel storytelling device is gone, but the flashy cutscenes definitely make up for it. Their visual aspect, heavily inspired by IO Interactive’s Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days, actually plays a large role in storytelling as well. It represents Max’s constant hangover and tipsiness, with cut-up, multi-framed, noisy scenes, flashing lights and weird camera angles reminding me on my own drunken ventures and the morning afters, but let’s not get into that. Overall, Max’s story is an engrossing, brilliant experience, and what’s even more important, it keeps in touch with the noir aspect of Max Payne 1 and 2.\n\nMax Payne 3’s gameplay is the old-school fun you remember from the previous games. There is a massive arsenal of weapons to choose from, ranging from revolvers, through micro SMGs and ending with a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher. However, you can only wield two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon at a time. If you choose to dual-wield, you drop the larger weapon. The cool thing about it is, all weapons are shown on Max’s body throughout cutscenes as well, and the way he reloads his pistol while holding a shotgun in another hand at the same time is one of the finest animations in gaming to date.\n\nHere comes the first complaint though, after each cutscene, and there are a LOT of them, Max defaults to his one-handed weapon, which might sound like a minor thing, but is actually quite annoying and breaks the immersion slightly. It is something that should definitely be fixed in a future patch. The old gameplay mechanics are still here- both bullet time and shootdodge make a return, and you absolutely need to use them if you want to stay alive. You might think that the game has been dumbed down because of the newly introduced cover system, but you couldn’t be further from the truth. Not only does the health not regenerate even on the lowest difficulty setting (painkillers make a return as well, so you can’t make Max suck a thumb for a few seconds to recover), but the cover is also fully destructible. And so are the enemies.\n\nMax Payne 3 is mercilessly brutal. The developers take pride in that it seems, since there is a button that allows you to slow down time to see your bullets shot at the last enemy in the area. And then allows you to shoot him some more. With 50 bullets more. To the chest. By the time the guy is down, his body has more lead in it than blood, and each of the wounds gushes blood and leaves bloodstains on clothes as well. The game utilizes the Euphoria physics engine known from GTA IV, and although some hilarious glitches might occur, you can feel the impact of the bullet with every shot, and seeing an enemy stumbling over a set of stairs never gets old. The game is a majestic theatre, a wet dream of John Woo and Chow Yun-fat, and a glorious sight to any gamer. The environments intensify the firefights even more- from shattered glass, through empty shells bashing the floor with every shot, to massive splinters falling off of wooden surfaces; the game is a truly thrilling ride throughout all 14 chapters, lasting about 9-12 hours.","November 25, 2013","true","81.1"," 178 of 230 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","178","230","0","5"

It kept the player sucked into the story and at times made me forget I was going from point A to point B, but to go achieve that goal that was needed during that chapter. Not once did I think to myself that this was linear.\n+/- Can sound emotional and/or depressing at times, but then again, this is where knowing the knowledge about the last two titles are crucial (I thought it fit in perfectly, but attitude reflects everyone differently when playing a game)\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Can be a slow start or even a confusing start if you haven’t played the original 2 games (or didn’t even read about their story via some online source)\n-Controls can be wonky at times or at times don’t feel fluid as it should be\n-Multiplayer is dead\n\n\nSummary:\n\nYou are placed in Brazil to protect some VIPs and the action takes off immediately. The story at first can start off rather slowly, but it does pick up rather quickly after the first two or so chapters. Max Payne is always narrating the story (as if you were reading a comic book or something similar), whether it’s telling himself to go this direction or a witty comment on why he took the painkillers. Some of the cutscenes do elaborate some portion of his past, but they don’t explain everything on what happened in his past. The cutscenes are nicely done and also give a lot of information for the chapter and the buildup to the final plot that shows at the end of the game.\n\nThe graphics are done excellently. A lot of detail went into this game. There is gore (for those who are squeamish), but it’s done right to fit the nature for this game. The blood splatter seems consistent to the bullet wounds and/or explosions, but not overly used when compared to other shoot-them-up titles (i.e. 5 gallons of blood on the floor with only one dead body).\n\nThe music fits nicely with the game and it doesn’t sound overwhelming or try take the focus away when listening to the cutscenes and/or when Max Payne beings a narrative discussion. The sounds are done right and the explosions/gunfire is not overwhelming when firing them off. Voice acting was done very nicely. It wasn’t bland, but it was dark and emotional; all relating to his past experiences.\n\nThe combat system is done nicely with the game. You’re in 3rd person view unless you pick up selected weapons that have a scope on them. The cover system is done appropriately depending where and how you stay in cover. If someone that has a height advantage above you, they’ll more likely hit you while you’re in cover, but the same can be done to them. The aiming is flawless. I had no issues aiming at their heads whether it was normal pace or slow-motion, though at times the controls do feel wonky. I would have moments where I would want to slow-motion in a direction and the controls would hesitate or be unresponsive. This would also be the case when trying to go into cover, but it would hesitate, I’d click again and it would send me into cover and then right back out of cover.\n\nThe AI hit their marks a lot more than most shoot-them-up shooters. This is why the cover system and slow-motion function are key. This isn’t a Battlefield or Call of Duty similarity. This game relies heavily on those two functions or the outcome will be your undoing. I really enjoyed this title and I haven’t played the other two titles. I did some reading on the story prior of playing this title, so I had some clue on what to expect when it came to his emotions and the reason why he was doing the things he did.\n\nThe game is rich in story, yet dark in nature. I was never bored or felt the gameplay was linear in any way, shape, or form. I felt the game was more of a movie that you control the main protagonist. I thought they did an excellent job at this game. I didn't play multiplayer because I didn't find any matches, so I cannot give a review based on any multiplayer aspects. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game.","October 26, 2015","true","13.4"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","77","88","4","6"

I wanted to like Max Payne 3, but it just really did not want to be liked. The good news is, at the core, the gameplay is actually pretty good... when you get to play it, but more on that in a bit.  The combat is true to the John Woo style of the series.  The game is also considerably more difficult than Max Payne 2, but not as much as Max Payne 1, which is a happy medium.  It's a bit heavily cover-based, but you do have the shootdodge at your disposal to mix things up.\n\nUnfortunately, you will spend the majority of your gaming hours locked in sequence after sequence of unskippable AND unquittable cutscenes which smugly display the text "still loading" when you try to skip them, despite the fact that it has clearly been 5 minutes or more. If you try to press escape, the cutscene will just pause.  Once the gameplay actually begins and you start to have fun, the instant the last guy is killed you are forced to watch a 30 second cutscene of Max opening a door or vaulting a ledge, or something else you could have easily done yourself.  It often doesn't even allow you time to search the room for guns, painkillers, or collectibles. When you do get the opportunity to scavenge the room after a battle, you cannot backtrack to the previous room (which is always inexplicably locked behind you) and you are CONSTANTLY nagged every five seconds to proceed forward, either by one of Max's allies or Max himself.  He'll say to himself, "I had no time to admire the scenery, I had to move forward," as if he's in a rush to finish his own story. I suppose he needs to make time for more compelling details in his storytelling such as "there was a security door across the hall" or some contextual remark on every bottle of pills that he finds.\n\nThe general flow of the game, as you may have guessed, between all the cutscenes is just shooting gallery after shooting gallery.  In many a cutscene you have the dubious privilege of watching Max bumble his way into a room, alerting the entire mob, and spoiling what would have been a perfectly good sneak attack.  And after the game spends most of its time yanking you forward against your will, in other chapters you will be forced to slowly walk or stagger drunk or wounded through the level for ten minutes, unable to actually do anything useful. It absolutely refuses to let you play at your own pace.\n\nBut that's just the story mode -- if you want to just shoot stuff in combat scenarios without all the talky talk then surely Arcade mode is where it's at... right?  Ehhh, no.  The only difference Arcade mode has is that it removes the *skippable* cutscenes from the game, which there weren't that many of to begin with. Wonderful. And it gives you a score at the end of the chapter, with none of the instant gratification the game so callously denies you.","November 30, 2013","false","29.4"," 262 of 378 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","262","378","0","17"

Now hes sportin a bald look and beard with hawain shirts and wife beaters.\n\nThe audio was fairly simple I thought but gets the job done as to raise tention when needed, however the voice acting was top notch.  Gameplay wise I gotta say that its linear and fairly simple.  The standard enemies your going after ramp slightly more in difficulty but with the bullet time its a breeze.  I do have to say that at least for me the biggest gripe I had with the game was the controls.  MP1 and 2 were butter smooth to control, this one was not.  The mouse sensitivity to much adjustments and getting used to and still to the end never fealt right.  Controls aside the game is top notch production value and fun as hell.

They've updated the gameplay in ways that still feel like Max Payne, and manages to be a shooter that's vastly more fun to play than the regular slow third person shooters, or twitch-based iron-sight extravaganzas.\n\nI've been super cognizant of games that just pump endless waves of enemies, and wait for you to click on them to make them dead, lately, and it's soured a lot of otherwise good experiences (Bioshock Infinite, Space Marine, Dragon Age II). This doesn't feel like that (spare maybe one, or two instances across the whole game), and I really expected it to be. Whether it be the fun mechanics, or the encounter design as a whole, I really like how this game plays.\n\nAlso I feel like the story fits Max's character really well. While there's a definite charm to his melodrama from the previous games, Rockstar adds onto that in ways that make his character a lot more human, and helps balance things out a bit. The writing wasn't always as sharp as the Remedy games, but it surprised in other ways in equal amount.\n\nI really like this game. You should probably play it, even if you're tired of shooters, or are turned off by the ludicrous 30GB install. It's a nice conclusion to two games that didn't really need elaborated further upon, and that's just pretty impressive to me.","March 21, 2014","true","11.5"," 86 of 110 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","86","110","0","5"

The cutscenes (in most cases) are unskippable due to "loading" and the self-aware humour that made Max Payne 1 and 2 special is gone. The gritty reboot is in vogue across popular culture, and in this instance it does the character a great disservice.\n\nThe mark of Dan Houser is obvious here, in that the gameplay takes a backseat to focus on poorly developed characters who spew trite dialogue of no substance. While Max Payne 1 & 2 were a direct send-up of the "man with nothing to lose" cliché, Max Payne 3 misses the point entirely and instead becomes the butt of it's own joke. Max comes off as a whiny, humourless d*uche with zero self-awareness and a drinking problem. There is little left of what made Max a likeable character, and his b*tching will quickly get on your nerves.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay is the complete opposite in that it remains very faithful to the original games, while adding an impressively morbid level of detail. At it's best, Max Payne 3 is an unrivaled orchestra of slow motion death porn. The mix of Euphoria physics, Bullet Time gunplay and horrific death effects is extremely satisfying and unique. The decals and death effects are the most realistic I have ever seen, and you will feel bad as you watch the last enemy twitching and moaning with a gaping hole in his head. MP3 is also one of the more competent PC ports I've seen in recent times, with plenty of options and good optimisation.\n\nThe weapons are very enjoyable, especially the 608 Bull, the AK-47 and every shotgun. This is one of the rare games that nails the feel of a shotgun, in that it has a great spread and realistic range. It is in these aspects that the game shines, to the point that I have played through a story I despise three times to experience it.\n\nI cannot vouch for the quality of the multiplayer aspect, as the lack of dedicated servers and the fact I live in Australia made it lag immensely when a match could be found. As with all new Rockstar games, you are required to sign up to the Rockstar Social Club. When I tried to do this the first time, the site was not responding all night and I had to wait a few days for the rage to subside.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you enjoy the gunplay of the Max Payne series, and the attention to detail Rockstar always brings to the table. You just need to be willing to put up with the utter wank that is the story and Rockstar's crappy social club.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laFfczUD9xg","January 14, 2014","true","67.6"," 78 of 101 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","78","101","0","12"

The gameplay mechanics are great. It's like GTA V's combat but a lot smoother and without the hijacking of vehicles, so it's a lot more focused. There are many guns to use, golden gun parts to collect and a hell of a lot of side objective challenge kills to do with them, which makes replaying each level valuable.\n\nThe graphics are beyond beautiful. From start to finish, the game has a very strong and persistent cinematic theme and style as well as it being narrated by the Protaganist that you play as: Max Payne. The story is full of history of his past, which you'll know about if you played the original 2 Max Payne games, and heavily influences how he acts in this game. The game has a series of choices you can make, although they do not effect the outcome of the story.\n\nThe game isn't massively long, but it's defninitely worth the money, and is seriously fun. Great graphics, great gameplay, amazing story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MDKII/recommended/204100/","MDKII","Real Soviet Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MDKII/","526 products in account","***LONG REVIEW WARNING***\n\nI’m not sure how many times I actually asked myself “Why?” as I played Max Payne 3. “Why is he doing this?” “Why did they make this design decision?” “Why am I supposed to care?” It would go from the typical reflexive inquiries, to the borderline obsessive ones. I would continue after every stumble, extending a hand to the game, picking it up and giving it another chance to attempt walking. Eventually, I just decided to drag it until we reached the end of the road and left it there.\n\nThere is not much that makes Max Payne 3 a bad game, but rather, there is plenty that makes it a bad sequel. I’ve seen and participated in various discussions on the subject, seeing many dodgy arguments as to why people liked or hated the game. There’s a clear discontent among a certain number of people, as though something was missing in the title. Possibly the most common claim being “it’s not noir”.\n\nAnd that is a claim that is as hard to support as it is to debunk. Men smarter and more qualified than either you or I have spent decades tackling this subject alone. Whether noir is an aesthetic or genre, or whether it even exists to begin with. Even among people who agree that noir exists, the criteria varies, and any “List of film noir titles” on Wikipedia or in any book wouldn’t be accurate. However, the golden age of noir died when the genre became self-aware, so now it would be more accurate to call anything written in a noir “style” neo-noir.\n\nClaiming that either the setting or the daylight denies Max Payne 3’s right to carry the banner is dodgy at best. Many noteworthy noir titles, like White Heat, were set during the day without it being detrimental to the atmosphere. There are many other reasons to say the game lost its noir charm, but such a discussion would last for an eternity with no side being able to win. Something that can be agreed upon, though, is that if Max Payne 3 is indeed neo-noir, it is of a different ilk compared to the previous two games. Quite reasonable if you consider that movies like Sin City and American Beauty both count as neo-noir while being vastly different.\n\nThe first two games were a fusion of extreme noir melodrama and John Woo-style gunplay. It reached absurd levels story-wise, often mocking itself, but also placed a character who had rational reactions to the grimdark world around him. It’s why when you completely immerse yourself in the game, you never question Max’s actions. It never tears you away from the screen. But when you walk away and think about it, you realize just how unreasonable and silly the entire plot is.\n\nThe third game makes the mistake of toning down the setting into a more realistic one. Nothing is over the top, and there’s more emphasis on realism (as far as a third person shooter can allow). All of a sudden, we are asking questions we otherwise wouldn’t have. Our immersion breaks with every conflict between what the cutscenes imply and what the gameplay implies. Not only that, but all of a sudden, Max Payne stops being about Max and focuses on the events around him. This distinction is clear when you take into account that neither the first, nor the second game offers any sort of epilogue. It starts and ends with Max. On the other hand, Max Payne 3 offers a proper “this is what happened after Max put the gun down” scene.\n\nThis difference in atmosphere doesn’t stem only from the narrative, but also from the gameplay. Whether it was due to technical limitations, or just a savvy decision, Remedy used a minimal amount of in-game cutscenes. If Max sees an object he wants to comment on, the player needs to actually approach it by moving Max. Rockstar’s approach was to force the player’s movement, whether by cutscene or just slowing Max down due to injuries or the environment. The latter isn’t even much of an issue and is a better alternative to cutscenes, but coupled with them, it sets a much slower pace. Even trivial design decisions, like taking away the player’s control when watching TV, damages the experience.\n\nThe combat also follows this change of pace. Max Payne 3’s combat does revolve around cover, which is true to the predecessors save for the addition of a “stick to the wall” button. But it quickly becomes binary. You either have bullet-time, or you don’t. You are either at full health, or nearly dead. With infinite bullet-time jumps and only putting a cap on regular slow-mo movement, the pace changes drastically. Before, Max could jump into the action guns blazing. Now? Every single enemy is a threat, putting more emphasis on the previously mentioned increase in realism.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the actual character of Max Payne, probably the biggest problem with the latest game. Someone once told me that Max is very good at lying to himself. That’s quite an accurate statement. After all, at the end of the first game, he thought blood revenge would give him peace of mind, but as the second game showed us, it didn’t quite work out that way. However, at the end of Max Payne 2, regardless of which ending you got, Max was at peace with himself. It wasn’t something questionable like “this person is dead, everything is fine now”, but merely the culmination of all events just pushing him to a realization.\n\nAnd obviously, he lied to himself again, according to Max Payne 3. This leaves a branching path, where one says that Rockstar wasn’t true to the character, while the other says they were. With the latter, one has to wonder why we should even care for the character now. There is a difference between falling on tough times and picking yourself up, and actually having two opportunities to take your life back and get at least a bittersweet ending. Payne stops being a powerful determinator and turns into this Guy With the Gun bum. A person one would find hard to care for. It would be easier for those who entered the series with this newest installment, as the predecessors become one big blur called “the dark past”, but as someone who played through both events, I find it quite difficult to ignore this kind of character development.\n\nThis is not the only issue when speaking of Max, though. His mannerisms are also drastically different. Despite the tone and rating of all games, Max rarely, if ever, swore in the first two games. I was halfway through the second game recently and I’m not quite sure if I even heard a “damn” from him. He had a sort of cold composure, dealing with his issues within himself, rather than swearing, raging and generally being openly upset about the situation. The trademark noir metaphors are also close to nonexistent now. Most of Max’s statements have become plain observations, rather than actually processing the information as he did before. No melodramatic thoughts on life beyond the occasional pearl in an ocean of dry writing.\n\nAs Payne himself says in the second game: “If you had done something differently, it wouldn’t be you, it would be someone else looking back, asking a different set of questions.” And that is what the core issue with Max Payne 3 is, in the end. It’s not about Max Payne. It’s about someone else with the same problems, dealing with them in their own way. There are many other issues we haven’t mentioned, like the highly out of place shock about the organ black market, or the redundant “Do you kill him or let him live?” prompt at the end of the game. Max Payne 3 suffers from Fallout 3 syndrome. Just how Fallout 3 was a good game, but awful Fallout, so is Max Payne 3 a good game on its own, but an abysmal addition to the series.\n\nOne only has to wonder where Remedy would have taken Max Payne 3 had they been the developers. “Max Payne’s journey through the night will continue,” say the credits of the second game. Sadly, most of the levels of Max Payne 3 were in broad daylight.","December 30, 2013","false","9.6"," 170 of 261 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","170","261","0","10"

Some of the early screenshots were alarming and I did not want Rockstar Games to have anything to do with Remedy's well-established franchise.\n\nHowever, this new Max Payne works perfectly! The story is exciting as usual - the dialog is great and as one can guess Max narrates most of the story. The graphics are stunning and even the dodge mechanism has been improved. If we dodge and Max goes into slow-mo we have to be careful with our surroundings - no more hovering Max if an object is hit in the air; Max falls and the slow-mo immediately stops. We have to be more careful and use covers more wisely.\n\nHeadshots are now almost mandatory as not long into the game can we first encounter the first vest wearing enemies. The game gradually gets more difficult, in fact, if it is too difficult (if the player dies too often) the AI provides us with extra painkillers to have a successful run after loading the last checkpoint.\n\nThe game features a long and excellent campaign with collectibles and those seeking extra challenge can complete the game on higher difficulties which, just like in the predecessor games, get unlocked only after walkthroughs.\n\nI heard the multiplayer option is also very good.

Well, limitation to weapons sucks a bit, but game is fast-paced, interesting, killing is cool, shootouts are fun, levels are well designed, you get intelligent propotion between playing and watching cutscenes, being the fillers.\nLike before, Max Payne 3 has 3 Chapters, around 5 missions each. Small change to the system was letting the player take painkillers moment before dying.\nGoing for the storyline: Long story short, it's about ex-cop trying to sort his life and find redemption in a little bit different line of job, as private security. Knowing it's about Max, you can expect some pesimism and failing on the way.\n\nI recommend this game, because even if it's no longer night-dark, it's still pesimist-dark, still looking for change, still trying to bury the past, still awesome gameplay and nice feeling.

It is an absolute must buy on sale if you haven't played it already.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n"There are two kinds of people: ones that are trying to build their future and ones that are trying to rebuild their past." - Max Payne\n\nMax Payne is a retired NYPD Detective. It's been almost 10 years since the traumatic events of the first two games and Max is just about done with life. That is until all of a sudden Max is offered a job as a bodyguard for one of Sao Paulo's most prestigious families. An easy gig...\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a fan of the previous Max Payne games as well as third-person shooters and story driven games in general.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNOn a purely functional level, Max Payne 3 is a very well designed third-person shooter. The robust animation system is extremely versatile and allows Max to aim towards all 360 degrees around him regardless of if he is stood up, down on the dirt or anything in between. This may not sound impressive, but you really have to appreciate that you can do this and the animation system and gunplay respond to your stance and direction accordingly. You can opt to play it as a Matrix-style action game, a cover based shooter or a bit of both. The game has amazing player feedback and ballistics tracking making every shot you fire and bullet you dodge feel really satisfying, especially when you pull of something like  this [gfycat.com]. Accuracy is still a very important aspect of the gameplay and the player is certainly encouraged to go for those headshots. Max Payne's signature abilities to slow down time and "shootdodge", as Rockstar call it, also make an extremely welcome return from the previous games. However, something that doesn't return in Max Payne 3 from previous games is the weapon carrying system. Instead of being able to carry every weapon in the game in one leather jacket, the player is now limited to whatever is physically possible for Max to actually carry and fight with. It seems that Rockstar has done this to create more consistency between gameplay and cinematics for a smoother experience as Max will actually be carrying the weapons you're playing with during cutscenes. The guns themselves are all unique with varying stats that will suit different enemy types and situations. The health system is based on painkiller pickups like in previous games with no regenerating health mechanic. There are a lot of difficulty options available to suit both casual gamers and those after a punishing challenge.\n\nThe game is designed as a largely linear corridor third person shooter. As mentioned before, this iteration introduces a cover mechanic not present in previous titles, which can be nice for the more conservative player that likes to pick their shots. The game also likes to throw some scripted bullet-time sequences at you which encourage you to pick off as many enemies as possible for the duration of the event. It's sort of like a QTE, but with more control, see this  example [gfycat.com]. The levels are designed carefully and fairly and if you die, it rarely feels "cheap". In addition, the AI enemies are smart and will take cover whilst also trying to destroy yours and flank you. You will fight against varying factions as the game progresses and their AI tactics and weapons reflect their backgrounds. You should also keep your eye out for hidden side paths, crevices and alcoves that may reward you with weapons, painkillers, clues (story based collectibles that give you little bits of info) and golden gun parts (which do pretty much as the name suggests).\n\nBrief note on the multiplayer: The multiplayer community of this game is completely non-existent so if you want to have some slow mo action antics with your friends then you will need to organise it.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEWhere there is Max Payne, there is usually cynicism, misery, regret and self-pity all usually illustrated to you with nice gruff voice over by the amazing James McCaffrey. This title has done away with the graphic novel style of the previous two games and has gone for all out fully voiced and mo-capped cutscenes that make you question if you’re playing a game or watching a movie. However, whether or not this is good thing will depend on the kind of person you are. Some people have had some qualms with the way the story is presented in Max Payne 3. The first issue, is the fact that the game has this sort of blurry, colourful and sickness and/or epilepsy inducing filter that likes to pop up more than few times. The argument can be made that this filter on the cinematics and gameplay is an intentional storytelling device designed to reflect Max's condition in the context. However, despite the loss of the graphic novels, we have not lost Max's outlook on the world and just life in general. All the smarmy one liners and wise cracks, depressing thoughts, mind-wandering monologues and the general all round tone remains the same.\n\nAnother issue that people have had with the game is a quite big one for some people. So big, that I've had to start another paragraph. A lot of the time, in the middle of gameplay the game just relieves you of control to deliver you a cutscene. This may not seem like a big deal, but it does admittedly happen A LOT. The cutscenes themselves flow seamlessly with the game itself, with no loading, but they occur just a little bit too frequently for the liking of some people. Now if you’re going through the game for the first time and you want all that glorious story, chances are it won't bother you much. If you are a player that isn't really interested in the story and just wants to shoot guys then this will be a point of contention for you and your enjoyment of the game will depend on how tolerant you are of the cutscene interruptions.\n\nVISUALS AND PERFORMANCEHistorically, Rockstar haven't really put much focus towards the quality of their PC versions, but Max Payne 3 certainly bucks the trend. For me (and many others from what I hear) the game ran a constant 60fps with most settings maxed and probably would have gone higher if my monitor allowed it to. This is on a 2GB GTX 770 with an i5 4670k with both at stock speed. The keys are all fully rebindable and I felt very comfortable playing this game with both a controller and M+KB. If this is what is in store for us PC gamers when GTAV finally comes around, then we will be in for a treat. Unfortunately the Rockstar Social Club DRM makes another return here, but I personally didn't have much trouble activating my game through it.\n\nThe game looks beautiful too. The environments are varied and the attention to detail here is just mind boggling. The physics on objects are also very immersive. The way that glass starts out getting riddled with individual bullet holes that develop into larger cracks which then develops into all out shattering and raining down (can be seen here [gfycat.com]) . The stressful feeling you get as your wooden cover slowly splinters and turns to shreds under heavy enemy fire are all results of Rockstars fantastic physics engine. Although fire and explosions are mostly part of scripted events in this game, they are still look excellent despite the lack of being able to influence them dynamically during gameplay. An example can be seen  here [gfycat.com]. These are little things that you may not even notice, but that subliminal part of brain will notice these things and they all come together to make a thrilling experience.","January 30, 2015","true","15.8"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/204100/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","Max Payne 3 is what happens when you take barely-competent devs, give them a classic, well-liked franchise, force them to play Uncharted 2 for hours on end, and set them free to make a game so bloated by bad decisions that it's hard to see the good through the bad.\n\nI went in wanting to like Max Payne 3. I'd known most of the story, but I was still hoping maybe, just maybe, there'd be some redeeming quality about it.\nNope. The story was asinine, insulting to my intelligence, and essentially serves to completely take Max Payne away from his character, his motivations, and everything that he stood for. When it's not taking control away from you to force an ugly cutscene down your throat, it's told through internal monologues, the kind that made Max Payne and Max Payne 2 interesting to play through.\nHere, however, they forget that Max Payne isn't an action here with a sailor's mouth and multiple personality disorder, leading you to wonder if maybe Max Payne had been replaced by Bruce Willis in a B-movie nobody watched.\n\nI do give some nods to presentation, but they're reluctant. The graphics are top-notch, the environments look great and are varied nicely, but the screen effects, camera angles, and effects in Last Stand are distracting and ugly.\nSome of the lighting effects and reflections were absolutely astounding though, and I do give Rockstar the most credit here: the game looks great. A shame.\n\nIf the game played as good as it looked, I'd be a little bit happier, but it just doesn't. Max Payne and Max Payne 2 worked because they were unrealistic and they knew it. Max Payne 3 is a weird mesh of realism and surrealism that doesn't work at all. You bullettime dodge and it all goes slow-mo while you shoot dudes in the head. That's not realistic.\nYet seconds later you hit a wall, bounce off, and take three seconds to get up. That is realistic, but it's not fun and it takes you completely out of your groove. It's a bad way for Rockstar to show off their admittedly decent physics engine, and it serves to both look dumb and play worse, which is a good feat.\n\nThe gunplay is top-tier. It hits hard, it feels good, and it sounds better. The enemy tiers are almost straight-ripped from Uncharted, though, and shooting helmets off guys, which forces you to headshot them multiple times, serves as an annoyance -- especially when they will one-hit you from across the room if even part of your body sticks out.\n\nThe sound design is a puzzling mix of beautiful effort put into sound effects and gun sounds and complete laziness with the soundtrack. The music is completely boring aside from the remixed MP1 theme and I struggle to recall any music I can remember that wasn't insidiously grating to my senses and intelligence. (Strip club, I am looking at you.)\nThere is one moment towards the end of the game where there's a good song playing and you're shooting dudes in the face and it all flows pretty nicely, but it doesn't make up for the lack of other memorable tracks.\n\nMax Payne 3 feels like a betrayal to everything Remedy did with the prior Max Payne games. It turns Max from a sympathetic, hard-luck character into a mass murdering, suicidal drunk old man who somehow still pulls off Nathan Drake-like stunts. It pulls ideas and concepts from other games wholesale (Rockstar must really like Naughty Dog) and shoehorns them in with little regard for gameplay or story. The story tries to make you think, but it actually tells you what to think and then it repeats it a few times for good measure, then ends in a completely dumb way that contradicts the entire rest of the game.\n\nAvoid at all costs if you've played MP1 and MP2 and liked them at all. If you're just starting the Max Payne series and you feel you must play this game, play it before the other two.","January 9, 2013","false","23.9"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","2"

One second you are watching a cinematic and a second later you are thrown into a room giving you 5 seconds to headshot 10 people or you die a merciless death. Unlike most modern shooters, there is no regenerative health, forcing you to be very aware of your situations and any reckless moves will cost you greatly. The AIs aren't necessarily the smartest, but they will try their best to flank you and shotgun you to the face. Even with his Bullet-Time skills, Max never felt too overpowered and still requires you to take cover and plan your moves accordingly.\n\nPresentation: The game takes place in Brazil, and interestingly the developers decided to keep the game authentic and make all natives speak Spanish instead of broken English, and just like Max, your inability to understand what the people are saying makes you feel foreign and secluded, which makes the game that much more immersive.\n\nThoughts: for a 30+ GB installation, this is actually a rather short game, with just a bit over 12 hours of campaign. The gameplay is fairly linear and there really isn't much to explore. there are also occasional rag doll problems where you'll see Max flail his arm around and not being able to shoot anyone, giving you a frustrating death. Overall this game is incredibly well polished and enjoyable, highly recommended.","January 19, 2014","true","11.5"," 44 of 58 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","44","58","0","4"

It breaks the game entirely. The first two Max Payne games forced you to be constantly on the move to win, always running and gunning in order to move forward. You were rewarded for taking risks. MP3, by constrast, rewards you for crouching and hiding, forcing you to jump from cover to cover with brief snaps of bullet time. This is especially evident on harder difficulties, where you are often instantly killed just for poking your head out. This KILLS the fun that you should be having. Cover systems are all the rage nowadays and they can be done right, but this is just about the worst implementation I've seen.\n\nThe comic book style unfolding of the story is also gone, and for the worse. Instead we get blurred-out color-saturated cutscenes. LOTS of cutscenes. Seems like every door between shootouts is another cutscene. They get old fast, and the story and characters are not interesting enough to keep them from dragging.\n\nMP3 can be fun at times, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has played the first two games - you will be disappointed.","August 5, 2014","false","16.7"," 81 of 121 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","81","121","0","0"

A brooding background score, well crafted cut-scenes interspersed with ‘slow-motion’ action sequences, and ultra-violence personified make this a title that will well please its target audience.\n\nCampaign: Released by Rockstar Games in 2012, ‘Max Payne 3’ is the final installment in a trilogy of games which began with the cult-classic ‘Max Payne’ in 2001, and ‘Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne’ in 2003. Now nearly a decade later, Max, an ex-NYPD police officer, finds himself washed up, out of work, addicted to meds, staring down the bottom of a bottle, and taking a job as head of security to a powerful real estate tycoon in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The campaign is a dark sordid journey of betrayal, revenge and murder winding through the twisted underbelly of inner-city Sao Paolo and its favelas. As with most Rockstar games, the background setting is the real star here - with considerable effort clearly expended in replicating the vibe and authenticity of wealth, corruption and gang-warfare in Brazil’s second city.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: Well conceived cut-scenes deftly transition into a fairly standard third-person shooter with a multitude of weapons, melee attacks and explosive devices at your disposal. Gameplay is fast, smooth and fluid and the standout feature of all the ‘Max Payne’ games – “Bullet-Time” – is well represented here in all its slo-motion, headshot, blood-spraying glory. It is usable in both Regular (slowing down time) and ‘Shoot-Dodge’ forms wherein you can leap in slo-mo in any direction across furniture, down stairwells, across rooftops taking down adversaries in cinematic fashion. A departure from the run-n-gun gameplay of the earlier titles, a newly introduced and quite serviceable cover system also adds a tactical element to gameplay to counteract the scores of hostiles that converge on your position as you progress. Beyond the main campaign, the game also features a strong multiplayer component – with both competitive and cooperative gameplay options - and expandable with 4 DLC packages (each with 4 MP maps, weapons and upgrades). K&M and Controller are both well optimized, and graphics, lighting and sound are excellent overall as well.\n\nFlaws: In considering its shortcomings – perhaps the game’s biggest flaw is its inescapable linearity, and the lack of any real variation in gameplay as you move from one (albeit gorgeous) shooting gallery to the next. Lengthy and unskippable cutscenes (when you want or need to replay a section), an uneven difficulty curve, an oppressive 30+ Gig install requirement, limited replayability and the need for ‘always on’ Rockstar Social Club 3rd Party-DRM blemish an otherwise great title.\n\n‘Max Payne 3’ is a gripping, action-packed, brutally violent shooter with phenomenal gun-play, slick visuals and a great storyline. By almost any measure, this is an impressive title and ultimately a great example of a ‘shooter’ done right – but! as a ‘Rockstar’ game (specifically, the folks responsible for genre- and industry- redefining works like ‘Grand Theft Auto’ and ‘Red Dead Redemption’) – you, as I, might be left feeling a tad bit wanting of more innovation or variation in gameplay, by the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/204100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Remedy’s first two Max Payne titles were a real rarity in the lurid world of action games. They wore their nostalgia for film noire and Hong Kong cinema on their sleeves, but were also cuttingly self-aware, pointing out the more ludicrous aspects of their own genre with a protagonist who could sometimes scarcely believe the situation he was in. Max Payne liberally broke the fourth wall in the first two games but when the jibes were over, the titles served as some of the best third person shooters of their era.\n\nMax Payne 3, then, focuses on Max as a drugged out, liquored up mess, and this is fitting. Max Payne 3 isn’t a bad game by any stretch but it has clearly sacrificed some of its wit and soul on the path back to prominence. Remedy is no longer at the helm, which leaves publisher Rockstar to develop the game internally…and all that it implies.\n\nMax 3 starts promising enough. Max has apparently fled New Jersey for a private security gig in Brazil, working with an old friend from the police academy named Passos. Max and Passos are charged with guarding a prominent Brazilian politician and his family, and the easy paychecks and opulent atmosphere have allowed Max to sink even deeper into his alcohol and painkiller habits. Rockstar may like to spend way too much time watching Max get absolutely trashed on vicodin and whiskey in his apartment, but that wouldn’t make for a very exciting game, so it isn’t long before the family is attacked by paramilitary thugs and Max and Passos are off on an ill-conceived hostage hunt.\n\nThe gameplay, particularly the movement and shooting feel much tighter than GTA4, and this has a lot to do with Rockstar apparently imitating the first two Max Payne games. Aside from Max only being able to carry one set of dual wielded handguns and maybe a rifle or shotgun on the side instead of an entire military arsenal, the aiming, shooting and acrobatics are replicated almost perfectly in the new game. Max also doesn’t have recharging health; you have to grab painkillers and slam them back when his HUD silhouette starts filling up with red, just like the old days. The first few levels make you feel right at home, but then things start to fall apart when the difficulty ramps up quickly.\n\nThe problem is that Rockstar tries to implement current shooter mechanics—big emphasis on cover combat, limited ammo reserved, huge set piece rooms filled with enemies—with the game design from the old Max Payne games and it just doesn’t work very well, especially if you try to play Max 3 like Max 1 or 2. If you do a graceful slow-mo gun ballet dive out of cover, expect to get shot to pieces. If you happen to bump another piece of cover or some other extraneous object, it automatically kills your slow-mo, and this is a common occurrence considering how cluttered the environment gets later on. Focus-diving just isn’t a good tactic anymore and the only time you’ll be able to use it effectively is during scripted events.\n\nThe mix of Max’s classic bullet-time acrobatics and the rote, modern waist-high cover gunplay is a clumsy one at best. I often found myself hunkering behind cover, leaving my time-slowing focus to languish. As the game got harder and enemies became inexplicably tougher I was even less inclined to dive out and instigate a bullet ballet; the only way it could end is Max clumsily landing in a heap, scrambling to his feet and rushing back to cover, taking several unnecessary bullets to his hide in the process.\n\nFranchise disappointments aside, once I got to about the halfway point I was genuinely enjoying Max Payne 3. It was easy to get into the groove of the gunplay and unlike many other cover based shooters, Max 3 didn’t feel stale for quite a few levels. But a game is more than its gameplay, especially with something like Max Payne—the game’s story needed to stand on its own and this is where Max 3 falters again.\n\nAt first the storytelling and presentation are great—if anything Rockstar knows how to make a good first impression. The cutscenes are done in a dynamic comic-panel cutaway style, with various frames sliding into place and important or witty dialog superimposed with eye-catching subtitle boxes. It really makes the sometimes overlong, load-time disguising cutscenes bearable, at least on the first play through, and lends the game both a traditional film noire attitude and a vague South American cinema sensibility as well.\n\nAbout a third of the way through, Max develops a serious case of cutscene stupidity for the sole purpose of progressing the plot. I’m not talking about when he shaves his head and I don’t want to spoil anything, but a little past the head-shaving the game starts to get a bit too ridiculous and just keeps going farther into double-cross conspiracy insanity, as Rockstar’s crime dramas have a tendency to do. This is really aggravating because when Max isn’t being inordinately stupid I really enjoyed his dry, sardonic personality, and his sarcastic quips never get old. He just doesn’t react to the insanity by breaking the fourth wall.\n\nMax Payne 3 runs into the same problem I’ve had with a couple other Rockstar games—instead of the game laughing with you and winking about its own ludicrousness, it plays things so dark and extreme that it becomes an unintentional parody of itself. So many people get ventilated and Max gets shot, beaten and shredded so many times in the first few levels that you can’t possibly take the hard boiled plot seriously.\n\nOf course the Rockstar pedigree applies to the game’s production values. The RAGE engine is definitely showing its age but if you can get past the somewhat janky facial animations, the rest of the game is gorgeous. It starts off a little muddy and generic, but that has more to do with how overdone “gritty” visuals are this generation. Once Max gets out into some of the more exotic locales and starts flashing back to the dingy streets of Jersey the visuals really start to shine, and they stay almost sensory-overload good until the credits roll. The slow-mo effects can be breathtaking, with bullets whizzing toward the camera after just barely missing Max, and each firefight is capped off with a bullet-trajectory killcam that highlights the last lethal shot, focusing in on a goon’s perforated gut or fractured face.\n\nThe sound design is equally good. James McCaffrey reprises his role as Max Payne and realistically pulls off the character as older, number and more jaded, but with a killer edge that comes back out when needed. The plot’s writing may be kind of messy but Max’s dialog is as good as ever, even if it got less snarky and more doom n’ gloom as they game wore on. In any case McCaffrey just nails the delivery every time, even making wry justifications whenever you pick up yet another bottle of pills.\n\nI know I’ve been saying this for a while, but Rockstar just doesn’t know how to mix humor and serious drama. They always end up with a whiny, mopey anti-hero cast against a world full of ♥♥♥♥ jokes, cliché gangster parodies and other assorted “mature” humor and it all comes off like some angsty fanfic written by a 13 year old trying to look cool. With a character and world as strong as Max Payne’s some of that pretense is mitigated, but it’s still clear that the storytellers at Rockstar have trouble growing up. That said, I’m optimistic. The story of Max Payne 3 is ultimately a fresh start for the character. Hopefully, after a somewhat rocky return to slow-mo dives and epic gun fights, the Max Payne series has a brighter future ahead.\n\nMax Payne 3 is a real love-hate relationship. Just when the solo story is getting good, the gameplay will get clunky, the slow-mo will go unused or Max will do something dumb. Max 3 is a rocky return to form but at least Max Payne is back and dodging bullets again.","August 6, 2014","true","107.3"," 59 of 88 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","59","88","0","0"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Max Payne 3 is the latest installment in the popular and award winning Max Payne franchise. Unlike the first two titles however, Max Payne 3 is fully developed and published by Rockstar Games whose notable works include the popular Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise.\n\nOnce again the player steps into the shoes of Max Payne, a former New York City Detective who, after the events of the first two games, went on a downward spiral both in career and personal life. Now, 9 years since the last game, Max retired from his job as a detective and now works as private security contractor in Brazil. Things were going well (aside from the Pain Killer addiction and Alcoholism), until he's caught in another conspiracy, this time, involving gang violence, a corrupt police department and the kidnapping of the members of a famous and wealthy family.\n\nPROS:+ Gorgeous Graphics and Visuals (Except for the Filters, See Cons)\n+ Great new Setting (Brazil)\n+ Scenic locations and flashbacks (Brazil and New Jersey)\n+ Great sounds, voice acting and soundtrack\n+ Good story writing (albeit a bit more generic compared to the last two games, it's still very well written)\n+ Improved gameplay (added a new cover system and 'last man standing' among other things)\n+ Large weapon variety\n+ Collectibles that reward the player with either additional story or improved weapon upgrades\n+ Intense and action packed combat\n\nCONS:- Excessive cutscenes\n- Extremely long loading times that make some cutscenes technically unskippable (“Still Loading” after 3 minutes of cutscene I want to skip is unacceptable, specially on an SSD)\n- Excessive use of Filters that can cause headaches\n- Unnecessary Multiplayer\n- Rockstar Games Social Club\n- MASSIVE 35 Gigabyte Storage requirement (probably because of Con #1 see above)\n\nOTHER NOTE:- Linear storytelling is FINE, its a good way to tell a narrative story in a directed pace. Not every game needs to be open world people.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and I liked it. As a Max Payne fan, I was pleased with how Max Payne 3 wraps up the sad and emotionally crushing life that Max has lived. The Graphics were gorgeous with a scenic new location in São Paulo, Brazil. The story was a bit more generic than the deep emotional roller-coaster of the first 2 games but nonetheless, it's still very well written. Gameplay was improved by adding new weapons, last-man-standing, and a cover system to boot. The game does suffer from a very long loading time, excessive use of special effects filters and long cutscenes which made the game size a whooping 35 gigabyte.\n\nAll in all, Max Payne 3 is a GREAT GAME and a GOOD SEQUEL / Franchise Finale. I can recommend this game as it is in full price but if you are, get the regular Max Payne 3 and not the complete version. The DLCs are all for multiplayer and skins with no additional story or missions. With that said, the game does go on Sale very often.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The game basically works by locking you into an area until you shoot all enemies. Open the next door, cut scene, shoot dudes, next door, cut scene, shoot dudes. And wow, are these cut scenes melodramatic. Give me a break.\n5. Then the game crashes during a cut scene. I restart the game, play the area again, and it crashes at the same spot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dove_creme/recommended/204100/","dove_creme","Dove HIPSTER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dove_creme/","196 products in account","Max Payne 3 is a noir journey to the heart of the protagonist. The story is unfold upon the player's eye with convoluted and deep story telling by the protagonist, which is getting older and struggles with addiction and the ghost of loved ones. Max Payne 3 proves its audience that there can be noir settings other than snow and night.\n\nIn Max Payne 3, you can see and feel not only story-wise but gameplay-wise that Max is getting old, he no longer can dodge bullets and get up as quickly he used to do. Getting up takes time, Max dives awkwardly and stays down on the ground and ocasionally would hit walls. These are all story details that are blended into the gameplay masterfully. It doesn't breaks the frantic shooting action in any way, but also gives you a new way to play Max Payne and makes you be careful about making mistakes.\n\nThe action is pretty well paced as far the story and the gameplay goes. There are a good set of quiet segments and frantic bullet spraying all over the place as well.\n\nBut the star of the show of this game is Rockstar's SUPERB physics. Shooting guns never felt this good before. The impact physics is amazing and fun at the same time. Each gun has a different impact and power depending on the direction and range you shoot. I'm astounished by the physics which along the story is the selling point of this game.\n\nMultiplayer is dead, which is a shame, I'd like to know how it feels like to use bullet time on a multiplayer game.\n\nI really like the setting. Rockstar's R&D dept. did a pretty damn good job on researching Brazil's favelas, police forces and street gangs in a way that felt realistic and made sense even for a Brazilian. The voice acting plays a major role in the Brazil's impersonation aspect; The brazilian accent is perfect and the english doesn't seem awkward at all. They did a pretty good job on voice acting.\n\nMy only complaints goes to the railshooter sections. Railshoot doesn't fit in a Max Payne game. At all. It doesn't feel clunky, but it's boring when you'd rather be jumping and shooting bad guys.\n\nOverall, Max Payne 3 is IMO the best game in the series. Major overhauls at gameplay elements, daring settings and deep story will suck you into this noir journey in Brazil and New Jersey.","June 20, 2014","true","19.4"," 39 of 59 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","39","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwterminator/recommended/204100/","dwterminator","[DW]Terminator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwterminator/","1082 products in account","This is a 12-hour long cutscene with occasional third-person shooter segments and grind-fest multiplayer. It has almost none of what made the first two Max Payne games so great: the phenomenal storytelling, gripping plots, noir styling. The one thing it *does* have that the original two did is solid third-person shooter gameplay with cool bullet time mechanics. Only problem is that out of the 12 hours the story goes, maybe 45 minutes to an hour and a half of it is actual gameplay. The style in this game isn't noir. It's like the movie "Man on Fire," which on its own is actually a really good movie, but here it comes across as a bad crossover fanfiction. Replacing the noir style with Hollywood action/thriller was a terrible idea. It constantly feels like the game's trying to trigger epileptic episodes by having bright colors and distortions as well as random text from the dialogue (much of which is completely pointless to emphasize so why they bother with it is beyond me) flash all over the screen. The plot itself is rather stupid and has basically nothing to do with Max Payne; frankly they should've just made the protagonist someone else. Ultimately it insults me as a Max Payne fan that they didn't care at all about what made Max Payne 1 & 2 so special, and even outright spit in my face with segments like the graveyard sequence. It also insults me as a reasonably intelligent person because the plot is so incredibly thin and predictable, yet the game keeps acting like it's some masterful example of the art form. When there actually *is* gameplay, it's pretty decent, though you'll find the camera often spazzes out due to the cover in the environment, causing you to die because you can't get an angle on anything (which is especially annoying during the "last stand" thing the game does). Multiplayer's tolerable once you get to rank 4 and can create your own classes, but it's punishingly unfair to new players and there's barely anyone playing it so I advise not even bothering.\n\nIn summary, a badly-presented 12-hour cutscene with occasional third-person shooter segments that are decent, multiplayer that's a total grindfest and is completely unfair to new players, and a litany of technical issues. It's insulting to me as a gamer, as a Max Payne fan, and as a person with even reasonable intelligence. Don't bother.","December 1, 2013","false","13.8"," 49 of 77 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","49","77","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/204100/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionMax Payne 3 is a third person, action shooter with a very addicting bullettime mechanic and a good story to boot.\n\nDeveloped by Rockstar Studios in 2012, this game is no doubt a wonderful expansion to the already amazing series, and is a contender for one of the best in its genre.\n\nPlot DetailsProtagonist\nThe game series has you playing as (you guessed it) Max Payne, a pill addict and someone who should already be dead due to physical trauma. If you haven't played any of the previous games, you won't quite know what he went through, but take it from me, this guy is hard as nails. After losing his wife, (and every other main woman in his life) he goes on an endless killing spree to 'right the wrong'; or so he'd think.\n\nIn this game, your journey takes you to Brazil, nine years after the events of Max Payne 2. Max Payne, a middle aged man by now, is a tired, booze addict who simply wants a life free of action. If you ever hated pills and booze then this guy is going to ♥♥♥♥ you off. Max Payne consistently makes questionable choices and many of them don't seem to go his way, but if there's anything I'd commend is his persistence and commitment to whatever he's doing. As far as badass protagonists go, he's definitely close to the top of the list. Max Payne continually makes almost poetic comments about various situations he encounters, bringing an element of depth to a man who ruthlessly guns down those in his way.\n\nStory\nIn brazil, Max Payne wants an easy job, to get away from the horrors of the past. A friend of his, Passos, enlisted him for an 'easy' job of protecting the Branco family. Without revealing much, you'll discover that nothing is ever easy in the world of Max Payne. Almost anything that can go wrong, usually does. The story is pretty believable if you ignore the fact that he goes up against so many enemies with various high powered weapons, and is captivating enough for you to continue playing it.\n\nIn this story, nothing comes easy to Max, and you're sure to endure many painful/frustrating moments as you see just how human this guy is. But if you like a story of a man fighting till the very end, this is one hell of a treat.\n\nGameplayMax Payne's shooting is pretty satisfying. Headshots with most guns will instantly kill a target, while body shots may simply knock them down for a while. Some enemies will try to shoot at you if they aren't killed, incentivizing the player to ensure they are killed. I liked the fact that enemies were so dynamic, as they would try to take a shot at the player from wherever they could. They utilized cover pretty well, and would sometimes not even lean their body out to take a shot. As the enemies got tougher, their body armor and intelligence got better as well. Sometimes they would jump between cover slowly inching their way towards you, sometimes they would simply rush you down. It all depended on the type of enemy faced.\n\nUsing the bullet time mechanic, combat was always fun. Seeing the bullets whizz right past my face as I took out five enemies in a single dive was definitely satisfying. One welcome feature was the ability to shoot on the ground after I had done a bullet jump. This was helpful because there were some areas of cover that would be too low for a crouch but just right on the ground. Sadly the lack of a prone button was disappointing, as there's no reason why he couldn't have that.\n\nThe shooting recticle was a very simple dot in the middle of the screen, which incentivized proper aiming. This game, even more than previous games, focused a lot on utilizing cover and bullettime mechanics, as enemies could shred you in almost no time at all. Avoiding damage was the best way to progress through levels, but even so I found myself dying at various points and I enjoyed the feeling of satisfaction beating the enemies. Healing up was done through the signature painkillers, which I'm currently sick of (please no more painkillers, just let me die). Dying didn't totally leave you in a pickle, as you'd slowly gain more benefits to make a retry easier every time you died; more painkillers, ammo, etc. Overall, gameplay was quite fun, but definitely had a lot of challenge to it, perfect for people who are tired of the easy-mode shooters out there.\n\nVisualsMax Payne 3's visuals were both good and bad. The visuals were well done, and the environments were impressive enough, but for the love of all that is holy, STOP THE CHROMATIC ABBERATION. This cinematic effect, used no doubt for a 'drunken' feel, was the bane of my existence in this game. It's terribly annoying on the eyes and it needs to stop, like yesterday. That alone ruined a lot of the game for me.\n\nAudioI actually liked the music and voice-overs in MP3. I think enough effort was put into this aspect for it to warrant a thumbs up. Some aspects didn't exactly stand out, but I guess everything fulfilled its purpose well enough.\n\nMultiplayerSadly, multiplayer is dead, with one group out there dedicated to playing more Max Payne 3 multiplayer.\n\nSummary & ConclusionMax Payne 3 is a brilliant 3rd person shooter, with unique mechanics and a thrilling story. The audio and visuals are nothing to scoff at, but where this game shines is it's core gameplay and badass protagonist. Though the chromatic aberration and drug overdose nearly killed me inside, Max Payne 3 is a game you'll regret not playing.\n\n9/10 Worth a Buy.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's atrocious that a company would create and release a product like this. While it's too late for me to do anything about this purchase, I won't be buying any other Rockstar games until they remove these types of "security" measures which only serve to punish those of us who are actually paying for the game.","December 20, 2014","false","15.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","2"

The third part of the trilogy drops the praised Noir flair and replaces it with a stupified storyline, a bitter and permanently angry mainprotagonist, characters you dont really care about, and broad daylight battles in the slums and swamps of Brazil with a ludicrous number of human enemies to kill. You basically run from one flashy, overstylized cutscene to the next one. Oh, and in between you shoot stuff.\n\nDont get me wrong. The action is fantastic! I would even say magnificent. Rockstar definitely know what they are doing, by showing us how to create a playable action movie and throwing the player in a constant adrenaline rush with an alarmingly intense addiction rate. The staging of the levels is over the top. Gameplay is all about style and being the personified one man army. But besides this aspect and the pretty awesome graphics, the game has not much else too offer. That said, I only played the singleplayer. And even finishing the game a month ago, I cant remember sh*t about the story. Maybe the multiplayer makes up for that.\n\nLe conclusio:\nYou like fast and pure action games on hollywood blockbuster rating with lots of bullets and targets to shoot? Get this game for, I dont know, 5-10 bugs maximum. You will be entertained, guaranteed.\nYou loved the first two Max Payne's because of the Noir flair, the plot, the characters, and you are now looking forward to experience something similiar?

One of the best recent third-person shooter. The game-play , bullet-time,pain-killers, kill cam all were awesome . And one of the best thing about is optimization for PC, I was amazed to see this game perform so well , It gave me constantly 40-50 fps on my old pc on high settings , while gta 4 still struggles to get playable framerates .\nWhile it has great game-play and all, the story although good, didn't felt like the old max paynes , I mean that the dark feel was gone, when max was all alone and felt helpless, while in this game few missions you get to team up with another guy, not bad but that's not max payne style. And the levels felt more linear than the older games.\nAnother problem , others have been complaining about this game is the Rockstar Social Club which makes it unplayable for them, but I haven't faced a single problem till now, you just got to log in the RSC account for the first time, then just press two buttons during initialization , which isn't difficult or anything.\n\nI totally recommend this game to everyone.

You cannot even navigate the in-game menus before you get the accounts to synchronise which means ctrl-alt-deleting to exit the game before you can manage to do this.  I bought the deluxe version for the DLC and the next problem is using your codes.  There is no way to do this via steam since you have to use the rockstar client and I cannot figure out how to apply all the extra codes either via a browser or via the game itself.  It's a real chore, wish I'd not bought it now.  I am sick of issues with STEAM games.  I bought FEAR 2 last week which I couldn't even get running and now I paid extra for the deluxe version and cannot even figure out how to input the codes.

Some rent-a-clown with a gun who puts holes in other bad guys. Well that's what they had paid for, so in the end that's what they got. Say what you want about Americans but we understand capitalism. You buy yourself a product and you get what you pay for.\n\nStory Nine years after Max Payne 2, Max finds himself drinking away his sorrow after he got fired from the NYPD, for consorting with the criminal Mona Sax. He has developed a drinking problem and his addiction to painkillers has gotten worse. He has moved back to where he lived with his wife and daughter: Hoboken, New Jersey. Max gets into a confrontation with the son of the local mob boss Anthony Demarco. And an old friend who claims to have been on the police academy with Max, Raul Passos,  finds him at the bar, hoping to recruit him for a private security job in South-America. Max resists, but after he kills the son of Anthony Demarco, he has no choice but to flee from his home.\n\nGameplay Of all the three Max Payne games, Max Payne 3 has arguably the best gameplay of them all. The controls are very solid, and the gameplay can be very addictive. The good old bullet-time is back, and works mostly the same as it always has. Instead of being able to carry your whole arsenal with you, like in Max Payne 1 and 2, You can carry up to three weapons. Two small ones, and one big one. If you want to duel-wield your small weapons, you have to drop your big weapon. This is actually very fun in my opinion, this way you have to use every gun at least once. Max Payne 3 has fourteen chapters instead of three parts with each seven to nine chapters. Max Payne 3 is also way more linear than its predecessors. This seems like it has less content, but Max Payne 3 is the longest of the bunch, which will take the average gamer around thirteen hours to complete.\n\nMultiplayer Next to the story mode, Max Payne 3 has a surprisingly fun multiplayer mode. You can create your own character to use in various different modes. Or if you bought the DLC, you can play fan favorites in the free for all deathmatch mode, like Vladimir Lem, Valerie Winterson, Vinnie Gognitti, Mona Sax and more. The game also has a multiplayer survival mode, called Dead Men Walking. In this co-op mode, you play as Max or Raul Passos, and must fend of waves of enemies, which can be very addictive and fun.\n\nConclusion Max Payne 3 is a different kind of game than its predecessors. The gameplay is way more solid, and the change of setting may anger a lot of fans. But this change is very welcome in my opinion and works really well. The story has as in every Max Payne game a few twists and turns, which are still very well done. Many fans say that Max Payne 3 has gone away from its roots too much, but it's still a game about Max Payne, and it's still a very good game with a very interesting and dark story.\n\n8/10","November 16, 2014","true","31.7"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","1"

In order to start the game you need to create a social club acc. Now this wouldn't be to much of a problem because there are many games that have small add-on's you need to start it (Such as Far cry 3) BUT this social account isn't the only problem. There are pretty big problems sometimes with actually starting the game after making an account I believe due to processing of if you make said account. Also you need a pretty beefy computer or it wont run right. But if you have a good computer and don't mind making a Rockstar social acc. and possible error's with it by all mean's, go play it.

Combat is great, and the "realism" added to combat (limited weapon inventory, for example) doesn't hurt the fun of game like many other modern shooters. Cutscenes, although frequent, were balanced pretty well for me, but some might find them too intrusive. Unfortunately the game seems to ignore some of Max's character development from the second game, but Max goes through other interesting changes in 3 as well.\n\nStylistically, it pays more tribute to neo-noir than the classic film noir that inspired the first two games. This is not a flaw. In fact, it's a refreshing change of pace and an interesting approach. The video feedback effects and transitions in cutscenes are an interesting evolution of the graphic novel cutscenes of the originals. The vistas and dirty streets of Sao Paulo provide interesting evironments and exciting combat encounters, and the more realistic/serious tone of the game makes it a bit more thoughtful than the rest of the series. That being said, the writing lacks the creativity of the previous games. There's an occasional metaphor but for the most part it lacks the poetry of the (admittedly sometimes silly) dialogue and narration of the first two games.\n\nOverall it is one of the best shooters I've played on a technical level, and it has an above average / good story to boot. Its visuals and style elevate it beyond a generic action game and definitely make it (for fans of shooters and cinematic games) worth playing.\n\n","October 14, 2014","true","37.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

My point of view changed and I was having so much fun with the main story that I started thinking that was enough reason to buy this game.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game. Why?

Soon Max finds himself lost in foreign country without knowing the language and trying to find the way out. the game has Arcade mode where you can play singleplayer levels and get scores, which is fun, Game also has Multiplayer with many arsenal and costumisation, there are lots of gamemodes to play.\nafter playing this game for 170+ hours I still love it, if you are fan of Max Payne series you definitely need to get this one.

In this game, you play as a washed up NYPD Detective, never being able to leave his horrid past after his wife and daughter are murdered. To start, you do not need to play the other Max Payne games to know what is going on in the third installment; everything you need to know is detailed throughout the game’s narrative.\n\nThe game focuses on intense shootouts and bullet-time, most of the encounters in the game will end in blood soaked rooms, riddled with bullet holes, as tiles chip off the walls and crash to the ground. Max Payne 3 is a beautiful game, with visuals that can barely be rivaled by other games currently on the market. Contrary to Rockstar’s history, Max Payne 3 is a wonderful PC port, putting their last port, GTA IV, to shame. Max Payne 3 runs on all sorts of systems and doesn’t require the most up to date equipment to run. Sadly, Max Payne 3’s multiplayer experience is a bit flawed, as it is plagued with Russians (Like Dota 2) and hackers (most of which are Russians).\n\nHopefully with more patches, the amount of Reds ruining multiplayer will decrease.\nIn the end, Max Payne 3 is an experience that all gamers should enjoy, one of the best games of 2012.\n","January 22, 2013","true","151.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Max’s diet consists of liquor and pain killers to make him forget the sorrows of what had happened to him and his deceased family. Desperate to get out of his pitiful condition, he takes a job as a body guard for a rich Brazilian business man named Fabricas Branco. But it turns out that it isn't an easy job after all, when Fabiana, Fabricas' wife, is kidnaped.\nThe plot is full of conspiracies and sick twists and huge amazing set pieces and in the end... it pays off, it is one of the best stories told in a video game.\n\nGameplay:  Simple yet incredibly fun, with a huge array of weapons to choose from, you shoot, jump and make amazing "Matrix" type tricks, gunplay is refined and perfect.\n\nGraphics:  The game is beautiful, from art direction to meshes and polygons. Animations are one of the best around. Surprisingly, the game is very well optimized and it utilizes many PC specific features such as DirectX11. (which is weird for a Rockstar game)\n\nSound:  Voice acting is top notch with James McCaffrey returning as Max Payne. The soundtrack is AWESOME, don’t believe me? Just check out "Tears by Health" on YouTube, you'll love it!\n\nMultiplayer:  for the first time ever in a Max Payne game, a multiplayer mode is included. Many people were skeptical about it but as it turns out... they were all wrong. This fun creative experience has all the singleplayer abilities such as Bullet Time and Shootdodge in it, which makes it stand out from the crowd. it is fast paced and (sometimes) chaotic and balanced.\n\nOverall it was my personal 2012 GOTY and it still is.\n10/10","January 7, 2014","true","199.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

If you are a die-hard fan of the series, you might be thinking that this game doesn't have the "feel" as the other 2. I'll be straight out honest with you, I have yet to play The Fall of Max Payne as I am writing this review. Though 3 does have the somewhat the same feeling as to the original Max Payne. Rockstar Games did a rather phenomenal job at this game. It's not open world, and it's not Grand Theft Auto. It is a truly unique experience from Rockstar Games.\n\nThe Max Payne 3 graphics are stunning. Though as I played this on Windows 10, there were some minor graphical issues with Max's suit during the first few levels. Nothing major, just it kind of glitched inside of itself in the corner. Won't affect gameplay, I promise. Besides that, graphics are beautiful to look at. The shadows were good, and the color really went with the story. The voice acting is also wonderful. The voice actor for Max really just blows you away with the feeling he gives you with his rich voice. By listening to his voice, you can truly feel "Payne" Max experiences.\n\nMax Payne 3 truly left its mark with me. The story was great, the graphics were stunning, and the acting was also pitch-perfect. This game was a revolutionary experience for me, let it do the same to you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlStolls/recommended/204100/","KarlStolls","KarlStolls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlStolls/","409 products in account","It's been a long time, Max.\n\nMax Payne 1 and 2 were high water marks for third person shooters, the first for its gunplay and style and the second for pairing those elements with a tight story focus.  The second game wrapped things up conclusively, such that fans could be justified in scoffing at the idea of a sequel.  I certainly did when Max Payne 3 was announced, and it took a while before I could give it a fair shake.  In the end it's not without problems, and any recommendation should come with a few warnings attached, both for series fans and people just looking for a shooter fix.  Still, credit where it's due, Max Payne 3 earns the right to the title, even if (or perhaps because) it brings a different aesthetic to the table.\n\nOn the gameplay front, MP3 mostly succeeds at combining cover-based shooting with the more frenetic, two-fisted gunplay of the first two games. The mechanics and effects of shooting - how bullets hit the environment, how enemies react to being shot, how the guns sound and feel - are quite solid, though I do miss the old unlimited inventory for weapons. Cover works fine, bullet time is largely intact, and (on hard at least) your BT gauge recharges while you're under fire, as opposed to solely through kills. The "Last Stand" mechanism gives you a chance to take down your would-be killer after an otherwise fatal injury, provided you're carrying painkillers.  Other gameplay modes remove the feature, but I found it a welcome backstop that didn't cheapen the danger of each encounter.\n\nThere's a good variety of environments for each chapter, and even the dingier locations usually don't settle for brown and gray.  A couple flashback chapters touch on Max's life after the second game, and how he got to Brazil in the first place. An exploration element encourages you to look around, as each chapter has various clues that either explain the immediate situation or give broader context: a newspaper with financial reports, invoices, conspicuous bloodstains, etc. These don't affect the narrative in any way, but it did well to invest me in what was going on. Favelas in video games always seem to overstay their welcome, but I rarely got tired of one place before being carted off to somewhere else.\n\nThere are significant problems, of course. Level design is sometimes conducive to good gunfights, but too often you'll shootdodge, kill an enemy or three, and land right in the open where you are killed on the spot. I wound up using blindfire a lot simply because sticking my head up for more than a second was profoundly unwise, often getting me shot by enemies I didn't even know were there. Last Stand can sometimes trigger with an obstacle blocking your line of sight, preventing you from killing your target and forcing you to die.  You can't even reload the last checkpoint during this, and must instead wait to die before doing so.\n\nThe game's cutscene-heavy approach has an awful habit of yanking control and dumping you in a dangerous starting position. Worse, it often inexplicably switches Max to a handgun regardless of what you're carrying, meaning you will start several fights under fire and waste precious seconds switching back to your main gun. Exploration is undermined at times by NPC friendlies urging you to hurry up, and you wind up in contrived shooter situations with annoying regularity: turret sections, forced slow-mo dives/breaches, escort missions, etc. To their credit, the escortees usually have the sense to get somewhere safe, but a few will die over and over until you figure out what you're doing wrong.\n\nStorywise, I went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality. New York Noir has been swapped for a somewhat surreal stranger-in-a-strange-land motif. There's no Norse mythology, but Max remains the fallen hero to end all fallen heroes.  He has since spent his life in a haze of booze and pills, and he's only just waking up to the larger goings-on. The highlighting of key words in a conversation works well with the use of unsubtitled Portuguese, giving the impression that Max, who doesn't speak the language, is gradually learning to pick things up from context.  I'm curious if a native speaker can attest to the authenticity, but careful cutscene direction helped to establish characters' intentions, and the game did an excellent job selling the atmosphere to me.\n\nThe plot was intriguing and smartly grounded, a contrast of South American politics and high society with crushing poverty and pervasive corruption; less shadowy conspiracy and more the kind of evil that might actually happen when no one's looking. The writing does stumble at times, and Max's voice is wasted describing basic actions, like turning a valve wheel or picking up another bottle of painkillers. The game also lacks for a strong, memorable villain, but many of the main characters did make lasting impressions and offered glimpses of deeper personalities. A quiet conversation between Max and his employer was one of the game's high points, where the latter dissects his own flaws with brutal honesty.\n\nMax himself starts off as the alcoholic, anti-heroic killing machine advertised in the trailers, which is a bit of a backslide after MP2, but it's handled plausibly. It quickly becomes obvious that for all his claims of being burned out and washed up, there remains a decent person on the inside: torn between being unable to forgive himself and wanting to be something other than a walking, talking action movie stereotype, and still thinking like a cop besides. He's not too jaded to be horrified, and not too busy feeling sorry for himself to fight a grave injustice; a failing, flailing mess of a man that still knows right from wrong.\n\nFew things can top the artistry and efficiency of "I had a dream of my wife. She was dead, but it was all right," and nothing in Max Payne 3 quite gets to that level. Instead it shoots for something else, confidently building its own atmosphere and narrative, and taking its own chances with the character. Doing my best to discard nostalgia, I don't think it's as well written as the first two games and it was sometimes frustrating to play.  Nonetheless, it's a respectable and respectful followup, a late welcome back for a series I didn't think I wanted to see again.\n\nLike its namesake, Max Payne 3 can be a hazy mess of issues that are more than skin deep.  But also like its namesake, the game succeeds where it counts: killing an army of bad guys in style, all of whom can't seem to grasp that the crazy, wordy substance abuser with the guns stubbornly refuses to die.  Get a good sale price and there's no reason not to pick it up.\n\nTrust us now.

I was highly suspicious about what Rockstar was doing to my precious Finnish game by making it a trilogy that ends with a bald fat John McClane in the tropical heat of Brazil,  surely they've ruined everything ?\n\nActually, no they haven't. It's definitely different than the two previous games and I think that's a decidedly good thing (hardcore noire fans calm down there's still segments of good old Jersey which isn't quite New York but it's the perfect place for Max). R* may have left Noir York behind but they're staying true to the originals in gameplay, with a few improvements added. Bullet time remains unchanged and you won't find regenerating health here, pop the pills and struggle on with the incredible new gunplay which is the single biggest plus point for the third game. Max's movements in all directions with any weapon are so fluid that it's hard to appreciate it at times, it just seems so natural that the player will rarely notice it.\n\nFor me the story wasn't an important point, but rather served as a great excuse to put the old warhorse out on the battlefield one last time. You get to shoot at the thugs of favelas, senseless paramilitaries and a few mafia goons, armed with a shiny new game engine it's a fun experience that surprised me positively. The story is there at least and it stands on it's own, but only just, if you ask me. No comments on the multiplayer as I haven't played it.\n\ntenouttaten\n\nP.S.

The bullet time mechanic works very well, with solid gameplay. Dolphin dive around areas and go into slow motion and shoot your enemies. You can go into slow motion at any time you want, which enhances the game experience, and you have a certain amount of slow motion, to replenish it you must kill enemies or be shot at. You will heal your self with pain killers that you find throughout areas. The shooting feels fantastic, and is very fast paced, but the gameplay is very repetitive with linear level design, and a low variety of weapons. The story is not as good as the first Max Payne game, but the story still manages to be good, but there is way too many cut scenes and there is a few plot holes in the story that can bug you. The visuals are great, and if the game was to be released today with the same visuals, they would still be impressive. The length of this game is way too short, there are about 3½ hours of cut scenes and 2½ hours of gameplay (6 hours total) that was a huge disappointment and might be the biggest flaw of the game. But the length of the game is not all that bad, there is a fully fledged out multiplayer, and there is quite a bit of replay value in the game, such as finding the rest of the collectables, New York minute were you have a time limit to get through a level and Arcade mode. This can forgive the sad short length of the campaign. The game in my opinion is way too easy, but for a lot of people the game can be very difficult. I never found my self getting stuck on a level, and I only died very few times, but there is a little difficulty spike near the end of the game. If I was to recommend this game, I highly would. The game isn't ''Game Of The Year'' material, but this game is a must buy.","August 16, 2014","true","8.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","1"

While at times it felt a little silly or even border-line stupid (wtf moments), it does it so well, that you cannot help but appreciate the writing.\n\nThe actual gameplay has a lot of the same features that were in the previous game (such as the supernatural-slow-mo'-jumps). One of the key changes in gameplay from the past games, is that you are only able to carry two sidearms and one larger weapon at a time (or dual wielded pistols/SMGs) which does make planning your next move a little more complex.\n\nFor my part, I kept this game in my backlog for a long time, and regrettably so, as I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.","April 18, 2014","true","13.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","7","8","8","0"

If you are someone who wants raw action, and doesn’t want to see a lot of cutscenes or kill-cams: then you may not enjoy this. However, if you are someone who enjoys games that play like movies, this is something you must play. In my opinion, Max Payne 3 is one of the best cinematographic-action games ever made and likely will be for a long time.\n\nThe first aspect I will highlight in defense of my opinion is the writing and dialogue. Max Payne 3 easily has some of the best writing I have ever encountered in a video game. The overall narrative is interesting and entertaining, but the real beauty of the writing shines through in the dialogue. There are several lines throughout the game that will evoke that inner-thought of: “that was a good one.” And the excellent voice acting ices the cake to ensure the cutscenes have an A-one quality that rivals Hollywood movies.\n\nBesides the main cutscenes that give life to the actual narrative, there are also many other cinematic features woven deep into the gameplay mechanics. You can activate Bullet Time® and Shootdodge™ as you play through the fight scenes in each level; doing so will slow time and allow you to perform elaborate kill sequences. Further, bullet-cams and kill-cams will pop up periodically to show some nasty kills. There are also level-specific “special” kills that will slow time and create cinematic opportunities.\n\nThe fight scenes encompass the vast majority of the actual gameplay of Max Payne 3. The game is very linear and generally ushers you from one shootout to the next, with a cutscene in between to show more plot development. There are some secret areas and collectibles, but generally the areas where you are in control are rather small and undeviating. However, this is perfectly aligned with the movielike feel of the game; and the levels are well-designed and diverse, so they never feel boring or plain.\n\nThe whole experience is brought together nicely by solid graphics and animations, a high level of attention to detail, and advanced physics and particle effects.\n\nNow, Max Payne 3 is the third installment in the franchise. It is technically a direct sequel, although it feels a bit more like a spiritual successor. You can easily enjoy this game without having played the first two. (Of course, it is still best to learn what happened in the story during the previous games). Also the first two installments in the Max Payne franchise were created by different people than this one. This game does go in a bit of a different direction compared to the earlier installments. For example, it isn’t quite as dark and noir; and also eases a bit on the deep, psychological inner-war concept. These, and other differences, upset some fans of the franchise (as seems to be a common theme in new installments of long-standing franchises). So be aware of this. I personally feel that all three games can be appreciated for what they are.\n\nArcade-mode, timed-mode, higher difficulties, and achievements all contribute to the possibility of many gameplay hours. There is also a multiplayer mode that is pretty fun. During the time I played, there was a decent amount of people who played regularly; although there were times I couldn’t find a game. I actually liked the multiplayer a lot and played it for dozens of hours, but I will admit that most people will probably find it lackluster.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend Max Payne 3 to anyone who would enjoy a heavily cinematic action-shooter and who would appreciate the amazing writing. It is one of the best “plays-like-a-movie” games ever made. Having said that, I can understand some of you just want action. If you want pure gameplay and/or generally skip cutscenes in games, you definitely should look elsewhere for your next shooter.","March 3","true","20.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Anyways what better to review than the much beloved (and hated, for some reason) Max Payne 3!\nDeveloped by Rockstar, you immediately can see the high production values with it's astonishing graphics, effects and cutscenes which are the best I've ever seen in any game. Hair looks really good, which is strange because only like 3% of videogames do hair good (even better than Tomb Raider imo, though TR does the physics of the movement better, but in 2012 there wasn't tesselation I think...). I also need to add that this game has one of the BEST PC Ports I've had the pleasure to try out!\nThe attention to detail beats any other game out of the water, which surprisingly detailed papers, photos, brands and other stuff you may find in your 10-12 hour journey.\nScenarios are very varied (even though they happen in the same country: Brazil (in portuguese it's Brasil with an "S" which makes more sense to me, but english isn't my prime language so maybe it's just me)!\nThere are level in the Disco, night forests, day forests, abandoned factories, luxury boats, etc. etc. Which really does make the game a nicely paced gem.\nAudio is just amazing, nothing there to criticize so I won't talk much about it: Voice acting is superb (as are the facial animations), so is the gun sounds and even the enemies in the middle of a gun-battle will outright say tactics (but most of the times they just curse) that most people won't understand but me, understanding portuguese as clear as pure water, had a blast listening and understanding everything without the need of subtitles, too bad it's pretty much just "Matem esse filho da ♥♥♥♥" or "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥", but oh well, it helps the player get immersed in the ♥♥♥♥ world Max got himself into, once again...\nOne part of the game I can't discuss well is the story because it's a mixed bag for me and didn't cause me a predominat feeling about it: It's filled with MANY plot holes and weird choices to tell the story, BUT at the same time it was interesting paced well enough to make me want to finish the game and still want to replay the game, though I want to replay it more for the (you guessed it):\n\n-Gameplay! It's superb in every aspect! It's old school goodness with small - almost non-existant HUD and non-regenerating health.\nBullet-time is back and it's awesome as you would expect, because who doesn't like taking a "layed-back-beach pose" while being half-in and half-out of a shattering window while headshotting 4 guys in a matter of fractions of second? No one, that's who! :DD\nAnyways, the gunplay is great, this is easily one of the best feeling 3rd Person Shooters I've had the pleasure to waste my time in! You also have collectibles which are golden gun-parts for every gun in the game, so if you callect all 3 parts, you get to use a golden gun, and HOLY ♥♥♥♥, it actually looks like gold! *Eyeballs to MW3*\nBesides gameplay itself, you (or most of you anyways) should be happy to know the game is hard in a good way! I played on the hardest difficulty possible at the start, finishing after 11 hours with a smile and many scars on my face while looking at the credits and thinking about the 500 or so deaths I had by the ending cutscene while smilling like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for accomplishing this hard as balls game.\nWhy is it so hard? Enemies actually know how to aim, just like a real player would, thus 1 well placed shot to the head will kill you instantly if you so much as peek outside cover during an intense firefight! Thinking fast and strategic use of your bullet time ability as well as good shot placement is key to survival!\n\nSide note: As a portuguese, it makes me so proud that portuguese is actually in a video game! I just loved the idea of incorporating something different rather than Russian or Arab!\n\nOh! Almost forgot about the multiplayer! - It's ♥♥♥♥! Moving. Right. Along!\n\nOverall, I think pretty much everything is covered... except the fan's reactions, which are... somewhat dumb, mainly due to the lack of reasons for their criticism, just because it "lost" the noir, when it should! Max Payne is a broken man, in his shoes, the last thing I'd do was to stay in that sh*thole of an apartment and waiting for death to slowly take me...\nAlso, how is Max a bad character that ♥♥♥♥♥es all the time? He's been through a lot, everyone like that is supposed to be (and feel) miserable! His everything died, so I don't think he should be watching family guy in a party-hat for a living, so I guess the painkiller and alcohol addiction makes sense and add a nice deep characterization to Max that the first 2 games missed completely!\n\nNevertheless, the game is pretty much flawless, except Rockstar's Social Club DRM, which still requires online log-in to play the single-player, which is bullsh*t! And the worst is that it will only log-in if it's in a good mood, otherwise, you'll have to play something else. It's weird that companies still add these DRM's to their games that no one ♥♥♥♥ing asked for in the first place! And for what? Stats? I can live without them, don't worry because I won't lose any sleeping hours because your DRM didn't count the amount of ♥♥♥♥ing painkillers I took in a mission! So, thank you but no thank you, RockStar, Ubisoft, Microsoft, ...\n\nAlso, the story, while interesting enough to elevate in in most shooters (which have bland stories most of the time), it has more (plot) holes than a slice of swiss cheese! Not as inconsistent as Sleeping Dogs, for example, thankfully enough!\n\n9/10 sounds about right, buy it below 30€, the collectibles and the great gameplay are good enough to make you want to replay it again, thus making it more worthwhile at a higher pricetag of 30€!","March 17, 2014","true","12.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Surely no one would notice another hole in the wall."\n\n"I started to wonder if my luck had finally run out when I realized it had, a long time ago.  It's why I was here."\n\n-Max Payne\n\nGood old self-deprecating Max is more quotable than ever before in Max Payne 3, the latest installment by Rockstar Studios into one of my favorite series.  The above are just a tiny sample of the nonstop narration he delivers to flavor the single-player campaign experience.  In my opinion this alone would justify playing through the game, even if it didn't have solid mechanics, excellent visuals and fun features like Bullet Time.\n\nMy time played (almost 10 hours as of this writing) reflects campaign completion on the Hard setting, some dabbling in the arcade mode and a few rounds of the extensively fleshed out multiplayer modes.  Even a brief foray into multiplayer reveals that there's plenty of progression to be had for those willing to pour hours into it.  Like any brilliant solo campaign, this one is an absolute thrill ride but feels tragically brief once finished.\n\nThe story is not what I'd call ambitious but for the most part holds up well: Max is a classic and highly satisfying tale of tragedy with dark comedy mixed in.  He's simply one of the most likeable antiheroes I've come across in gaming.  The choice of setting provides an interesting, colorful departure from the grit and grime of the noir style that characterized the previous games (but don't worry, there's some of that here, too).  Fans of the IP will recognize a few throwbacks to those predecessors.\n\nGameplay is functional and engaging.  Level design is mostly good, but here and there feels uninspired/recycled, which makes me wonder about the quality of all those DLC map packs I didn't buy.  Bullet time is tons of fun, rewarding twitch aim & fast reflexes.  On Hard difficulty there were only a few encounters I had to replay, and the frustration was minor so I'd recommend that setting.  Multiplayer--despite the variety of play modes, maps, weapons and avatar customizations--did not capture my interest, nor did I find the progression or social systems appealing.  I'm sure it comes down to personal preference, so I recommend you at least try it out, but for me personally there are better options when it comes to online shooters.  The arcade modes and time trials were also only of marginal interest to me so I won't discuss them here.  The strength of Max Payne 3 for players like me lies in the campaign.\n\nThe game appears bug free and has only minor issues.  During my hours played it only crashed once.  It ran smoothly with settings maxed--granted, the game is two and a half years old at the time of this review, but the visuals hold up well enough to triple A standards unless you're talking about top of the line resolutions.  I found it odd that weapons with a laser sight attachment were less accurate/useful than the standard ones due to the loss of crosshairs on screen in aim mode.  Also a bother was how the triggered Bullet Time would force me into my 1-handed weapon; threw me off a bit if I was using 2-handed and suddenly encountered an event.  On rare occasion activating Bullet Time will send you jumping over the edge of something like a building or dock, which is instant-death bad news, so be careful to avoid that very annoying problem.  The last and worst offender I have to mention is Rockstar's Social Club which in my opinion is an unwelcome and failed DRM-like hoop to jump through.  If when you first launch the game you can't sign into your account, go to their website and change your password then restart the game and it should log you in and let you register/activate the game just fine.\n\nI had a great time with this one and honestly would recommend it to any gamer who enjoys the action shooter, which Rockstar does extremely well.\n\nTIP: Use your Bullet Time wisely, as it will make fights much more manageable and sometimes save your bacon.  Timing and position are important.\nTIP: Keep your gun reloaded to avoid having an emptied clip while downed.  Downed w/no bullets = dead.","November 16, 2014","true","9.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Another con could be the lesser noire-style (comic book/graphic novel look), but Max still has that raspy narrative voice so I'm absolutely fine with it personally.\n\nIn my opinion, the reason multiplayer is nearly dead is because of huge sync/disconnection problems and that the multiplayer is unbalanced AS HELL.  The "pros" always use a chick character, due to the fact that females have super skinny hitboxes or something..  and they always duel wield pistols because rifles are absurdly weak.

You literally only play for like 2 minutes and there's a 5 minute cutscene, and this just keeps on going on. Not to mention it's the worst title out of the three Max Payne games. I had more fun playing the first one just last week, and the game is 15 years old. It doesn't look so good but the gameplay holds up really well. Shootdodging and bullet-time is actually possible to use and it was the core of the gameplay. In Max Payne 3 they get rid of all that by severely nerfing the bullet-time to be only used for like 2 seconds tops, and instead added a completely broken and unecessary new core to the game, the cover system. Seriously, the main gameplay you get in that 2 minutes is behind a cover waiting for the AI to push, otherwise if you try and move around have fun dying a few 100 times. The camera movement is really constricting, it completely ruins the freedom of the game, the little it has, and the movement although realistic can f*ck you over a lot of times. The developers knew that this game is insanely hard, so instead of unnerfing the bullet-time so that it would replenish everytime you got a kill even while in slow mo, they add a pain killer every 10 times you die in a sequence. Thanks game for telling me how much I suck. They stuck so much to realism and story they forgot to make a f*cking game.","March 4","false","13.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The storytelling is done very well with excellent voice work. Envorionments are detailed and beautiful, especially in the outdoor stages. It helps that the graphics in general look amazing when cranked up to maximum quality. Its no wonder that the game takes up 33gb in harddrive space.\n\nCombat has evolved very well in Max Payne 3. Being able to enter bullet-time and visually see Max run past streaming bullets is quite satisfying. Not as satisfying as watching a closeup slo-mo of a bullet popping the blood bag in an enemie's head. The gore really is top notch here. IT may not be realistic, but it damn sure looks good on screen.\n\nI actually found the combat to be quite challenging. This is the first game where I actually had to turn the difficulty down to the lowest level. I may not be the greatest at shooters, but I did manage to beat the Crysis games on max difficulty.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this game, even if you only touch the single player.

Rockstar removed almost everything that was good about the first ones.\n\nDO BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE OVER THE TOP HOLLYWOOD ACTION!\n\nI have only played the single player of this game, therefore I cannot judge the multiplayer aspect.\n\nThe gameplay is acceptable in it's core, but boy did they mess up with some aspects.\n\nAfter every cutscene (which is every second door you go through) you are usually put in a bad position in the middle of the room facing around 7 enemies, equipped with 1 pistol in your hand. Regardless of what you had equipped before said cutscene.\nFurther ruining this is the weapon switching mechanic. There is no more nice layout showing you all the weapons you collected. You have a stupid circle split into 4 which constantly bugs if you use the scroll wheel (keeps switching between only 2 options) and the default keybindings to said circle are horrible.\n\nThere are hidden things in most areas. Newspapers, television clips, clues about the story and parts of golden weapons that you can collect.\nWhich is a nice feature, I like exploring and finding out more about the story.\nBut! Max or whoever is on your side is constantly nagging you every 3 seconds to move forward, that you don't have time to look around.\nWhich pretty much makes you choose between getting more insight into the story while constantly being harassed or rushing through the game because the story tells you to, ruining any immersion.\n\nEvery time your life depletes and you still have some painkillers you go into slomo facing the person that shot you giving you a chance to kill him and use a painkiller.\nNot a bad idea, if it wasn't ruined by what happens next.\nAfter you kill the guy, you fall on the ground forcing you to get up again.\nYou can't get into cover instantly from the ground. If you press Q (default key to get into cover) while behind some cover you first stand up and THEN go into cover thus getting shot multiple times again (usually forced into the whole slomo shootoff again on higher difficulties).\nWhy didn't they bother working out the cover mechanics? They just slapped some half a$$ed attempt into the game.\n\nOne thing that I found pretty good was the ability to switch the camera angle so that your character was either left or right of the reticle.\nBUT! As expected, there is also a flaw with this.\nThe bullets hit the target of the reticle regardless of what is between the gun and the reticle.\nSo most of the time I was hitting an enemy behind a wall even though Max himself was completely behind that wall.\n\nThe only reason I kept playing until the end was my hope of there being just a little bit of the old Max Payne in there.\nBut I found the story to be a boring, cheesy joke. I could not feel anything for the characters at any point in the game, they were all just dull and uninteresting. Everything about it felt forced and mindless.\n\n\nI actually replayed the first Max Payne about a year ago. I loved every second of it! Everything about that game sucks you in. The way the story is presented, the story itself, the gameplay, the atmosphere, the freedom to save whenever you want.\nEven today it's still a refreshing game!\n\n\nRockstar couldn't have done much worse with this attempt at Max Payne. They had a solid foundation with the story and gameplay from the first ones. They decided to take Max Payne a completely different route and completely failed to deliver.\n\nIf I had to rate it as a Max Payne game I would give it no more than a 3/10. Not even worth buying during a steam sale.\n\nIf, however, they made this as an original story I would give it close to a 6/10 probably.\nThe game has lots of flaws and the story really lacks, but it is an acceptable action game.\nI played it on hard difficulty and the challenge was decent.\nYou can probably have a bit of fun in the multiplayer and it would be worth a couple of bucks if you're looking for an action game to kill some time with.","December 7, 2013","false","12.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

With this kind of physics engine it's really incredible how player's and NPCs bodies act. When you shoot enemy it doesn't looke like you shot doll or something, it really looks alive and realistic. Shooting and physics is best part of this game - never seen anything like that in any game. I mean damn, it's TPS game, but i enjoy shooting way more than in any FPS game, i think that tells a lot.\nWhat else? Music is fine, sounds are nice(guns sound like guns unlike CoD), voice acting is nothing to complain about.\nOh yeah, multiplayer! It's kinda unbalanced: lots of perks and highlevel guns, so if you are low level, prepare to be ♥♥♥♥♥ by those who came before, lol.

I haven't played a more quick-time event heavy shooter which feels the need to inconvenience the player at every possible situation. You're constantly stripped of your weapons and put in the worst cover areas imaginable before unskippable cutscenes.\n\nThe game quickly becomes incredibly frustrating and expects you to know where every single enemy will come from. It's not fun to shoot 50 bad guys at every single encounter, with ammunition and bullet-time being so scarce it becomes tiresome pretty quickly.\n\nI have no idea what Rockstar was thinking turning Max Payne into some AAA cover shooter, the ending isn't gratifying either. The story elements are predictable forcing every depressing lame line of dialog out of the protagonist every 5 minutes. The game plays and paces like a typical bad Hollywood movie with plenty of explosions to keep the more simple minded players engaged.\n\nI did not have fun and I don't believe many others will either, even fans of the cover shooter genre. I don't have much good to say other than the graphics and animations are excellent along with the voice acting.

TBH it is like Rockstar came up with a really bad story and decided use Max Payne series' name to sell it. Max Payne 3 has nothing to do with the series. Characters are just meaningless even Max himself is. This game is just cut scenes + fight against 20 people again and again and again.\n\nEvery cut scene makes you change your weapon even drop it automatically sometimes and you always drop your painkillers at beginnings of chapters. It is just ridiculous to have such a system. . Just why?\nMost of the time cut scenes end with Max being a complete idiot and covering behind the worst possible places (e.g: http://i.imgur.com/gocpJzd.png During the cut scene Max was at the behind of bar-like-thing at right most side. Then he decides covering behind some luggage might be a better idea and does it).\nMost of the time you start chapter with half health since every enemy is covered well but since Max is an inexperienced ex-cop, he just stands there and takes hit.\n\nAnd... they made such a badass character wear flip-flops.

I can't speak for the multiplayer as I've never touched it but the single player story is everything it should be. Series purists might be put off by how often there are cut scenes and dismayed by the fact that there are numerous fail conditions that can happen that don't involve Max soaking up bullets or explosions. The bottom line is that you get to watch a lengthy summer blockbuster action movie where you play through all the shootouts of which there are many.\n\nMechanically the game is damn near flawless (minus one arbitrary "boss" encounter) in that precision and quick thinking are rewarded properly. Making good use of the cover system, bullet time, and shoot dodging are essential to beating the game on harder difficulties where even on normal you WILL get flanked by aggressive enemy A.I. that won't let you "stop n' pop" like in other shooters. The guns all have a certain weight to them ( a .50 Desert Eagle just "feels" heavier than a .45 in a very noticeable way) and you'll be forced to mix up your arsenal often. Finishing the game was a satisfying experience and while I didn't feel compelled to return on higher difficulties right after my first pass I came back later with renewed appreciation.\n\nVisually the game holds up really well 2 years after release. Some finer textures and such might not fare well to heavy scrutiny but the environments are varied with tons of background detail and props while the character models respond to gunfire in a sickeningly visceral way. It's pretty hard to take a screen shot that doesn't look good when you are in a shootout. Aurally the voice acting is solid, the soundtrack is top notch, and the various sounds of battle compliment the action well.\n\nOne of the more common gripes I've heard about the game is that the story is lame and it is excruciatingly linear, to the point where on a few occasions if you explore the same area for too long when no enemies are around you'll trigger a fail condition because you didn't follow your companion and he's killed in a short cut scene. I can understand that frusturation. What I don't understand is how some would interpret the story as simply dumb and completely senseless without thinking about it. Unfortunately explaining it would be a spoiler but since the story is about Max and is from his perspective that is PRECISELY how it is meant to appear. You are meant to be Max in this situation but you are not meant to influence him. You are meant only to see and feel how he does and not decide who he is. You're meant to get clarity at the same time he does and it does seem dumb as hell when it all falls together,  right? Max thinks so too. There's also a lot of nuanced visual flourishes meant to convey Max's mental issues and state that some might have mistaken for simple grittiness or what have you. Either way the game is considerably smarter than the trailers would have you believe.\n\nIn conclusion I get the impression that the game was a critical success but commercially floundered, considering how quickly it went to sale prices and how frequently the game is 80% off. Maybe I'm just being pretentious in thinking that I "get it" while others looked down on a decidedly less gamey Max Payne. All I know is that as a standalone product the single player game is worth the 20 dollars it goes for now. If you like good action games and can take the time to enjoy a decent narrative then you'd be a complete dunce for passing this up when it's on sale.","August 31, 2014","true","74.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They're both excellent and it seems to me that a number of the characters and most of the setting of Max Payne 3 is inspired by or simply lifted from those films.\nMax Payne's story serves primarily to put large numbers of tangos in your line of fire so it does get a little silly but you're playing a game where bullet-time allows you to get sick headshots while floating in mid-air, so all in all I can't complain.","April 18","true","20.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I passed four times and still I will pass.\nFine plot. The protagonist wasn't changed (except appearance). Max's character too not strongly was changed that very much surprised me and pleased. After all usually, when the rights for a good series are bought by other developer, it is spoiled. And to "Max Payne 3" so it didn't happen.\nThe protagonist, Max Paine is the same man who lost meaning of life, but continuing to live, became the cynical, melancholic drunkard liking to philosophize. With development of a plot Max will get rid of a habit to drink that leads to a logical ending where Max understands all sense and goes somewhere to a distance. Thanks to James Mccafrey for such charismatic character and for a postscoring of the previous parts.\nIt isn't enough noir. Yes, it is much less than it, than in the previous parts. It is only in chapters of memoirs of Max about New York. But it not a problem. The main action happens not in nuarny, gloomy, winter/autumn New York at all as it was in last parts, and in solar Brazil. Respectively, there was other atmosphere in which there is more than hatred of all to each other, than a hopelessness.\nThe smart graphics, thus excellent optimization - game works at old computers. The physics is a little oddish: somehow it isn't believed that the person can do a somersault, jump up and do other unnatural when firing of a thing in it. But it, perhaps, the trifle which isn't influencing game.\nDynamic gameplay, as well as in single, and in network games. Also pleased shelters - when on you the crowd runs, is where to hide and shoot back. Certainly, delay of time was left to leave the main counter of all series. A sound multiplayer where won't allow to miss. Pleased the additions for network game adding new cards, characters, the weapon and other. Especially the addition of Painful Memories Pack adding to game of the card from Max's memoirs was pleasant.\ncinematic is one of game counters. Thanks to it many scenes of game were strongly remembered. Game as the drama fighter looks that too played a big and important role in creation of the atmosphere the Smart soundtrack which played a big and important role in the atmosphere for which it is worth thanking Health group (by the way, fine group).\nAfter passing of this game in soul there were strange feelings, feelings of lostness, a decay, uncertainty, futility, a hopelessness, grief, grief, and the ending and a soundtrack strengthened these feelings. I consider, on this game it is necessary to shoot the movie, as well as on all series. It, certainly, one of the best modern games. About this game it is possible to speak eternally. Rockstar Games tried, not for nothing three years spent. Thanks, Rockstar. I have not many favourite games. This one of them. And even thanks to this game, I learned about the Health group which became to one of the most beloved groups.

If you want to play this, you have to join Rockstar's stupid social club or whatever it is.\n\nRemember when Max Payne was a badass in the first two games... yeah, you won't find that guy here.  I don't even recognize who the guy in this game is supposed to be, because it's not Max Payne, it's gotta be some fake who happens to have the same name.\n\nThe most annoying aspect of the game may be the non-stop cutscenes.  Cutscenes happen over and over again every level.  Some cutscenes end with you already being shot at, so you're already taking damage when you gain control.  During every cutscene, the game switches your weapon to the pistol you have in your first slot.  So after every cutscene, you have to switch back to your primary weapon.  Thanks fake Max, I fully intended to engage these 6 enemies with your pistol that holds 8 rounds instead of the 30 round assault rifle you're now holding in your offhand.\n\nThe story in this game is incoherent at best, it's like they didn't even bother trying.  You can't have me running around killing hundreds of bad guys, then suddenly have a cutscene where Max decides he's a ♥♥♥♥♥boy who can't handle 6 bad guys and gets captured.  Max is constantly being captured by people who should be putting a bullet in his brain, but don't for no real coherent reason.  Likewise, there are many cutscenes where bad guys could simply shoot him dead, don't, and instead it's just them yelling at each other.  That's right fake Max, go into that room, surrender your gun and beg for the girls life, that will surely work.\n\nI also had plenty of gameplay nitpicks.  If Max gets close to a wall with a gun, he'll point the weapon up in the air.  This is very problamatic since they turned this game into a cover shooter.  Sometimes you'll pop out of cover to shoot and Max will point his weapon up at the ceiling... Thanks fake Max, that's what I wanted to do, shoot the ceiling instead of the bad guys in front of me.\n\nYou're also limited in the arsenal you can carry, 2 pistols/smgs and a primary weapon.  If you ever want to dual wield pistols, which is the only real fun in the game, Max has to drop whatever the primary weapon he is carrying.  Eventually, you can't dual wield anymore since you'll run out of ammo in your pistols and no longer have a fallback weapon.  Thanks fake Max, for not allowing me to actually have fun using the dualies.\n\nShootdodge is very buggy and I stopped using it around 1/4 of the way through the game.  Sometimes I would press it and it would work right away, but other times I'd press it and Max wouldn't know what to do.  Then 3 seconds later it would randomly activate and he'd start diving across the room.  Thanks fake Max, for waiting to dive until I've already been shot up, gotten to cover, and then randomly activating and diving out into the open again.\n\nIf you are moving when you try to pick up an item, instead of stopping to pick it up, Max rolls over it and picks it up.  Not the biggest issue, but I was very annoyed when I tried to pick up a gun along the side of the Panama Canal.  Thanks fake Max, when I told you to pick up that gun, I wanted you to roll off the side of the Panama Canal and to your death, how'd you know?\n\nThe game has clues and weapon parts scattered throughout.  The clues are pointless, they do nothing and add nothing to the game, I don't know why they're there.  The weapon parts turn your weapons gold if you collect all 3 parts.  Collecting them can be very annoying since the game has spots where you must choose 1 of 2 paths to go.  Behind path number 1 is a weapons part, behind path number 2 is the continuation of the game... Thanks fake Max, for constanly breaking the door/pathway/whatever behind you so I couldn't go check out that other room.\n\nI could go on and on with problems.  This game sucks.  Go away fake Max Payne, bring back the real Max Payne so I can have a fun game with an interesting story.","February 4","false","12.1"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","32","58","9","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/recommended/204100/","Masterchiefs","Belegarssøn #ianmcshanerocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/","951 products in account","Max Payne was one of my childhood games (along with Unreal Tournament 2004, Devil May Cry 3, GTA Vice City and TES III Morrowind). Up to now, I still can't forget the cop with monkey face (due to old graphic technology) a.k.a highest NY mobs bodycount mungo with sick humour who only has one thing to do: blast a hole in bad guys' faces in slooooooooooow motion, oh yeah and drug too, that Valkyr drug created nightmares inside Max's mind became one of the first horror segments in video games that I've ever experienced. And then Max Payne 2 came to my life, the awesomeness continued with a love story, Captain Baseball Bat and moar sloooooooooow motion. With me, Max Payne 1 and 2 redefined third-person shooter genre and they remained my favourite games of all time.\n\nWhen Rockstar Games first announced Max Payne 3, I honestly thought the game would failed because it no longer took place at NY and it didn't have classic noir them anymore. Well, I was wrong...\n\nLet's kick off with the reason why we all play Max Payne for: presentation and story (I won't tell anything related to the story because I want to avoid spoilers). The game is heavily filled with rendered cutscenes instead of comic style cutscene, which will make many Max Payne fans dissappointed. But let me tell you one good thing: these cutscenes are all well-made, I had a great time watching them and I didn't even bother to press "skip" at 2nd playthrough. Max continued to narrate in the game and with the I-don't-even-know-how-to-describe-them effects, the cutscenes in the game are very unique and cinematic.\nMax Payne is no longer obsessed with his wife and daughter's death, he still has his sarcastic humour and "One vice at a time", he is addicted to painkiller (which is not surprise), no more nightmares, no more depression. This is a new Max Payne with brighter tone and less dark atmosphere. Although I still miss the classic noir them, I have to admit that Rockstar Games did an amazing job in changing the original style of the franchise.\n\nIf you asked me what I liked most about Max Payne games, I would say BULLET TIME, YAY !!!!. But sad news guys, you can't dodge bullets by moving fast in slow motion anymore and you can only bring 2 guns at one time, but the good news is: now you can shoot GRENADES, yes I'm talking about flying GRENADES in the air that will blow your face anytime. Max is also able to make a last stand kill in case his health bar goes down to zero if he has a spare painkiller in his pocket. Anytime the cinematic killcam appears, you can see the bullet flying to enemy and blood spills out of his face. Shootdodge is still one of my favourite features in the game, Shooting 6 or 7 guys by 7 bullets while flying from the balcony to the ground like a real badass, hell, who doesn't want to do that ?\n\nIf you're a fan of the previous Max Payne games like me, you can find some easter eggs related to them, like Vincent Gogniti and Nicole Horne's graves in chapter 8: "Ain't No Reprievement Gonna Be Found Otherwise". You can also watch the Captain Baseball Bat on a TV when you're escorting Fabiana to the bus (it reminded me of Vincent, that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet because I bought Max Payne 3 in order to play as Max Payne, not some nameless dude running around with an AK-47 who have no idea how they have Max's ability to slow down time.\n\nAfter I had finished the game, I watched the credit in sadness because I realized that I won't have a chance to see Max anymore. Suddenly I remembered Max's line in MP2: "When you're looking down the barrel of a gun, time slows down. Your whole life flashes by, heartbreaks and scars. Stay with it, and you can live a lifetime in that split second". It has been 7 years since the first time I played Max Payne 1. After all, every adventure must have an end, right ?","November 29, 2013","true","47.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","6"

The game is perfect: in its captivating story, fluid and responsive game mechanics, picture-like graphics, focus on details, well-done PC optimization and of course the magnificent narration by the one and only James McCaffrey. Even though the game is no longer in the arms of Remedy, Rockstar did an amazing job. The transition between the surroundings: from noirish and snowy/rainy New York to sunny São Paulo is truly impressive. One thing that that's incomprehensible is the infamous double DRM (RGSC & Steam) ((not to mention GTA IV's TRIPLE DRM)), so sometimes one might experience connection problems. I, for one, didn't have problems with activation keys, luckily. I highly recommend you buying this game, for it's easily one of the best things on the gaming market.","February 17, 2014","true","63.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

In this game, there is little to nothing about it. The story instead focuses on the resurrection with Max Payne running away from his problems to San Paulo, where as always, trouble seems to find him at every corner. It is safe to say that the story is sub-par at best, but there is still enough there to make some sense and past a certain point in the game, you do stop caring about it all together. It's good that you do stop caring as slow-mo-ing your way around levels shooting people in the face is a significantly better reason to play the game and the story won't destract you from it.\n\nI clocked in more than 30+ hours with no Multiplayer (which by the way is filled with disapointments for me, but I suppose it is playable in the same way the first three Star Wars episodes are watchable) going around each of the levels again and again, diving and creating hell for anyone who stands in my way. The game might seem arcaic by todays standards, but there is simply nothing quite like it. The mechanics and controls of the game are tight enough to allow you to do pretty much anything within reason. I'd recommend the game on those basis alone.","December 29, 2013","true","39.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I can imagine Rockstar being tempted to modernize the game in order to broaden its appeal and attract new players but they kept the series' staple gameplay that's almost 15 years old - as of writing - and proved that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. As someone who had several playthroughs of the past two titles, I played Max Payne 3 without even feeling alienated and quickly became accustomed to how the game works; I was still running and gunning my way through waves of thugs as I did so before, feeling like a one-man killing machine out for justice. For those wondering if the difficulty has been toned down compared to the previous titles: it hasn't and you will die a lot in this game, even if you're a series veteran because the AI is programmed to be very aggressive and will always try to flank Max in every opportunity possible. Overall an excellent action game that will appeal to old fans and new players craving for a chaotic and hardcore experience.\n\nI couldn't hold the same regard for the story though. Even with its high production values, Rockstar's attention to detail, and amazing performances from the cast, the story couldn't win me over and I can't sway the thought that this game shouldn't have been made in the first place. The previous game already established that Max finally achieves peace and accepts that his wife and daughter are dead forever; he realizes that no amount of revenge could ease the pain and he vows to live with that until he dies. Fast forward 9 years later and Max is shown with his life down on the rocks and has an addiction to alcohol and painkillers. He develops a negative attitude to everything surrounding him and he denounces the American dream which he once had. I seriously couldn't get why the new writers presented Max that way since 9 years is more than enough to change a person's life. I felt that Dan Houser and the other writers were going for the Max Payne 2 route where the point of that game existing in the first place is to show that Max doesn't learn from his mistakes but it doesn't work if you do it a second time after your main character already sworn that he already got his redemption. The writers tried to make connections with the past titles, putting small references here and there to appease the old fans but I think it would've been better if they went the reboot/remake route and showed us what vision of Max they had in their head because they're just feeding off the scraps that Remedy sold them.\n\nThe story's not bad, mind you. Sure, there are glaring plot holes and it doesn't really explain well why certain events happened the way they happened but it's a passable story for the kind of ambitious game that they were making. It's just that for someone who replayed the Remedy-made games a lot of times, Max Payne 3 has been kind of a let down in the story department. It was a good attempt on Rockstar's part but old-timers may not have the same satisfying experience as they had in Noir York City.\n\n\n\n"I had a dream of my wife.\nShe was dead.\nBut it was all right."\n\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","May 14","true","56.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Well let's start with the obvious. The gameplay. Holy hell does this game have the tightest gameplay I have ever seen in a shooter. I don't know how to describe it other than just saying it is "perfect". Also there are quite a few things in this that make it stand out from other shooters, like how it doesn't have HP regen and you have to use pain pills to get health back. Also the weapon system allows you to carry 2 side-arms and a long gun. You can also dual-wield both your sidearms but it causes you to drop the long arm because where is he gonna put it? Dual-wielding is pretty simple, you can still aim with right click because the left click shoots both. But the big thing in the Max Payne series is the slow-mo and, much like it's predecessors, it is amazing. Jumping around a corner and headshotting 5 baddies in one quick blast of gunfire feels awesome.\n\nAlso the not only is the gameplay good but the story is pretty good too. The actual entire overarching story isn't the most interesting story ever but it is told through the eyes of Max Payne who narrates everything in his awesome gritty style. Another absolutely perfect aspect of this game is the music and sound. For one thing the guns sound right which is good but the music can be really amazing at parts. It just fits in with what is going on so damn well. Other parts has crappy dance club music but that is to be expected when having a shoot-out at a dance club that plays crappy dance club music so it technically fits I guess. Also the graphics look damn good but then again what game made this decade doesn't? All in all I would say that any of these aspects alone would make the game worth it but put it all together and you have something really special.\n\nI give this game 5 out of 5 pain-pill bottles. Seriously, buy this game ASAP.\n\n\n\nAlso there is an MP but I never tried it.","July 11, 2014","true","37.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's a really curious game. Almost like, I dunno, it's showing off how good R* are at world building first and then there's some Max Payne stuff chucked in there later around that.\n\nThe thing is, when it works, it's absolutely riveting and tremendous. Both the game and the story get off to a really slow and shaky start. You spend more time watching Max Payne 3 than you do playing it for way, way too long. Short firefights punctuated by lots of story punctuated by short firefights punctuated by lots of story. It can be really, really frustrating too. But at some point, it kinda settles into a happier (OK, happy is not a word I should really use when it comes to Max Payne) groove.\n\nThen there's the favela which is an incredibly showy-off walking simulator wedged in the middle of an AAA game about shooting people in the head in slow motion whilst muttering about your pills. It's a glimpse into a universe where AAA doesn't rely on shooting people in the face but it's also, again, a guided tour of R*'s DVD collection the way it's pieced together. And that's sort of OK, I guess because it wouldn't -be- R* without that.\n\nAnd after that, it starts letting you play the game proper. The balance between cut scene and videogame sorts itself out and the little frustrating bits of shooting it let you do before finally transition into longer firefights where it feels absolutely properly tense and urgent.\n\nThere's a few missed beats in the story. Sometimes things are a bit too grim and dark and slip into violence for violence's sake to shock you through the face and show you how nasty the people you're up against are but y'know, videogames and the tone is all over the shop. Like someone truly believes it's a sort of Tarantino does film noir but no-one told them that most of the time, Tarantino isn't realllly something to aspire to unless you've got a thing for feet and celebrity.\n\nBut then it all comes together in the airport and I'm on the edge of my seat, running through this level, glass shattering everywhere, bullets flying left and right and the game gets the bullet ballet bang on. There's a ACTION BLOCKBUSTER ending to it too and then you're left with that sort of wow, that was actually fantastic sensation for a while until it sinks in that for about 7 hours of the game, you were mainly watching a guided tour of someone's DVD collection and... why couldn't I play more? Why couldn't I step a bit to the left without the game killing me off? But OK, those shader effects are incredible so maybe I can forgive it?\n\nWeird game. I'd absolutely recommend playing it through because if nothing else, only Left4Dead has more muttering about pills in it.","August 12, 2014","true","11.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Everything about it just feels off, from the combat to the story.  Rockstar chose to drop the old comic book and noir story telling in favour of a more cinematic approach, and in doing so took away much of the charm that made Max Payne what it was.  On the topic of combat, the game tries to automate many features (like painkillers and save points) rather than letting that player regulate these things by themselves (yes there is a mode which does not auto-utilise painkillers, but it should not require that the combat be at an incredibly difficult level as well).  Furthermore, the level design emphasises a basic cover-bases system (insert generic 3rd person shooter here) rather than fully utilising the bullet-time elements the series has become famous for.  Overall, as a fan of the series, I was quite disappointed with this entry but have hopes that a good developer like Rockstar can raise the bar for the next instalment.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I did experience a number of technical bugs in my play through with an Nvidia 500 series card.","December 1, 2013","false","15.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Now, there are a number of major differences. This is a modern shooter and so a large change is made- the addition of a cover system. You end up using a mix of cover and bullet time to defeat a large number of enemies, and I felt that enemy damage was cranked up a lot to compensate for the addition of cover. That said there is just not as much gameplay in this as there was in the first two, as instead of the in-game narration style of the first, MP3 is broken up frequently by long cutscenes, to which you are fed story. The story itself is standard revenge fare and most times it feels like it's being fed to you rather than you guiding it along in any meaningful way, though this is a corridor shooter at best. I felt that the characterization of Max was spot on and the tone of the dialogue was true, though not sure if I felt that the character fit the South American-styled story, and the justification for Max's inclusion in it was shaky at best. That said a thoroughly enjoyable, though short game, with less actual gameplay than even Max Payne 2's short running length.","January 12, 2013","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Leaving New York, Max moves to Sao Paolo to start a new life, but he quickly gets into a huge trouble and needs to do things in the Max way.\n\nThe story and the narration (specially the voiceover) are exceptional and really fun to listen. The script is clever and Max has some really good lines. It’s almost like reading a very good book, except the shooting of many-many bad guys. This might be a problem for some FPS lovers who do not like the frequent interruption of long narrations between action sequences, but for me it worked great.\n\nBeside that the action itself is greatly polished and smooth. Bullet time works just as in Max Payne 1 and it is very fun to use, and necessary to use to remain alive. There are many type of weapons, guns which most of them you can dual-wield and there is also a neat cover system to enhance the action. Grenades can be only used in Multiplayer, and there are NO additional tools or gear you could use (like bulletproof vest or knifes for melee).\n\nThe game is beautiful and highly detailed with care which is Rockstar’s strength. The map design is amazing with the detailed interiors, makes the world really alive and immersive.\n\nThere is also multiplayer with deathmatch and some survivor co-op missions (which are fun) but we all know that this game is played for the single player experience. And in that part, this game did incredibly well.  More co-op missions with story elements could be good though.\n\nThis game is a true gem in the TPS library of games and an exceptional story which everyone needs to see and play. I have replayed it for the 2nd time just to be part of the story again. May Payne is the man.\n\n9/10 Excellent\n","September 14, 2014","true","22.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It’s still a short, linear, straight action-packed third-person shooter. Each of the 14 chapters begin with a cool cinematic, after which you start at point A, clear rooms after rooms of enemies, essentially just shooting your way to point B, enjoy another cutscene, repeat. But with that said, was it fun? Well, that depends.\n\nStory-wise, I can't say the plot is too elaborate. It has a very predictable twist and the ending is somewhat disappointing. However, the originality of the story lies in the presentation. The cutscenes are fun to watch, the voice acting is top notch, and the writing is clever. For fans of hard-boiled and noir detective fiction, the way the protagonist narrates the story is a real treat. It may come across as cheesy sometimes, but I just loved every line of it and felt it did a perfect job giving you a glimpse into the psyche of Max. Fans of the series will feel right at home with the narrative. It also helps that the amazing graphics and sound go a long way toward giving the game a realistic feel.\n\nMy first complete playthrough took me approximately 8-10 hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it, but whether or not it's fun enough to justify a buy will be based on your tolerance for linear and somewhat simple gameplay. The shooting and slow motion mechanics can be very fun once you get them down but don't expect the game to reward you with ability or weapon unlocks that can open up new strategies--combat stays the same from beginning to end. Seeing as the game is relatively short however, it shouldn't get repetitive enough to make the first playthrough feel like a grind. The story is engaging and does a good job adding more layers to Max's persona, whom despite his flaws, is truly a great protagonist and a hero that you love to cheer for.","August 25, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Rockstar's best wok in my opinion. It captures a realistic essence of a hero with everything going bad to worse, not everything good to better like in most games today, and that's a refreshing take on a story to me. The gunplay, cinematics, and visuals are top of the line in almost every way. The only aspect of this masterpiece I am disappointed in is the Online Multiplayer. Hardly anyone plays it anymore even though it's an interesting form of online gameplay. So if you do decide to make a great purchase and get this game, get it for its driving and hard-hitting story, chiseled shooting mechanics, and pristine graphics (on the correct computer haha), then purchase Max Payne 3 and get hooked on some painkillers! :D","November 10, 2014","true","38.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only disappointment is the coloring and texture design. From a Mexican adventure you'd expect some beautiful scenery and lovely colors, but this is a Rockstar game, so shades of gloomy grey and boring brown is typical (see: GTA IV). Another issue I have with this is the ugly filters and random effects that are thrown on sporadically. Then in cutscenes every other word spoken pops up in big stupid lettering to emphasize "dae pls vocab story yeh".\n\nThe story was entertaining for the most part, but closer to the end it felt kind of drawn out and barely engaging. This isn't why you'd play a Max Payne game though. You come for the shooting and slo-mo bullet time and the gore!\n\nWhich is the game's strongest... strength... (huhu). Shooting is so fun in this game. Bullets have a kind of oomph they don't typically have in games and it is SO SATISFYING killing people.\n\nFinished in 10 hours on medium, the length is a little off-putting, though it's better to have a game short and enjoyable than long and drawn out.\n\n$5 is an acceptable price.\n\n8/10 would booze again","September 12, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The tough difficulty is back with more bite, as Max will die from headshots in single-player instantly and enemies are more plentiful and aggressive, making the new cover system a need when you're out of bullettime. The aiming in the game is tight, meaning you will score headshots in bullettime if you've aimed well and fired single shots at a time, something that was absent from the first two games with most weapons, and there may be some difficulty keeping track of the small dot reticule because of this change. There are proper physics in MP3 and the impact of bullets can be felt well, either stumbling an enemy or the player, dependent on the bullet caliber & muzzle energy. Multiplayer is finally in the series and is frustrating from all the seasoned players at first, but rewarding when you get a good feel for the game and have unlocked a few items, given how tight the controls/aiming is. I'd recommend beating the single-player at least once before heading online, though there doesn't seem to be many players around these days.\nThe game is definitely weak story-wise, and MP3 moves away from the alleyways, warehouses, and abandoned buildings of New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro. MP3 also ditches a lot of the campiness in the first 2 games for more cool & gritty. There are also some glitches but they're avoidable for the most part and aren't too common in my experience. The levels were done with a good amount of detail in mind, even if it's just a flashy nightclub you blaze through in a few minutes, some cramped favelas, or a large party yacht, and are all rendered beautifully, somewhat justifying the 32 gigs of so of HDD space this game takes up. HEALTH, the noise band, did a great job on the score as well, and provides a somber mood but with electronic intensity.\nOverall, it's a polished and tight third person shooter for those twitchy, arcadey gamers that just want to feel like a single-man army in a modern action movie, dodging bullets and shooting akimbo while diving through the air, with a hefty amount of challenge to make it feel like more of an accomplishment to beat","December 22, 2013","true","38.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's usually on sale, but well worth the asking price.\n\nIf you are a fan of Se7en, Dirty Harry, Sunset Boulevard, Pulp Fiction, The Big Sleep, Blade Runner, Drive, Taxi Driver, or Miami Vice, then this game will be right up your alley.\n\nMax Payne 3 is the gritty, dark, and depressing tale of a former NYPD cop named Max Payne, who is battling his demons: alcoholism, his mental stability, and the murder of his family. He now resides in Brasil working as a security officer for the wealthy Brancos, a family with some secrets they want to kick under the rug.\n\nThe plot very much plays out like a well-made film and serves as a big nod to its inspirations. The story has so many ups and downs-- it's a wild ride! Max's narration is as well-done as it is cynical and unreliable, which is typical to film noir. Cutscenes are very cinematic, with multiple angles, important words popping up on the screen, and some sweet post-processing effects.\n\nGraphics are awesome. The levels are incredibly detailed, lighting effects are magnificent, etc. For a four year old game, it certainly doesn't look the part, and puts my $3k rig to shame.\n\nSound design is very well done, from the soundtrack to the effects.\n\nHaven't touched multiplayer but there's not a lot of people on it anymore sadly.\n\nWell worth the $20 but definitely worth the sale price!\n\n9/10","April 28","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I can't imagine a better swan song to a studio so great.\nEven if you've never gotten into the series before,  please get this game. You will not be dissapointed.\nCan't really speak to the quality of the multiplayer because it seems to be all but dead at this point. (You can still find a match at certain times of the day) Though I do remember it being fairly enjoyable when I played back when the game innitially released.\n20$ for the campaign alone is a very fair price.\n\nGotta give it a 10/10","April 30","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

By the end of the story mode, Max will have a kill count in the high hundreds – yet it still never feels like it gets old blowing a gaping hole in someone’s skull.\n\nThe enemies aren’t pushovers, either – they’ll (mostly) intelligently make use of cover, flanking attacks, and covering fire to try to defeat you. Some of the more difficult ones also pack grenades, keeping you from turtling in a corner.\n\nThe game is difficult, yet fair – difficult in that even on normal mode (which is what I played through the story on) you can expect to run into fights that will kill you – and will manage to kill you again even when you know (more or less – there’s enough noise in the AI routines that enemies won’t always move the same way between attempts) what’s going to happen. Thankfully, the game will take pity on you – the first couple times you die, you’re transported back to the last checkpoint (the game’s pretty good about saving pretty often) fully healed. If you manage to die some more, it’ll start you off with some painkillers (the game’s medkit-equivalent) as well.\n\nThe story’s not too much to talk about – it’s Max Payne being all Max-Payne-y, will all the noir ham-handedness that implies. It’s basically just a vehicle to get Max in front of small armies of mooks in various locales.\n\nLess of a negative, and more of a rant – Max; I know you’re apparently all about the form-over-function, but neither a suit and tie nor a loud Hawaiian t-shirt are rated to protect you from bullets. Many of the thugs you’re going up against know that, and they wear _bulletproof vests_. Feel free to take one from somebody that you headshotted. Especially after you basically declare war singlehandedly against South America, it’s just downright stupid that you’re not protecting your vitals with anything heavier than a good starch.\n\nAnyway, great game that I finally got around to playing (I bought it during the X-mas sale of 2013!) It runs beautifully on high settings, even though my computer has been in dire need of an upgrade for a while now.","May 26","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I used to play the previous two Max Payne games back in my original Xbox and the third game is hard to describe. The genre of the game is a hybrid of crime thriller with a sheer blend of intense firefights, containing the cinematography of Tony Scott's 2004 film, Man on Fire. Strangely enough, Max Payne is more cynical about himself and his surroundings. If you know what happened in the first two games, then you should know why he acted in such attitude. The story in the game is rather...complex up to the point that it is confusing on what's happening and who's who. The narration mixes up to Max's current situation in Brazil and his past in New Jersey and Panama Canal. Unfortunately, the story progression tends to go back and forth of Max's past and present, ruining the mood on certain points of the story. Without a doubt, the gameplay is highly impressive with excellent body movement and human flexibility for Max to fire his weapon at any position. However, the game does feel a bit repetitive and can be difficult for some gamers to not play the entire game in one sitting. Overall, the game is recommended to those who like slow motion, action movies particularly John Woo's Heroic Bloodshed films, and gun play. However, the game may not be for some gamers who are more story centric (even though there were some surprising moments in the story). The story's good and may feel a bit "uncomfortable" in certain parts of the story. It has my recommendation.","March 12, 2014","true","22.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Also once I ragequit during a QTE combat sequence that seemed way harder than any of the shooting parts.\n\nEvery scene in the movie has near-constant voice-over by the actor playing Max Payne and always ends with Max Payne letting himself get surrounded by guys shooting at him, and he always switches to the pistol -- even if it is out of ammo. You will probably run out of ammo repeatedly. Max Payne 3 does the Uncharted thing where almost every bad guy has a different weapon, but somehow has only 5-10 bullets left when you kill him, and that's the only source of ammunition. I don't know about you, but I get tired of having to having to discard my gun and go pick up another during a shootout.\n\nI did like Max Payne 3 enough to finish, but there are so many great shooters on PC (for instance Wolfenstein: The New Order, not to mention the first two Max Payne games) that I can only give a slight recommendation.\n\nEdited: changed to recommend, because the game is still pretty badass, even though there's not much gameplay in the single-player campaign.","April 28","true","12.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In fact, the non-chronological storyline is the only nonlinear aspect about this game. While this streamlined approach deprives the player the freedom of gameplay choices in Rockstar's more renowned open world titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, it gives the game a much more tightly crafted narrative and greater level of direction in its scripted set pieces. Shootouts play out in an extremely fluid fashion, the camera framing action sequences with great care and the "bullet-time" mechanism slowing down time to capture the journey of a bullet fired from Payne's gun all the way to its intended target, whose blood splatter and falling corpse have an almost majestic quality.\n\nThe linear gameplay does get repetitive even for fans of shooters, but the trade-off is the high level of control the developers had in crafting every minute detail. The locales are so intricately rendered that they almost feel like on-location movie shoots; from poverty-stricken Brazilian favelas & dilapidated buildings to glitzy dance clubs & high-end party yachts, each location has a sensory quality so strong that you can practically smell the air. Max Payne himself is also a fantastic environmental fixture, his appearance changing as dramatically as the scenery. In stark contrast to the typical musclebound videogame protagonist who overcomes obstacles and inexorably saves the day, Max is a tragic figure who fails almost every task put before him. I have not played the previous games in the series, but with Max Payne 3 being set after the death of his wife & child and retirement from the police force, the pathos of his character arc strongly echoes in his voice-over narratives (usually during hyper-stylized & visually striking comic book-esque cutscenes). The voice actor does an outstanding job of capturing just how burned out and broken this man is, making for an all-around compelling character.\n\nIt's difficult to universally recommend this game to those new to the series because of how hit or miss it is; your enjoyment of it is almost entirely contingent on how compelling you find the narrative and player character. While some may find it tedious, I'd recommend picking it up now that it can be had for around $5 or less on sale. It's a very satisfying third person shooter that weaves an interesting tale of conspiracy set amidst the various social classes of Sao Paulo, Brazil and told through the eyes of an anti-hero unlike any other in videogaming. His voice-overs alone are enough to keep many players grinding through a lot of similar, long-winded shootouts.","April 6","true","20.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After completing the campaign I have to admit that it isn't bad at all. The presentation is great, Max's voice actor delivers and the whole atmosphere, though not New York, comes together. The graphics are great, the physics are nice and I didn't have any problem with the music or sounds. BUT and it is a big but: there are couple of things which simply killed the game for me. First. if either MSAA or FXAA is enabled, it screws up mouse movement BIG time. Seems like Rockstar still can't properly develop for the PC. Second: the enemies are so bullet-spongie that you can only advance with headshots which is not what I've wanted and also makes certain situations a nightmare. Third: usually I don't have a problem if games take over my character to advance to the next area/level but here it's just ridiculous. Also it constantly switches back to the default weapon which sometimes can screw you over. Fourth: weird gameplay issues like iniating a reload, enter bullet time then exiting the cover simply cancels the reload... WHAT?? Also other weird movement issues... So yeah, great ideas ruined by technical and gameplay problems. As for the multiplayer side of things: it would be a nice touch, however it's still full of cheaters... worthless. To be honest I partially regret my purchase since I didn't wait till the price was low enough. I wanted to write that ' I would only recommend this game if you want a nice singleplayer experience for couple of hours and you can get the game for 5€ or less', however after thinking it through: NO, don't get this game, watch the story on YouTube and get another one instead.","August 15, 2013","false","8.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

MP3 could probably be one of the true single-player games that deserve a place in the books of gaming history. Well-paced story, brilliant gameplay, and a satisfying end to the franchise.\nAlthough, it was a beautiful game, it had its downsides. Surely, I can't say it's better than Max Payne 2, because sadly, it's not. The characters weren't fully fleshed out, the multiplayer was a huge letdown, and it wasn't too engaging. But, considering it's Rockstar, I have total faith that if they made another game in the series (Most probably, no), they wouldn't overlook the cons of MP3.","January 21, 2015","true","41.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

They were fun, sure, but no super-rosy spectacles over my eyes for them. So I went in to Max Payne 3 with a pretty open mind. I expected some wisecracks, monologue, nice graphics and a bunch of cool shooting action.\n\nWell, the wisecracks and monologue is there. The graphics are also pretty decent at max settings. The shooting is pretty cool too, when you get over the hostile approach to PC controls the game employs, like mouse-accelleration.\n\nHowever, the first thing the game does is show me a cutscene running at a terrible resolution, because I hadn't been allowed to set options yet. Then, I have to create a "Rockstar Social Club" profile. Which I didn't really want, but apparently this is Rockstar's substitute for GFWL. It took some annoyance and the game being unable to give a report if you accidentally  type a wrong password, instead it just hangs at the loginscreen. This is amateurish.\n\nFinally, I got to play the game. Or that is, after a 15 minute long cutscene, I got to move Max around a little and shoot a couple of guys. Then another cutscene. This then describes perfectly the game from then on forward. Move around and shoot for 1,5 minutes, then just after you've found a rhythm and started to become comfortable with the controls, a cutscene interrupts the gameplay for some minutes. Most the game is just shooting 5 guys to see another cutscene, from the experience I managed to gain playing it. Which quickly became sort of annoying.\n\nAnd it might be the only experience I got to have, because when I wanted to play the second time, the Rockstar Social Club once again rears its head, with the game demanding that I activate it before I can play it, even though I already had. Again, it hangs trying to log in to the Rockstar Social Club. OK. I manage to make a password reset on the account, and this time, after some waiting, it logs in. However, instead of loading the game like you'd expect, the game just hangs on a "MAX PAYNE 3" logo that says "loading" in the bottom right corner. Nothing happens, the process doesn't seem to do anything and after waiting for 3 minutes, the game is on a SSD, I became tired of waiting and shut it down. Maybe I'll give it another go. But it really wasn't good enough that I want to even spend the time waiting for a rescan of the local files.","March 16, 2014","false","10.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","6"

The gameplay feels authentic to the original while delivering something entirely fresh to the current standard third person shooter formula; Bullet Time. The player can slow down time to land more precise shots, or dive through the air in an iconic actionmovie-esque way while you can feel the bullets missing you by just a hair...\n· Incredibly Detail: ... and every single one of those bullets is individually rendered into the game. The AI will react to where you shoot them, Max Payne himself can 360° around himself even while laying down on the ground and the game cuts from cutscene to gameplay flawlessly. Overall Max Payne 3 has an uncanny amount of detail to it, from the textures to the precision and the the movement among many others.\n· A Surprisingly Large Amount Of Replayability: after the lengthy story is completed and all of the campaign collectibles are collected you can get into the multiplayer or the New York Minute mode that gives you a minute to complete a level and rewards you with bonus time for every enemy you kill... without any chechpoints along the way.\n· Superb Voice Acting: Max's original voice actor is back and every other personage in the game is beautifully voiced.

Max however finds himself yet again in the middle of a bloody affair where he can only trust his Beretta 92FS... Oh wait apparently its a M1911 now, and his addiction to painkillers.\n\nThis game is one of the better third person shooters in a long time, the gunplay is precise, the guns sound and feel like they have weight and power, and with the Euphoria Engine the impact of every bullet is mirrored in the brazilians you shoot.\n\nThe one complaint I have is that you can't skip all cutscenes and sometimes they do mess up the phasing of the game, however, the cutscenes and dialouge is once again masterfully done with James McCafferey voicing an older more disgruntled Max.\n\nThe music is also absolutley fantastic and Health deliver perfect tunes for gunning down hordes of guidos and brazilians. And when the action gets lower and the noir kicks in, Rockstar still kept that iconic piano tune from the previous games to set up dark and depressing scenarios.\n\nTo end this review I strongly recommend the game for new players wanting to try a solid fun shooter, and also for all of the veterans wanting another brilliant entry in Max's story.","March 16, 2014","true","3.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The gameplay feels authentic to the original while delivering something entirely fresh to the current standard third person shooter formula; Bullet Time. The player can slow down time to land more precise shots, or dive through the air in an iconic actionmovie-esque way while you can feel the bullets missing you by just a hair...\n· Incredibly Detail: ... and every single one of those bullets is individually rendered into the game. The AI will react to where you shoot them, Max Payne himself can 360° around himself even while laying down on the ground and the game cuts from cutscene to gameplay flawlessly. Overall Max Payne 3 has an uncanny amount of detail to it, from the textures to the precision and the the movement among many others.\n· A Surprisingly Large Amount Of Replayability: after the lengthy story is completed and all of the campaign collectibles are collected you can get into the multiplayer or the New York Minute mode that gives you a minute to complete a level and rewards you with bonus time for every enemy you kill... without any chechpoints along the way.\n· Superb Voice Acting: Max's original voice actor is back and every other personage in the game is beautifully voiced. Their tones and accents fit the situations and the character's movements, making for incredible voice acting that I've rarely seen done this good before.\n\nThe Bad:\n· The Story Doesn't Live Up To The Previous Games: previous games had plenty of memorable characters (Mona Sex and Vinni Gognitti among others) but the characters in Max Payne 3 feel flat and uninterresting.

I'd give them back when R* eventually fixes this misunderstanding (If you want to replay the game for another couple of times it becomes unbearably annoying). Other than that the game absolutely rocks.\n\nThey managed to reincarnate the good old Max Payne (I don't mean the second game which I actually can't stand) into another masterpiece without destroying the badass atmosphere.\n\nIt's kinda sad though I can't play the whole game without being hit at all (scripted wounds don't count:) as me and a friend of mine used to pull off in the original Max Payne.\n\n\nThis is how I reviewed the game at first when I was dead drunk:\n\n"CUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\nBIGBUTTS\nCUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\nBULLETTIME\nCUTSCENES\n\nI'm drunk as hell and Max would highly appreciate it."\n\n\nP.S.\nCARAL4O has become my favorite swear word.","July 11, 2015","true","187.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","6","9","4","0"

If you enjoy actually playing the game and getting into it quick well screw you most of the entire first part of the game is cutscenes(this is not hyperbole in any way shape or form). My favorite cutscene was the one at the start of the game, and by that I mean the one before the start of the game where it forced me to watch Max be depressed for five minutes.\n\nBut that wasn't the bad part, no no no, the bad part was that I had the audacity to alt tab during that first cutscene to shut off my music(I was expecting the game to start approximately 30 minutes faster than it actually did) and the game went into a crappy windowed mode that cut off part of the screen. Keep in mind that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unskippable cutscene was before I had acess to an options menu or anything.\n\nTHEN I get into the game and find out its a cover based shooter, so I think to myself "Yeah I can work with this" and then I discover the bug where Max will jam his arm into the wall and shoots uselessly into the air. He doesn't even have the decency to shoot into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall. So I'm like whatever I can deal with half an hour of cutscenes where Max is all depressed at me, I can deal with bugs that make the cover based shooting useless in a cover based shooter.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back though was the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon switch system. Now you see the weapon switch system is really important in a shooting game, and its something games as far back as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DOOM GOT RIGHT. But not here NO NO NO, you don't actually get to see which weapons you're going to switch to you just switch to them. You're probably all like "Well so what that seems like a fairly petty complaint" Well you see Max never learned what a shoulder strap was so you can't dual wield pistols AND carry a primary weapon at the same time. So if you press the "dual wield button" by mistake in a hectic action scene meaning to switch to your shotgun you could just accidentally drop your shotgun automatically and instantly.\n\nBest part about it the gun switch UI can't be held down and dissapears in a fraction of a second. So I can't even take inventory of my weapons. Other games like Half Life had a little GUI at the top/bottom of the screen that showed you the weapon options for that slot. Other games like Doom/Half Life/Quake/EVEN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REDNECK RAMPAGE had a better weapon switching mechanic than this and for a game of this production value, a game of which THIS much money and time was dumped into thats pathetic.\n\nThe game also does a very poor job of telling you when you are injured. There is no part of the UI so far as I can tell that tells you when you when you can go into the slo mo mode.\n\nI keep seeing the character drinking and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't have the decency to offer me one to dull the headache from these intentionally headache inducing cutscenes, these bugs, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI choices.\n\nI would talk more about this game, but honeslty I just can't stand to even play it. I feel like I'm missing something if I skip the cutscenes, but the cutscenes literally give me headaches. I try to deal with the game's cover mechanics but I can't they are simply too frustrating for me to give a damn. And then when the game has the audacity to kill me when it aimed my gun direclty upwards to fire at clouds like it was animated in Garry's mod I just stop giving a ♥♥♥♥.","April 2","false","1.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The non-stop cut scenes and irregular pacing ruin the fun all the time. You want to move down a corridor and get ready to dive in and bullet time? No, sorry cut scene tedium then some action when you're deliberately set up in a very bad position.. Also the script makes no sense , for example .when one hostage is inside a room bullet time is not allowed and instead contrived cut scene and  they get shot instead. You have already blitzed worse, killed hundreds of commandos, yet this room somehow disables it all for a very contrived plot point.\nMy major complaint is the removal of player agency. Sorry had enough of being contrived into a bad position for a gun fight. If I wanted a rail shooter I'd go play something good like Time Crises.\nOne for the Steam sale if you must buy. Also you have a useless partner who does sweet FA in fights. Being forced into a cut scene then into a fight reducing your options? no thanks I like as a player being able to move cover to cover etc. and set up rather than be stuck into fight after fight in narrow short sections then yet into another cut scene.\nHaving played the other two in the series  I can only but disapprove of this one, although this one has superior production values the annoying cut scenes detract greatly from the fun.

The original Max Payne had a motive that could connect you and would make you want to advance. This just didn't have it. Add to that the fact that the game is very short and predictable. It's only 14 chapters, which I flew by in a day and a half. Then top that with the fact that there is no true thinking involved in the game. It's just go to the next room and shoot.

The graphic novel feel is still there, and Bullet Time is better than ever.\n\nThe game has high replay value, since play styles are so different on every difficulty level and it has an Arcade mode, which again lets you play the game with new play styles and compete against other people for highscores.\n\nAnd if you ever get tired of singleplayer, which is unlikely, you can switch to multiplayer, which again offers endless hours of gameplay, character and loadout customization and unique elements (like Bullet Time).\n\n\n","January 2, 2013","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The central character is well developed.\nBullet time is still fun, even though its showing its age as a 'Matrix' gimmick.\n\nCons:\nFalls prey to the 'Press X to block, Press Y to disarm' sections - an uncreative and uninteresting solution to a game problem.\nToward the latter part of the story suffers from frustrating repetitive bottleneck sections.\nLack of player agency; you are essentially an automaton pressing buttons to advance the story.\n\nI bought this in the steam sale, I've completed the single player but I have no intention of giving it a second play-through or playing multiplayer. If you intend on doing the same then consider it a few days of entertainment at a fraction of the price of a cinema ticket. Overall I'd say the experience was worth it to those interested in how the central character has developed in the third instalment of the franchise.

Max Payne 3 successfully manages to modernise the gameplay and the character himself.\n\nThis is one of the few game series with a large focus on story but set in the time of their release.

I think they should have done it like this, if you get knocked into last stand mode, you use a pill, kill a guy, and you get half health, if you use a pill normally you get full health or 3/4's of your health back, making it to where it still feels like max payne and not stupid CoD.\n\nBarely used Bullet Dodge: While I was playing I actually hardly used my bullet dodge, cause Max takes for f*%king ever to get back up and I ended up dieing from that, or dieing while in mid air dodging, so I figured "Why use bullet dodge if I can just sit behind cover and blind fire them, they end up dieing anyway..." I ended up clearing out most rooms just sitting against a wall and waiting for them to come over, that's not the Max Payne I know, the Max Payne I know was the one that could dodge and clear out a whole room in a few dodges or so, not sit in the corner and wait for everyone to come over.  Granted, he is getting older, but if I threw a 60 year old guy with some muscle in a room I doubt he'd take 5 seconds to get off the damn floor if he was getting shot at.\n\nNot a huge arsenal of guns: Sadly, you can only carry 3 weapons, god dammit people, Realism gets pretty bloody annoying after a while, You can only hold 2 hand guns or uzis, and 1 two hander, that's it, instead of you know, the huge arsenal you got in the older games, where you would switch around to different guns and constantly find ammo for them, now it's just you pick up a few guns in the level, and every enemy would be using the same thing, so you never really had to worry about running out of ammo for certain guns.\n\nDie a lot easier: You know how in the other games the enemies couldn't shoot for s%#t and you were usually dodging most of their bullets? Well that's the total opposite in this game, now you die a lot easier and every enemy will actually end up hitting you fairly easily, granted some can't shoot for s%$t still so you don't have to really worry most of the time.\n\nOn rail shooting: Some ocassions you'll have some on rail shooting sections, like Max will lift himself up on a chain and go in slow mo, and you have to shoot everyone, or ride on a little push cart and shoot everyone across, granted, these are pretty fun, but honestly they are really easy, the enemies don't really shoot you or don't aim at you correctly, it's like they are pointing their own gun at themselves, and plus it takes like 1 shot to kill them all in this mode no matter where you aim, so it makes it really easy.\n\nWHAT I THINK: The game is pretty fun, and I still feel like it's Max Payne, but the problem is, is that the've change so many things around and made things easy and hard in some of the weirdest places in the game, and the difficulty fluctuates like crazy, and when I figured out that hiding behind cover and waiting for them to come to me is easier than finding them, it just becomes a waiting game, and the fact that using pills in last stand is more useful than using them normally means I could just go in rambo style and shoot everyone when I have a lot of pills, get knocked down, kill a guy, get up and shoot them and clear out the room that way.  It gets a 7/10, it's fun yes, but there are just some weird decisions that don't make much sense to me.","August 3, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

New York Minute mode). also when Max recovers from a second wind, he will fully stand up instead of going to cover which meant more unnecessary damage, pill usage and facepalming.\n\nall in all a worthy title to play and definitely worth it if you can find it for $15 or less.","January 18, 2013","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think they should have done it like this, if you get knocked into last stand mode, you use a pill, kill a guy, and you get half health, if you use a pill normally you get full health or 3/4's of your health back, making it to where it still feels like max payne and not stupid CoD.\n\nBarely used Bullet Dodge: While I was playing I actually hardly used my bullet dodge, cause Max takes for f*%king ever to get back up and I ended up dieing from that, or dieing while in mid air dodging, so I figured "Why use bullet dodge if I can just sit behind cover and blind fire them, they end up dieing anyway..." I ended up clearing out most rooms just sitting against a wall and waiting for them to come over, that's not the Max Payne I know, the Max Payne I know was the one that could dodge and clear out a whole room in a few dodges or so, not sit in the corner and wait for everyone to come over.  Granted, he is getting older, but if I threw a 60 year old guy with some muscle in a room I doubt he'd take 5 seconds to get off the damn floor if he was getting shot at.\n\nNot a huge arsenal of guns: Sadly, you can only carry 3 weapons, god dammit people, Realism gets pretty bloody annoying after a while, You can only hold 2 hand guns or uzis, and 1 two hander, that's it, instead of you know, the huge arsenal you got in the older games, where you would switch around to different guns and constantly find ammo for them, now it's just you pick up a few guns in the level, and every enemy would be using the same thing, so you never really had to worry about running out of ammo for certain guns.\n\nDie a lot easier: You know how in the other games the enemies couldn't shoot for s%#t and you were usually dodging most of their bullets? Well that's the total opposite in this game, now you die a lot easier and every enemy will actually end up hitting you fairly easily, granted some can't shoot for s%$t still so you don't have to really worry most of the time.\n\nOn rail shooting: Some ocassions you'll have some on rail shooting sections, like Max will lift himself up on a chain and go in slow mo, and you have to shoot everyone, or ride on a little push cart and shoot everyone across, granted, these are pretty fun, but honestly they are really easy, the enemies don't really shoot you or don't aim at you correctly, it's like they are pointing their own gun at themselves, and plus it takes like 1 shot to kill them all in this mode no matter where you aim, so it makes it really easy.\n\nWHAT I THINK: The game is pretty fun, and I still feel like it's Max Payne, but the problem is, is that the've change so many things around and made things easy and hard in some of the weirdest places in the game, and the difficulty fluctuates like crazy, and when I figured out that hiding behind cover and waiting for them to come to me is easier than finding them, it just becomes a waiting game, and the fact that using pills in last stand is more useful than using them normally means I could just go in rambo style and shoot everyone when I have a lot of pills, get knocked down, kill a guy, get up and shoot them and clear out the room that way.  It gets a 7/10, it's fun yes, but there are just some weird decisions that don't make much sense to me.","August 3, 2014","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiKiGoDeReY/recommended/204100/","TiKiGoDeReY","R3x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiKiGoDeReY/","107 products in account","Max Payne, he was a drunken son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ who got dealt a terrible ♥♥♥♥ing hand. The destructive emotion of entropy had not one drop of sympathy for Max Payne. Since the first one to this most recent third game of the series. Max, I would like to think of as a good friend by now (considering what we've gone through), was a man filled with so many conflicting qualities that whether it was in the heat of a slow-motion shootout against paramilitary drug cartels, or, the dreadful conversations with stoned secondary plot characters. I found myself tired of it all.\n\nAs if, I ask, what was it all really for? I mean, who cares if this rich family has their own story of murder, corruption, deception and the likes. I would of walked away as soon as I would of been given the cue. Yet, alas, my conscious kicked in. “It was my fault. I should redeem myself.” This is the defining reasoning for Payne's actions for a huge majority of the game. That is until the story takes a few twists and turns that end up creating more questions than answers. This left many questions unanswered, and a sense of disappointment at the end. The story is 50/50. At times it is genuinely interesting, other times it is ridiculous and mundane. What really saves this game's story is Max Payne's inner dialogue. [6/10]\n\nThe graphics are most definitely stunning (check out my images, I have many pictures from the game I played through). If you happen not to clip through many of the hard edges of seemingly soft structures, you will definitely enjoy some spectacular moments of Max PayneTM. An array of various environments, such as Brazilian slums, stadiums, roof-decks, to airports, classic streets of New Jersey, and even deep into the rainforest. In many ways the ambiance and environment help in engrossing you into the game. In particular, I enjoy the pre- & post- 'conflict pictures of various environments. Seeing all paper, sparks, bottles, glass, explosions and the rest of the enjoyable destructible environment is an always enjoyable experience. [8.5/10]\n\nThere is definitely enjoyment in the game-play, I would just say that it doesn't last long. It is essentially superficial, point and click with timed jumps. To be fair, the whole series is as such, although in this one, they included this cover system which isn't as smooth as they clearly wanted it to be. Especially if you run out of bullet-time (which will happen if your playing on hard.) Sometimes I felt like I was grinding through this game. Just to get it done. I would remember the exact spots the officers appeared, and death after death, i would go through the best motion to kill as many as possible with my bullet time, before having to take cover, and frantically move the camera around to find the remaining soldiers. I died so much that sometimes I completely forgot why I was in that situation, and where and what I was doing. You can see that I have 11.5 hours, not much. To be honest, I can't force myself to play a game. That is a genuine sign of a problem in the game-play mechanics and their fluidity. [6/10]\n\nAll in all, this game is worth it, especially if your a Max Payne fan. It's not worth a full price game but it is worth it a discounted price. It has it's appeals of explosions and the classic mutterings of Max Payne. What I enjoyed about the previous games is that I truly did sympathize with Max Payne. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and what they did to him and his family, was disgusting, and I was going to pick up every gun available to help bring vengeance into Max's hands. Until we both felt the accumulative wrath of our own actions, retribution shot back at us, through more torment and pain. Until Max stopped, nothing else would...In this game, it wasn't as personal. It wasn't as believable to go out and do all this for some schmucks, who were entwined in their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'd give this game a [7.5/10]. Its a worthwhile play through, although I wouldn't say it holds that much more appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of those great moments of Max that I was talking about:\n\nI was a dumb American in a place where dumb Americans are less popular than the clap...\n\nI might have written the book on bad ideas, but Passos wasn't afraid to quote from it....\n\nSo I guess I'd become what they wanted me to be, a killer. Some rent-a-clown with a gun who puts holes in other bad guys. Well that's what they had paid for, so in the end that's what they got. Say what you want about Americans but we understand capitalism. You buy yourself a product and you get what you pay for, and these chumps had paid for some angry gringo without the sensibilities to know right from wrong. Here I was about to execute this poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like some dime store angel of death and I realized they were correct, I wouldn't know right from wrong if one of them was helping the poor and the other was banging my sister...\n\nI'd killed more cops than cholesterol and still no sign of Becker. It wasn't the first time it dawned on me I should probably have gone over the plan in more detail, but it was too late for that now.\n\nThe smell in this place reminded me of how long it had been since I'd had any food. A drinker eats when he's loaded. A real drunk eats when he's not.\n\nYup, very well written lines...For the Max Payne character.","April 23, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphic novel feel is still there, and Bullet Time is better than ever.\n\nThe game has high replay value, since play styles are so different on every difficulty level and it has an Arcade mode, which again lets you play the game with new play styles and compete against other people for highscores.\n\nAnd if you ever get tired of singleplayer, which is unlikely, you can switch to multiplayer, which again offers endless hours of gameplay, character and loadout customization and unique elements (like Bullet Time).\n\n\n","January 2, 2013","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Set in Brazil!? I have to admit that I was perplexed, perhaps even turned off at this idea when I initially heard about it. After all, Max Payne had established itself as a melodramatic noir crime story set in New York City, the complete opposite of its new sunny, colorful, Brazilian setting. Along with the new setting there were also new developers, while previous titles were handled by Finnish studio Remedy Games, Max Payne 3 was being developed by an internal Rockstar studio in Vancouver. This definitely raised a few eyebrows, mine especially. How did it all turn out?\n\nWonderfully.\n\nMax has never felt better. Controls are snappy. The animations are some of the best I've ever seen in gaming. The story is a little lacking, but all we really needed is Max with guns, truckloads of bad guys, and bullet time.\n\nThe dark and brooding atmosphere of the first two games is replaced by an aesthetic that closely resembles a Tony Scott film, particularly the film Man on Fire. There are a lot of filmic effects overlayed on the cutscenes that distort and blur the shots as they are framed off, highlighting key moments and important plot points. The combination of these effects gives the production it's own unique feel.\n\nOverall a must play of ANY action game enthusiast.","January 7, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I paid the money - what the hell else was I gonna do? They'd gotten me. An overdue port of a washed up franchise, and I'd given in like the sucker they'd pegged me for. I wanted answers.

New York Minute mode). also when Max recovers from a second wind, he will fully stand up instead of going to cover which meant more unnecessary damage, pill usage and facepalming.\n\nall in all a worthy title to play and definitely worth it if you can find it for $15 or less.","January 18, 2013","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Me, myself, never played MP1 or MP2, so my review will be unbiased and will not be comparing this to the previous games.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Easily one of the better looking games in my library. The visuals and effects are stunning\n+ I like the realistic way of handling weapons; two handguns and a primary (rifle, shotgun, etc.), although you can dual-wield the handguns but must drop the primary in order to do so\n+ The bullet time is limited, which means you must use it wisely\n+ Pretty interesting plot, will leave you interested for the most part\n+ The characters are likeable, although a couple will annoy you (which they're intended to)\n\nCons:\n\n- The multiplayer is sub-par and quickly gets boring\n- Rockstar's Social Club\n- Take my hours above and subtract about an hour or two for the length of the story; I was playing on Normal, so the playtime may vary for you depending on how good you are and what difficulty you choose\n- The game's got some weird flashing and editing crap piled onto the drunken scenes with Max, so beware those that suffer from sezuires\n- YOU WILL CRY AND SHOOT SOMETHING AT THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS GAME (not a con for me, but a con for most so RIP)\n\nOverall, I'd give this game on a good day an 8/10.","November 27, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Copious amounts of motion capture work has been put into this game and it helps to overcome the general floatiness/sluggishness of procedurally-generated movement that GTA4 was known for. A particularly striking moment would be a peripheral segment in the Brazilian slums with a trio of young aspiring footballers having a kickabout.  Being powered with an infrastructure meant for open-world games does come with a trade-off in the form of load times (masked by lengthy unskippable cutscenes). Replayability suffers as a result of the aforementioned loading.\n\nGunplay matches the best in franchise to date with extremely responsive controls and the return of the shoot-dodge/bullet-time maneuvres. Aiming returns to the era where projectiles travel dead centre without any deviation/spread. Weapon variety covers your usual fare of pistols, submachine guns and rifles - with an option to dual-wield with the lesser firearms. Levels provide cover generously by design and feature believable architecture that serves to mimick their real life counterparts as opposed to a seemingly random assortment of crates and walls. The game is also punctuated by a few rail shooter segments and chase sequences which are placed appropriately and definitely do not overstay their welcome.\n\nMax Payne 3 is presented via a heavy use of cutscenes as opposed to the unique comic-book approach adopted by Max Payne 1 & 2. While the departure from its origins can be somewhat jarring to diehard fans, the cinematics ingame are well-directed and acted out by a competent cast of voice actors. Max himself still comes with a full arsenal of monologic quips and one-liners that he is most fondly remembered by.\n\nWorth full price? Maybe. Worth discounted price? Definitely. For those sitting on the fence and leery over the prospects of playing a sequel that has been developed by none of the old guard, the near-decade wait is finally over and it has certainly not been in vain.","November 25, 2012","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Shoot-out tactics are needed to succeed, and the level-maps offer plenty of diversity.  In some other levels, you're in a rush to chase someone down, so there is a lot of variety in the gameplay.

The bullet camera is almost like Sniper Elite V2 and it looks realistic as compared to that game but it doesn't shows the internal part of human body.

First off let me say booting up the game for the first time is a nightmare!!! Rockstar needs social club to play and it must be linked in to your steam account, for some magical mythical reason Rockstar cant find your Steam account. Seriously there are "How to guide's" for booting Max Payne up and playing it. Its like trying to feed your reflection cheese, Rockstar doesnt want it but eventually it takes it. Anyways..... the gameplay is good but i felt like the storyline hurt most of the game. Also i hope you enjoy 5 minutes of gameplay then a cutscene throughout the whole game... If you played Max Payne 1 and 2 i would say get the 3rd and finish it up. If you have not played the game before it would be smart on you to keep your credit card in your wallet.","August 6, 2014","false","11.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's more like a movie fun, you can do special moves while shooting enemies. This is one of my favourite third-person shooter games, it takes you to a level where you've to fight while protecting yourself otherwise you will eventually die everytime but wait, pills helps! but they're very limited. The bullet camera is almost like Sniper Elite V2 and it looks realistic as compared to that game but it doesn't shows the internal part of human body. I've been playing this game for long (I wasn't having this game before on Steam) and since then I really love it. I still wonder what's with multiplayer because it doesn't seems to loads for me, they aren't available now or something but nevermind.

First off, I can definitely say I'd recommend this game, since it carries the very essence of the previous parts of the franchise. The RAGE engine looks gorgeous and making headshots in bullet time is as fun as ever. The game runs pretty darn well on most systems. The storytelling is great and Max's monologues reveal the self-pity he's fighting after the loss of his family. What I did not like is the amount of cutscenes which interupt the fun you're having over and over again. Of course, those who intend to run through the game just once - will find the cutscenes to be a great addition. On the other hand, those, who are planning to complete the game on different difficulty levels, or just hunt for achievements, are bound to watch the unskippable cutscenes. The soundtrack adds up to the memorable shooting sequences and provides a few classy tracks which may find their way into your MP3 player. Conclusion: go get this game, it's worth it! 9/10","September 10, 2013","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Thanks to Rockstar's genius Idea of using Social Club as DRM for their games it has made it near impossible, and in my case, impossible, for lots of players to ever see the "Start Game" button. It's really dissapointing to spend hours clearing room on my SSD, then waiting a day or even more to download a 30GB file, only to find out that the game won't work. Rockstar has claimed that they have released patches fixing multiple issues, including fixing connection to the Social Club activation server and the loading screen getting stuck on "initializing..." but I have so far failed to see any signs of the fruits of their labour.\n\nGames are a source of entertainment, and I can tell you that the journey I have gone through attempting to get this game working was nothing short of hell on earth and quite a long shot from entertaining, even if I get this game working I could never reccomend it to anybody, the game itself could never be worth the pain of just getting it to work.\n\nI wrote this review so that nobody else will buy this game and go through what I went through, and feel the same frustration that I did after being so exited when the game went on sale, to being so mad when it would not work; if just one person read this review and was discouraged from buying it I would feel that my purpose had been served.\n\nFirst and last Rockstar game I will ever buy.","January 4, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It looks like they learned something after GTA 4 after all.\n\nThis time we get DX 11 tesselation, ambient occlusion (advanced sun rays), FXAA, MSAA, Anisotropic filtering as well as texture, shader, shadow, reflection and water quality tweaks. Needless to say this game has some heavy PC requirements. I was able to get 30 FPS with my powerful rig, but as soon as I turned down the multisampling anti-aliasing from 8x to 4x I got around 50-60 FPS throughout the rest of the game. Some jumpy shadows and halo around certain objects were also fixed. There are much more sharp edges and corners to be seen now. There will be certain areas in the game where you will see objects just appearing out of thing air.\n\nHere are some other things that I have noticed. When you die at a checkpoint and you start over, you get to play with your full health even though you're supposed to be wounded. No more manual saves for us PC gamers. So you can thank Rockstar for when you get stuck in am awful area where you die over and over again. I also haven't noticed the first time around that you can actually go prone in this game. Sometimes its helpful but it takes you a long time to lie down and get up, so you will feel pretty exposed.\n\nRemedy sold its soul and now its turning in its grave. Oh wait, they are still around! I wonder how they feel after letting Take-Two/Rockstar make the third installment. I mean what were they thinking? ok so Max crosses some people back home (finally); then get recruited by an old police academy buddy to go work in Brazil. How exciting. I also like how you protect the girl because Max Payne doesn't like seeing girls get hit; moments later you can actually shoot the girl with no consequences. This thing has GTA written all over it.\n\nI really wonder whose bright idea at Rockstar it was to make Max Payne bald and place him in Brazil. When I first saw the screenshots back a couple of years ago I actually, in all honesty, thought it was a joke. I thought that Rockstar was just fooling around with some pre-production ideas.\n\nLet's start off with a little history lesson.\n\nThe first game introduced the bullet time feature. This feature revolutionized third person shooters. Since then, many games copied the mechanics. Dead to Rights, F.E.A.R., Call of Juarez, Strangehold, Red Dead Redemption, Sniper Elite, Vanquish, Wanted. What started off as a style mechanic slowly evolved into assist mechanic, aim assist that is. The first and second games did not rely on protracted gun fights with cover; it was mostly about short encounters with a handful of enemies, so the gun fights were all about your reflexes. (more on that later).\n\nImagine a heavily scripted and narrative-driven GTA 4 plus a little bit of Red Dead Redemption touch. Congrats, you have just imagined Max Payne 3 (minus car theft). Same engine was used in GTA 4 and RDR.\n\nGone is the dark NY noire. Gone are the days when Max Payne 1,2 came out on PC FIRST and was rated higher than the console counter-parts. Gone are the characters from the first two games. Gone is the isolation that you felt in the first two games (now you will have back up nearby quite often). Gone are the derelict New York city alleys, gone is the comic-book narrative. In fact, the feeling you got from playing the first two games was that there WAS no world outside of New York at all. Here you get about 40 minutes of gameplay in New Jersey with the old Payne Jacket, the snow falling and the mobsters shooting you, (flashback to the good old days), but that's as close to NY as you will get in the game. I mean why couldn't they continue with the NY/NJ timeline? The mafia boss could be the villain and Max could easily continue running around NY and NJ. Ironically, the two flashbacks were the best parts of the game for me.\n\nNow it is time to make way for the dance clubs, mini-skirts, Hawaiian shirts, the ability to kill friendly NPCs with no consequences, the annoying unremarkable uninteresting characters (Rockstar has a hard-on for those); make way for the side kicks, crazy blinding lights (people with epilepsy, BEWARE), the rural slums, sunny outdoors, frequent cut scenes that can't be skipped because the game is loading the new level (there are no loading screens here btw), Portuguese speaking enemies (no English subtitles by the way), the lack of suspense, and don't forget the multiplayer....yeah, the Max Payne franchise desperately needed that one.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the cut scenes, there are so many of them. The interrupt the fire fight continuity and decrease the urge to replay the game with guns blazing. The cut scenes also place you in scripted locations even though you were taking cover a second ago. At times, there is a cut scene every 1.5 minutes. Half the time you cannot skip them because that is when the game is apparently still loading. Every, and I repeat, EVERY cut scene is messed up. What I mean by that is that every cut scene has "effects" added to it. These include: blurry/static screen, double vision, various color and hue variations, sepia hue, frequent change of camera angle, blinding flashes, etc. It's frigging nauseating! Rockstar thought that adding too much "style" to these cut scenes would make them look more "cool" I guess. It sucks bad though, your screen can't ever focus on a single thing because everything goes haywire every two seconds. This "style" is even sometimes oozing out in real gameplay, no kidding. I also like how random dialogue words just pop up on the screen during cut scenes. Useless.\n\nI also like how as you progress through the game you get these achievements, like "250 enemies killed" or "you shot 50 enemies in their hands" or "100 enemies killed with pistols", etc. WTF! When did Max Payne turn into a arcade shoot filled with rewards? Seriously, you can't even turn that infantile thing off!\n\nSo Rockstar decided to go with cover, since they are using their RAGE engine again, okay. What sucks though is that you cannot move when shooting while in cover. It's weird because you could do that in RDR.\n\nThe firefights are good, there is sufficient destruction and satisfaction of each kill.\n\nAlso when you run, you have the ability to roll and pick up ammo, like in Uncharted. However running itself is sluggish and imprecise, just like in any console third person shooter.\n\nAs you progress through the game you get too look at "clues" that describe your situation. You can also look for weapons parts to be used in multiplayer I guess. Take that for what its worth.\n\nThe campaign is pretty long (by today's standards anyway) but it is only so because 40% of the time you watch cut scenes, like in the last Metal Gear game.\n\nAs far as the story goes, well, nothing will ever beat the first game in that department. In the first Max Payne it was you against the world: the cops were after you, so was the mafia and the pharmaceutical corporation during the worst storm in history. The third game is a train wreck where you have to save a rich girl... who cares seriously? Moments ago Max was talking about how much he despised the vanity filled rich people. Yet he jumps into the pool with both feet (literally) instantly and keeps risking his own life for them. Then you turn into Sam Fisher/Arnold Schwarzenegger/One-Man Army kind of guy and do some spec ops missions, then you turn into a fearless unstoppable killing machine just looking for trouble. It just doesn't feel like a Max Payne game at least half of the time (boat chase sequence with infinite ammo anyone?) Certain areas the game plays like Kane & Lynch, no kidding. I still say that the franchise spiritually ended back in 2003.\n","November 27, 2013","true","84.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","10"

It's now much more action focused with especially "cinematic" feel.\n\nNow Rockstar generally doesn't make bad games, and this definitely isn't one. These days I mostly play games for the story and Max Payne 3 doesn't dissapoint in the department. The writting is superb, esspecially the dialogue and Max's "monologue", the cutscenes are done well and the voice acting is some of the best in any game. The graphics are great, the attention to detail astonishing, and the psyhics again some of the best. And it runs great even on a weaker machines.\n\nThe gunplay, and that's the all the gameplay consists of, is fun, though it feels clunky at times. The difficulty is also problematic, you will breze trough parts of the game only to hit rough spots and die repeatedly. Cutscens are fine and I like them in my games, but here at the start the feel disruptive of the gameplay resulting in a pretty slow start of the game and that's not fine. Things do get better later, though.\n\nAll in all, it's a good, maybe even great, game not without some problems but definitelly worth a playtrough","February 19","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Su much fun that i completed it 5 times and i'm still not bored.\nThe scripted events are great, enemy disposition brillant, level design SUPERLATIVE...nothing else to say...JUST BRILLIANT...much more fun to play than the old episodes (Gameplay wise).\nI'll be very short with the tecnical part...THE GRAPHICS ARE GORGEOUS! Specially here, on the PC.\nSimple as that....GORGEOUS (and i have to notice this is the first VERY WELL MADE Rockstar game PC port).\nTo conclude everything i have to say that Max Payne has only one problem...that is called MAX PAYNE.\nThe game is so different, in a matter of atmosphere and location, that will always be compared to the old epsiodes...no matter why...it's just like "Alien" and "Aliens", two very good movies, but the second one was, and will be, constantly compared to the first, because of its different direction.","December 29, 2013","true","146.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Bullet time (player activated slow-mo) is fun. Good music and mostly nice environments.\n\nCons:\nThis game becomes tiring. At the START of the game you could kill enemies by one shot in the head. Later on some enemies need 5+ shots in the head to finally die, when they are wearing nothing on the head, or just a basebul cap. It takes the fun out of things when you don't know after how many shots to the head will kill the enemy. This ruins bullet time too. Massively disappointing if you start the game on the hardest difficulty and progress.\n\nBullet time was more fun in previous max payne games. Bullet time adds fun, so why reduce the amount of time you can bullet time? There was clearly more of it in previous games.\n\nThe engine this game was built on just is not fluid enough. The RAGE engine is not even remotely as good as some modern engines. It's great for GTA, but a FPS? Compare this to the Source engine, Unreal engine, Frostbite engine.... It's just kind of poor in comparison. Less fluid, more bugs, more glitches, worse AI, bulky. Lacking optimization.\nYou can just look at the game size to see how bulky it is. 33gb +? Really? The graphics and cinematics arn't that great. This game could be compressed down to 10gb. We all see what you are trying to do here Rockstar...\n\nNo tactics (again due to the engine and AI).\nPoint and shoot. Use bullet time. Repeat. Point and shoot use bullet time. repeat. Endless chases with the enemy escaping in the last second.\n\nThe story is WAY too slow. If it were 70% faster and the game 70% shorter, it would be a lot better. It feels like a constant chore to continue. This is a prime example of a producer over prolonging a story to justify a higher price tag.\n\noh... and F**k off Social club. Signups/Signings and additional bloatware installations and DRM suck.\n\nLots of bugs and graphical glitches are present.\n\nPS. I recently shot an enemy without a helmet 8 times, point blank, with a .38 revolver before he finally died. Bull***t\n\nPSS. Max Payne 3 has stopped working. This happens a lot on windows 10.\n\nPSSS. After 9 hours I finally had enough, uninstalled and watched the ending on youtube. Changed review to negative.\n\nGet this game if you like story driven games with lots of cinematics and if you liked the previous Max Paynes. Otherwise AVOID!","January 31","false","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One of the best story games I have played in a long time and even at the end I was craving more on what happened to some of the characters and more sequences where I could fight. The game has a solid story, great effects, and a good replayability factor I think. I have never played the older Max Paynes but think I may try them now due to my love for this one.\n\nAnother factor I really enjoyed was the dialoge for the game; there wasen't too many flaws or, a big part for me, uneded curse words. When a dialogue has too much language like that it takes me out of the game a little because it seems so unrealistic. The little jokes that are thrown by Payne or his partner, the language setting, narrative, etc. all just blend so well I think.\n\nSummed up if you liked the original games, enjoy a good action packed game, good story, and a great time I would highly recommend this game!

For any gamer who knows their salt, this name should be familiar. His publisher Take Two has released two games in 2001 and 2003 to great reviews and a decent amount of critical acclaim. Since then, though, the ex-cop has been left in the dust, barely being remembered other than that crappy movie that was released around then with Mark Wahlberg. It seemed for a while Max would just fade away, until back in 2012, when Rockstar Games, now owners of Take Two, released Max Payne 3. How was that? Well, we're taking a look at it now.\n\nSTORY: You're... Max Payne, of course. After the events of the last two games, Max is a drunken mess, he smokes regularly, he's addicted to painkillers, and he tries to find a reason to not blow his head off daily. Up until one day, when his old friend Passos comes across him and hires him to guard a wealthy family in Sao Paulo, Brazil named the Bronco's. Everything seems fine until the wife of the eldest Bronco is kidnapped, and Max and Passos go on a search to find her. That's all I can really say about it without spoilering it. It's a pretty well put together story. It can be pretty depressing at times when you see Max lose, but when he wins, which is kind of rare, it feels great. That's really all you can ask for. The story is a bit on the short side, took me 10 hours to beat it on Medium, but it's a good experience regardless.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 3rd person shooter. You have 4 slots for guns. You have 2 slots one handed weapons, another for a two handed weapon, and the 4th one is dual wielding the two one handed weapons you have on you. All methods are satisfying enough, and gunplay is fantastic. The innovative Bullet Time from the last few games is here too, and that is great, and it has some new features. If you carry painkillers on you, and you lose all your health, you have a chance to shoot the guy who would have killed you and take him out, getting some health back and putting you back into the fight. Ammo can be a bit scarce, especially on the harder difficulties, but if you're efficient enough, you can do well. The game is freaking hard, btw, even when I played it on Medium, it was hard. The game is really satisfying when you beat the levels, and I ended up replaying it on Hardcore, which made me tear my hair out a bit but it was totally worth it. Gameplay is fantastic, maybe even best of 2012.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Game looks good. The favelas of Sao Paulo look grimy and dirty, the nicer penthouses are well designed. There are a lot of nice details in all the levels without a doubt. This isn't a grand open world game like GTA or Red Dead Redemption or LA Noire like Rockstar is known for making, but the smaller levels are fine. They all look great. Game runs pretty well as well, since it's a game from 2012, if you have any recent hardware you should be fine. Runs well enough on my PC, and if I can run it, you can run it.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Max Payne has his voice actor from the last games, James McCaffery, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, is he as good as ever. The other characters are voiced well enough too. The characters look good, Max goes through a bit of a redesign halfway through which some people didn't like, but I thought he looked fine. Overall it's fine.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: Practically abandoned on PC, played a bit on my 360, kind of fun, but nothing spectacular, odds are unless you get a big community for it you wont get to play it anyway.\n\nEXTRAS: In each level, there are clues that relate to the story, though you have to look for a few of them. There are also some parts for golden versions of each weapon, and if you get all the parts scattered around the levels, you get a better version of the gun every time you pick it up. Once you beat the game, you unlock Score Attack, which is basically a kill and get points mode. There's also the New York Minute mode, where you have to beat a level in a minute. Well, you get time for killing guys, but still. If you arent impressed by that, then you have New Youk Minute Hardcore mode, in which you have to beat the whole game in a minute with the same bonuses, with no deaths. Yeah... good luck with that.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Phenominal game. One of the best of 2012, strong competator with Far Cry 3 and Mass Effect 3 for that slot. 9/10, it's worth picking up around a sale, hell, even right now. Try it out sometime, it will not disappoint.","November 23, 2015","true","26.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Especially to any Max Payne fans.\n\nI personally liked the first game in the series the most. Had the best/most intriguing atmosphere/story not to mention really impressive gunplay. (especially for its time) That being said I will say that I think Max Payne 3 is number two on that list. With Max Payne 2 coming in last. Though I enjoyed them all.\n\nThe second Max Payne tends to lose you right around the last 1/3 of the game. The first, and third games in the series do not suffer from that, and have great pacing all around.\n\nNow to focus more on this game. It has great graphics, gameplay, gunplay, and the difficulty spikes can be a pain, but are not too bad. I personally like the melee on this game the best out of the 3 games. weapon selection is always pretty good in these games, but grenades are so scare I don't even think I got to use one. I remember in MP1, and MP2, you could get grenades, and definitely get molotov cocktails. They are not so present in this game from the players perspective.\n\nIts not a short game, but its also not as long as people claim it is, I beat it on hard in about 12 hours, not counting setup and AFKs.\n\nIt is very movie like, the way it transitions back and forth is pretty well done. Especially for a game that came out 3 years ago.\n\nI did like the reflections back in this game, and the snow levels (which is why I loved New York in the first game) That being said they used the atmosphere of this game to create a completely different feeling Max Payne, and they did a pretty good job of it. The music really accented what was happening in the game at the time, as well as, stands out as pretty good tracks overall. The music has always been pretty good in Max Payne, but the third one has the best music of the series.\n\nThe story/plot of this one didn't have as much impact on me as the first game, and a lot of it was cliche', but it turned out to be pretty decent.  The voice acting was good, and most of the sound effects were ok, but could have been better. The performance of hte game is pretty straight forward especially if you don't go crazy with MSAA. I do like that the gameplay reflects his age, and how worn he is. He is not near as fast as in the first 2 games. He takes at least twice as long to recover from a dive in this game. Much more of a cinematic experience than the first two games, but they molded the new with the old fairly well.\n\nThe multiplayer has been shut down by now, but the game is still worth purchasing. It also is one of the many games on steam that always sees a decent %off on ever Steam sale.","July 9, 2015","true","13.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

Not a bad Max Payne game, though least favorite of all three for me. Story is decent yet felt cheap and tad short. Gunplay was satisfying with great variety of weapons. Personally didn't like the WARM setting of this game and look of Max, yet I get what he still going through. Loved his voice in game, and his inner voice comments, reminded me of first two games. Game was a bit short, around 8 hours yet ending was satisfying. Some parts of the game felt cheesy, with dozen of enemy soldiers attacking you in waves and you kill them all - felt like shooting gallery. Image flickering effects were tad annoying and not necessary. There is little connection to the previous games story wise, apart from Max still suffering the loss of his loved ones and some flashback "missions".

I was a big fan of the former two titles in the series but for this one I was kinda worried that they would lose the original "Max Payne-feeling" with the change of settings.\nTurns out I was suprised that it really worked, Sunny São Paolo might be a lot different then a snowy New York, but the gritty Max Payne-feeling is still there in my opinion. If you are a fan of the series I am convinced you would like it.\n\n\n+ Great Gun play. I mean really great. Things are flying all over, shooting stuff, glass getting smashed and so on..\n+ Great Setting. São Paolo and Brazil is a great setting for this, with all the grittiness, corruption and violence that is Max Payne\n+ The new mechanics. I like how the developers implemented a cover mechanics and how you can keep shooting while lying down for instance.\n+ The story is good and fits in the Max Payne universe, there might have been some clichés and some predictability but all in all good.\n+ Sound and Soundtrack. Generally good overall, adding to the atmosphere of the game.\n\n- A bit on the short side, especially if you, like me, are not interested in any multiplayer\n- Not much replay value, this is much I guess due to me not being interested in multiplay\n- Gun Variation. I did not feel like there was that many guns to choose from and this is not good in a game such as this. But come to think of it, the earlier games did not have that many guns either.

It has been a\nphenominal story driven noir experiance that is unmatched in gaming to this day.\n\nI was apprehensive to say the least when I heard that Remedy lost the rights\nto the Max Payne name to Rockstart studios. When I heard the game would be\nset in Brazil I was even more apprehensive. How can you have a Max Payne set\nnot in the iconic New York city. I was afraid they would trash the franchise and\nturn it into a new money grubbing copypasta game series that forgets what it\nwas all about.\n\nTo be fair, the game blew away my expectations. In every aspect the game is\nsolid and quality. The graphics, story, pacing, gameplay and voice acting are\ntop notch. Worthy of a Max Payne game. First the good.\n\nThe game itself is incredibly well put together. The story is tight but the weak\nest entry in the series. However it is quite enjoyable hearing Max chew through\nhis lines and wit as sharp as ever. The graphics are using the RAGE engine and\nit is truly stunning. The physics are the best on the market. I do miss the story\nboard way of telling a story. It is sorely missed in Max Payne 3. The "new age"\nway of doing the story convence is okay but it can be a little annoying. People\ncomplain that there are too many cinematics in MP3, but its a story driven game\nand so I think it makes sense. I enjoy seeing the beauty of the game unfold with\nexcellent voice acting and animations. It all comes together incredibly well.\n\nThe gameplay and particularly the gunplay is BY FAR the BEST part of this\ngame. It is the BEST 3rd person shooter ever made. The combat is a true\npleasure. The bullets showing where you hit enemies, how the bullets hit the\ntargets, how their bodies react. Its an incredible ballad of death.\n\nI don't think I really have to write much more. Simply put Max Payne 3 is the\nbest 3rd person shooter I have ever played. It is also a damn fine entry in an\nincredibly franchise. I honestly hope Rockstar is not done with Max Payne.\nSeeing as 3 was as solid as it was.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myaugmentationsareaugmented/recommended/204100/","myaugmentationsareaugmented","Bionicman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myaugmentationsareaugmented/","249 products in account","This is what happens when you give a series to a development team that had nothing to do with the earlier entries and basically give them a small sheet of paper with some basic gameplay mechanics, and a note saying "cast James McCaffrey as the title character": A game that doesn't feel like Max Payne, doesn't play like Max Payne, and actively punishes you for trying to play Max Payne. Oh, and don't forget needing to sign up for some obnoxious PC-only DRM service because Rockstar expects its paying customers to be treated like untrustworthy criminals! At least the PC version has some nice enhancements. Sure, they're only in the graphics department, and maybe in being able to actually customize controls assuming the console versions have that feature removed for no reason.\n\nAfter this, you get to watch a long, unskippable cutscene that tells you "game is still loading!" if you try to skip it... all before you're allowed to get to the main menu. The menu of all things. Want to watch it again, so you can see the story when you're not just trying to set up your controls and graphical settings? I hope you're technically inclined enough to find the .bnk file in the install directory, otherwise you can forget about that.\n\nYou're given a bland onslaught of in-your-face tutorials during the first chapter because clearly people who play games are too stupid to learn basic mechanics on their own, or in a separate tutorial- an option Remedy's titles offered. You're also given an introduction to the horrendous input lag this title has! Press a button to move, and Max pauses before doing so. Let go of the button, and Max keeps going for a second before deciding to stop. Try to shootdodge, and Max will pause before the effect actually begins. Everything feels delayed, even the simplest things like mouse movement. (I refuse to try using a controller to see if it's more responsive. I didn't buy a PC game to play with a controller. Outside of vehicle-related games, that's a bit like buying an HDTV to watch VHS cassettes on.)\n\nGet used to seeing cutscenes, as there are a lot of them. Out of the playing time that's surely displayed with this review, I've probably gotten to spend under half of that in actual gameplay. I had bad flashbacks to Inversion while playing with the amount of "30 seconds of gameplay between multi-minute cutscenes" that was going on! Inversion at least had the benefit of not being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of an existing series of games. The rest is cutscene, cutscene, cutscene, with obnoxious and pointless effects plastered everywhere. Color desyncing, scanlines, freeze-frame of Max's face pushed to the side, the multiple-PiP effect of 24 fame, flashing lights, certain words that were just spoken needlessly printed to the screen... It's constant, erratic, and nauseating, especially when you're trying to actually see what the hell is going on. Thanks Rockstar, I appreciate being given migraines when I try to play your games. There's also a strange anomaly regarding the cutscenes: each one phases between pre-rendered and real-time rendering for no particular reason. (This is most noticeable if you have recording software that reports framerate running, as the pre-rendered are thankfully very high quality despite the graphics clearly being below what the real-time graphics are capable of. Pre-rendered cutscenes "run" at an incredibly higher framerate than the real-time cutscenes.)\n\nRemember how I said the game punishes you for trying to play it as if it were a Max Payne game? Veterans of the series will see, in the rare gameplay segment, that trying to remain mobile and use bullet time and shootdodging will end up getting you killed as quickly as standing in an inferno. Instead, you're clearly expected to cling to cover like some Gears of War/Kill.Switch player and play it that way- including switching back to your main gun from your pistol because you're most likely in this situation straight out of a cutscene.\n\nA few more horrendous gameplay changes are ones clearly decided upon because Rockstar wanted to make an Xbox game out of a historically PC-based series. Gone is Max's ability to hold an arsenal of weaponry and grenades that provide a variety of options for how to shoot up the next mook. Gone are even the names of the weapons! Max can now only hold two pistols, with the option to use either one of the two, or dual wield them (Ingram-style machine pistols count for this). You can pick up a two-handed weapon, but if it runs out of ammo or you want another two-handed, you have to drop the gun. If you get into a cutscene, you will have to switch back because you're forced to use a pistol again. Your weapon selection is a radial menu, clearly designed for a joystick. Painkillers now take effect near-instantly rather than healing over time, but it doesn't really matter since unless you're huddled behind cover like a generic modern TPS game your health's going to run low just as fast anyway.\nRun out of health, but have painkillers? Rockstar took a page from Call of Duty's book like so many other unoriginal people and give you a variation of "last stand" - kill the person who "killed" you and you get to stand back up. Fun! Challenging! Pointless!\n\nOh, and your ability to quicksave or save from the menu where you would like? Rockstar ignored that idea too. Can't give too much control to the player, right?\n\nOverall, someone unfamiliar with the previous entries in the franchise and can stomach the awful input lag (or the thought of playing a PC game with a controller) might enjoy this, so long as constant cutscenes with nauseating effects aren't a problem. As a fan of the older games, and someone who just went through the entirety of Max Payne 2 again, I have to say this is the true Fall of Max Payne. My only consolation was I spent less than $5 on this thing during a sale, because I don't think I can be bothered to go any further.","January 11, 2014","false","9.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Not a single ONE of these World Cup rejects screamed "hue hue hue" or asked me to give them money, or threatened to report me. It was like being in a poor charicature of what Brazil would actually be like. Rude, poor people who smell funny were everywhere, true, but not a single Huskar or Bloodseeker in sight. Not only that, but the actual shooting itself just dragged on too long. The game didn't need to last 8 hours. Max Payne 2 lasted only 5 hours, but that was the most enjoyable because the game knew when it had done everything that could be done with itself and packed it in there. How many hundreds of times do I need to pop out of cover and shoot a ♥♥♥♥ing BR in his filthy burrito face until I've proven I can do it a hundred more times? I've passed the test, game. Making me do it more won't make me enjoy it more.\n\nI don't usually say this, but what I enjoyed a lot about this game, and all Max Payne games, is the poetry. Not some pretentious metaphors about butterfly farts in an elevator, I mean the poetry set the mood for the game and painted a picture of the world I was in. Max doesn't have the dark humor he did in his first two games, but Rockstar was intent on keeping with the "brooding ex-cop woe is me I'm so sad all the time QQ" theme and took it as far as they could for better or for worse. Maybe next game they'll finally put Max out of his misery, and for the fifth game we'll get a CUH-RAZY protagonist like an old Dante, he would certainly fit the mood more for all the jumping around I do.\n\nThree out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( )","August 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

On the one hand it retains 'the shoot first ask questions later' feel of old school fps games, marries them with some ridiculous (but admittedly cool) set pieces and together manages to produce an extremely fun bullet riddled campaign of destructive justice. Pretty much what defines Max Payne to be honest. It true Rockstar fashion, the cinematic presentation is excellent, as is the score.\n\nOn the other hand, the game suffers from some terrible design ideas like last stand (basically leaves you a sitting duck on the floor being shot at from multiple directions), clunky controls, incredibly cramped environments, over reliance on closet mobs that literally spawn out of thin air, annoying monologue by Max about everything.. (and I mean EVERYTHING) and some of the worst follow NPC's in recent history. The story isn't particularly well written, characterization is average at best and the (thankfully) few 'boss' encounters are average at best; frustrating at worst.\n\nSo why would I recommend this game then? Because it is FUN. Also, explosions everywhere. Really, for $5, it's totally worth it.\n\nP.S.

OKAY, lets google again.....\nturns out to be able to play this game online you need to do alot of things that seem to vary from user to user, however after again 5min googling, it should be something around: disable your firewall and/or open up to 13, yes: thirteen. ports in your router.\n\nNow we are at almost an hour just trying to set up this darned game and still would have to deal with portforwarding for multiplayer, I'm done.\n->at least steam took the game back w/o any hassle and refunded me.\n\nDo not buy this, ever.

That's actually a lie - I have yet to play the game.  I have been wanting to for a long time, and was waiting until I bought a new computer to play it.  Today is that day!\n\nInstead of being able to play the campaign of Max Payne 3, there's a minigame at the beginning called "Sign in to Rockstar Social Club".  I have yet to beat it.  The best I can figure out is that it works like some kind of gambling / slot machine type game, where you feed it characters in the form of an email address and password and you get a result.  Usually it's some message about contact steam support 1000.50 error, sometimes it's unable to find email address as a proper Social Club account (despite being able to sign in on their site).  I assume the winning jackpot game is that I get to play a single player game of Max Payne 3.\n\n99% of the time (I'm going to say 99% because I'm sure there's a way to beat this minigame) I just get these messages and have to try again, so I've yet to see the winning screen where I assume I get to play the game.  Or perhaps there's another minigame after this one.  Occasionally the minigame makes it interesting by just removing the email address and password fields and requires you to type in some numbers.  I'm not sure if this increases the chances of winning or adds a bonus jackpot.\n\nAlso, I give this minigame 1 out of 5 stars because the background music is exciting and makes you wonder if you're going to win.\n\nEDIT: OH!  I won the minigame!  There was a cutscene, and then the game's title menu!  I promptly cranked all the graphical settings up to the max to test this computer out.  Of course that usually requires a restart and it looks like when you restart you have to play the "Rockstar Social Club" minigame again.  :(\n\nIsn't it funny that there are places on the internet where I could get this game for free and not have to deal with this Rockstar Social Club?  Instead I pay for not being able to play a game.  Why did no one realize this was a bad idea in implementation?  Or was the Social Club rigged for the testers to always win?  Such a bad idea... I shouldn't have paid for this.\n\nI give up for now I suppose.  I'm getting a constant email address invalid now, and maybe that means I'm out of credits to play the game today?  Funny enough there's not an exit button that I see - I assume you have to get past the minigame to be able to even exit (don't tell anyone I used a cheat and pushed Alt-F4).  I mean, who would need to exit without beating the minigame, right?  That's unprobable!","June 6, 2015","false","9.7"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","52","31","60","34","0"

I'm playing the story again I enjoyed it so much. The detail that has been put into this game is breath taking, the levels do not appear lifeless and empty as in many games. For example, the favelas in Max Payne 3 appear to have been designed brick by brick unlike in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 where buildings are designed to be ran past and nothing more. Shoot dodge I love and I have developed a tendency to just use it whenever because it is so cool. As I said at the beginning, is excellent. I don’t know about other people but I was working out how elements fit together just as Max was, which in my opinion is a testament to how well thought out the game is.\n\nBasically stop reading, start playing.\n","February 15, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't worry if you didn't play any of the previous titles though as this game doesn't have anything to do with the previous storyline.\n\nPros:\n+Bullet time is absolutely brutal this time around.\n+Graphics are gorgeous! My eyes melted away as I saw both the beautiful and ghetto side of Brazil.\n+The music. Good God if my ears could j*zz they would!\n+Story is very gripping but isn't too deep (it's basically a Die Hard plotline)\n+Controls are very fluid and responsive (though the covering mechanism bugged out on me a couple of times and Max just refused to take cover no matter how fast I pressed that button)\n+Multiplayer is better than COD (honestly....anything is better than COD......except Duke Nukem Forever....). Rockstar managed to keep Bullet Time in multiplayer so laugh as you slow-mo kill someone who jumped for cover!\n+Replayablilty is finally in a Max Payne game! (Collecting Golden guns, clues, and grinds! Did I mention Multiplayer?)\n\nCons:\n-Buggy covering mechanism (probably just me tho...)\n-Enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Seriously some of them just run right at you.....with a pistol. Really guys?\n-For some reason Rockstar decided to add fuzz/flare in the game. It happens in EVERY. F*CKING. CUTSCENE. I took more pills than Max to get rid of my raging headache.\n-Multiplayer lobbies are sometimes empty. Yeah sorry guys, not a lot of people play this game online. On the plus side you can invite your friends to a deathmatch AND rank up that way! So go have fun hatin' each other!\n\nOverall: Yew liek teh shooting? Good, this game rewards you for every headshot you make. Watch as the bullet literally comes out the other side of your enemies head in glorious slow-mo! I give this game 8 pills out of 10!

I found myself running head on into situations that were impossible to overcome and the controls felt like they were designed for a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard. The mechanics behind game were solid, bullet time was useful at times but the AI were just Batsh*t crazy. I found it hard to hang back and plink them off one by one with them suicidally sprinting at me and constantly throwing grenades and it made the game feel too fast paced and random over, being speedy and action packed how I prefer. One thing I found most unsettling is with me constantly dying the game decided to crash a lot which DESTROYED the flow of the game and its play ability. All in All I will keep the game installed and try to play it, but the game still needs some TLC, especially with the AI and crashing after the 3rd death. This game is not perfect for me, but great for people who use a gamepad and love a good fast-pace shooter!\n\n\nIf you found this review useful please comment and let me know as this is my first and I may do more.","December 29, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

One of the few games where it’s fun to play right to the end, and not just becoming a grind to finish the story.\n\nHowever, Social Club is detrimental, and doesn’t allow me access to multiplayer or the store because I live in New Zealand, so I couldn’t activate any of the DLC.\n\nAlso, Max Payne is one of the most negative anti-heroes I’ve ever played as. The most positive thing he says is “I’m getting good at this” as he pushes a button on a wall.\n\nAlso the game expects you to look for collectables while also having Max drop hints like “I decided to stop faffing around in the restroom and went outside to kill more people”, whereupon you find more pills in the toilet bowl.\nBut Max’s comments are sometimes different when you die and replay a bit, so that was a nice touch.\n\nSo yeah.

It shared interesting similarities with the previous entries, while simultaneously seeming like it's an entirely new concept for a video game. It had the familiar bullet-time ability, the well scripted and well spoken commentary by Max, humorously breaking the fourth wall on occasion, and a gritty, dark story peppered with well-timed bits of black humor.\n\nThen the other side: A story which stops just short of "noir" and instead explores a more shocking, psychological break-down of Max (trust me, the other games just played with the concept in comparison) as one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day follows another. Instead of a "poor me" mentality, we get to see Max evolve a "♥♥♥♥ you" attitude, though it's still served as you'd expect from Max.\n\nI've said this of every Max Payne game I've played* but, Max Payne 3 is the best Max Payne yet, and I hope they don't make another.

You can see my review for Max Payne 2 elsewhere (tldr: same gameplay, loses great storytelling and themes, do not recommend).  Unlike the first sequel, this one delivers.\n\nThis game features modern graphics, a vibrant setting (predominately Sao Paulo, Brazil), and a return to the "bullet time" gameplay wherein the player can slow down time to make cinematic diving shots.  There is the addition of cover in this game, and my main criticism is that it relies on it a little too much.\n\nWhile the story does not have the deeper thematic undertones like the original's Norse mythology, it is still an interesting noir detective offering often juxtaposed in sunny South American settings.  It is well worth at least one playthrough.  I recommend just enjoying the story and increased bullet time of the easier setting.","July 4, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The leveldesign is absolutely fantastic, showing different environments and variety within them, but mostly, the player will walk from A to B while triggering actionbubbles of bad guys to fight, more often than not with short cutscenes inbetween. This can be seen as a red string adventure with fluent interaction, but whoever wants to simply play ye good ole shooter and be able to traverse freely within sections of a level will be quite disappointed with this game.\nIn fact, altough I really enjoyed the game, especially the tale that it told, and I was hooked by it from the start, I will refrain from touching it again, because beyond the first run through the story, I probably wont be able to get much more out of the game. It's just too repetitive and boring after you've seen the environment once or twice, twice being the time you died because the game picked a weapon that was empty for you during a scripted snippet. Like, wow, you could've just told me to go ♥♥♥♥ myself.\nTL;DR: Graphically stunning, but in gameplay falls short.

It's a love letter to the action genre. The combat scenes, dialogs, scenarios are excellent. Retains the noire setting from previous games, also the same old mechanics with new features in, that blends quite well.\n\nIs against what a "modern" game is supposed to be. No health regen, no charming characters and Payne's actions most of the time goes south. The diving now is way more realistic, same for the way Max carries his guns.\n\nThe animation is superb. Re-playability is great.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect is good, has potential, but cheaters and unbalanced gameplay makes a "not yet" for me.\n\nStill don't get what Rockstar show us first. They depicted Max in a totally different setting: Brazil, a different look and the dark setting was, apparently, gone. I'm glad I was wrong.

On max settings it has to be one of the best looking games I have ever seen. As well as the graphics, Rockstar should be praised on the amount of detail this game has (though that shouldn't be a surprise). The game seems to be optimised very well, also. It runs very smoothly and is one of the more pleasant\nPC gaming experiences I have had.\n\nHaving never previously played any previous instalments in the Max Payne franchise, I picked up Max Payne 3 not knowing what to expect, but I do have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, and I do believe the game is worth its full retail price. If you can pick it up during a sale, then you're laughing. The gun controls in Grand Theft Auto IV are very sticky, but they have been fixed here, so no need to worry. Although it does have partial controller support, I would just use the mouse and keyboard as this title is not an open world game.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, well, it's not my thing, but I have played a little bit of it and I do appreciate it. Bullet Time does actually work well, too.","December 22, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Add to this a distinct lack of a dark, snow-blasted New York City and the game fails to deliver the Noire-esque experience fans of the series had come to expect.\n\nWhat the game lacks however it makes up for in visceral, unforgiving gunplay and raw style. It has great visuals and a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack to boot.\n\nDefinitely worth playing through at least once or twice.","August 12, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself running head on into situations that were impossible to overcome and the controls felt like they were designed for a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard. The mechanics behind game were solid, bullet time was useful at times but the AI were just Batsh*t crazy. I found it hard to hang back and plink them off one by one with them suicidally sprinting at me and constantly throwing grenades and it made the game feel too fast paced and random over, being speedy and action packed how I prefer. One thing I found most unsettling is with me constantly dying the game decided to crash a lot which DESTROYED the flow of the game and its play ability. All in All I will keep the game installed and try to play it, but the game still needs some TLC, especially with the AI and crashing after the 3rd death. This game is not perfect for me, but great for people who use a gamepad and love a good fast-pace shooter!\n\n\nIf you found this review useful please comment and let me know as this is my first and I may do more.","December 29, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

One of the few games where it’s fun to play right to the end, and not just becoming a grind to finish the story.\n\nHowever, Social Club is detrimental, and doesn’t allow me access to multiplayer or the store because I live in New Zealand, so I couldn’t activate any of the DLC.\n\nAlso, Max Payne is one of the most negative anti-heroes I’ve ever played as. The most positive thing he says is “I’m getting good at this” as he pushes a button on a wall.\n\nAlso the game expects you to look for collectables while also having Max drop hints like “I decided to stop faffing around in the restroom and went outside to kill more people”, whereupon you find more pills in the toilet bowl.\nBut Max’s comments are sometimes different when you die and replay a bit, so that was a nice touch.\n\nSo yeah.

Any shots that are not in the head feel like you're just wasting bullets.\n\nI'm not a fan of the checkpoint system and really miss any sort of quicksave and quickload options. It makes it significantly harder to optimize your play.\n\nThe control also feels a lot "looser" than previous Max Payne games. I'm sure this is played up as Max being older and far less agile, but it can still feel a bit frustrating just the same.\n\nOverall, it's certainly worth getting if only to hear Max's thoughts on this newest human cesspool of crime.","January 4, 2013","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is so unique like nothing I have ever played before. The Single Player has a pretty decent story and good character development. The SP is the only good part of this game. I am about 6 hours into the story and it is an aboslute blast. The SoftLock combat is so precise and fun to play. The game gets quite addicting pretty fast. The multiplayer, however, is ♥♥♥♥. There is no point in buying the game for the multiplayer. The Season Pass is pointless, no one even plays the "Co-op" and the weapons included are just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the starter weapons. There are no more than 100 people online at a time and about 90% of those 100 people are all level 20-50's. So if you want to get good at the game, good luck. If you are going into this game expecting a fantastic multiplayer, you are going to being thoroughly disappointed. The only thing fun in multiplayer is to mess around with the Softlock capabilities, pretty much it.\nThe SP is the only highlight of the experience, and I give it a 8/10, for $3.99 (Autumn Sale) you should buy it. Do not buy the season pass unless  you want to waste your money, it is virtually useless since its all for the crappy multiplayer.","November 30, 2013","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm playing the story again I enjoyed it so much. The detail that has been put into this game is breath taking, the levels do not appear lifeless and empty as in many games. For example, the favelas in Max Payne 3 appear to have been designed brick by brick unlike in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 where buildings are designed to be ran past and nothing more. Shoot dodge I love and I have developed a tendency to just use it whenever because it is so cool. As I said at the beginning, is excellent. I don’t know about other people but I was working out how elements fit together just as Max was, which in my opinion is a testament to how well thought out the game is.\n\nBasically stop reading, start playing.\n","February 15, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played through them in order. in the first two max payne's i ran around like a crazy person shootdoging and throwing grenades and it was so much fun. I remember when i was finished with max payne one loaded up max payne two, and then i shot my first guy and almost pooped myself with how fun the ragdolls we're, and all the graphical upgrades, and the ability to dual weld desert eagles (best weapons in max payne two) but i felt max payne two's title was very appropriate "The Fall of Max Payne" there was just a vibe in Max Payne two that was not welcome. The story was not nearly as compelling *spoliers* it was incredidbly predictable that Vlad was the bad guy, speaking of which Vlad's voice actor in the first game seemed a million times better, and the character in the first game never would have betrayed Max. Then came along Max Payne three, which is MOST DEFINILTY the BEST game in the series, i loved the story, multiplayer is a ton of fun, and Max Payne is more of a badass then ever. But don't do what i did in my first playthrough of the game. I played Max Payne three on hard mode my first time playing through and was a turtle the ENTIRE game, i got stuck on alot of parts and was annoyed with how the npc's were smart enough to flank you and completely destory you, then on my second playthrough the next difficulty setting, (i forgot the name) i barely used cover and instead use multiplayer/Max Payne one and two tatics, the game was SOOOO much more fun. I never got stuck except for a few parts and i did some AWESOME kills.

It never strays from its true roots, so fans of the style and gameplay have always been presented with a new and improved version of a game they loved from before.\n\nMax Payne 3 is more of the same - Being far superior to ME2 in terms of story, looks, style and combat - Just like ME2 was to ME1. If you were ever a fan of Max Payne, MP3 is worth the purchase just to get that fresh and more recent slice of fun, even if it shakes up the locations and style but doesn't really stray from what made the game Max Payne in the first place... This is also the negative side for 'some' who may have wanted something different - But maybe those few will be swayed by the fact MP3 has multiplayer - And a multiplayer that actually works very well. The only issue you can have with it is population of regular players, though despite me being very late to the MP3 party, I still managed to experience some fun MP games packed with people.\n\nAs for the campaign - Max is older, much like the game itself - And you will feel it. Bumping against walls, being less of a run and gun hero - Instead, more reserved, tactical. No matter your style, you will die. A lot. Even on normal. This will frustrate but not enough for it to bypass the frustration threshold that turns a game from 'must do better - I want to progress' to 'want to throw this game out of the f'ing window ugh!'\n\nIt has that right balance between repeat death to adapt and overcome, while you still have the tools to be a complete badass doing it. Spare painkillers? Good! That guy who just shot you point blank in the face with a shotgun is going to put you in last-man-standing mode, which will give you a second wind on those freak incidents where you find yourself overwhelmed out of nowhere.\n\nAll in all, MP3 is Max Payne - With enough bells and whistles to justify it being apart from the previous two, but not enough for it to not be Max Payne. Those who debate that the non-grim city dark environments detract from the noir underappreciate just how gorgeous this game looks and how you don't need to have a leather jacket wearing guy ranting in the rain of a gang infested american city all day for it to be Noir.\n\nBuy this game - Enter bullet time - Go shoot people in the eyesocket.

Story wise, it's good. Max is is as sardonic and bitter as ever, and his one liners tend to stick with you for a while. Max's original voice actor is still in this game, and he's still a fantastic fit, and the rest of the voice acting is solid. The story has some interesting twists and turns, but it can be confusing at times.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. This is easily the best looking game that Rockstar has made. Every sequence and cutscene is a visual treat filled with some great attention to detail, comeplete with being able to totally decimate an office with bullets.\n\nThe music and sound is great too. Great VA as said earlier, and the group HEALTH makes a great score for a game like this.\n\nThe gameplay is what makes this the best third person shooter I have played recently. The action  always keeps you moving, defying the annoying "keep in cover or die" trope. Mooks will flank you if you stay in one place, and the more you play like a psycho, the better you'll do. The game rewards you for risky behavior with Bullet Time, and man is it satisfying. Max still has the typical John  Woo moves, and they're complemented with shooting gameplay this is smoother than butter. The Multiplayer is just as good, and the Bullet Time still works there too.\n\nIn short, this is easily a 9/10, and it's always super cheap. Do yourself a favor and get the best game you've never played of 2012.","June 23, 2014","true","67.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are just amazing and the multi-player is setup extremely well as the developers have managed to find a fair and balanced way to implement epic ninja slow-mo dives out of windows, corners, ect into the multi-player which is very fun to use.\n\nTL:DR\nYou can do slow-mo ninja dives and shoot stuff. 8.5/10","August 21, 2014","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has some of the best graphics I've seen in any game ever and it really makes me surprised that it ran decently well on my computer (note that I clearly didn't have everything on max). I need to say that the game is pretty much as similar as it would be in the last Max Payne games, the only difference is that there are no more Graphic Novels and it depends too much on the cover system.

Its no longer in the dark setting of the streets of new york in winter, it now plays  in ♥♥♥♥ing Rio de Janero. Max Payne is no longer a cop, he's now a bodyguard for a wealthy family, but that does not mean he has stopped the drugs, the booze and the smokes. The story is about a gangster clan wich kidnaps the daughter of your boss. While Max risks his life often enough to find her, he discovers the streets and "background"-crimes of brazil and also a few plot twists about bad guys lying and ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is a bit thin compared to the previous games, especially those moments where you don't really care about a few important characters of the story.\n\nThe gameplay is very similiar to the previous games. Max shoots his way through tons of badies while using bullet time and pain killers, a very fun combination that has always worked good. One point is a bit sad though: You can only carry 2 handguns and a 2 handed weapon (and if you dual-equip the 2 handguns you actually drop your big gun). I personally think the massive amounts of guns you could carry and use whenever you wanted from the previous games were a better solution. Also there are no more grenades for you to use. Allllllso: no more quicksaving. A bit stupid if you have to fight the same hoard of enemies again and again :C\n\nThe game has a very high graphic standard. Most of the time you'll have high quality textures and good exploding effects. The voice acting is good, especially the monologues of Max burn into your memory. The soundtrack on the other hand is a "funky" version of the original soundtrack. I kind of dislike this, the "hawaii five-o"-theme song would probably been better...this is no longer a "sad" max payne, its a "depressed and angry" max payne in a zoo full of partying gay flamingos.\n\nConclusion: I recommend the game for the sake of having max payne gameplay, while I dislike most of the setting of the game. There are a few flashbacks that play in New York, but its just never the same anymore.","February 22, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The way bodies colapse and debris is kicked up adds to the atmosphere. Everything in this game feels real. Graphically, it looks very good. The environments are incredibly detailed, as are the characters and weapons. Storywise, it's pretty good to. Although it's not really linked to the previous 2 games in many ways (although it does tie in at times), the story (which I won't ruin) is relitavley compelling and wouldn't seem out of place in a movie, which is what this game feels and plays like - a full throttle action packed movie, and an amazing one at that.\n\nI honestly couldn't reccomend it more.","February 22, 2014","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Any shots that are not in the head feel like you're just wasting bullets.\n\nI'm not a fan of the checkpoint system and really miss any sort of quicksave and quickload options. It makes it significantly harder to optimize your play.\n\nThe control also feels a lot "looser" than previous Max Payne games.

It could even be a prequel to the original game explaining in detail why they went after and killed his family. The possibilies can be limitless!

However... I have come away with some mixed feelings...\n\nSo firstly what is Max Payne 3? Well you play as the Max in the title, an ex NYPD cop who after the events of the first two games finds himself with his wife and baby murdered, his best friend dead and another woman he grew to care about shot in the back. Sooo understandably, this leaves Max carrying some hefty emotional baggage around with him, a suitcase made of scar tissue, full of regrets.\n\nHe's life weary cynicism personified, he's been through too much.. seen too much and no matter how hard he tries to find redemption or a way out of his own internal pain... things just seem to get from bad to worse.\n\nMax Payne is probably the most apt name for a character ever conceived.\n\nHowever he is also hard as nails and a master of film noir metaphor, believe me you'll come away from this game with a gritty one liner for nearly any situation. For example...\n\nMax - “I didn’t know what to think any more. This town had more smoke and mirrors than a strip club locker room."\n\nUse that one next time your confused about something, it will be fine trust me.\n\nWe start the 3rd game with Max now out of the NYPD as I say, pretty much propping up a local bar in New Jersey and trying to find some answers in the bottom of a Whisky glass.\n\nDuring a drunken fight with some apparent hoodlums, Max tries to do the right thing... and ends up killing the only son of local mob boss Anthony DeMarco, who puts a price on his head.\n\nSo! It's off to Brazil for Max ..to a new life of private security, and the scene is set for Max Payne 3. Enjoy the sunshine!\n\nNow... about those mixed feelings I have.\n\nOn one hand this game oozes style. The gun play and fire fights just "look" cool and at times almost appear choreographed in the way they play out, it's quite a spectacle to behold. When you combine that with Max's gravel voiced narration and an attention to detail which only Rockstar can provide, the game can feel like you're in the middle of greatest action movie ever made, which is brilliant!\n\nOn the other hand, I really felt like it dragged on way too long and as a game it could have been over in half the time really. It introduces utterly nothing new after the first 5 minutes. Beyond different locations, different weapons and harder enemies you'll pretty much be standing in cover shooting bad guys, or doing the same but in slow motion, for roughly 10 hours.\n\nThe slow motion is excellent by the way. I did a short video of one sequence which might demonstrate, which is on my profile I'm sure.\n\nI'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, but paradoxically I'm not saying I did. The highs were few and far between for me, as were the lows, and for the most part I just went through the game shooting people in cool looking ways. Wading through bullet casings and stepping over dead bodies.\n\nThe story feels like it should take centre stage, but it doesn't, the gun battles is where the spotlight is firmly shone. The narrative technique is the same all the way through and the pacing is rigid in that in never changes. At no point did I feel like I was on the edge of my seat racing to climatic plot point.. or kicking back soaking up words to flesh out the story...\n\nThat isn't to say it isn't well acted, well animated or well written, it is. High production values are apparent throughout, and Rockstar have done a stellar job of making places seem real. Some of the locales are amazing in their detail, the airport level for example feels like an airport should.\n\nIts layout, the fake adverts on the walls, the sounds of the jets, the PA systems the baggage conveyor... just marvellous.\n\nAnd yet, with all this high praise, Max Payne 3 will remain an average game in my eyes, just because it was an average experience for me, which ultimately boiled down to the game lacking variety.\n\nWhether you love this game or not, as always, it's personal taste and in this case how much you love a cool gunfight.\n\nIt's good!

There are many moments in the singleplayer where you will say to yourself "This is the most bad ♥♥♥ thing I've seen from a video game." The story, the voice acting, is all Rockstar quality with all the trimmings.\n\nThe brilliant part about it is that this is not a port. This game runs perfectly with high resolution textures on max resolution and anti-aliasing at 60 FPS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BramRHCP/recommended/204100/","BramRHCP","Sikamixoticelixer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BramRHCP/","122 products in account","Gameplay\n\nMax Payne 3 differs a lot from the earlier entries. It feels a little faster paced, which does not make it worse or better. Of course bullet time has returned and it's better than ever before! Seeing bullets go through your foe's head slowly is very enjoyable! The main story is interesting enough to make you want to proceed and this game desperately needed that. The game is nothing more then shooting enemies and proceeding to the next area. The shooting part is great and there are many different ways to execute parts so that makes the game still fun to play. And to be honest, I didn't feel like it was as repetitive as it may sound. The cutscenes are very interesting and fun to watch with top-notch voice acting. After you complete the main story, which is around 10 hours. You have arcade mode and a great multiplayer mode to mess around with. Nothing too special but it does make the game last quite a bit longer!\n\nGraphics\n\nThis game looks amazing! even on the lowest settings most things still look very crisp and clean... well until you make another bloodbath of course Wink. Graphical wise this game amazed me. The only game I can think of with better looking graphics is L.A. Noire!\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer didn't do a lot for me, but it's solid. There are not that many maps, but the ones that are there are great. The way bullet time is implemented is great and works. Kudos for that. But all in all the multiplayer is just a solid experience, nothing that really blows your mind.\n\nStory\n\nThe story, just like the earlier entries, is told in an unique way which I personally really enjoy. The story really makes you care for Max and yes, it is definitely depressing. And the ending is also worth it. While all of this sounds like I'm amazed by it, I am not really, It's great, don't get me wrong. But the story falls short at some points. I had a few moments which I found a little cliché. But other than that the story is interesting enough to keep you playing.\n\nAddons\n\nThere is quite some dlc for the game. some DLC whilst being very cool, Is pretty expensive and you don't really get much in return in comparison. And I am very disappointed in one of the DLC's. Quote: " higher damage bullets in Max Payne 3 multiplayer". This makes purchasing DLC make you have an advantage in multiplayer which is not a good thing!\n\nValue\n\nThe price tag has dropped to roughly $35 for the complete pack on pc. The game is worth it. I have played it for aroun 65 hours and I don't think about playing it again anytime soon. So it's definitely worth the money!\n\nVerdict\n\nRockstar once again drops a solid game on the market. Though it has a few weak points nothing really makes the game unenjoyable or unplayable. It's even better if you play the first 2 entries in the series first just for the story's sake! I'd recommend this game to most people!","September 5, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't far too hard and not too easy. I first played on easy and it still gave me a challenge. I played on medium and it gave a more balanced challenge. Also the detail in this game is simply AMAZING. The game let's you explore alot, even though it isn't open world so that was pretty cool.\n\nI mostly liked this game for the gameplay due to the fact I've never played other Max Payne games, but as sure as hell this got me interested in the first two games. The story was pretty simple: Ex-cop is now a bodyguard who has alcohol and painkiller addiction is supposed to protect a rich family in South America. And obviously there is some problems on the way which lead to bigger problems. So the story was pretty easy to follow. Also I like the fact that it's narrated by Max and that's why everything tends to sound pretty cool.\n\nI can't find too much bad in this game expect the effects. All of those DARN effects in the cutscenes. I can't see the point in them! Those effects make me sick and make me want to throw up.\n\nFor short: An amazing game that makes me want to buy the older Max Payne games and also gives you a beautiful view of Sao Paulo.

Story wise, it does tell an interesting enough story to keep you engaged throughout the game with a bit of politics, the rich here, the poor there, etc. That said, it is nowhere near its predecessors; almost everything I love was taken away: The noire atmosphere, the stylist comic-like mission intros, the nightmares, hallucination, the rainy, pissy NYC nights...\n\nThe multiplayer mode - frankly, I don't care much about it - is okay; it has a level-up system with cool perks, character/weapon customization and a few modes for you to practice slo-mo shooting - yeah, slo-mo shooting in multiplayer mode.

The combat is so unique like nothing I have ever played before. The Single Player has a pretty decent story and good character development. The SP is the only good part of this game. I am about 6 hours into the story and it is an aboslute blast. The SoftLock combat is so precise and fun to play. The game gets quite addicting pretty fast. The multiplayer, however, is ♥♥♥♥. There is no point in buying the game for the multiplayer. The Season Pass is pointless, no one even plays the "Co-op" and the weapons included are just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the starter weapons. There are no more than 100 people online at a time and about 90% of those 100 people are all level 20-50's. So if you want to get good at the game, good luck. If you are going into this game expecting a fantastic multiplayer, you are going to being thoroughly disappointed. The only thing fun in multiplayer is to mess around with the Softlock capabilities, pretty much it.\nThe SP is the only highlight of the experience, and I give it a 8/10, for $3.99 (Autumn Sale) you should buy it. Do not buy the season pass unless  you want to waste your money, it is virtually useless since its all for the crappy multiplayer.","November 30, 2013","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not everything they touch change in gold, same goes for this game. Unskip-able cutscenes, linear and hardly anything new to show. Multiplayer should be okay now, but back then every game contained at least 1 cheater. And they ruin the fun. Doing timetrails WITH cutscenes is the worst part of this game. Couldn't have been done worse, and all the DLC is wortless if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that barely gives you anything to enjoy about.\n\nYou want to play co-op? You have to buy DLC for it. Played it a few times, Steam account was not linked to my profile that kept me from re-playing this game for 3 months. Rockstar support takes months for an answer. No thanks.. They didn't even grant free DLC to all people who still have problems running the game? Only buy this ♥♥♥♥ when it's cheap.

It has astounding graphics and so many different levels filled with amazing number of details. The action gameplay is maybe best in genre: cinematic picture and incredible bullet- and body-physics makes it extremely addictive. Although you may not like what Houser brothers did to a character, in the end its all makes sense: noir winter of the almost psychotic ex-cop with nothing to loose ----> noir autumn of the man who tried to start new life and who lost his newfound love for the second time ----> post-noir summer of tired old man, who just wanted to escape his past but was embroiled in viscous plot again.

According to the support site from rockstar. You have to use alternate form of controls. And that is only for that section of the game.\n\nReally ?? so its our fault .. your games doesnt work.. and we have to just cope with it.. you could just make a little patch that solves these issues,.\n\nAlso the thing with triggers,, the game works like you move on to a certain point, that will trigger a cut scene moving on to the next level.\nThe thing is.. Some do not work. and you keep moving around, untill you restart the level again and then it works.. ( talk about forced replay)\n\n( two days later )\n\nI really dont know what did happen here, but sometimes the game does start. but will hang on the title screen that says "Initializing" from there its stuck.\n\nThe only thing you can you at that time is "Force Quit" on your MAC. And if you might ever try to restart the game, it wil just ging you the icon of it poppin in try below and nothing more.\nSo you have to acually restart your pc. to try again.\n\nI got this game because it was a bargain, its from rockstar and i liked max paine. this ruins my day. spending all my day figuring out why it wont run. And thats not the idea of gaming, at least not mine.\n\nNo i know what "some" of you guys will say , buy a pc, macs arnt for gaming.\n\nIf rockstar tells me this thing works on a mac, then i try it. If they tell me " hey you can buy this but this wil not ever work on your mac" then its a different story\n\n\n( two weeks later )\n\nAfterdealing with the "initialising" issue and the fact that it would not even display the "social club" so i could log in.\n\nAnd some welkome help from collin G @ rockstar we got the game runnin again. And after playing more than its good for me i have to revise my review of this game.. ITS AWESOME.\n\nOkay you will encounter some bugs, but these are a really small thing in this big game.

On max settings it has to be one of the best looking games I have ever seen. As well as the graphics, Rockstar should be praised on the amount of detail this game has (though that shouldn't be a surprise). The game seems to be optimised very well, also. It runs very smoothly and is one of the more pleasant\nPC gaming experiences I have had.\n\nHaving never previously played any previous instalments in the Max Payne franchise, I picked up Max Payne 3 not knowing what to expect, but I do have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, and I do believe the game is worth its full retail price. If you can pick it up during a sale, then you're laughing. The gun controls in Grand Theft Auto IV are very sticky, but they have been fixed here, so no need to worry. Although it does have partial controller support, I would just use the mouse and keyboard as this title is not an open world game.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, well, it's not my thing, but I have played a little bit of it and I do appreciate it.

Add to this a distinct lack of a dark, snow-blasted New York City and the game fails to deliver the Noire-esque experience fans of the series had come to expect.\n\nWhat the game lacks however it makes up for in visceral, unforgiving gunplay and raw style.

However, I put my faith in Rockstar; and what a wait it has been. This is truly one of the best games I've ever played, I am an absolute fan of third person shooters and really love GTA and this is just incredible. The shooting, the bullet time, the metaphorical and amazing voice work by James McCaffrey is truly a work of art. I would advise anyone to buy this game, it'll get you addicted for many hours after the main story with the intense multiplayer action. I've completed every difficulty and done everything there is to the game, and I'm still playing the game, even after 100+ hours of play. I love it, and I think it still has the best shooting within a video game, better than anything imaginable, this is the sort of game that lives on forever and ever. Max Payne's life and story is so influential and heart aching that I feel like I am that character, that despite Max Payne's bad fortune, we all suffer in the same way he does. The depressing feeling of losing people all around you. The vengeance and anger we self contain, it is within us all and it's not going to stop the feelings you get from this game. Truly a work of art, and the narrative is so superb in the way that is done by James McCaffery that really nothing could compare.","November 26, 2012","true","137.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The combat is so unique like nothing I have ever played before. The Single Player has a pretty decent story and good character development. The SP is the only good part of this game. I am about 6 hours into the story and it is an aboslute blast. The SoftLock combat is so precise and fun to play. The game gets quite addicting pretty fast. The multiplayer, however, is ♥♥♥♥. There is no point in buying the game for the multiplayer. The Season Pass is pointless, no one even plays the "Co-op" and the weapons included are just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as the starter weapons. There are no more than 100 people online at a time and about 90% of those 100 people are all level 20-50's. So if you want to get good at the game, good luck. If you are going into this game expecting a fantastic multiplayer, you are going to being thoroughly disappointed. The only thing fun in multiplayer is to mess around with the Softlock capabilities, pretty much it.\nThe SP is the only highlight of the experience, and I give it a 8/10, for $3.99 (Autumn Sale) you should buy it. Do not buy the season pass unless  you want to waste your money, it is virtually useless since its all for the crappy multiplayer.","November 30, 2013","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not everything they touch change in gold, same goes for this game. Unskip-able cutscenes, linear and hardly anything new to show. Multiplayer should be okay now, but back then every game contained at least 1 cheater. And they ruin the fun. Doing timetrails WITH cutscenes is the worst part of this game. Couldn't have been done worse, and all the DLC is wortless if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that barely gives you anything to enjoy about.\n\nYou want to play co-op? You have to buy DLC for it. Played it a few times, Steam account was not linked to my profile that kept me from re-playing this game for 3 months. Rockstar support takes months for an answer. No thanks..

Story wise, it does tell an interesting enough story to keep you engaged throughout the game with a bit of politics, the rich here, the poor there, etc. That said, it is nowhere near its predecessors; almost everything I love was taken away: The noire atmosphere, the stylist comic-like mission intros, the nightmares, hallucination, the rainy, pissy NYC nights...\n\nThe multiplayer mode - frankly, I don't care much about it - is okay; it has a level-up system with cool perks, character/weapon customization and a few modes for you to practice slo-mo shooting - yeah, slo-mo shooting in multiplayer mode. Still, I couldn't get into it; guess I suck that much.\n\nPlease don't give up your hope just yet, like I mentioned earlier, Max Payne 3, in the end, is still a very good shooter.

A jogabilidade em alguns momentos me atrapalhou em vez de ajudar, mas como o bullet time é divertido do começo ao fim de qualquer jeito, isso não chegou a incomodar tanto.\n\nEnfim, dou 7,5.

According to the support site from rockstar. You have to use alternate form of controls. And that is only for that section of the game.\n\nReally ?? so its our fault .. your games doesnt work.. and we have to just cope with it.. you could just make a little patch that solves these issues,.\n\nAlso the thing with triggers,, the game works like you move on to a certain point, that will trigger a cut scene moving on to the next level.\nThe thing is.. Some do not work. and you keep moving around, untill you restart the level again and then it works.. ( talk about forced replay)\n\n( two days later )\n\nI really dont know what did happen here, but sometimes the game does start. but will hang on the title screen that says "Initializing" from there its stuck.\n\nThe only thing you can you at that time is "Force Quit" on your MAC. And if you might ever try to restart the game, it wil just ging you the icon of it poppin in try below and nothing more.\nSo you have to acually restart your pc. to try again.\n\nI got this game because it was a bargain, its from rockstar and i liked max paine. this ruins my day. spending all my day figuring out why it wont run. And thats not the idea of gaming, at least not mine.\n\nNo i know what "some" of you guys will say , buy a pc, macs arnt for gaming.\n\nIf rockstar tells me this thing works on a mac, then i try it. If they tell me " hey you can buy this but this wil not ever work on your mac" then its a different story\n\n\n( two weeks later )\n\nAfterdealing with the "initialising" issue and the fact that it would not even display the "social club" so i could log in.\n\nAnd some welkome help from collin G @ rockstar we got the game runnin again. And after playing more than its good for me i have to revise my review of this game.. ITS AWESOME.\n\nOkay you will encounter some bugs, but these are a really small thing in this big game. The graphics are very good, and the story is great..\n\n" and rockstar dint even pay me to say all that "","December 28, 2013","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of my favorite series ever in the history of ever! (heart) Minky Pinky for life! The story behind this game is compelling, the game play was as fluid and righteous as this diarrhea I got once and the graphics are so good I started making out with my screen. GET THIS GAME! PLAY IT! LOVE IT!\n\nOn to a more serious note: Follow your own path. Choose different role models. How can you relate to these silly video game characters? The person speaking such nonsense I guess has never been blessed enough to relate to someone so beautiful. Ever since my 360 red ringed I was pretty sad I couldn't play Max Payne 3... Max is more than polygons, pixels, zeroes and ones. Max Payne has been someone I respect and related to since I was young. To watch a man go from the perfect life to such a tragic downfall was a heartbreaking experience to witness. I was shielded from the emotional aspect of videogames. Crash Bandicoot and Spyro never once got an emotional response out of me, but Max was one of the first. Who would have thought that in my adult life I would take from his experience and learn that despite all the pain and hardships you can move on and do what you think is right in life. If the game can end with him being happy with himself as a person and the opportunity for more, why can't I think that way? If you have ever played Max Payne, you know the man has had some struggles and hard times. If you know anything about my life, you'd know I have faced many hardships as well. If Max can do it, so can I!","November 29, 2013","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Story wise, it does tell an interesting enough story to keep you engaged throughout the game with a bit of politics, the rich here, the poor there, etc. That said, it is nowhere near its predecessors; almost everything I love was taken away: The noire atmosphere, the stylist comic-like mission intros, the nightmares, hallucination, the rainy, pissy NYC nights...\n\nThe multiplayer mode - frankly, I don't care much about it - is okay; it has a level-up system with cool perks, character/weapon customization and a few modes for you to practice slo-mo shooting - yeah, slo-mo shooting in multiplayer mode. Still, I couldn't get into it; guess I suck that much.\n\nPlease don't give up your hope just yet, like I mentioned earlier, Max Payne 3, in the end, is still a very good shooter.

If you've played Grand Theft Auto IV, the style will be familiar, for this game and GTA4 share the same writer.\nOn a technical level, the game is polished to a mirror sheen. Rockstar has redeemed themselves when it comes to PC ports- the game has next to no technical flaws, the controls all work as intended, the graphics are beautiful, and the loadtimes are reasonably quick. The framerate remains a smooth 60, and for once, Max Payne 3 takes advantage of multiple cores and other oft-neglected features from day 1. Aim assist defaults to its "off" setting, greatly reducing aiming frustration and making shootdodges and bullet-time a blast.\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game for Max Payne veterans and newcomers alike.","August 2, 2012","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat model is pretty impressive (shooting from prone is particularly well done) , but does require a bit of getting used to it. I recommend doing a chapter or two dry run initially so you get used to using the bullet time mechanic and when to instigate it. Story doesn't really contain a huge amount of surprises to be honest, though the signposting isn't as egregious as in GTA IV, and overall the writing is as hard boiled as one would expect from a Max Payne game.\n\nThe game suffers from a couple of difficulty spikes in places, and the body count does get a tad ridiculous at times (New York could've done with a lot less targets overall I feel), however it is an action shooter so overboard numbers is to be expected.

He's a moody, drug and alcohol addicted detective...except in this one he is retired, and living in Sao Paulo, Brazil working as a security guard for the wealthy Bronco family.\n\nThis game is ultra story-heavy, with top-notch voice and motion capture working seamlessly together throughout the entire game. There is murder, there is mystery, there is heart-pounding suspense, and there is always a rainstorm of bullets being rained down upon you. I guarantee you a good time.\n\nIt has a fresh take on gun mechanics, improving upon the franchises already implemented control scheme. You can dual wield two single-handed weapons and carry one two-handed weapon at all times. You have a slow motion gauge that fills up from getting kills and you can use it while you run and gun, duck for cover, dive forward, backward, sideways, down stairwells, you name it - Max can do it if you can.\nThis installment also gives a new feature called "Last Man Standing" wherein someone shoots you fatally, you have until you hit the ground to find them on screen and shoot them, granting you a painkiller upon success.\n\nMax Payne 3 is a non-stop action thrillride that will have you playing until the end with sweaty palms.\n\nOther features include extra game modes: Score Attack - where you go through completed chapters racking up the most points as possible; New York Minute - you have one minute on the clock to complete each chapter...good luck.\n\nMultiplayer is functional, as of 5/27/15 I can still find games.","April 29, 2013","true","55.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole games just basically you shooting up people in Brasil and New Jersey in slo-mo bullet time which is very well done. This game is not easy even in the normal difficulty. I died a lot, a whole lot at first. It does feel easier if you replay it a second time because you get the hang of the shooting mechanics and the people spawn in the same general area. There also tons of cimematic parts that just blew my mind. So I can't say anything bad about the gameplay.\nThe story was great too.

I'm playing the story again I enjoyed it so much. The detail that has been put into this game is breath taking, the levels do not appear lifeless and empty as in many games. For example, the favelas in Max Payne 3 appear to have been designed brick by brick unlike in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 where buildings are designed to be ran past and nothing more. Shoot dodge I love and I have developed a tendency to just use it whenever because it is so cool. As I said at the beginning, is excellent.

I looked out from my personal hell to see something truly terrifying. That was the local goodwill. The cesspit of forgotten dreams picked up by the new age of the hip young generation. I took 4 seconds to open a door. Then, I took another 4 seconds to open a few more doors. I went straight to the gadgets and gizmos section and there it was for $3.99. Poor soul must have been priced by an elderly woman who lost both her arms to Marfan syndrome. As I started intently at the box is almost spoke to me. There I was living the American Dream with a cheap copy of Max Payne 3 under my belt. Booted the disk in the old toaster. But my mind was in so many places. All these years of glancing back at the past and never looking and the disaster that played out right in front of me. In a haze, I couldn't enter the product key and the box sat there like a narwhal with a couple extra kidneys squirming around out of water as a means of entertainment. But when the steam sale ship was in full motion giving more and more money to the high and mighty crippling the weak, like an advertisement on a late night TV show for finacial compensation that comes with 4 free copies of the final season of Weeds ripped off Jeffrey Dahmer's hard drive covered in the remorseful tears of a suicide bomber who works for a religious cult that believes Tex Murphy is secretly Tim Blake Nelson, who got drunk and dressed like Indiana Jones after rewatching ♥♥♥♥ Tracy 32 times but instead of ♥♥♥♥ Tracy the main character was a cardboard cutout of Billy Mays with the voice of that guy from the shamwow TV ads. As I waited for the game to download I noticed that it was taking an awfully long time like watching pieces of cheese try to reproduce through osmosis. I decieded to get a drink, and another, and another, and before I knew it my life was in a downward spiral. Life told me to accept social club. But Life never accepted me. It was one uninstall and that was it. There was no hope for me. I opened a few doors, and then I opened some more doors and yelled at people because I was dark and gritty feeling like the Tequilla was taking a toll on my like Charlie Sheen does to my neighbors' fouton when he's taken time out of his day to sell drugs to government agents. This was my experience... but now it's my life\n\n(TL;DR: If you like lots of cutscenes and nonsense about talking to yourself along with the most satisfying gunplay ever you should try this game as long as social hub isn't being its awful self)","April 6, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This setting is Rockstar´s perfect opportunity to boast some incredibly detailed scenarios and astounding lighting effects, not to mention Max´s life-like reactions and breathtaking cinematics.\n\nThe story, while engaging from the get-go, does get somewhat muddled by the end, with several different names flying by without giving you a second to give a face to them, but then again, the story has always shared this trait in the previous offerings. What never gets old are Max´s quirky remarks dotted throughout the 12-hour-long campaign, which have become a trademark of the cop´s adventures. The visual design works wonders with the narrative feel, as key words are highlighted when a cutscene hits, giving the title a distinct feel above other, more generic third person shooters.\n\nOf course, what would Max Payne be without bullet time? Dead, that´s what. But fear not, because this aspect which made the first two games so appealing is back, now packed with more over-the-top situations in which to try it out. A cover sistem has been introduced for the first time, and it feels way more natural than just standing behind corners like a big ol´ chump the Max from nine years ago did. Also, this time you actually see your character taking painkillers, instead of just magically regenerating your health for no apparent reason. These cool new features, added to the increase in guns and varied level design, give the title at hand a new dose of realism, to the point you actually feel this guy could totally exist in the real world.\n\nLast, and most probably least, is the multiplayer portion. While it carries over the amazing slo-mo kills and over-the-top action, it can´t help but feel tacked-on, a way to lengthen the game´s overall duration, but definitely not in a good way. It does provide a fun few hours, but that´s probably all you will spend in it.\n\nOverall, Max Payne 3 is an amazing experience, proving Rockstar is not only the master of open-world games, but also really good at trying its hand at relentless, third-person action. It could use a bit of tweaking here and there, and the multiplayer portion could have been better implemented, but that shouldn´t distract you from what this game really is: a fantastic, dazzling, non-stop thriller which will grab hold of you and won´t let go until you see it through.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Intriguing, if somewhat muddled, story\n+ Fantastic audiovisual design\n+ Max´s character, a fascinating insight into one of gaming´s most beloved anti-heroes\n+ Bullet-time and all the spectacle it provides\n+ Social Club integration\n+ Voice acting is once again top-notch\n\nCons:\n\n- Lackluster multiplayer\n- Some of Max´s remarks don´t quite impress like they used to back in the day\n- A co-op mode would have been gratefully accepted\n\nFinal grade: 9.4 (Amazing)\n\n","July 6, 2014","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good action. Plenty of options to get it for a good price.\n\nThe mechanics and controls on the game are solid.  The weapons handle (for the most part) well except for a few that make you zoom down the sites.  The game was ment with 3rd person looking like a badass in mind so its easy to see where the POV guns dont work well.   However if you are looking for "realistic" gunplay go look somewhere else. This should be obvious if you know anything about the bullet time inducing Max Payne series, but sometimes it actually made me laugh.   Plenty of times I was inches away from death from a fireing squad of assult rifles or machinegun nest only to be saved by the few plywood boards at my back.  Made me chuckle.\n\nThe story is top notch and the facial expressions and voice acting are all very well done.   Some of the plot can be a bit predicable and some of the actions from the characters dont make sense, but these are not characters known for thinking out situations.  Thats apart of the fantasy of this game.  Get in and get to shooting is what this is about.\n\n","September 15, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
