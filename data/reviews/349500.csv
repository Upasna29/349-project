Here it is:\nToo expensive for its quality, weird for a game that beat KickStarter (1.6k) to have default textures everywhere. If it was cheaper, then I would recommend it.\n\nAbout it It's a 2D Game made on RPG Maker about a guy that is deep in debt and depression and with a very boring job.\nYou will fix your problems (most of them with money) through RPGly battles and adventures through the game's map.\n\nThe game tends to break the 4th Wall quite often (Maids knowing they don't do anything or that they look all the same and character in-game talking about Nintendo and grinding gold on WoW - although the latter doesn't seems to be 4th wall, but I found it worth mentioning.)\n\nFeatures You will walk around in some confusing maze-dungeon-trap with random spawning monsters coming out of thin air all the time, fight them and proceed to walk for more 15s before getting into fight again (Like Cthulhu Saves The World, but in lesser quality)\nThere are chests around the mazes, and most monsters are incredibly powerful, taking a bit of a time to deal with them (Job Police), that will have some special items such as Job sheets or Self-esteem spells.\n\nPros +1 It's nice fighting your problems as RPG.\n+1 Takes a while to finish, although that may be related to confusing mazes other than tons of content.\n+1 Beat a boss, win a promotion (That's as far as I got into the game, though!)\n+1 The main menu's background is cool.\n\nCons -1 The entire game is made with standard (aka default) textures that come with RPG Maker, weird for a game that beat Kickstarter ($1.6k)\n-1 It doesn't even look like it has custom (aka community made or selfmade) scripts.\n-1 Game's OST doesn't seem to fit the game, looks like RTP (RPG Maker Default Material) OST\n-1 The game's price is.. too high. I mean, $9.99 for a RPG Maker game with no custom textures (EYE CANDY11!)\n-1 Most characters' dialogues are boring and dull.\n\nSigh.. I hate when I have to do this. Rate a game negatively, but it happens.\nI don't recommend you buying this game for $9.99, but $4.99 or $3.99 would do it.","February 25, 2015","false","6.8"," 282 of 330 people (85%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","85","282","330","17","19"

It's a clever and unique idea I haven't really seen done like this before.\n\nToo bad it's ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING to play.  Nothing is explained.  There is no direction.  You will never figure out what the hell anything does. What is this status effect?  What am I getting hit with?  How am I supposed to block it?  What does this spell/item/menu/building/area/character/monster/boss/effect/investment/weapon/armor/accessory/insert-any-gameplay-element-can-think-of-here do?  You'll spend the whole time asking yourself these questions, and unfortunately you're the only one who's ever heard of this game before so you're not exactly going to find the Prima strategy guide for it.\n\nI would describe the gameplay best as "wander aimlessly until you find the one path where monsters don't one-hit kill you, reconfigure and redo battles until you randomly find a configuration that let's you not get irredeemably reamed," When you're ready to finish the game, go to bed over and over so the main plot devices just resolve themselves.  Either that or you can go fight the last boss.  Because he's there.  And because stabbing him makes credits roll.  I guess that's reason enough.\n\nAlso there is a horrible hole under a tower with a knight that casts death (I guess?) on every single party member up to eight times every single round.  There's no indication what's actually happening and I've found no combination of gear that gives you any defense against it.  All I know is there's a 100% chance that knight will slap seven shades of ♥♥♥♥♥ out of you at any level.  So have fun with that nightmare.\n\nThis was supposed to be leisure time; WHY AM I SO ANGRY?!","June 17, 2015","false","20.9"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","37","45","9","1"

RPGs live or die on their writing and this one has both clever writing and a quirky, engaging premise. Unfortunately that's been wrapped up in stock RPG Maker graphics and music.  More originality in those areas would go a very long way.  As it is, the game seems very much worth playing, as it definitely entertains.  I'd recommend it at the less than a dollar sale price point.\n\nAs for the people complaining about where the Kickstarter money went.... The guy didn't even make enough to pay my rent for a month and clearly detailed where it all went, including paying a couple of people for some original assets. It still wasn't dven enough to compensate for the creative work he had done if he had kept it all. It can clearly be seen itemized out on his Kickstarter page.\n\nDoes Cubicle Quest need work? Yes.\nDoes it detract from the game? No.\nIs it still fun? Yes.\n","January 3","true","1.0"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hybrinoid/recommended/349500/","hybrinoid","Hybrinoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hybrinoid/","113 products in account","Cubicle Quest, gameplay-wise, is a standard JRPG with turn-based combat, the likes of which RPG Maker VX Ace is designed for. It follows the story of a man named...well...whatever you want to name him (let's go with Pantsinestro). Pantsinestro is neck-deep in debt, and it's your job to get him out of it.\n\nThis is where the game differs itself in terms of actual gameplay--monsters don't drop gold, so your only way to get money is to get promotions and cut down on spending...or, in gameplay terms, go through dungeons and fight the bosses within to prove yourself worthy of getting a higher pay. You advance the months by going to bed, which gives you your monthly income and restores your HP and MP, but it also piles more debt on you, since those loans have interest rates attached to them. Since there is no way to recover your HP and MP for free besides advancing the months, this creates an interesting ticking-clock element where you have to make the most of each month, leveling up and getting more income as efficiently as possible without wearing yourself down (or spending too much money on healing items).\n\nThe thing most people seem to complain about is the art and music. Yes, the game uses the default RPG Maker graphics and sound, but to be honest, it doesn't hamper the game all that much. It's annoying, but the gameplay and humor shine through enough to make the annoyance of default assets practically irrelevant.\n\nSpeaking of the humor, it may or may not be your cup of tea, but I like it. It's almost Earthbound-esque, if Earthbound broke the fourth wall even more often. The characters often question game mechanics and point out things that only make sense in games (like the "NPC Racist" maid in the trailer), and while I'm usually a fan of the fourth wall staying just how it is, it managed to get a few laughs out of me.\n\nOf course, this game isn't perfect. There are some annoying balance issues, especially with some enemies in a dungeon being far more powerful than others in the same dungeon. The game recommends you save often in different files, and I wholeheartedly agree--death can come from the most unexpected of places. One example of this is near the beginning of the game, in the first dungeon. The random encounters I'd faced up to that point were mostly fine, except for one enemy (Idle Whim, I think. It looks like a spider) who dealt frankly absurd damage compared to his allies, but one of my random encounters was against an enemy who appeared fairly normal at first. His attacks did trivial damage, but he had more health than the others in the dungeon, so we traded blows for a while. Suddenly, a couple turns before I would've killed him, he performed a massive attack that did more damage than my entire HP capacity at that point. The attack wasn't telegraphed, it wasn't forewarned, it just happened and killed me. So, like I said, save, or else you might be killed by some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (I should note that I only saw this guy once--I never encountered him again, even traveling across the same square, so it's possible you won't have to deal with him. Just be forewarned--if you're in the first dungeon and you encounter a massive knight, RUN!)\n\nTL;DR: it's funny, charming, and has a unique financial system. Don't dismiss it from the graphics alone. Yes, there are some balance issues and the price tag is a *bit* high, but I completely recommend it if it's on sale. Even if it isn't, I recommend it...just, y'know, less so.","March 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

The game plays just like an old RPG like final fantasy (reminds me of the turnbased combat and world exploration), and , but the art style does seem generic. The story of Cubical Quest is a huge joke on everyday life. A few examples of this are: Your party members are called roommates, the enemies have ironic names (Trivial Relationship, Fear of intimacy), beating a boss gives you a “promotion”, and the big bad is the Debt Alliance. The game even is self-aware and references real life things. Ex: “To comply with Nintendo censorship standards, I am required to say the substance in the bottles behind me is juice.” And “Hello there, cliché RPG child running in circles.” Cubical Quest isn’t innovative, but the comedy/jokes/self-references make this game very entertaining. The huge issue for me is all of the sprites seem very generic and out of place. (Fear of Intimacy is a green bat gargoyle thing)\nPros\nSelf-aware jokes\nTypical fun old school RPG gameplay\nGreat comedy\nUnique items/upgrades\nEverything references real life problems (self-esteem, paperwork, and whine)\nComedic look at the “everyday” life in the form of an old RPG\n\n\nCons\nGeneric sprites\nNot many graphic options\nNo voice acting\n\n\nConclusion\nCubical Quest is an old school RPG that creates a unique comedic look at everyday life. The game’s assets do seem generic, but the funny dialogue and good old RPG gameplay make up for the generic seeming assets. If you are a fan of the old RPG games, this is definitely a game you should pick up.\n\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/recommended/349500/","shonaningyo","ShonaNingyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/","215 products in account","Spoiler: This game is fun as hell.\n\nCubicle Quest is a fantastic RPG that simulates the state of American college-age adults who have found themselves wrapped in debt in their attempts to integrate into society as new blood of the system. Student loans, the encroaching horror of a fate spent at a dead-end job, and the difficulties of asserting independence plague you, the adventurer.\n\nI don't mean to sound ethnocentric, but I believe that someone not native to the US and who hasn't lived in the country or has any friends to correspond with will find this game bizarre-turned-horrifying upon realizing that this game perfectly emulates the reality for millions of Americans (minus the monster-fighting, of course) especially from cultures like Western Europe's that have indoctrinated their citizens into a system that places important emphasis on education without requiring one to sell their soul in order to pay off loans and debt.\n\nI recall that my French Professor who teaches literature frequently expresses her lividity towards us Americans who need to work five jobs and downscale our diets to eating ♥♥♥♥ (newsflash: Ramen is ♥♥♥♥ing bad for you) in order to make meager dents into our student debts.\n\nEnough politics and cultural comparisons, though.\n\nThis game is real life. In fact, I think it would do all prospective college-bound adults and those already in college to give this game a try. For those who are afraid of the horror stories that people tell you about debt and obligations and the juggling of responsibilities, this will put a face on such abstract concepts. It will still be harrowing, but at least the metaphor will serve you better than no mental image at all.\n\nFor us currently-enrolled students, this will be a fun and painfully true experience of where we currently are in life while offering laughs, parodies, and dare I say it, hope. Superficial hope--I mean, beating virutal monsters and waving your Book of Diet isn't going to really help you in the real world--but at least it gives you the confidence that if you square yourself off against each "foe" you'll be able to truck through, hopefully.\n\nJust know that despite how difficult the time period of your life is that this game captures, you have support of your professors, teachers, parents (hopefully), and even more hopefully, colleagues that know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about. It is overwhelming to be sure, but it's all about tackling each goal step-by-step.\n\nEnough pep talk. Play this game. If not for the RPG elements then for the RPG style that analogizes real life. Freaking fun, this game is.\n","April 3, 2015","true","16.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","1"

I *really* like this game.  It's not without flaws, but a very fun experience.  The question you have to ask yourself is "am I okay with a game that is a big self-referential allegory?"  You arm yourself with goals, and armor yourself with a community of friends.  Enemies are life challenges.  In this game you will fight a succubus sprite labeled as "empty relationship", you will arm yourself with your goal of "read more books", and defend yourself with "drinking buddies".  if this bothers you, this is not the game for you.\n\nShort version: 8.5/10 strongly recommend to anyone who likes turn based JRPGs, and wasn't completely turned of by the premise.\n\nInterestingly many of the games strengths are also its weaknesses:\nPros/Cons:\n+ The battle system is interesting, but manages to not be as tedious as a lot of games that add extra random battles to pad game length.  Characters are largely not customizable, but the fact that you get a fairly large number means your party *is*.  Skills are varried enough that you have meaningful decisions in combat.\n- As with any turn-based JRPG type game, sometimes you're just hitting "attack" very quickly to kill weak enemies.\n-The game's allegorical nature sometimes makes things confusing.  I never had problems in other games making the connection that "lava breath" was a fire attack, but with attack types like "stress" and "laziness" it can sometimes be hard to pick out what attacks are doing, and the game isn't terrible forthcoming with the information\n+ Music and sound is pretty generic, but very enjoyable.  I often mute games and play music, but I didn't for this one\n+ I rather like the story, but I could see some people just not really "getting" it\n+ A fun collection of characters to meet.\n- All the characters are pretty one dimensional.  Making friends, offering emotional support, and forming relationships are all core concepts to this game, so I feel like it could have used some more robust characters.  This isn't mass effect/Lornen/Dragon age\n+ A surprisingly open world (gated somewhat like a metroidvania), that lets you figure out where you want to go and what you want to do.\n- Sometimes it's very hard to figure out what to do.  For instance when you start the game you're in debt, and you need to find a room mate and get a promotion at work.  What the game doesn't tell you is that the dungeon of promotion is basically impossible with a 1-man party, so you need to do them specifically in the room mate-> promotion order, unless you spend an hour or two grinding on the world map\n- There's also one or two areas I had trouble accessing.  Fortunately since the game is so open I didn't *need* to get into them, but it was still frustrating.\n","May 25, 2015","true","18.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

Enemies are savagely overpowered with attacks that kill you in one hit, the enemies are also inconsistant with one lvl 3 enemy appearing after a group of five lvl 7s ? I spent atleast an hour just wandering with my party and fighting random enemies to try to level my party up but the game is super tight with XP. When I did reach a decent level I fought the 'boss' (a promotion) who immediately killed every member of my party with the first special attack....so back to wandering around trying to fight a game that feels like its preventing you from actually progressing.\nAfter three hours of levelling up I managed to fight the 'boss' again and won....yay. But now I have to start the process again as that lead to around 7 new 'boss'/quest fights appearing in game, all of whom I cant fight without being wiped out in seconds. Thats when I gave up, wandering the same part of the map while fighitng the same enemies bored the crap out of me and the whole story of how the game was made (Kickstarter for $1000+ that ends with a RPG Maker templated game) makes it worse.

Below I list my biggest problems:\n1)  The characters are very unbalanced, 70% of the enemies are personal enemies and one party member you can find learns the best skills versus that enemy type.\n2)  Your defense never rises at a very fast rate meaning enemies later on do upwards to 2k damage to you with one attack if not more.\n3)  The superbosses even at lv 40+ are all still pretty difficult, I can't seem to beat the final version of the guardian of time, social judgement, or the 2nd form of the social expenses monster, among other pains\n\nOverall despite it's foibles it's pretty good so if it goes on sale for $1 or 2 again I'd say go for it it's pretty entertaining.\n","December 3, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no specific mission or anything. You just need to try and be financially successful and for that you must face monsters that represent all the problems a guy like that would have (like 4 hours pointless meetings, relationship problems, spending too much on gadgets...). The sense of humour and the way the game makes fun of rpg cliches is a great reason to give it a try. If you get some discount try it out for some laugh at how it really represents well things in life.\nOnly bad thing is not being able to turn off the music...","May 13","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
