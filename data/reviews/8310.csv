The characters look about like you'd expect.\n\nNegatives: It's tedious and boring, making it feel much longer than the short runtime.\n\n'Bone' is one of my favorite books (graphic or otherwise) ever.  It's a wonderful fantasy adventure.  I also enjoy TellTale's games (though they aren't perfect).  So I should love this, right?  I wish.\n\nEvery task you're asked to complete is clearly busy work.  None of the "puzzles" is truly driven by the story.  They're just hoops to jump through in order to get to the next screen.  The worst offender is when you're asked to guide Ted the bug across the river.  Without a walkthrough, I never would have gotten across as the logic dicated by the pattern of his jumps breaks down when you get close to the other side.  It looks like I should be able to make the jumps necessary as the stones are spaced just like rest, and I tried multiple spots to lead from, but there is only one single way to get across, and if you don't follow it, it won't allow you to make the jumps.\n\nAn additional crime, less painful but still aggravating, is the inability to skip voiced dialogue.  I can generally read the text much faster than the voice actor will deliver it, and when I'm in the middle of an extended Q&A, I want to get it over with as soon as possible.  But perhaps that's my impatience with the overall game.  I just wanted to be done and wished I could speed up any little bit of it.  This lack of skipability carries over into the end credits.  They're slowly scrolled and, for some heinous reason, quadruple spaced.  And you... can't... skip them.\n\nTo be fair, the early sections of the book are relatively uneventful, but maybe that should have been a sign to TellTale.  'Bone' would make a phenomenal animated movie, but videogames are an interactive medium, and that interaction needs to feel meaningful.  The source material here, as much as I love it, doesn't bear the weight of player interaction.\n\nUnless you're the most die-hard fan of TellTale's games, skip this one.  Fans of the book?  Stay away.","September 23, 2013","false","2.2"," 76 of 87 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","76","87","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/8310/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","Telltale's first adventure game is a fairly short, graphically charming game which is clearly aimed at children. The humour would appeal to young kids and the puzzles are pretty easy. The minigames can be skipped if anyone finds them too difficult. It's not a great game, but it's not terrible either. Others have mentioned bugs, but apart from two moments of silence when characters should have been speaking, I didn't encounter any.\n\nThe pace of the game is quite slow, characters move ponderously and dialogue can't be skipped. For a point and click adventure there aren't that many things to click on. There are very few objects to find and even fewer puzzles that require using those objects. The game is mainly dialogue driven with lots of talking and is very linear, interspersed with set piece games and puzzles. These are quite simplistic and frankly I found them rather tedious, although kids would probably enjoy them.\n\nI would not recommend this game for adults, but I would recommend it for the audience it was clearly intended for, young children.\n\nEDIT: It's not obvious from the title, but this game is Act 1 of a two part series. The Great Cow Race is Act 2, so they should be played in order. Unfortunately the story is not complete, they should have made more episodes but didn't.","January 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","7"

It had great characters, an interesting plot, and an expansive world and mythology. Now all these factors should translate well into a game, right? Sadly, Telltale did not live up to the comic with this game.\n\nFirstly, it is a point-and-click game. While in theory this would work in favour, there is just not enough to observe in the enviorments. It's a rather empty game, lacking in atmosphere and inspiration. The dull voice-acting doesn't help at all. There are several moments where the game transitions to a sort-of "mini-game" mode, and these segments do not work at all. They're unclear, dodgy in response, and attribute nothing to the experience.\n\nAll in all: Stick to the comic-book.

The characters and locations are here, but they don't feel genuine.\n\nI'd recommend this only to die-hard Bone fans, or maybe children who have somehow discovered Bone but aren't old enough for the books yet.\n\n[There's also an inventory glitch that prevents you from progressing past Gran'ma Ben's farm.

This game is no different from the other Telltale series (Sam n' Max, Strong Bad, etc.).  The humor is abundant, and is appropriate for most age ranges (alcohol and tobacco use).  The puzzles are intuitive, but not overly simple.  The crisp graphics helps alleviate from tedious pixel hunting.  The overall difficulty isn't too hard, and the game length is relatively short.  I completed it in about two hours.  There isn't any hidden bonuses like there are in Strong Bad.  Very straight forward.

Animations are dull and lifeless, especially facial animations are bland, voices are off, and where the game could add to the Bone universe, either by telling the story from a different perspective, or showing other inhabitants affected by the tale, it tries to tell a shortened version of the story in the comics.\nGame play is point and click, with 2 chase sequences that you can skip, most of the tasks are tedious chores, but nothing outrageous bad.\n\nFor its humble asking price it’s well worth the money, and considering when it was released, it’s not a bad nor an ugly game.\n\nYou can skip dialogue by pressing “space”.","October 9, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As it is, Out From Boneville feels pretty unfinished, as if it didn't even make to the polishing phase. Altogether this seems to be more of a proof-of-concept adventure for the TellTale engine. From design (protagonists' models and movements are somewhat similar to Max's) and voice actors (e.g. main protagonist's voice is Sam's) I'd say this adventure was done to show the Sam & Max adventures could be done, which incidentially are what I would recommend everyone to play way before touching this game.\n\n+ It's an adventure\n+ TellTale engine: 3D world, camera 'following' the player\n+ Good voice acting: David Nowlin (Sam) and other voices from TellTale's Sam & Max\n\n- Way too short and still somewhat boring\n- Story almost completely developed in introduction cutscene\n- Awful controls in action sequences\n- Skipping dialogue parts may skip more than can be read at the time\n\nThe story builds little momentum, mainly driven by the introduction cutscene and by some pieces of dialogue that appear disconnected at times. And the first act is over in nearly no time.\nPuzzles are very easy. Basically it's combining the few things you find with the environment, the main obstacle here is finding items as they are not highlighted in any way (which I'm fine with). Other times your current objective is helped by dialogue.\nThere are three scenes with their own puzzle mechanics - labyrinth, hide and seek - which is nice.\n\nUsing items inconsistently makes the mouse cursor that object or the standard 'use' cursor.\n\nThere are two very bad third-person action sequences in which you have to escape whatever follows you. They are bad because your control options - jump, go left, go right (as opposed to turn left or right) - are executed with the mouse and the left-right movement control is nothing close to tight. There is no indication as to how far you just moved the character before it stops moving in that direction which can feel pretty long after you let go of your mouse and make you run into obstacles - not fit for reaction sequence. Both sequences are short but not short enough to not bore. Then again you can simply fail them after which the game offers to skip them.\n\nPersonal preference: I don't like it when the played character, one of two, behaves like a prick, more so if that interferes in no way with completing objectives. Maybe that's why the 'protagonists' are from Boneville.\n\nI may recommend this act after playing the next one as piece of the overall experience but I don't expect the second part to take it away.\nFor now, I don't recomment Out From Boneville.","July 5, 2014","false","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Did they start off with a bang or did they screw it up entirely ? In Bone out from boneville we take controll of two charecters. Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. We take controll of the characters after they get kicked out of theyre home town and travel across the land to find somewhere to live but after they get attacked by Locust they split up and they need to find each other. So how is Bone Out from Boneville ? This game is actually pretty good. The game is not like the other Telltale games where the story progress by itself. Theres tons of puzzles to solve. But there are some problems with the game as well. There are very annoying puzzles in the game. The game is also quite buggy and theres a problem where the charecter doesnt go where you want him to go. Overall the game is alot of fun and for the first telltale game its quite impressive. Great story. Awesome puzzles (excluding the possum one) and great art style. Just a few problems like minor bugs and thats pretty much it. Without a doubt give Bone Out From Boneville a try.

Jeff Smith wrote a five book graphic novel series of pure epicness. The games have a little smaller of a thrill. They are nowhere as good as the books, but they are still good. Bone: Out From Boneville follows the story rather well. My biggest complaint is that its too easy. I turned off hints because it wasn't that hard. I only got stuck once without the hints, and it wasn't even that hard of a thing, I just got confuzzled. Even the mini games in this one aren't too hard. Of course, there is also a locust chase at the beginning where you get caught in a swarm of locusts. You run away, and use basic monuveres by moving the mouse back and forth and left clicking to jump. You do the same game style later in the game when being chased by rat creatures. The dialogue tree things aren't that hard either. With your dialogue tree, you have basic conversation and its pretty obvious what to say, depending on what is going on and what character you are. In this game, being the first, out of the three main characters (Fone Bone, Phoncible P. Bone 'Phoney Bone', and Smiley Bone) You only get to play as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. YOu also get to play as a talking, leaf-shaped bug named Ted for a mini game where you hop across rocks. It is too quick of a game. For me, seeing how I played it and beat it before I got it on steam, it only took me two hours to beat. FOr a newbie with a sensible head on their shoulders, 3 hours to 4 hours. Overall, it is a great experience. I'd recommend the game. I give it a 7 out of 10. It has some pros, but mostly cons.","August 31, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is Telltale's first game ever! Cut them some slack! Anyway, this is what you would expect from Telltale, point-and-click greatness. It basically follows the Bone series of graphic novels made by Jeff Smith. The series ran from 1991 to 2004 and DAMN were these good books. But the game however..is lacking. As expected from Telltale's first game, this one isn't as long as say, TWD or BTTF. No, this won't take very long. The graphics fit the feel of the comics to a t, and features voice acting to go with it. Everyone sounds on par to me, just how I would imagine them in the comics. Although, Grandma Ben and Smiley Bone can get on your nerves real quick. But other than that, both the graphics and voice acting are decent. However, the puzzles, as explained in previous reviews, are what break the pacing. Finding the possum kids was a snoozefest in itself, and guiding Ted through the river was a hellish ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. I swear to God if it wasn't for a guide for a game aimed at 7-11 year olds, I would have been stuck there for HOURS. Yes, there are some crashing issues and bugs, but that did not stop me from enjoying this gem. Recommended for fans of the comics? Yes. Recommended for fans of the Telltale games? Well...that's all up to you.\n\nPros: Captures the feel and look of the graphic novels beautifuly. +\nFound myself chuckling at more than one occasion. +\nDecent graphics. +\n\nCons: Incrediblely short. -\nVoice acting is hit or miss. -\nAwful puzzles. -\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 6/10\nRECOMMEND: FANS OF THE COMICS: YES.\nFANS OF THE TELLTALE GAMES: NO.","January 10, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game starts and ends fairly strong and the whole game is consistent with the book, a little too well. One major issue is that the entire game focuses on Fone Bone and while that's all well and good, the book took time to show the development with the other characters as well, and although you do get to spend some playing time playing as Phony Bone (sorry, I lied earlier), It never felt as strong as it could have been.\nIs this a good game? Only if you've read and really enjoied the Bone books, like I did. Otherwise, it isn't a game, it's an interactive storybook that's done better than most of the interactive storybooks from my childhood (even green eggs and ham but then again, green eggs and ham didn't have rat creatures chasing after you).\nIt's good, but not fantastic, the voice actors threw me off and the character models aren't the best. Not to mention the end wasn't as strong as it could have been since (spoilers) we had no introduction to the mysterious figure, which I might add was introduced in the book in a segmanet that was touched on in the book. That left the ending very confusing as if we were missing a section of the story, which we were.\nAnyway, I give this "game" a 6/10 if you love the bone books\n5/10 if you liked them\nand a 4/10 if you're unfremilar.\nAs a remind, this is my own oppionon, I could be compleatly wrong. But I feel that if TellTale ever made a remake, It would be tons better than this game was.","February 9, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The two Telltale-developed Bone point-and-click adventures don't play nice with Microsoft's latest muck up.\n\n1) Both Bone games crash unless you delete prefs.prop from each directory.\n2) The games will continue to crash if fullscreen mode is selected.\n3) Resolution settings are limited, meaning -- depending on your screen size and resolution -- the window is nigh unplayable.\n3b) To solve this, a third-party application needs to be downloaded (http://www.wsgf.org/article/tell-tale-games-custom-resolution-tool).\n\nFinally, I was able to start and play the game. I love how it captured the look and spirit of the Bone comic series, one of my all-time favourites. The interface and movements are significantly clunkier than in modern Telltale games, so definitely take that under advisement.\n\nAfter a while, I decided to save and quit. The reason? I found that Steam's screenshot tool wasn't working, possibly due to the custom resolution tool, and I enjoy snapping shots of my games. Anyhow, I reset the resolution and booted the game up again.\n\nIt couldn't find my save.\n\nAt that point, I decided enough was enough. I really do think that the games, at least an hour in, respect the source material. Unfortunately, I may never know if that continues. Seeing as I doubt this game will ever be patched to play nice with this awful operation system (after all, it's not like Steam is GOG -- they don't care), I simply have to rate it down and move on. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to play it again someday but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nI guess I'll just read the comic again when I need to get my fix for Jeff Smith's wonderful characters, story, and world.
