"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/352140/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Finders is the latest of Alawar Entertainment's simulation games to find its way onto Steam.  Although a bit more casual than I usually enjoy, after getting used to the gameplay I found it to be quite a relaxing and pleasant experience.\n\nFirst, let me note that if you're looking for any type of challenge, even if it's an arbitrary goal that you can impose on your own gameplay to perfect your play, this really isn't the game for you.  Finders is a true casual title in that there's no time crunch, no goal that must be met to earn yourself any type of trophy (other than some easy to reach in-game achievements), nothing at all that places stress on the player.   This lack of challenge may prove too bland for some, but those who are looking for true casualness in gameplay may find it just the thing for them.\n\nGameplay consists of completing various quests by directing your "finders" about an area of the map, completing tasks, solving puzzles and leveling up which unlocks more actions, quests and options for the player.  As you build up your camp, gather resources, complete quests  and cut a path towards your overall objective, a simple story unfolds giving a bit of meaning to everything you're doing.  There is an element of freedom present in that you don't necessarily have to complete any task in order, but to progress you will need to work through those quests. Still, without a ticking clock hounding you, you can take your time planning out moves.  Even the resource management aspect of the game is quite forgiving as you can always spend time gathering foods or other materials if you find yourself short, then get back to questing without issue.\n\nMy main complaint is that the tutorial isn't quite as intuitive as it could be.  I spent quite a bit of time in the beginning trying to figure out just what I was supposed to do and what exactly the game itself entailed.  Once you have a grasp of how everything works it gets better, but this may be frustrating for those looking for something easy to jump right into.\n\nFor the price, Finders is worth a look if you're in the mood for casual gaming without the rush and stress that most titles in the genre employ.  Perfect for whiling away an hour here and there on lazy afternoons, if only there were Steam Achievement integration of the in-game Awards, but I'll just have to be content with trading cards for now.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for players looking for a truly casual experience without the usual time crunch madness of other "casual" sim games.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.","April 9, 2015","true","3.8"," 128 of 152 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","128","152","11","8"

It is a lot more casual compared to other titles in the genre, for better, or worse, personally I appreciate Alawar for trying to bring a different experience to the table.\n\nDespite being a resource management game, the levels in Finders do not have a time constraint, or even a failure state, this can be a huge turn off for some people as the game in turn offers less of a challenge. However, the game does offers you a surprising amount of freedom when it comes to building and expanding the camp and allows you advance through the level at your own pace.\n\nThe core gameplay is solid to say the least, you are given the task to complete a variety of different objectives in the game in your own time, in order to progress through the level. At first it mainly consist of setting up your camp and satisfy the basic needs of your workers, but the game opens up considerably afterwards and introduces you to a plethora of new mechanics and features, including a well made match 3 mini game, completed with power ups and abilities.\n\nIn short, Finders is a great game if you’re looking for a stress free, casual experience that is chock full of quality contents that’ll keep you entertained for a fair amount of time.\n","April 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 95 of 135 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","95","135","9","1"

The game frames this all in an adventure story, which plays out as you accomplish goals and build up your camp and add little bits of interesting tech as you go.\n\nFinders is an easy and relaxing game, with no time pressure or tricky strategic maneuvering to ramp up the difficulty. The game saves whenever you exit, so you can easily play in tiny increments without having to redo anything.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, you will probably want to look elsewhere. If you just want a relaxing experience that rewards the achievement of simple goals with a cute and colorful adventure story, then check this one out.\n\nThe trading cards are nice, but I do wish that the in-game trophies were available as Steam achievements.\n\nA review copy of this game was provided by the publisher.","April 9, 2015","true","12.6"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","47","61","3","0"

I like time management & match 3 games, the two genres into which this game most solidly fits.  I also like city-builders.  So I should be the exact target audience for this game, but I didn't enjoy playing it.\n\nThe game tells you to complete arbitrary tasks, something like quests, and just as in (bad) RPGs, it doesn't matter if you've JUST done the arbitrary task, you still have to do it again.  The match 3 game is only really necessary when the game tells you to play it, and it's timed and impossible to strategize.  There's some strategy involved in setting up your camp, and doing your best to fine-tune it.\n\nBut here's the game's biggest flaw, in my opinion.  After fine-tuning your camp, you have to move to a new area and complete a very tedious process in order to bring some of your progress with you.   This happens several times over the course of the game.\n\nAdditionally, the fishing minigame needs to be shot out of a cannon into the sun.  Overall, this is a very annoying game.","July 15, 2015","false","16.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/352140/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4613 products in account","Finders is an addictive casual Time/Resource Management game that both feels familiar and manages to put its own unique spin on the genre.\n\nIn Finders you direct an expedition that crash lands while in search an artifact in order to help locate a lost hero.  You're left to send survivors out to gather resources and build up the camp in order to continue the mission, which has 4 separate chapters.\n\nWhere Finders diverges from many other casual time management games is that it's area based rather than level based and you get to stay in one area for a long time. I found I liked this style of gameplay a bit better than hurrying through multiple levels as I felt more invested in gradually improving my camp and gathering resources since I would be there for some time.\n\nYou get a constant stream of mini goals that usually involve building or gathering resources and in some cases may even include short puzzles. Some of these will further the campaign along while others or merely optional goals to allow an opportunity to gain experience and levels.\n\nThe pace of the game is relaxed (with one exception; more on that later) and seeing the camp grow over time made the game fun and addictive for me. In addition to the building, upgrading and resource gathering there are a couple of mini-games.\n\nMost notably is the mining mini-game which is done as a match 3 game. These segments are timed which and I found much more hectic than the pace of the rest of the game. It's worth noting though that they are mostly optional as there are few places in the game where you're required to do it to progress and there's no real penalty for not getting very far down in the game other than using some of your water resource, which is replaceable. You can also retry as many times as you like.\n\nThe other main mini game is fishing. It's a bit of a timing mouse click sort of mini-game that's pretty quick and fairly simple once you get the hang of it, but again this is optional and later in the game you get access to a boat you can use to gather fish without doing the mini-game.\n\nOne area I thought could have been handled a little better were the transitions between areas. You don't take money you've earned over. You can take your resources but you have to transport each resource separately by helicopter which is a bit slow and tedious as well as carries a per item fee, but you do get the option at least to bring some items over. It's all optional however as you can just as well play from scratch in the new area and there's some things you can do to maximize effeciency in transporting previous accumulations like buying up lots of the most expensive items and then selling them at the new camp.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed Finders and found myself wanted to go back, build up my camp and progress through the campaign and its quirky story right up until the end.","April 9, 2015","true","21.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","5"

The demo-video on steam shows it locked to 4:3, however the game DOES scale to fill your monitor (looked fine at 1080p widescreen for me.)\n\nMy wife absolutely loved the game, and actually beat its campaign today, the same day we bought the game.\n\nMechanics are very, very, simple. It's a "casual" game. You can play the entire game with only a mouse. Scrolling with a keyboard feels kinda slow, so using just your mouse is very preferrable.\n\nYou control a limited number of workers and order them to complete basic tasks, gather food, wood, stone, water, and so on. Your workers cannot die, from starvation, animal attacks, or anything else, so theres really no "mistakes" you can make, other than just being innefficient. It's completely safe to leave the game unattended for hours, however you won't gain anything beneficial from doing so.\n\nThere are no microtransations or time sinks. Some actions/activities take longer to complete, but it's only to scale with the importance of the task you're doing (ie, scouting an important cave for a main-questline might take a few minutes) and to give each of the maps some longevity. There is no "speed up" options or anything like that in the entire game, although on particularily longer tasks you can "accelerate" the process by using extra workers and food.\n\nGameplay feels a lot like a mobile game with all the microtransactions and time sinks removed.\n\nFor the price I paid, around 5-bucks, I feel I received sufficient game depth. If you're a fan of "Casual" titles, where the challenge isn't about avoiding failure, but instead, maximizing efficiency and enjoying the experience along the way, you're more likely to enjoy it.","April 11, 2015","true","5.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","15","19","4","0"

They usually do not appeal to me. Yet the premise of this game "Superhero goes missing and now you and your team must solve the mystery to find him!" peaked my interest.\n\nThe game is quite short, and there is no way ( that I could discern ) to objectively "lose". Your team goes from island to island solving puzzles and playing small mini games to complete quests. Nothing is ever taken away from you, so the game is very low-pressure. (I suspect that its made for children. But its fun for adults too, especially if you just got out of a really competitve game and want something laid back to help you wind down.)\n\nThere is a strategic element to it too, but more about build order and building placement to optimize your economy, rather than commanding armies.\n\nThe story is a little cheesy , but moves right along (especially if you don't follow all the side quests, which I initially did until I realzied they are procedurally generated and infinite). The integration of archeology and comicbook style superheroes was genius. It worked amazingly well, and its something I've never seen before.\n\nIf I have any one major criticism about the game, its that its so short. Even going off and doing a lot of sidequests, I completed it in something like 10 hours. Which isn't bad, it just left me wanting more. A few of the puzzles, for example, were only done once. I'd really like to see some DLC or expansions with more islands and more puzzles.\n\nAnyway: thoroughly enjoyed it. I bought it during the Steam summer sale when it was under $5.

So far I haven't seen any bugs that I can tell, and its got good game play.\n\nThis game has one major drawback that I didn't see others mention, the constant clicking.  You have to micro manage everything, constantly.  Now most of us are used to that in some fashion in these type of games, but this is where the short cuts where taken, no matter what about every 20 seconds you have to click on everything that produces food, water, or cash, as well as all the resources that respawn for your workers to go harvest/collect.  This gets old fast.  clicklety click click click.  Thats all you do in this game.  keep clicking on the same tree, bush, same everything every 15 to 20 seconds as it respawns.\n\nEven using the resources you gather, every few seconds click on the kitchen, to make more stuff, no auto queing.  After 10 hours I was clicked out.  Just way to much clicking.   That said, if you can suffer through that, the rest of it is as others said a fun little game.\n\nif the workers would be auto gather on where you send them once, and the wells, tents, and grills would auto collect after the first upgrade, that would make the game much more tolerable.\n\n\nEdit the next day ... ok so once you get to level 19 ... you get a reprieve from most of the clicking.  They finally give you a perk where you only have to click on one tent, or one water well, or one brazier, and you collect everything from them all.  Also by that time, you aren't so desparate for collecting the respawning wood stone and food as much so the game play is much more enjoyable.\n\n\nI finished the game today ...  nice game, well wortth the price, but i don't see any real replay ability.   I also got the feeling like I had played this game before or one very very similiar.\n\nI would highly suggest they patch this and put that once click resource perk so you get it before you leave the first island, that would really make the game play much more enjoyable.\n\nAlso for you planners who like to max resources before you jump to the next new place ... um as far as food, water and cash go ... don't bother , you basically start over each time.  When you get to the third place .... thats when its worth really going for it, and purchasing most of the big stuff.\n\nEnjoy, looking forward to a second one.","April 11, 2015","true","39.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Some tasks are done quickly while others can take minutes.\nBuildings can be freely placed on an isometric grid. There aren't dedicated spots like most Alawar strategies.\nThere is a decent number of types of resources that each have a purpose.\nCooking can be done to use resources/ingredients to make food and stat boost items (faster workers, etc).\nSmelting to make more valuable ingots to sell for money.\nAll items can be sold to raise money. Some ingredients can only be obtained by buying them from town.\nLater in the game, there are demand spikes that make random items worth 3x more than usual. Selling in-demand items is a good way to raise the money required for the very expensive vehicles, upgrades, etc.\nRandom, optional objectives will appear that provide rewards if completed.\nThe graphics have a bit more detail than the usual Alawar cartoony style.\nThere are also different mini games inside of the overall resource gathering and building part:\nBejeweled-style Match 3 game for mining : 3 blocks is a standard clear, 4 gives one type of power up, and 5 gives a stronger one. Ore is trapped in the dirt that is cleared as blocks are matched beside them.\nFishing mini-game : A dialog appears when a fishing spot is clicked. Bread (crafted) is used as bait. Different type of fish can be caught. One of them is used in crafting, and the others are either used just to replenish food or sell for money.\nAlchemy-style puzzles : There aren't many, but some objectives require this type of puzzle to be completed. A pile of items are shown, and they have to be combined in the right order to meet the objective. Doing it without making mistakes will get you a money bonus.\nA few different types of logic puzzles  : By no means are they brain-bending, but there are a few other puzzles to complete as objectives.\nThere are some things that keep this from being a perfect casual game, but I wouldn't call them cons.\nSome of the words used are a bit odd. It's obvious that they are a case of "lost in translation". For instance, to fish, the action you take is "Put Out". That sounds like something you do on a date. I would expect "Cast", "Cast Line", etc. Landing the fish is done with "Strike". I would expect "Reel In" as the action. There are also a few oddities in the in-game achievement descriptions.\nThere are in-game achievements that could've easily been implemented as Steam achievements. I like going after achievements, and I completed all of them in the game. It would be nice if they were also in my achievement collection.\nI really liked the game. It was about as long as I expect almost any Alawar title to be, and the overall variety made it a bit more than a reskinned resource/time/worker management game. I got this game on sale for $1.49, and it was definitely worth it. The full price isn't too bad, either.\n\nOn a side note: I'd like to know how people are getting keys to publish reviews of partial play-throughs. I review fully-completed games for free. :P\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

Though I do wish there were achievements. There are, however, trading cards!\n\nYou don't stay in the same location the whole game through so it can give you a challenge that can be a bit difficult when you first relocate but at least it gives you some variety. :)\n\nI enjoy these types of games when I'm trying to unwind from a busy day. It's a relaxing game similar to the types of games you'd find on your cellphone or ipad without the need to keep spending real money to level up.\n","June 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

First subscribed to this game on a subscription site that I now forget the name of.  Loved this game but when I quit the subscription I realized that I had totally forgotten the name.  I  have been looking for this game for three or so years an I had given up ever finding it again.\n\nWhen I saw the name on the specials page I just hovered over it, did a double take and then the happy dance.  Threw on some clean undies and went to GameStop to buy a card.\n\nThis is a very simple game so if you are looking for complex time management you will not want this game.  Truly a no brainer but I like it and find it relaxing to play.  There is just enough of a storyline to keep me interested. and not so verbose it is like reading a book which causes me to mindlessly click to get the dialog out of the way.","April 14, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The mining aspect is akin to many other "match three" games out there.\n\nFinders is similar to many other games in that it has a click and collect interface for resources and buildings which "produce".  The Difference is that Finders attempts to give a reason for the production with many goals which progress you through the game.  As an exhausted parent, I was looking for something straightforward that i could pick up and drop as I had time.  Finders fit that bill well, so I was disappointed that it only lasted 13hrs.","May 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First one was for "The Promised Land" from the same developer.\n\nThis game is extremaly casual, and while it's not bad, it's not the best either from this developer. The gameplay is easy, but gets boring after a certain time. I had to complete the game (which is only few hours gameplay) in sessions. I still recommend the game, because it's nice to progress a bit when you are bored, but if you haven't played "The Promised Land" yet, try that out rather.\n\n6/10","January 14","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A little bit of everything and well worth buying, especially on sale. If you enjoy the build, collect, mini-quest, mini-puzzle type of game, this is for you.  Promised Land is my very favourite of the genre so far (and arguably goes beyond the genre), but this predecessor game provides several hours of engaging relaxation.  Some moments of humour, although the story is relatively superficial (but it's not supposed to be literature!).\n\nYes, it does look and feel a little bit like a Facebook (or similar) game, but it's nicely put together and I enjoy playing these games outside the freeware - "must have a hundred online friends help you unlock cool stuff - or spend money" - setting.\n\nThe interface is slightly sless intuitive than I would have liked, but still quite good.

I went from Starcraft 2 and Elite Dangerous to this casual brainless game...and I even liked it :-D\n\nOk, seriously: it's really a basic management game, you can finish it with a very little amount of strategy, but...dunno, it's entertaining somehow! Graphic is good, sound is too, there is some kind of story, and you can really put a bit of strategy and thought in it. So, if you want something fun, easy and relaxing to spend a bit of time, go for this.\n\nJust one warning, the only somehow negative point in the game: the side missions are NOT needed to complete the game nor they are related to the plot, as they are totally random generated and a lot repetitive. There is no need to do them and no side effects, they are good just for the reward.\nI write this 'cause spending too much time on the side missions (as I did before understanding that they where totally random) can lend to boredom (been there, seen that :-\ ) and ruin a bit the experience of an otherwise really fine game.\n\nThumbs up for Finders :-)","January 17","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finders has no time pressure or "levels": you get to choose whether and how you challenge yourself. (Me, I always try for "most efficient," but everyone's different.)\n\nThe gathering, building, and production have just enough depth to keep me playing 10 (or 20, or 30) minutes longer than I intended, but they're simple enough that you can fit in short sessions between other tasks. The game isn't too short, either: following the entire story line took me more than a few hours.\n\nIn fact, Finders is one of the most enjoyable casual resource management games I've played in quite a while. If the art, sounds, and writing were polished, I think this could easily be a top seller. As it is, some of the art is fine and some is weak, much of the text is awkwardly translated, and the fishing mini-game needs work to be more than just a chore. If those kind of things bother you, don't get the game. But if you like clicking to gather and craft, especially with no time pressure, you're likely to enjoy this.","April 9","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
