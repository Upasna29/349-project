"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengusaur/recommended/211420/","pengusaur","pengusaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pengusaur/","792 products in account","It's hard to describe why Dark Souls is so, so good.\nYet, it's so incredibly easy.\n\nWhy? We just need to look at the core attitude of Dark Souls, from a design-to-player perspective.\nDark Souls is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you.\nIt's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.\n\nDespite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Dark Souls wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.\n\nIn that regard, Dark Souls does absolutely no hand holding in almost every aspect. The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.\n\nCombat is slow, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying "clunk" sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!\n\nThe world of Dark Souls is completely open. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Dark Souls' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that "adventure" experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.\n\nThe world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Dark Souls' story. This is where I feel Dark Souls' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, Dark Souls is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.\n\nDark Souls also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: hollowed, or human. You spend a somewhat uncommon item called "Humanity" to turn from hollow to human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Dark Souls allows players to "invade" the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.\n\nNow, this is where I feel Dark Souls' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of "honor" code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine. They'll even go as far as to never turn human. What "honor" or "etiquette" should be included in Dark Souls' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.\n\nDark Souls is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.\n\nIn today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Dark Souls is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.","November 26, 2013","true","179.5"," 5,312 of 5,606 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","312","5","4","74"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hootey/recommended/211420/","hootey","Hootey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hootey/","697 products in account","I've had a love-hate relationship with this game for years. My first three attempts were miserable failures, and hardly stretched beyond an hour of gameplay. It took a fourth attempt to understand where I went wrong.\n\nThis game is not a bully or a menace. It is not unfair. Dark Souls is a father that wants to play catch with you in the backyard. Sure, he tosses you a few practice pitches, gets you warmed up, makes you feel like you're in the big leagues. Suddenly, you eat a screwball to the temple. You cry at first, moan, maybe fuss a little, and then get up to catch another. The stinging welt on your face reminds you to keep your glove up. Throughout this process, your father slams a fastball into your gut, sails a slider into your genitals, cracks your skull with a curveball, and he'll throw a second ball just when you're barely figuring out the first.\n\nNow you can give up whenever you want. Make a big deal about it, about how Dad is cheating or he's being mean or that it's all just a big waste of time. Your father will patiently wait while you throw your tantrum, slowly turning over the next hidden threat in his worn glove. The truth of the matter is that he wants you to succeed. He's teaching you by showing, not by telling. He's preparing you for something much, much worse that lurks ahead. Don't fight it. He wants you to succeed, but he's going to make you work for it. Take your lumps, say goodbye to your precious souls, and above all else: Prepare to die.","December 30, 2013","true","338.6"," 2,749 of 2,945 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","749","2","4","63"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aquinas_/recommended/211420/","aquinas_","aquinas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aquinas_/","162 products in account","Dark Souls is hard. That's the first thing people probably hear when the title is mentioned. I think that people have become spoiled -- or maybe weak or complacent are better words to use. We've become used to pressing A for awesome or quick time events flashing across the screen. We're used to hand holding and tutorials that overstay their welcome. We're used to winning and not having to work for it because challenges are usually designed to be beaten without the threat of losing or death. If Dark Souls is a difficult game, then it's because it actually respects the player. I know that I find the typical style of hand holding in games to be patronizing, no doubt from being developed for the lowest common denominator. If you die (and you will), then it's because you lack necessary information and must learn it through experience, or it's because you're not paying attention or being too careless. Dark Souls rewards adaptability and experience. If Dark Souls is difficult, then it's not because it is unfair, but because we are weak and need to shape up.\n\nAnother claim I've seen bandied about is that Dark Souls is light on story, but I do not believe this to be true. The story, like the difficulty, treats the player with respect. We're not going to be fed exposition from an eye dropper. The majority of the lore we gather is embedded within item descriptions or world and enemy design. We approach the game as an explorer, travelling to the cataclysmic land of Lordran to sift through its relics and best its challenges. The way the lore is delivered reflects this. Does this mean that it is light on story? Only if we assume that deep story necessarily means being beaten over the head with it via heavy handed narratives.\n\nDark Souls is/was a bad pc port. It is internally rendered at a fixed, low resolution, can't really be played without a controller and, the worst of all curses, uses Games for Windows Live. DSFix is a third party modification that alleviates the former graphical issues. There'll be a patch released this month to remove GFWL, so that takes care of another issue. Honestly, the game is such a masterpiece that it's worth recommending even with the above porting issues, but it's nice to know that the two main gripes (I don't mind using a controller, personally) are not issues any longer.\n\nSubtlety is an art that seems lost in the medium of video games. Games are treated as if they are amusement park rides with all the flash and noise one should expect from such a distraction. Dark Souls is not an amusement park ride, but more like a long forgotten, dusty tomb that we disturb at our own peril; it thusly responds to our disturbance in kind. I played Dark Souls to completion around six times with three characters when it was released on consoles. I didn't hesitate to purchase it again when it was ported to pc. I've since played through seven more times with another three characters. I suppose you could call me a fan of the series. I obviously recommend it.","November 18, 2014","true","203.1"," 1,800 of 1,928 people (93%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","93","800","1","56","47"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hevvy/recommended/211420/","hevvy","Hevvy180 {ŦĐ/G4C/CD}","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hevvy/","52 products in account","I'd recommend this game under one condition: Take the advice in the title, and prepare yourself.  Death is not failure, but it is common.\n\nFirst, a bit of background: Coming into this game, and having never touched either it or a controller before, I actively disliked a lot about it.  I hated the Vancian cast limits placed on the magic (still do, in fact; I'd prefer nerfed magic and a bloody mana bar).  I also expected to be able to play it immediately, but instead was advised to get DSFix (no, seriously, get it immediately) to ensure that it worked well the first time around.  I had to buy a  controller just to PLAY the game, since the M&K combo didn't work out.  The only reason I even got the game was that a friend wanted me to try it, and it wasn't all that expensive.  All in all, I was more than ready to hate this game and everything about it.\n\nAnd then I actually PLAYED the game.\n\nAnd it's amazing.\n\nLet's ignore the setting for a minute, because it's awesome on its own.  Let's ignore the depth of the lore, and the subtlety behind it, for the same reasons.  Let's look at the combat, and the exploration, and the GAMEPLAY of the game.   I have never seen a game so dedicated to making it YOUR FAULT when you die.  It's not that hard to take about ten extra seconds and think it out before charging in, and if you do that, you instantly double your chances of survival.  Trying out a weapon and learning its quirks BEFORE fighting the enemy is absolutely vital, so that you know how to time your hits.  The attacks the enemies use are, for the most part, very easy to read if you just WAIT a minute and figure it out.  It's not hard to figure out which enemies are tough enough that you should just leave them alone for a while, and if you attacked them, it's on your head.  Once you understand the basic mechanics, the game becomes downright refreshing.\n\nI don't know about you, but I hate it when I die in a game and it WASN'T my fault.  I need to be able to see where I screwed up, and fix it.  This is the game that lets you do that, and if you're not willing to do so, of COURSE the game is super hard.  Of COURSE you're getting punished.  If you're not willing to learn and get good, you deserve punishment.\n\nIn summary, though, this game is not for casuls.  This game is for the player who is willing to accept constructive criticism both from the game and from the player base.  This game is a trial by (bon)fire, and passing through will temper you into a better gamer, and possibly a better person.  Git gud, stay warm, praise the sun, and kill the dogs first.  Good luck out there, and don't you dare go Hollow.","March 21, 2015","true","678.9"," 696 of 719 people (97%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","97","696","719","97","14"

I've heard the horror stories, I've heard of people spending hours on a boss, I've heard of people raging and almost quiting the game. And I went through all of that. And I'm glad I did, because I experienced one of the best games I've ever played. And dispite looking at guides and getting help, I'm proud that I was able to beat the game.\n\nI could go on about what the game is and what it does, but lets be honest, everyone whose played games before has heard of this game. I'm basically writing this for the people who where in my shoes before I played it. If your worried about the difficulty, about getting upset at the game, you will. Its almost a guarentee. You will have to look up guides to figure out what you're supposed to do next, but the games level design and combat more than make up for the frustrations of the game. And after you realize that death in this game isn't a punishment, but more of a learning experience, you stop getting so frustrating and you realize that you have to learn how the world works. There are definitely some frustrating elements that I think are way too unfair, but the game makes up for it with the combat and level design.\n\nI think everyone should play this game through at least the first 3 bosses. If you decide it isn't for you after that, that is prefectly fine. But a lot of people play for an hour, die, and say it was too frustrated. And admittedly I did that for a long time. But if you give this game a fair chance, I think you'll realize that it really isn't as frustrating and hard as people think.\n\nDark Souls turned me from thinking it was a frustrating mess of a game to being one of the best games I've ever played, and I'll definitely play it again at some point.

(°ロ°)☝\n\n♦ The difficulty\n♦ The graphics\n♦ The gameplay\n♦ The lore\n\n♦ The difficulty\nFirst of all, and probably the reason why this game is so famous (or infamous), is the difficulty.\nThis game ain't that hard, it punishes every single mistake the player makes, often with death.\nI often read people complaining that this game is so hard only becase it's artificially made so with bad programming or ultraoverpowered enemies.\nIt's not true.\nThis game forces to learn (sometimes killing you 5 billion times in a row) the mechanics, but once you have learnt them, you can "easily" kill almost every single boss (made exception for 3 or 4 in which one you will just need patience or luck).\nI said that this game punishes mistakes. But not only the player's ones, even the one made by the AI: there is always a easier way to kill stuff than running onto them (because 90% of the time it will end with you respawning at the last bonfire).\nIt's a challenge. No more words needed.\n\n♦ The graphics\nThe graphic comparment of this game is simply beautiful.\nMaybe is not that pumped, but it's so cured that literally gives the feeling of running in a world made of chaos and beauty.\nThe textures are a bit gross and at a closer look, ugly.\nBut the way they are implemented in the world, with every collapsed building, grass growing in the wild or every strange liquid in the deepest areas of the world, the textures are just perfect.\nThe light is not that well done but when it's dark, for God's sake, it's really dark. Not dark like "meh, i can barely see stuff", dark like "Where the hell am I going? Where the hell is the road? Am I still alive? Was that a damned arrow?".\n\n♦ The Gameplay\nThis game is definetely not indicated for people who like the classic RPG game with quests, NPCs and maps.\nIt gives only two directed suggestions:\n-"In Lordran, level up and kindle at bonfires"\n-"Ring two bells and GTFO"\nSTOP. No more instructions. no one will tell you where to go or what the hell is happening. You're alone in this dark and shattered world. People will trick you, people will invade you from their world, people will ♥♥♥♥ your game up killing NPCs. The only way to know where you have to lead next, is reading everything. On every item there is a description that tells you everything you need: where to go, where to look and what are the weaknesses of the bosses.\nEvery single weapon has a unique moveset that goes well against certain enemies but against others are better other weapons. And i'm not saying that every weapon class has a moveset. Every. Single. Weapon.\nDon't ever try to do a 3v1 in an area (unless you're overleved), you will probably get rekt, or finish without estus (potions).\nThis game is divided in areas, at the end whereof there is a boss fight. Until the final boss is killed, people can invade your world trying to kill you for souls and humanities. In the other hand, until the area is freed, you can convoke players.\nLast but not Least, when you die a blood stain will appear on the floor, cointaing the souls and the humanity you had.\nYou can pick them up restoring everything you had. But if you die again trying, sayonara souls.\nUSE A CONTROLLER.\n\n♦ The lore\nSome people complains that this game has no lore. This happens because just like what you have to do, no one says what the hell is going on.

It can be difficult, but outside of one mid-game boss fight, it never seems ridiculous. Dungeons are extremely well-designed. I have played a lot of RPGs in my life, and this seriously has some of the most interesting, huge, incredible set of crafted dungeons I've ever seen. In addition to this, the game is beautiful, and the boss battles are intense and memorable.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Dark Souls is a combat-oriented RPG. The world is beautifully designed and rendered. The aesthetic of the game ranges from gorgeous, breath-taking vistas to eerie, haunted locales. The sparse NPCs are laconic, have their own agendas, and come and go despite your desires. There are no random, unimportant NPCs in this game. The world of Dark Souls is dangerous, mysterious, and lost. The game designers leave a lot of details unspoken and allow your imagination to fill in the gaps.\n\nThat said, this game can be very frustrating. I die a lot. I have fallen off cliffs. I have lost encounters with monsters much stronger than my character. I have been killed by other players repeatedly. I have been poisoned. I have been ambushed.\n\nSo is it fun? Yeah, I think so. There is something exciting about exploring your way through a booby-trapped fortress that would give Indiana Jones a run for his money. It is rewarding to fight a near invulnerable opponent until you find his weakness, beat him to a pulp, and walk away with his magic ring. It's exciting to truly be worried about what is around the next corner when you've come way too far to go back, but don't want to dare fate and push ahead. It's exciting to sneak through the dark hoping you hear the monsters before the monsters hear you. This game has lifted my spirits and brutally dashed my hopes.\n\nI recommend this game to ANYONE, but especially those who like to become fully immersed in their gaming experience. This isn't just a game where you go from start to finish in a linear fashion; this is a universe of its own, with vast landscapes and beautifully crafted worlds and characters and weapons and spells and dialogue and narrative. You could play through this game a thousand times and never have the same experience. Things are constantly evolving, and with such multi-faceted quest-lines, the number of different character builds and tools available to each player, the replay value is HUGE.\n\nI really recommend that you visit the Wiki and follow a walkthrough so that you can get the most out of each level; it'll make things a lot less frustrating also. I mean, you'll still die regardless, walkthrough or no walkthrough, and you'll die a lot, but at least you'll know what to expect (kinda).","January 8, 2014","true","68.6"," 409 of 461 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","409","461","0","20"

I like to say it’s an early 90’s action RPG with modern 3D graphics and controls, in every aspect.\n\nThe central thing that sets Dark Souls apart (as well as Demon’s Souls before it) is that it actually tries to respect the player’s intelligence and resilience by avoiding many of the practices today’s mainstream games adopt. It doesn’t hold your hand. It doesn’t constantly prod you in the right direction. It doesn’t spoon-feed you the storyline. It won’t try to make sure you constantly know where to go and what to do. The developers at From Software aren’t even worried about you possibly overlooking content in this game. Dark Souls provides you only with what you need to eventually figure out what to do.\n\nIn terms of overall difficulty and its approach to the player I personally would say Dark Souls is about in line with most Super NES games. It actually feels like it takes a philosophy similar to that of the classic Mega Man and Mega Man X games. While playing you have to accept the fact that you’re going to die and retry a few times before you work out a strategy for beating a particular boss or getting past a certain situation. Most developers today are too worried players will get frustrated during that process and drop the game, but From Software doesn’t care.\n\nDark Souls is definitely a punitive game. When you die you lose “souls,” a resource representing both your experience points and currency, which you get one chance to retrieve. Checkpoints are specifically placed throughout the game. Though you can save and quit literally anywhere, the game auto-saves after pretty much any action, so every single decision you make, big or small, is final. Many people have called Dark Souls the ultimate example of “tough but fair,” in video games.\n\nEven the tutorial manages to be at once smooth, enticing, and a bit challenging. The first time I tried Demon’s Souls it took me literally around 30 seconds to figure out the core combat controls (which are basically the same in Dark Souls). It’s a very intuitive system based on the left and right bumpers each representing a hand, (on an Xbox 360 pad) the B button representing dodge, and the management of a stamina meter. The rest the tutorial conveys with messages on the ground, immediately teaching you to read messages left by other players in the game proper. The tutorial section is basically a miniature version of a normal level of the game that doesn’t ever stop you to talk your ear off.\n\nDark Souls even manages to stand out among action RPGs by nailing a unique balance between RPG stat-building and action game skill. It’s not a twitch game at all -- its action combat is rather slower than most games, requiring good timing, patience, and attention to enemy patterns (a lot like old school game but in 3D). As an RPG Dark Souls is about watching equipment stats (your gear is arguably more important than your level in this game), resistances, and a few other base stats, but attaining a high level does not at all negate the need for the aforementioned action game skills. In fact, with the right gear and enormous attention to enemy behavior, it’s possible to beat Dark Souls with a level 1 character.\n\nAnother part of Dark Souls that feels tough but fair in a somewhat old school way is its level design. It takes many hours to realize it, but Dark Souls is basically a 3D Metroidvania. Its world is just as vertical as it is horizontal, each area containing shortcuts to other areas that show off real ingenuity in the level design. Oftentimes a “checkpoint” in a level is really just the activation of a shortcut you didn’t even know was there.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Dark Souls though -- what it manages to do that too many games have forgotten, is carry a dark sense of mystery. Its environments make me feel cautious but simultaneously provoke my curiosity. It’s a feeling very akin to dungeon crawlers like Ultima Underworld. From Software manages to accomplish this with a combination of minimalist atmosphere and storytelling along with a pure yet baroque sense of art direction.\n\nDark Souls pretty much constantly surprises you with what you find in each new environment whether that be unique enemies or the environment itself, never really giving you much of any clues as to what you’ll encounter next -- only just enough warning for ever-vigilant players. At the same time paying attention to environments, item descriptions, and NPCs starts to reveal what’s going on in the story as well as some of the game’s lore. Things like this are pretty much the game’s only storytelling devices.\n\nThose environments show Dark Souls is a strong case for art over tech in video game graphics. The game runs on a very modest engine that in many ways resembles PS2-era games, but is saved by superb art design in the environments and enemies. It’s all medieval fantasy, but it manages to nail a medieval look and a fantasy look that are more pure than most fantasy. Dark Souls obviously doesn’t pull its looks from other RPGs, but rather straight from actual medieval architecture, clothing, armor design, and fables.\n\nDark Souls isn’t a terribly difficult game to run but unfortunately does require some modding on account the PC port’s rushed development cycle. Unless Durante’s DSfix is applied, the game is locked to 720p and 30 frames per second, and its keyboard controls are absolutely not recommended. Furthermore, your performance is highly dependent on your CPU’s base clock speed. If it’s under 3.0GHz you’re going to have trouble regardless of how many cores or threads you’re running.\n\nDark Souls and its predecessor have gained an intimidating reputation, but if you’re tired of AAA games treating you like an idiot and you want a game that actually let’s you figure out how to play it on your own for a real sense of accomplishment, Dark Souls is just about the best you can do without going down to indie production values.","January 27, 2014","true","75.1"," 292 of 319 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","292","319","0","6"

After 200+ hours of playing, I think that yes, it's challenging and it will test your patience (first time in Sen's funhouse Fortress) but it's not as difficult as some people make it seem.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Melee combat - I usually prefer playing ranged but the melee combat in this game is so fun.\n- Gameplay - The pace of the game play is on the slower side, and involves a lot of trial and error.  You'll die quickly if you try to play it hack-and-slash style.  The more you die, the more you learn.\n- Level design - Interconnected areas, hidden areas, shortcuts.  Sen's funhouse :p\n- Loading screens - Only a few loading screens (when loading your save, when you die and respawn, and when using fast travel).\n- Skippable cutscenes - Most cutscenes are skippable.\n- Visuals - It doesn't have the best graphics but some areas look beautiful.\n- Weapons - There are a lot of weapons in this game, with different movesets for each kind of weapon.\n- Armor design - This is usually my pet peeve in RPGs. I was surprised that a Japanese game had practical-looking armors, and none of the chainmail bikini or boobplate nonsense in many RPGs.  There are ridiculous-looking armors too but they look ridiculous regardless of the sex of the character wearing them.\n- Jolly cooperation :D\n\nMeh:\n- The trek from bonfire (spawn point) to boss area felt tedious after dying from the same boss numerous times.\n- No pause (probably because of multiplayer). Not really a problem outside boss fights because you can just quit the game then load your save afterwards.  During boss fights, if you have to take care of something for a short while, you can't pause so you'll have to repeat from the start.\n- Lag during invasions (fixed by Alt+F4 :p )\n\nOther stuff:\n- Using a controller is highly recommended\n- Use DSfix to fix the resolution, remove 30 fps lock, use texture mods, etc.\n- If you've seen "Edge of Tomorrow", that's basically how Dark Souls plays like.","July 25, 2015","true","339.2"," 217 of 230 people (94%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","94","217","230","46","9"

It's not your average day game, that's for sure.\nThe game throws the player in a very difficult world, not just by gameplay standards, but plotwise as well. The narrative is played in such a way that it's never speaking to the player, but rather to your character, it never breaks the 4th wall by directly telling the player what to do and how to do it, only the basic attack move buttons are given to you at the begining, and from then on, you're completely on your own for the rest of the 50+ hour journey. Unless you get a co-op partner or go through some guides on the internet.\n\nDark Souls boasts a great online system that originates from it's spiritual predecessor Demon Souls, one that was revolutionary when it came out. You can invade other people's world, like literally, their own game world, just like they can invade yours, but invasion can only happen on certain circumstances. You can also allow other people to summon you to their world, so you can help them fight tough bosses, or protect them from other players who invaded their world.\nDark Souls has covenants, which are ingame clans. Different covenants has different attributes, you can level up your covenant level to get bonuses, abandoning covenants has penalties and make you regret it. Dark Souls' online system is great, but it's connectivity issues are still poor as of today, but it works usually and can give you jolly good fun!\n\nThe story of the game won't be told to you directly, you won't get cutscenes where NPC's tell you stuff and action scenes occur.... no, that's now how it is. You'll learn the story through character dialogues, item informations, the appearence of an area and boss battles. Yes, boss battles gives you a great deal of story, you learn why their fighting you, aside from demons, no enemy in the game is actually a villian, they're fighting you for their own reasons.\n\nDark Souls in my opinion is technically one of the best games ever made in terms of gameplay. A lot of people say that the gameplay is broken, but if you play it for some time, you'll understand how beautifully crafted it really is. You can perform so many movesets, no other game that I've played has such a thing. To kick, to jump attack, to jump, to parry, backjump, to roll, to attack with your right or left hand, to heavy attack with your right or left hand, to block, to equip your weapon with both hands which changes your attacks and increases damage, to backstab, to use bows, crossbows, magics, apply magical effect on your weapon and many more. So many elements, it's literally the perfect gameplay for me, it feels so real, and so technical. When you defeat a tough enemy or a boss, you feel like the best dude there ever lived, like you've achieved human perfection. That's how satisfying the gameplay really is.\nIt's simply magnificent, totally worth buying, truly worth playing.","November 10, 2015","true","254.2"," 177 of 187 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","177","187","12","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/211420/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","- Personal Rating - "Must own Instant Classic"\n- Traditional Rating - "9.5/10"\n\nThis game... currently sits at my absolute favourite experience this generation and Video Games in general. Dark Souls, storywise is what's considered a minimalistic game in terms of it being a "Find it Yourself" and the experience itself hails back to classic games of old in it's design, it drops you in a huge expansive world, where you, as the "Chosen Undead" are tasked to braving the world of Lordran to either save or destroy an age.\n\nI personally think this is one of the greatest experiences found in any video game ever, and is one that's mostly all about self satisfaction than rewards. The game starts you out at an Asylum as you escape from it, the game immediately drops in a huge boss enemy that you must run away from (at the time being) as the game teaches you how to be cautious and watch out for traps ahead, enemies and ambushes as well as eventually give you the weapons of the class you chose at the Character Creator. What you do with this information here will carry out through the ENTIRE game. As soon as you defeat the Boss and escape the Asylum, your are thrown at a completely new area with no set path to go, you're given a goal - Ring two bells, and that's it, it's up to you to find out why and what for.\n\nThe game is based around traps and enemy types that will undoubtedly down you the first time around until you figure out their patterns and weaknesses (this also holds true to bosses). There are a multitude of different enemy types around the game that will test your mettle as every enemy encounter feels more like a duel than actual fodder as you are learning them. After you kill an enemy, you collect their "Souls" (that save as the game's style of currency) that is used to not only level up, but to buy items, weapons, etc as well - enemies may also drop weapons or armor depending on who they are and how rare the drop may be. The world is also pretty expansive with areas that are highly varied that each tell their own stories and further re-inforces the "Figure it yourself" type of story; pretty much every area and detail is important to the story and what is actually going on, from villages, to rotting bridges, to an area mostly populated by dragons, to a fortress filled with death traps to the brim - there's no shortage of level design to be found here, and everything is fully explorable and is encourageable to do so, as you can find the rarer armour or weapons this way - as you make your way to the nearest bonfires (checkpoint system for the game).\n\nThe leveling system itself is a bit cryptic if anything. What the game won't tell you is that after a certain number is reached per stat (50 generally) those stats stop scaling in very meaningful ways. These stats are essential to building a certain character, similar to an MMO. By leveling up a stat like, Intelligence for example, you'll be building up a Mage, like building up a stat like Strength or Dexterity will most likely build a melee style character. There's no limit to a character you can build which is what kept the community for the game going to this day.\n\nAs far as the Online Multiplayer goes - this game has one of the most inventive systems in place. If your character is undead, you cannot summon other people (or NPC Phantoms) to help you out in combat and you cannot be invaded. Invasion is, in my opinion, what makes a game like Dark Souls the game it is. Invasion is when another player (and in some cases an NPC) comes into your world sporting a dark red aura (in certain other cases a Dark Blue aura) and attempt to kill you, as well as you can invade another player's world and attempt to kill them to steal their humanity. Humanity is also a key feature for the online portion of the game and the game in general. Humanity is used to revive your character at a bonfire, while "Human" is when you can be invaded or invade others, and summon other players or NPCs.\n\nThere's a bunch more details to this game I could go on and on about, but if you're reading this, you're most likely either looking to continue supporting Dark Souls or buy it. If you haven't bought this game, and you enjoy tough games that reward perseverance, get this game. It sits as my absolute favourite video game this generation for a multitude of reasons, it's a game that harkens back to days of old and it refuses to hold your hand in any way throughout the whole adventure.\n\nA+++","November 26, 2013","true","26.4"," 475 of 579 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","475","579","0","32"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/211420/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Dark Souls is an action role playing game, developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games, releasing in 2011 on the console market, and 2012 on the PC.  This is the second game in the “Souls” series, the original game “Demon’s Souls” was never released on the PC format.  The series is set in a dark fantasy universe.\n\nGame play in Dark Souls is something which a lot of people will have seen from online memes and articles depicting it as an extremely hard game to play.  Whilst this is true, the game’s difficulty is also fair at the same time, with the game relying primarily on the player’s skill, rather than how they are geared and what level they are.  At the start of the game you get your character creation segment, you can go as in depth or as basic into this as you like – choosing options such as sex, appearance, name and class.  You play the game in a third person perspective, you have access to tons of different weapons, and each has their own unique style and even their own attack animation to add to the variety.  Weapons require a certain amount of skill points in certain areas, which can be improved by levelling up your character through collecting Souls; this is the game’s currency system as well as experience points.  The combat system in Dark Souls is one of the game’s most positive features, with system that is easy to grasp, but pretty hard to become a master of. With a lot of enemies having different attack routines, you are never quite sure how you should react, should you dodge this attack? Should I parry this attack? Am I just outright dead? Dark Souls has a huge learning curve and as you may probably already know, you will die….a lot.\n\nGraphically, Dark Souls upon released looked like your typical PS3 release. By today’s standards it would be considered very dated.  Thankfully with the game being on PC, we have options to a plethora of mods which increase the visual appearance of the game ten-fold. If you aren’t a fan of modding games, then the graphical side of Dark Souls may be something which puts you off a little, with low quality textures, and an even worse resolution cap in place.  With mods not only can you make the game look beautiful, but you can crank the resolution up as high as you want, as well as increasing the frame rate to 60 fps.  Dark Souls has some really good sound tracks too, and whilst the game has voice acting of the majority of characters; something just doesn’t sound right about them. Whether that is the style the developers were going for to make it seem very eerie; I am not sure, but there is something very different about the voice acting in Dark Souls.\n\nThe game is essentially an open world playground to adventure in. There are no loading screens, or “levels”. If you have the balls, you can actually go where ever you want from the very start of the game, that’s one of the games really difficult parts – making the player work out for themselves on where they need to go in the right order. Throughout the world you will encounter tons of different enemies, equipment vendors, and loot. The game feels very vast in the amount of content there is to see with plenty of paths to take you off your main route.\n\nAs you can see from my play time on Dark Souls, 73 hours is a lot. In fact that is probably about 1 and a half play throughs of the game. Your first play through Souls will probably take you about 30+ hours, depending on how you are with the combat system. Beating this game is no easy feat, and when you finish it, you will have a real sense of achievement because not many people have done so.  Achievement hunters amongst us will also have a huge task on hand, with an estimated 130 hours needed to complete this game fully. There is also a large amount of replay ability factored into Dark Souls.  You can simply start the game again with a different class and have a whole new experience, as the tactics you used to beat bosses last time will no longer be viable depending on your class.\n\nTechnically, on PC Dark Souls released in a poor state; thankfully with the help of mods all of these issues were able to be fixed. First of all, don’t even attempt to play this game with keyboard and mouse that will really take the difficulty level to all new heights. The most important mod you will need to make Dark Souls playable on PC is DSFix which can be downloaded here - http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/19/? – The mod is very easy to install and configure, and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that will help you get the absolute most out of this mod.\n\nDark Souls is a real test of a gamer’s skill and patience. It is difficult, but fair at the same time. If you want to test yourself on one of the most difficult action games out there, Dark Souls will be for you. I had so much fun playing through this game and am thoroughly proud of myself for actually managing to beat it.  If you want the full experience of struggle, try the game without the use of wikis or guides! Dark Souls will not be for everyone, and that is fine, but I strongly urge anyone who even has a passing interest in the action RPG genre to attempt to beat this game.  The game’s regular retail price on Steam is £19, 99 – whilst this is still pretty high for a game that was released in 2012, you are getting a monster of a title.  Sale season has been known to bring Dark Souls down to less than £5 though.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

I found myself starting up games, and getting bored within 10 minutes, even new games I just recently purchased, I thought the gaming phase of my life was over at 20 years old. But still, I continued that search for a game that would spark that feeling I had when I was 14. The feeling of deep immersion, losing myself within the game, wanting to find out more, and improve myself. Then, this game happpened.\n\nI heard about Dark Souls first about 1 year ago, mid 2015. Nothing about it seemed interesting to me, I heard it was incredibly hard, the story was confusing, and I felt like gaming was past me. So about 6 months pass, and I hear about the hype of Dark Souls 3, something about this series now seems intriguing, I still pass it off as something I'm not going to ever play though. Then it comes out, I see all these youtube videos about it, people going crazy about how amazing it is... alright I've got to at least try one of these games, where do I start?\n\n$60 for a game I don't even think I will like? No thanks. Alright lets see number two, $55 for a game I'm not sure about? No thanks, once again. Ah, lets check the first. After a few minutes of pondering, I decide f**k it, I'm buying it, and here starts my journey.\n\nI'm new, I don't know what the hell is going on, but this game, something about it, every time I die, I want to go further, figure out how to fix what I did wrong last. It's not Skyrim, it's not some boring repetive game, it's just... different, nothing like I've ever experienced. Then after a while, a few hours past, wait what? I'm actually... getting into a game again, I want to play more. I want to improve my character so I can kill that Black Knight and get whatever is behind him, I want to finally find a new cool piece of armour, I want to figure out what the f**k is actually happening in this world and where the story is going.\n\nThis, is a f**king game done right. Just buy it, try it out, you wont regret it. Ignore all the ♥♥♥♥ about people saying it's insanely difficult scaring you away, that is exactly what makes this game fun. It's a breath of fresh air to me, I'm only 5 hours in, and can't wait to keep playing the rest of this series.","April 21","true","45.1"," 111 of 116 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","111","116","8","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/211420/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Dark Souls is the great misunderstood game of this generation. There’s a wildly prevalent belief the game’s extremely hard. People presume the developers, From Software, sat down and looked at the history of videogames, cherry-picking specific titles to place in their drawer of inspiration, only to cause perspiration for others. Ghosts ‘n’ Goblins and Battletoads would likely be in there. In there so the devs can look at them and exceed those levels of difficulty and cruelty and position their game to be harder than, well, than anything you have ever played before. This just isn’t the case. It’s just misunderstood.\n\nYou see, dieing hundreds and thousands of times as you make your way from the relative comfort of Firelink Shrine through Darkroot Garden and onto Blighttown is part of the game mechanics, part of the game design and the basis of the learning curve. You move a few feet, meet a foe and are vanquished in the fleeting moments between letting loose a flash of your heavy blade and the connection of their harder and faster attack with your torso. You try again, make your way back to the location of your vanquishing and collect the souls you had before that failure, this time with a little more awareness of what is about to befall you. You think to yourself a quick attack might be the better option, or maybe a long-range effort if so endowed. You’ve learned what not to do. Now you teach yourself what to do. It probably still isn’t enough. A third, fourth, thirtieth time and you eventually get past that particular villainous creature. Each time you died you were that little bit wiser, that little bit stronger. Regardless of it all the compulsion to continue was unbearable. There was no stopping, no waiting. Just the desperate need to keep on trying, learning and eventually succeeding. It was incredibly hard work and around the corner there’s more to do, different baddies to beat and extra secrets to uncover. You have no idea if you’re going in the right direction, the wrong direction or even in a direction you have no right going until tens of levels stronger. The compulsion is there though. It’s not a hard game, see, it’s just a game with a deep, long-lasting and incredibly compulsive mechanic with death part of the process, rather than the end as in the majority of titles today.\n\nDark Souls is essentially a third-person Elder Scrolls game for the self-hating. Like Bethesda's masterful series, Dark Souls offers you a fantasy tale with dragons and other mythical creatures to meet, classes to choose from, factions to join, magical spells to learn, a huge world to explore, and a bunch of awesome medieval gear to find. But unlike the Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls doesn't reward your failures with generous helpings of EXP and leveled-up abilities, and its combat is nuanced and unforgiving. Dark Souls kills you over and over, and then punishes you for dying. If you want to make the game a little easier, grind to improve your character. If you don't like it, go play Skyrim with all the other wimps.\n\nAt its core, Dark Souls is a game about animations. You need to keep a close eye on what your enemies are up to, and you need to remember that every button you press commits your character to a full motion. If you begin an attack animation after an enemy starts swinging at you, you'll probably get hit. If you want to take a swig from your health flask, you need to know that your character will take his sweet time, leaving himself vulnerable. And when you get knocked down, your character won't scramble back to his feet; he'll lie there for a second, just tempting bad guys to move in.\n\nYou need to take each enemy type, dissect their patterns, and figure out what works through trial and error. It might be as simple as blocking, strafing, and attacking when you get the chance. Or, you might need to deflect their blows to stagger them, or somersault away to avoid a powerful blow your shield can't handle, or use a certain type of magic. You're prevented from button-mashing by your stamina meter, which is not particularly generous unless you pour a lot of effort into leveling it up. The upside: When you finally get a hard part right, you feel… well, not good so much, but relieved.\n\nOf course, there's more to an action-RPG than just the action. Killing enemies earns you souls, which you can spend (if you don't lose them first) to improve your many attributes—and RPG progression is the only way to make this game less difficult. You'll want to find and improve the best weapons and armor. You also earn a resource called "humanity," which makes you a little less undead, allows you to return to your human form, and offers a variety of other perks, such as the ability to "kindle" a bonfire. (Bonfires are this game's checkpoints, and they refill your health flask; kindling the fire doubles the amount of health the bonfire gives you.)\n\nThe visuals are well-crafted, for the most part. Dark Souls offers impressive environments, detailed and frightening enemies, and fluid animations. The creepy music and decent voice acting add to the atmosphere, too.\n\nAs for the controls, they're easy to get used to, but you'll definitely want a controller. There is a default keyboard configuration, but it's incredibly clumsy, and the developers don't even pretend there's a chance you might use it—all the on-screen instructions pertain to the gamepad. (No, you don't "Press A" to pick up items when you're using a WASD movement setup.)\n\nThere's ten hours of new content in the "Prepare to Die Edition" as well, making it the definitive version of Dark Souls There's a new chapter of the story, including fresh areas, bosses, enemies, and NPCs. As I said above, most players probably won't finish the game—which was up to 100 hours long to begin with—so it's not that big of a deal that this version has more of it. But if you're a hardcore Dark Souls fan, or if you're confident in your ability to wring every last cent of value out of the game, the Prepare to Die Edition is the way to go.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 1, 2015","true","28.6"," 229 of 275 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","229","275","14","10"

You think you're pro-MLG enough to handle this one? Maybe you should turn around and go back to Skyrim or Terraria or whatever other CASUL "game" you waddle around in. If you really think you're ready to step up your game and try your hand at Dank Souls, lemme give you an accurate depiction of your fate:\n\n- You will die.\n- You will die a lot.\n- You will die for basically most of your time playing.\n- Death will befall you.\n- Your life will be ended.\n- Your shirts will be colored red in your blood, which will ironically make you die even more.\n- Imagine one of those games where you estimate the number of candies or rat testes or some other small things that've been put in a jar. Now imagine all of it has been replaced with instances of your death. Okay? That's a pretty accurate description, I think. Yeah. It'll do.\n\nBasically the game is hard, or at least it is to CASULS like you. Don't even pick this game up unless you already know every enemy attack animation as well as every parry frame and weapon moveset in the game with some side knowledge of every misc item in the game and all the secret passages.\n\nOr you could learn as you go. I mean, that'd be okay I guess. I mean, that's probably what makes Dank Souls so great is that you learn as you go, no matter how many times you die. UNLESS YOU'RE PRO-MLG LIKE ME, IN WHICH CASE YOU NEVER DIE BECAUSE I NEVER DIE EVER.\n\nIn PvE you will face off against BALANCED and 100% QUALITY enemies such as the "bed of chaos" and "torch hollows." The combat in Dark Souls is directly tied into user and enemy animations, so the player will have to be forced to learn patterns AS WELL AS the patterns the player will utilize and change via weapon choices, since all weapons basically have their own unique moveset and sets of strengths/weaksauce weaknesses...except for the CHAOSHANDER, which only has strengths.\n\nIn PvP you will be butt-devastated by a gigantic flurry of backstabs the like of which you will never have thought could exist. Take every game in the Assassin's Creed series and then add up all the backstabs players could possibly execute at any point (possibly an infinite value due to respawning NPCs?) and then multiply it by five.\n\nOkay.\nGood.\nYou're still not even close.\nThe combat is still tied into animations, except now it's entirely based on PLAYER movesets. This means PvP is primarily dominated by those who learned the strengths and weaknesses of (at least most of) the gear in the game.\n\nAKA THEY LEARNED HOW TO ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND GET FREE BUTTSTABS.\nFREE BUTTSTABS!!!\nIT'S A TRAVESTY.\n\nBasically the backstab system in Dar- I mean Dank Souls isn't all that quality-laden. Dark Souls II (notice how I didn't say DANK SOULS II) attempted to fix this, and it did a fair job of doing so. Except for how Dark Souls II isn't as good as Dank Souls, and should be avoided.\n\nJust saying.\n\nI'm not going to go into the lore because you can just do a google search ("DANK SOULS LORE FUNNY CAT IMAGES") and see 999,999,998 "people" go "OH YES IT'S SOOOOO DEEP AND MEANINGFUL BUT SUBTLE AT THE SAME TIME LIKE OMGGGG YOU HAVE TO DISCOVER IT FOR YOURSELF."\n\nThey're right, of course. It still doesn't need another reiteration though. You get the point after a while.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Dank Souls is an amazing triumph of the game market and is more akin to an interactive work of art THAT HATES YOU.\n\nIf you have any disagreements then I'll have to ask you to 1v1 me. Watch out though 'cause my zweihander don't play no games son.\n\n10/10","May 28, 2015","true","343.9"," 343 of 448 people (77%) found this review helpful 320 people found this review funny","77","343","448","320","36"

Rarely playing games above the normal difficulty, the appeal of it being a really hard and unforgiving game wasn't the most compelling. I'm glad I changed my mind though, because I may have had missed out on a game I now consider one of the best of the decade.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and engaging. The art, hauntingly beautiful and original. The soundtrack, breathtaking. But what really makes Dark Souls a masterpiece, by perfectly uniting all its elements, is the world of Lordran. Its cohesive design made me question every videogame world I'd experienced up to that point. From the wastes below the very backbone of the land up to the very top of the tallest tower of the tallest castle, the world's vertical and intrinsic design never fails to maintain its authenticity and unimpaired flow. After transversing the map not too many times, I could - and still can, months after actively playing the game - definitely draw a convincing transcription of it, with all its shortcuts and intersections. In a journey through Lordram, rarely does it feel like an area is forgettable or unused.\n\nDark Souls has no narrative. There are no quests, maps, or journals. What it has is the world of Lordran. The story is presented to the player through unusual elements. Item descriptions. NPCs - that have their own agenda. And most importantly, through the other main elements of the game: music, visuals, gameplay. You are never given a codex or anything like what most RPGs have. You have to pay attention and intentionally pursue the story elements to make any sense out of it. Or you can ignore that and go slay a wide array of creatures and superbly designed bosses - it's just as fun. As is taking part in the clever and unique co-op and PvP elements. To top it all off, the atmosphere through most of the game is unmatched. But that comes as no surprise after praising the world and its cohesiveness for so long.\n\nA must-play if I've ever seen one, Dark Souls is as a fresh experience as it is a throwback to a kind of fun recent videogames seemed to have forgotten.","October 25, 2015","true","87.4"," 91 of 98 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","91","98","7","3"

Adriano is joined by his talking pet dog, Francesco, who brings some much needed levity to their journey with his many hilarious puns. Francesco has more to offer than just his sense of humor, however, and his tail doubles as a magical paintbrush to help Adriano return color to the world.\n\nGameplay (8/10)\nThe goal of the game is to obtain colors and then use them to return color to a monochrome world with your paintbrush. The more of the world that is restored this way, the closer to solving the mystery Adriano gets. While it is not necessary to repaint 100% of the world, there is a special secret in store for players with the patience and dedication to do so.\n\nThe gameplay is split into four phases. In the first phase, Adriano and Francesco must travel to an area that has lost its colors. It's up to the player to decide where to go first, but some locations have a higher difficulty level than others. Decide for yourself what you feel capable of, but try to challenge your creative spirit!\n\nIn the second phase, Adriano must find the Three Prime Colors of the area in question and convince them to aid him in restoring color to their surroundings. The three different Colors are Yellow, Blue and Red. Yellows will usually aid Adriano willingly because of their desire to return color to the sun, but in some cases Adriano will have to solve a riddle or prove himself first. Blues can be troublesome, particularly if Adriano hasn't restored a lot of churches yet. In most cases they will give Adriano a puzzle to solve, the difficulty of which depends on how much of the world's color has already been restored. The most troublesome Color by far is Red. The Reds will often say mean-spirited things to poor Adriano and try to ruin his paintings. They can be difficult to deal with, but with a bit of cunning and a hysterical joke from Francesco, Adriano will eventually be able to prevail.\n\nIn the third phase, Adriano has to apply these colors to the canvas that is the monochrome world. Here, accuracy, speed and the number of colors collected is important. If Adriano gets careless he might not be able to properly restore color to the world, and if he is too slow the Colors might get impatient and escape again.\n\nThe fourth phase is only unlocked after Adriano has restored a sufficient amount of the world's color. I won't spoil the details of this phase, but it's quite intense!\n\nThere is also a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players where you compete to color a monochrome landscape as fast and as accurately as possible. There are some connectivity issues on the PC version, but with a bit of patience it shouldn't be hard to gather players for some creative painting fun.\n\nI give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay, which is both fun and addictive. The competitive multiplayer mode is particularly riveting, and many an evening was swallowed up in endless sessions of painting masterpieces with my fellow art enthusiasts from all over the world.\n\n\nStory (7/10)\nPrepare to Dye does not have a very complex storyline, but it doesn't need one, either. It's a family game for casual painting fun, and the plot reflects this. It's simple enough that a child can grasp it, but even adults will appreciate the tale of Adriano in the monochrome world. The twist at the end will also likely surprise most players, even if there are some clues to this twist scattered throughout the game. This is only obvious in retrospect, however.\n\nI give the story a 7/10, because while the story is not particularly advanced it does get the job done. It suits the game, and does not get too ambitious or take itself too seriously. It's a story anyone can jump into and enjoy.\n\n\nCharacters (6/10)\nThe primary characters are Adriano and Francesco. Adriano is a cheerful young artist with a knack for making those around him smile. His optimistic and carefree nature allowed him to avoid the influence of the monochrome world, and he now wants to restore color to the rest of the world. Francesco, his talking dog, is similar to his owner in many ways, but has a knack for clever wordplay that sometimes goes over Adriano's head. Nonetheless, the player won't be able to stop laughing at his wonderful jokes.\n\nThe personalities of the Colors are not particularly complicated, and are mostly covered in the section about gameplay above. There are certain characters later in the game worth mentioning, but spoiling the nature of these characters would not be fair to would-be players.\n\nWhile the characters are quite endearing, I can't give this section more than 6/10. There is little in the way of character development, and there isn't a lot of character variation.\n\n\nControls: (4/10)\nDark Souls: Prepare To Dye Edition was ported from the Nintendo Wii to PC, and as a port it does have some issues. The original game relied heavily on the Wiimote's motion control for the painting parts of the game, and this was only awkwardly replaced with a system using the mouse and keyboard on PC.\n\nIt's difficult to play the game as intended on PC, and many blame the rushed release of the PC version for this. There are mods to fix the controls, but, despite this, I can't really give the game more than a 4/10 for the controls as they are by default. While the developers did have a difficult job porting a motion control game to the PC, they should have taken their time to properly implement the controls, rather than rushing the port like they did.\n\n\nGraphics (7/10)\nAs I already mentioned, the game was ported from the Nintendo Wii, and the port is less than ideal. This can also be seen in the graphics, as the game doesn't support resolutions a PC player would consider acceptable. While this too can be fixed with mods, it should still be considered a problem with the port.\n\nResolutions aside, the game itself is absolutely gorgeous. The haunting and simplistic beauty of the monochrome world is only surpassed by the gorgeous and vibrant landscapes that result from restoring color to the world. While the designs of the characters are significantly more simplistic by comparison, they suit the overall atmosphere of the game. In many ways they resemble characters from a children's picture book.\n\nDespite the issues with resolutions, I give the graphics a 7/10. The low resolution makes the game seem significantly older than it is, but even with this handicap the game looks gorgeous. With mods it might be one of the most beautiful titles on Steam.\n\n\nSound (8/10)\nFrom Software is well known for its upbeat and catchy tunes, and Prepare to Dye is certainly no exception to this rule. In the monochrome world, the music is somber, but as color is restored to the world, the music grows livelier and more colorful as well. Once color is fully restored, the music gives you a happy sense of accomplishment. It's like an auditory representation of the canvas Adriano restored to life.\n\nThe voice acting is a bit cheesy, however. The stereotypical Italian accents of Adriano and Francesco get more endearing once you get used to it, but the fact that the Colors and the other NPCs have standard American accents is a bit off-putting.\n\nThat said, the voice acting can't pull down the overall sound score too much, as dialogue is not very important in Prepare to Dye. The music speaks more for the game than the voices do, and so I give the game an 8/10 for sound.\n\n\nConclusion (7/10)\nOverall I give this game a 7/10. While it has many issues, it's a gorgeous classic made by a beloved game developer. I highly recommend giving it a try if you enjoy painting and art in general.","June 23, 2014","true","302.8"," 498 of 677 people (74%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","74","498","677","10","36"

I literally jumped from my desk, raised my hands in the air and screamed "YES!", as my headphones ripped out of the jack and my speakers came alive, in the middle of a solo between the ghostbusters theme and sonic the hedgehog yelling in his ever so annoying voice "FOLLOW ME, SET ME FREE, TRUST ME AND WE CAN ESCAPE FROM THE CITY"\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nI can't imagine how to describe the experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stug/recommended/211420/","stug","Stuggernaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stug/","157 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I have never played Demon Souls, and I play Dark Souls 2 (See my review) before I played this.  I was waiting for GFWL to be gone.\n\nOnward.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS: After playing DS2, my first thought on DS1 was "Wow this game looks bad".  I thought it was grainy and ugly and honestly had a hard time.  A friend recommended I get DSFIX and some other tweaks and the game looked and ran much better after that.\n\nThis game is NOT DS2, I learned that pretty quickly.  I was a cheesy ranged magic user in DS2 and in this one, I hated magic right off the bat, it was so slow.  I was forced to learn melee play more than I had before.  Man did I start to finally learn some mechanics I missed even after an entire play-through of DS2.  I learned how to properly roll and dodge, how to properly parry and back-stab.  Fun stuff.  I mean I had done it before, but then crutched out on ranged combat so never had to master it.\n\nNot to say I did not use ranged in this game.  I just used a Bow to pull certain enemies and kill others.  More fun than magic.\n\nCONTROL: Again, I am doing this backwards since I played DS2 first.  Once you have it down, the game controls well.  It seems a lot cleaner than DS2, tighter.  I did not seem to get "cheap" shotted as much.  If you played DS2 first like me, you'll be fine.\n\nCOMBAT: Fluid, scary!!  The enemies hit HARD, all of them, and as I said above, the control is key to getting good at the combat.  Ranged piercing hits are kind of overpowered so get a weapon that does that to ease things up a bit if you are having problems.\n\nThe bosses in this game I had heard were hard.  Some of them to be honest simply kicked the living crap out of me so often it is embarrassing.  I am a slow learner but I don't get frustrated.  Watch the boss mechanics, move around a lot, and be SMART with your blocks and stamina and all bosses become much easier.  I HATED the Stray Demon and all things like him (@&^*%#@&^% those things).\n\nSTORY: As with DS2, I did not follow the story much.  This game is all about fighting for me.  I thought DS2 had more interesting characters that followed you through the game more though.  Quite possible I missed something though.\n\nWORLD: Holy hell did I get confused by this world.  I had no clue where to go first, what to do, etc.  I felt less hand held and directed than I was in DS2.  I frequently went to areas that were WAY too hard for me (hollow Catacombs and Tomb!) way before I should be there.  I found myself repeating areas over and over to just practice combat and build up souls for weapon improving more that anything for a long time\n\nEventually I learned how the entire world links together VERY well, and it is all connected and loops together brilliantly.  The fact that you can't warp around right from the start (You can later... way later for me ;P) is actually a blessing in disguise.\n\nOTHER: I put 120+ hrs into this game before I finally beat it.  If this review is anything like my DS2 one.  Someone will tell me how much I suck.  Well, so what if I suck.  I had 120+ hours of fun and have put in 20+ more since.\n\nI would love to see a "Collection" edition that had Demon Souls so I could play that one.  Bloodborne will make me buy a PS4 simply because it is a "Dark Souls" type game.\n\nI loved this game, I loved part 2 (I play to play a melee only DS2 run now ;P)\n\nGo play it.","January 18, 2015","true","210.7"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","59","64","5","11"

They were correct!\n\n"Welcome to Dark Souls, traveller. Your quest has just begun."\n\n"What must I do?"\n\n"First, you must go to the Microsoft website to install Games for Windows Live. Beware: Microsoft calls it Games for Windows Marketplace Client now so it is immune to your google searches. Also, beware of the GFWL client bundled with this game for it is an imposter that won't work on Windows 8.x."\n\n"I can handle that, for I am brave of heart! I'm off..."\n\n"Wait, traveller! That is not all."\n\n"What else must I do?"\n\n"You must visit the xbox live website using a web browser and accept the terms of service. Do not be fooled by the login screen within the game. It will slay you with error 8015403A."\n\n"Very well."\n\n"Your next challenge shal be entering your GFWL username and password."\n\n"I know it. That is not a problem."\n\n"Memorize it well, for you will need to type it in 4 - nay - 5 times afore the install is done. Learn to type it in your sleep! The checkboxes which claim to remember your password for you make false promises!"\n\n"Thank you, inkeeper. I shal leave forthwith..."\n\n"Wait! There is more."\n\n"Very well, what else must I do?"\n\n"You must enter a CD Key."\n\n"But... those have been extinct for decades!"\n\n"One still lives, in the context menu of your steam library. Fetch it and type it into the game, for only with the CD Key can you play."\n\n"Okay... what else?"\n\n"Hast thou developed skill in downloading?"\n\n"Haha! I have you there. I've already downloaded the whole game and the GFWL installer."\n\n"I'm sorry to tell you, but your downloads have only started. The GFWL installer will update itself at about 1meg per minute... and after the game installs it will want to update GFWL again."\n\n"But.. surely you jest. No download hath gone that slow since the dark ages!"\n\n"Just be prepared."\n\n"No game is worth this. I'm going to go play Dragon Age: Origins."\n\n"Yeah, about that... have you heard of Origin?"\n\n"Nooooooooooooooooooooo...."\n\nEDIT: The latest version of this game has added steamworks and removed GFWL - so really, these complaints don't apply anymore.

This is my first time going through this game and must i say the emersiveness and skill base meant for this game is mindblowing. I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse and i truly feel i need a controller with this game. The game has some intense action based attacks and realstic movements. I have to say this is one of the most intuitive and intense games i have ever played. As much as i die in this game shows how much i want to play more and more in this game.\n\nThis game will test you, psychologically, cognitively, and embark you in some many challenges you'll finally know what it's like to actually play A GAME! This isn't one of those story driven easy to play games you normally play on playstation or Xbox. This isn't the typical pc game that you play to push competitive play... This is a game that challenges YOU on how fast you can adapt, how fast you can learn and how fast anticipate your oppoent and survive. This game has survival base to it, it has strategy to it and it puts you in the mentality to want to win, want to survive, and want to finish it and kill those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that killed you and stole you 3000 souls.... STUPID DEMON PIECES OF ....... *whew* sorry lost myself there.....\n\n\nAnyways i recommend this game... Expect to be challenged.... Expect to die.... and Expect to come out being a better gamer with this game. Enjoy it...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/211420/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","Dark Souls is one of my absolute favorite games of the generation.\n\nIt features a giant interconnected world with tons of hidden areas to explore.\n\nThe game is challenging but not overwhelming so. Dying is a necessary aspect of learning the game but once you get the hang of it, progression can offer a very strong sense of accomplishment.\n\nThe combat is rock solid and skill based with each of the weapons having their very own unique move-set.\n\nDark Souls has RPG elements and an extremely unique multiplayer component. It's set up as a single player game but you can occasionally see the ghosts of other players which can offer hints on where (or where not to go). Players can also leave notes for one another and can be summoned to help with the many bosses. On the other hand, they can also invade your world and attempt to kill you.\n\nDark Souls also offers plenty of replayability. It's not uncommon to spend 50 hours or so on your initial playthrough and once you complete the game, it has a New Game+ where everything becomes increasingly difficult. I've played through the game four times on Xbox and it never gets old.\n\nJust make sure you play the game with a controller as it isn't very keyboard and mouse friendly.\n\nFor a more indepth and thorough review, check out my video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6DKswlFrwI\n\nDark Souls has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation.

I purchased the game on the idea of a challenge and a skill cap that I would want to pop but that proves to be harder than I first thought.\n\nA friend starts talking to me on steam just as I see the first boss and tells me the joy that can come from Dark Souls. I listen and I quickly see what the game has to offer and I also notice that my friend will be my mentor through this experience. After just under 10 lives I manage to kill the first boss and arive at Lordan. After speaking to a guy who seems to know more about myself than I do, I realise that the goal of the game is to reach a destination of some sort.\n\nI then go forward and find that I must defeat pairs of skeletons... who are overpowerd and after 10 or so lives I realise I need to do something different. I go down there and rush.. without even looking at the skeletons and see a shield. I die quickly after and the go back down to look for other items. By now I have realised how the soul system of the game works and that if I die I must retreve my souls from the spot I have died. I level up my dexterity because that seems to be what I need and go for many more runs with each life teaching my more about the combat of the game.\n\nI start to give up alittle bit but then my guide (friend) replys after being afk. My question is "Am I doing something wrong" and proceed to tell him about the skeletons. He then replys with a quick tip, "Try seeking a plan B route". It hits me. I have been going the wrong direction the whole time. I quickly find a stair route that have much weaker enemies in it. My new weakness... grouped up enemies that attack shortly after one another while you are downed and/or recovering. Quickly I begin to realise that they must be seperated and try just that.\n\n2 Hours pass and countless lives go along with them. Keeping calm and learning from my mistakes and such. Finally I get to a tower-ish area, do you go up or down? I go up and walk along a bridge area. BOOM, a boss... much to powerful for my equipment and I. So I die... go back and choose to go down and am met with a boss. You know what happened... don't you?!\n\n~Day 1 - This game... its hard to believe it was made so long ago for something that wants to challenge you in such a way... and I love it!","September 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","43","48","8","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/betacyanin/recommended/211420/","betacyanin","betacyanin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/betacyanin/","65 products in account","Don't get greedy. This is the golden rule of Dark Souls, and the key to your success or failure playing it.\n\nStory-wise, the game is deceptively simple. At first appearance there is little information given, you are told almost nothing and given a surprisingly large world to fight in. But this is what a lot of people love about Dark Souls - you get out of it what you put into it. Dig a little bit below the surface and there is actually a vast lore with tons of information, detective work and speculation for you to piece together if you are perceptive and observant. Item descriptions tell an entire world's worth of details, occasional lines of NPC small talk reveal facts that can expand the lore by surprising amounts, details in the landscape give inferences to greater world events. The only times you are directly told something important you can be sure as hell the tellers have an angle they are pushing and it probably isn't the full picture.\n\nWorld design-wise, you have a surprisingly large stage to explore and, most importantly, it *feels* like you are exploring a massive land in a fading world rather than a set of different levels. Just about everywhere in the game is interconnected and criss-crosses with other areas in some way, you can walk from one area to another and then look back and see exactly where you came from and look forwards and know you'll eventually get there (and sometimes even see tiny orange player messages in the distance, which is a nice touch). The shortcuts exemplify this, it genuinely feels like everything is one large castle.\n\nMechanics-wise, see the first sentence. This is a game of patience and cat-and-mouse baiting. Lure enemies into one-on-one combat, don't get flanked, learn when to tank and when to evade, plan your attack movements, use everything and anything to your advantage. Death has little meaning as everything lost on death can be infinitely regained, so it becomes a learning mechanism rather than a punishment. Sometimes the lesson may be 'go elsewhere' or 'try a different method.'\n\nCharacter building can vary greatly. Do you want to be a heavy knight with a massive weapon, or a dexterous archer, or a tactical mage? The beginning class choice is essentially meaningless in the long run, it just determines what gear you start with and gives you some stats you'd have even with a different class (eg you'll probably end up putting some points into faith so for the heal miracle regardless of your build). You can effectively beat the game with almost any playstyle or build, though some are definitely easier than others.\n\nUse humanity at a bonfire to un-hollow yourself and you can summon other players to help you fight areas and bosses at the risk of being invaded and killed by someone else. There are also NPCs who can be summoned and even invade you, which is nice if you're offline, though there are sometimes conditions for summoning them such as them having been in the previous boss fight or them invading you and defeating them.\n\nThere are some spots it suffers from poor design, let's be honest. These are generally not so much in terms of enemies or player options but in terms of terrain and meshes - the Great Hollow is a good example of this, sometimes you will go flying down and to the side to your death because god forbid you touched the wrong angled mesh despite having had an apparently clear angle to your destination. The Bed of Chaos is especially obnoxious with this, but the less said about that the better. The Painted World doesn't mesh with the rest of the game very well, it's more or less where the devs put half-finished ideas that they didn't want to throw out, which is a pity because information on the stage itself and boss are very interesting but rather undeveloped and could have been expanded on much more (I was especially disappointed that I couldn't return the doll to its owner). Most of the game has excellent level design, however, the exceptions to this are only exceptions and not the rule.\n\nI am not skilled enough at pvp to really go into it, look elsewhere for an analysis on that. I will say that in my experience pvp has been annoyingly full of longer-range bleed weapons and little else in terms of variety, lag is also very much present and will lead to you missing when you clearly connected and getting hit or backstabbed when you were clear across the area.\n\nAll in all, brilliant game that you will probably quit the first time you play it then come back to much later and eventually enjoy. Takes time to 'get it' which can be considered both a major weakness of it and a massive strength to it. Just about every bit of progress you've made (both in-game and in understanding/learning the game) is a result of your own effort and accomplishment, very little is given to you so again you get out of it what you put into it.\n\nNote that due to the devs self-admittedly being inexperienced at PC porting, there are some native issues. These are mostly fixed by getting DSfix and configuring it for whatever needs to be tweaked for your setup.","October 18, 2014","true","258.4"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

The new XCOM is a game that ♥♥♥♥♥ you over by letting your squadmates perma-die, roguelikes often ♥♥♥♥ you over by starting the game over when you die. Those are features added to make the game harder and while I have nothing wrong with either if they're implemented well, Dark Souls uses subtraction, which is a subtler bouquet.\n\nSo modern gaming conveniences that are generally thought of as necessary for smooth gameplay have been thrown aside. So while I don't think the bosses in Dark Souls (which are generally regarded as being brutal) are tougher on paper than any other third-person action game of this type  (they don't take a ludicrous amount of damage, attack patterns aren't hard to learn) the game doesn't do you any favors in getting past them. When you die you don't immediately respawn at the start of the battle and have to work your way back, you can't load up on enough health items to forgo learning the boss's patterns.\n\nPlaying Dark Souls is like giving up your smart phone for a day. "Oh wow, it is possible to exist without being connected to eleven different social networks while being in perpetual contact with hunderds of people!" I'm not saying I want every game to wantonly cut the fat like Dark Souls, but it's nice to know that I don't need my hand held, that I can be expected to figure out a crafting system on my own, that I can be expected to discover things without any prompting. It's all very empowering.\n\nI also think Dark Souls makes some smart choices to distinguish itself from similar RPGs. First off it doesn't feature an open world. I'm not a huge fan of open worlds. I think it's more challenging to craft a small gameworld where every step is deliberately placed, every nook and cranny there for a reason, than to make a big ♥♥♥ map and then scatter a few waypoints even across it. Every thing you find and every where you go in Dark Souls feels like you figured out and uncovered rather than just being something you stumbled upon. Plus, if you get stuck in one direction and feel like exploring you know you're always going to find something new if you push along that path you were stuck at before. You're never going to waste your time because the developer didn't drop something cool where you decided to explore.\n\nDark Souls also handles weapons and armor brilliantly. There are very few inately bad weapons and none that so completely out-class others that they make other options pointless. You find a weapon with a moveset you like and then, with upgrades through the crafting system you can take that weapon all the way to the final boss. It's a perfect way to defeat the RPG trope of, reach new town, buy new weapon/armor set, fight boss.\n\nOf course Dark Souls is a game that requires dedication and patience. Not everyone will have the time and attention to dedicate 80+ hours to get through. If you do though it's a unique and satisfying experience.","December 18, 2013","true","99.1"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","1"

The main problems I notice is that the keyboard controls make absolutely no sense at all and that the button tutorials at the beginning are actually for an Xbox controller, which I was not using so they did not help me at all. I can understand that it's highly recommended to use a controller, but since I'm playing this on a PC I should be able to use a keyboard if that's what I prefer or if it's all I have. The keyboard controls could have easily been done better. I pressed every single key and not a single one of them opened up the main game menu. I had to force quit the game just so I could get back to the title screen and the options menu. And again, it just looks extemely lazy to reuse the tutorials from the Xbox version when someone is playing with a keyboard on a PC.\n\nThe other main thing I have to complain about with this port is the performance issues. I experience constant framerate drops while playing that make this game almost as unplayable as the controls do. However, I have heard that basically everyone who buys this game for PC has the same problems, and as a result there are mods out there that fix these problems and--I have to admit--actually seem to make this version perform better than the console version. But am I the only one who thinks that it's a major flaw when a game needs to be modded just to be playable?\n\nAll I can end with is: if you own a Playstation 3 or an Xbox 360, you would be saving yourself a tremendous amount of trouble by just getting the console version of this game. I have played this game on 360 and the controls are great and the performance is flawless (with the exception of the notorious Blighttown framerate).\n\n\n\nTL;DR  This game is unplayable without modding it to improve performance and using a controller. If you don't own a controller and/or don't want to mod the game, then you're better off getting the console version if you own a PS3 or 360.\n\n\nEDIT: Calling this port unplayable may not be entirely accurate and a little harsh. I personally went out and purchased an Xbox controller and spent an entire afternoon modding the game, and now I have to say I find it better than the console version of the game. But I still have to say that this game will be VERY difficult for anyone to enjoy in its default state. I still cannot for the life of me set up the keyboard controls in a way that is comfortable or at least not confusing (also still never found a key for the menu in the default controls). Also, I don't know if I'm in the majority or the minority with the performance problems. Most people I've talked to or heard talk about this port highly recommend the DSfix mod to make the game run more smoothly. So this is a common problem but not a problem that every single person who downloads the game experiences.\n\nAfter tweaking the game myself I think I can say that if you're someone who doesn't mind using a controller and possibly going out of your way to install a mod or two, then I recommend this game to you 110% (assuming of course you know what Dark Souls is and what you're getting yourself into). But I am still going to leave this as a negative review, because what I'm reviewing here is how the game is in its present default state, not how it is with a controller and a bit of modding. And frankly, in its default state this port is just...bad.","November 29, 2015","false","13.3"," 300 of 465 people (65%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","65","300","465","23","28"

That's what I thought while shopping in Asda one day, and so I picked up the phsyical edition of the game. After installing Microsft's DRM service, Games for Windows Live, and discovering the game didn't want to link to my Steam account, I started playing. While Dark Souls is an incredibly fun game, I just can't recommend it while it still has Games for Window's Live attached to it. After the service managed to delete my account, meaning I couldn't save my game, I decided to buy it on Steam in the sales so as to be able to actually have a save file. And guess what? The game still makes me use GfWL, and now the service is refusing to let me log in at all - meaning it will be impossible to ever save my game.

They changed the way I look at ARPGs with the fantastic combat and the open worlds you can play within. The combat is just amazing with every weapon having different mechanics and animations so you can try tons of different styles of  gameplay from big swords to daggers to dual wielding to being a pokey turtle with a spear and giant shield.  Not just melee, but Pyromancy, Sorcery, and Miracles are available too with their wands and gloves and can all be used by every player if your skills are good enough. Don't forget to use the items too for some fun ways of attackign enemies like poison arrows and darts.\n\nThis game is an RPG with a story that isn't spoon fed to you. This series tells a story through item descriptions and other obscure places. It is a world of lore that is found through reading items and very few cutscenes. You awaken in this world and everyone is just as crazy as you will feel.\n\nYou upgrade your levels by collecting souls to increase your attributes, which allow you to wield more weapons and cast different magics. STamina is important. Very important. Don't skimp on it.\n\nThis series introduced a fascinating online mechanic. While I like the messages and the blood stains more in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls still has them. Messages can be left from other players that can either help, or trick you into a death. These are all pre-written messages and you choose from a list for obvious reasons. Blood stains allow you to view how other explorers have died! Sometimes these are hilarious.\n\nThe big online aspect , however is the PvP and the co-op it provides. If you have used Humanity to get into human form you can be INVADED by other players on the server at any time as long as you have not killed the area boss. "XXXXXX Has Invaded ....." starts the heart pumping immediately as you play cat and mouse while you search each other out. Ultimately one of you finds the other with a sneak attack, or you just make a friendly bow and start to circle each other for a one on one fight to the death! You can even have summoned phantoms help you out if you find their summon signs first to fell these invaders.\n\nThe Co-op aspect works like the messages where summon signs are placed upon the ground and you can summon Blue Phantoms (other players) to help you through the area and ultimately defeat the boss.\n\nDark Souls also introduced Covenants, which allow you to join mysterious groups within the world. Each group has different benefits for members. They will put you in a bullseye for more invaders, allow you to team up easier for co-op with friendly players, give you extra powers, and many more things. Several of these are available and can be joined when found and leaving another Covenant.\n\nWhile the online aspects are intriguing this game is at its heart a single player game. One that can be played with the threat of invasions by staying in Human form, or completely alone by playing offline, or as a Hollow.\n\nThis game isn't a PvP game, while many will try to make it one. This edition does offer an Arena, however with the new DLC to play PvP as much as you want without having to search for players to invade in the world itself. The main way to play this is to think of it as a single player game with online elements. These online elements add to the difficulty as there is no AI that can give you the challenge that a human player can. These invasions are to put a kink in your exploration and make the world even more dangerous.\n\nThe PC port graphically isn't the greatest, however. Most players have downloaded the mod named DSFix (search google) to help with some of the technical aspects of the game. Dark Souls has its own Nexus site and is completely compatible with the Nexus Mod Manager like the Elder Scrolls and Fallout games have, but these are mostly cosmetic as adding anythign that could impact other players would be illegal for an online experience. A bunch of other graphical upgrades are available as well as the ability to replace the gamepad buttons like to PS3 buttons for those of us that use a PS3 controller, and many other controller buttons are there too for peopel that like Logitech.\n\nThis series is one that you should not miss. If you have a Playstation 3 try getting and playing Demon's Souls first, however as this has changed some of the gameplay a bit. My best surprise in gaming ever was Demon's Souls buying it on a whim the first week it came out. It is an epic adventure. I believe that the servers are actually still Live as well so you should be able to play online last I checked.","December 7, 2013","true","144.5"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","42","51","0","3"

It feels like the developers have been isolated from society for several years while making this game, and never had any idea of the standards that have been set in modern game development.\nThe standards where button mashing is always a legitimate option, where the player's hand is held with constant instruction and navigational aid (even to the point where games play themselves), where there is no consequence for dying.\n\nThis game is oblivious to all of that. The combat is extremely satisfying; complex and risky, without being overly convoluted. Button mashing WILL get you killed right away. Every weapon has its own moveset, handling, and attributes.

The difficulty of the game was NOT the reason for the thumbs down.  yes it is hard and it is really damn annoying at times, but it is extremely rewarding to finally make it through whatever boss or section of a map that you are playing.   The reason that I give it a thumbs down is largely because of how bad of a port the game was.   The graphics could have been enhanced more but they were good enough to get the job done, so that's a very very minor reason.   The issue with the port was the learning curve on what keys from the Xbox controller were corresponded to the keys on the computer.   I tried so hard to figure it out and got most of the things down but it was so frustrating.   But the worse part, was the mouse.  I used mods to fix it but it kept turning at 90deg turns and made it annoying to stay still.   And then finally, the "focus on enemy" feature, whatever it was called, was so bad because even when you would focus on one enemy, your mouse would grab another one and thus leave you wide open and in this game, that can cost you dearly.\n\nIf they only cared enough to have changed the controls (especially the on screen buttons -.- then it would have been better to play, but they didn't.   I think this is better to just play on the console, rather than the PC.\n\nTL;DR  The game itself, is great, although tough, but the PC version of is a really bad port  UNLESS you use controller, which makes it much much easier to play.   As for KB&M users, use the mods made by players, or just get a controller.","December 24, 2013","false","14.2"," 452 of 727 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","452","727","2","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/211420/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It's certainly novel for a game's subtitle to boast of your impending slaughter, but Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is unusual in most respects. Its combat is abnormally precise, its narrative is largely embedded within optional NPC interactions, and its multiplayer features are unconventional and initially largely hidden. While the PC version is a shabby port, there is simply no other action RPG out there like Dark Souls, which is so good that it adversely affected my opinion of how all previous RPGs handled combat.\n\nHowever, I must start out with a warning: the PC port is a disappointing wasted opportunity to technically improve on the console version of Dark Souls, and it lacks many features you probably expect as standard. The resolution is locked at 1280x720 (aka 720p), the framerate is locked at 30fps, and there are no high resolution textures. There's a mouse & keyboard control option, but control is so bad that it's not practical, so you'll definitely want a gamepad to play. Fortunately, there's a must-have unofficial patch available that improves the rendering resolution. With it, everything looks much crisper, although you're stuck with low-resolution textures.\n\nThat said, Dark Souls is still an amazing game. There's no hand-holding - to succeed, you need to invest time diligently exploring, learning the combat system, and developing your skills to overcome challenges. The open-world design makes it likely that you'll wander into high-level areas that'll mercilessly slap some perspective into your character. It's a tough, but fair experience. Deaths aren't cheap, but success needs to be well earned.\n\nDark Souls – likes it predecessor – is a third-person dungeon crawl at its core. In the almost overbearingly gloomy realm of Lordran, a sizeable open-world that you’ll explore high and low, threats loom just about anywhere you look. From a few established hubs in the world, you’ll expand outward, constantly facing adversity in the endless gnarled faces of ever-dangerous creatures that stand between you and ending the calamotous period called the Age of Fire…or, if the tone of the world sucks you under, to usher in a different calamity entirely. The game’s plot is purposely minimalistic and tells its story through the limitations of its sparsely populated world. Like most everything else in the game, the flavour of the game’s lore and plot is largely left with the player’s curiousity and interpretation, which suits it just fine. Dark Souls is a game focused squarely on combat that demands precision, smarts, and persistence.\n\nMost action-oriented games place you in frenetic fights that move swiftly, and although fluidity is very much a key to success in Dark Souls, the combat here feels weighty and deliberate. Your character’s movements, burdened with heavy armour and weaponry, feel appropriately strained. You can’t make a last minute dodge out of harm’s way or just mash on the attack button, either. Every action in the game is methodical yet extremely powerful if used judiciously and properly. Each blow you land and fatal swipe you dodge is the result of skilled observation and timing, of knowing your characters strengths and limits and exploiting each to the fullest. Know your character and pull your punches wisely, and you’ll slay the toughest of foes. Attack wildly and evade flippantly, and you’ll soon find your enemies taking advantage of your every misstep.\n\nDeath is swift and common in Dark Souls, though it’s never an end. In fact, your character will likely be dead – or “hollowed” – for much of your play time, complete with a decayed and eyeless face. Each time you die, you’ll lose all of the souls you accrued from enemies – which serve as both experience points to upgrade your stats and currency to purchase items – and respawn at the last bonfire you visited, which serve as sigh-relieving points of rest in the game world. Bonfires refill your stock of estus flasks – the game’s healing item – as well as recharge uses of your spells. Yet even these points of safety come with a catch; use a bonfire, and all enemies excepting bosses respawn, ready to make an attempt on your life once more.\n\nThe game’s death mechanics also introduce yet another unique aspect to Dark Souls – the importance and privelige of being alive. Although your character handles the same way no matter their state, using valuable Humanity items at a bonfire to turn your character back into a living being opens up a ton of online connectivity features. Although you can’t play Dark Souls in a multiplayer setting or set up matchmaking with your friends, each individual player does slightly connect to all others. You may see ghostly images of other players appear around you, real-time feed of where they are and what they’re doing in their own game. When you’re alive, you can find and use items to summon players into your game temporarily, using them to help you clear more difficult sections.\n\nUltimately, you get out what you put in to Dark Souls. There’s a dizzying amount of nuance and detail in the game’s setting, level design and combat, and it only gets more engrossing as you sink your teeth in further. The more you change up your fighting style and take risks, the more you learn about what makes the enemies tick, and brings possible methods for felling them to the surface. There’s no easing you into play mechanics or tips popping up on screen to give you a hand in Dark Souls. You not only need to take chances and be proactive in your approach to its many challenges, you need to remember everything that works and apply it skillfully.\n\nEquipment choices can have more than one impact - heavy armor not only blocks more damage than lighter equipment, it also makes your character less likely to be thrown off balance when hit. Large shields have great stability, which allows your blocks to use less stamina, but light shields allow you to better land devastating ripostes. Some weapons inflict damage dependent upon attributes such as Strength. If you've neglected the attributes that modify weapon damage, you can instead use elemental weapons that don't rely upon attribute modifiers, or chaos weapons that scale with consumable Humanity points. If you find it difficult to get parry timing down, ignore it and use heavy shields for blocking or rely more upon rolling. Enemies and items don't scale in strength as you level, so if you become skilled enough at combat you can complete the storyline and grab the most powerful equipment as a very low-level character.\n\nThe Prepare to Die Edition also adds three new areas that provide some new insight into the setting's history: a crumbling cityscape, a forest, and an area of the Abyss that's haunted by Humanity ghosts. The cityscape is the only one that impresses, as the others feel too redundant next to the original content, but the new enemies make them worth playing, including some misshapen humanoids with headstalks that can be seen in darkness and some tough stone guardians who slam their hammer so viciously into the ground that yanking them out causes an explosion of turf.\n\nThe new bosses include the fallen Knight Artorias, a key figure in the lore, and a ferocious Dragon which is so tough that he's an optional fight. All of the new bosses are frenetic and extremely aggressive combatants, making them at least as tough as those in the original areas. One of those original bosses also makes a very welcome reappearance, in a manner that both fits well with established lore and gives a different tone to the original encounter.\n\nWith its high difficulty, punitive checkpoint system, and trial-and-error gameplay, Dark Souls isn't for everyone. But with the Prepare to Die Edition, PC gamers finally have a version of Dark Souls to call their own, and longtime fans of the game have some new content to work with. Graphical hiccups aside, that makes this port a success.","March 13","true","117.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","1"

But persevering in the face of hardships yields results soon enough nad going back to a boss the next day only to beat it on the first try gives an huge sense of accomplishment. And that's really the whole game in a nutshell, bashing your face against difficult zones, strong enemies and huge bosses to eventually come out victorious once you get the hang of it.\n\nThe difficulty that made the series famous sadly stems, in part, from the camera: it works decently most of the time but while fighting huge bosses/ mobs or traversing cramped spaces it can act up badly: and when it does you might not see an hit coming or simply become disoriented and die with little to no way to react. A few encounters are also designed in a purposedly cheap way...have to traverse a thin strip of stone over an huge chasm? We'll add ranged mobs just to ensure you might die a cheap death. These encounters feel outright annoying rather than challenging...same goes for having to walk over invisible platforms or fighting in almost pitch darkness, I did it and eventually made it but I felt relief rather than accomplishment in doing so.\n\nBut even with all its flaws the game is a memorable experience, for me it was about going against overwhelming odds and persevering even in the face of multiple defeats: to try until you succeed, to know that there's always a way to come out on top, eventually. And it was also a story about sacrifice both in its plot and the actual game mechanics.\n\nIs this a game for you? Maybe, maybe not...it's not as difficult as certain people make it out to be (and if you're really frustrated or scared to tackle it, just read a guide to have a slightly easier experience) but it surely demands quite a bit of skill and lots of concentration to go through. And even if you can't beat it I feel even just a few hours with the game could be worth it even just for the cathartic experience it's able to provide.","April 30","true","41.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","30","32","2","2"

And here I was... thinking that I could try Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition again. Although I never really did try it for real before. For some reason it had huge performance issues on my former PC - which was not bad in any regard. Anyway my new high-end PC and the community-patch I've installed made it a smooth ride so far.\n\nWhen Dark Souls II came out I tried it.. and almost immediately ragequitted it. It made me think that I would never ever like a Dark Souls-title. Well.. I was so wrong. It took Dark Souls 1 just a few hours to hook me and really get me into it. I found myself on several occasions during the last few days feeling this urge and thought: "I want to play more Dark Souls... I want to get into the next area, find another cool weapon, fight the next boss and more..."\n\nIt really took me by surprise that a game - I thought I would hate & ragequitt after the first few deaths - could get me so invested and leave me with a desire for more.

There are quite a few optional places to go, lots of loot to find, and many enemies to kill along the way. Take your time and absorb all of the information the game throws at you, enjoy your first experience through the game.

With an iron gauntlet. Spiked. Repeatedly. Telling you to toughen up, learn to dodge, block and/or parry, and above all, fight back.\n\nBut it's fair at that - when you do learn how to block, dodge, fight back, then you truly know you do deserve that power fantasy feeling. Or deserved to die for failing to dodge or misstepping that ledge and plunging into ever so eagerly welcoming embrace of gravity.\n\nCome here if you want to know what a game designed ground up to be challenging, but fair, means. As opposed to misnaming ♥♥♥♥ easy difficulty as "normal" and then making "hard" just by halfheartedly upping sponginess and numbers of enemies.\n\nBeware though, this game really does not hold your hand in any way and you barely get any pointers what to do or where to go, or what various things mean or do - you may end up needing to do some research on wikis etc.\n\nThe game has interesting take on multiplayer, creating peer to peer network of game worlds (citing temporal anomalies in game lore) that enables various interactions between players. But that, in terms of PvP, I wouldn't call fair, as the game is min maxer's and twinker's paradise and you *will* get totally funked up by relatively overpowered real human adversaries, which, unlike PvE enemies, will give no room to breathe whatsoever. Unless you become one of them, or play majority of game in "hollow" state which doesn't let you summon help but also prevents other players from invading your world to kill you.\n\nBut yeah that summoning of help, letting willing players help you kill bosses - or trying to help others yourself - is part of multiplayer experience as well, along with getting that feeling of shared struggle, seeing various messages left by others or just their apparitions as they hang out by the bonfire or fight in their own world.. and die.\n\nThe world design is really great (though I think designers had some fetish towards flying buttresses which suspiciously often feature as the only bridge forward). All in all the world is not too huge, and not too open, but is very interconnected, like a tree becoming a graph, opening up more and more, where completing one segment allows you to open a shortcut to places you already visited. It's always a great feeling, recognizing some place you've already been to, now approaching it from a different side... Or even remembering that this ruin up on the hill you've seen the other day, now you're in it, looking down at the ruins you've been into a few days back.

This is the kind of game that is completely brutal but rewarding at the same time. I raged, and raged hard at some encounters, because this game holds nothing back, but it forces you to also think on your tactics as you progress through the game. It will give you all the tools you need to get through it, you just need to think and plan accordingly. And they are completely right, the feeling of accomplishment you get upon beating a particularly hard section or encounter is unlike any most games out there can give you. I especially enjoy how big monsters actually FEEL like big monsters, as in, they can easily crush you if you're not careful. It was a thrilling and challenging ride, but I loved it and it is now easily one of my favorite games of all time. Highly replayable as well, there are tons of secrets to find here.\n\nElaborating why I liked this game though, hell, even discussing the minimal detail on this game would actually derail and spoil you the experience, in my honest opinion. This is one of those games you're supposed to pick up and play, while going in completely blind. You'll be shafted many times, count on that, and you'll probably seethe with frustration, but you'll adapt, improve as a player, and maybe even overcome the challenges ahead. This is definitely not a game for everyone though, the difficulty is up there.\n\nThe port wasn't the best, but I did just fine using an Xbox 360 gamepad and DSFix, an unofficial fix that fixes many of the problems it has - http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix. I was able to go through the game quite well, barring one single crash, and some minor framerate issues here and there. That's better than what any Bethesda RPG can really claim in terms of performance, and I love the hell out of those games too.\n\nBottom line, if you have this game on Steam and didn't play it yet, I URGE you to finish this review, and go install it and play it right now. You may end up loving it or hating it, but either way, you won't come out indifferent to it. Even better, now that Steamworks has finally been implemented, you have no excuse. Go die lots of times, go curse that one boss who keeps kicking your ♥♥♥, it'll all be worth it once you finally manage to beat him down, I promise.\n\nPraise the Sun!","February 25, 2014","true","63.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","1"

There are some significant problems, though:\n\nIf you don't have a console, this game can be made playable. It is fun in of itself, but the PC version is marred by no patches, GFWL, and various bugs. Users have to install small patches manually and hope it works. If you do get it, MAKE SURE you do the patching and GFWL sign-in BEFORE attempting to play, else you will lose all progress.\n\nIf you have a console, GET IT FOR THE CONSOLE. It is challenging, even if people overestimate/overhype its difficulty.\n\nThe game itself is very rewarding with an insane level of depth and a very widespread community. Figuring out how to proceed with fights is immensely satisfying, yet it's punishing (but fair) if you make a mistake. (However, due to the buggy nature I will say that it's infuriating when a glitch occurs, and say there's a 2-second delay in you trying to drink a flask.) The fights are epic (and sometimes outright terrifying) and you truly get to build your character the way you want to play.\n\nAgain, though, the functionality leaves a lot to be desired. Even after patches I frequently run into a sound bug and a control bug, the the prior being irritating as hell and the latter which has cost me several deaths. (I'll click to use a flask while standing, and the move won't register til 1-2 seconds later when I try to raise my shield, instead raising my flask. This has resulted in me being hit and killed numerous times.)\n\nI got mine as a gift. I wouldn't've paid for it myself knowing the degree of functionality it is currently at. If you're more patient than I am, by all means go for it and enjoy it.\n\nI AM looking forward to Dark Souls II, however.","November 30, 2013","false","8.5"," 203 of 327 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","203","327","3","11"

The gameplay is sophisticated, but it isn't  too complicated once you understand the stats and what they mean. Controls are tight, and everything works as it should. The world is deep and rich with an interesting lore. You'll want to read item descriptions and pay close attention if you really want to understand the world From has crafted. The story of the game is very implicit, but the direction is clear if you talk to NPCs.\n\nMultiplayer is present in the game, with coop existing by summoning friendly phantoms to assist you in your world. There is also PvP, which is the main draw for me, and it's fantastic save occasional lag and balancing issues. One of the main problems with the game was that it used Games for Windows Live, but that's gone now and the multiplayer is better than ever. The PC Port is just god awful though. It's locked to a low resolution and framerate and the keyboard controls seem to have been designed by a monkey with half a brain. This is all fixed by Durante's mod DSFix, which is very easily installed. Once everything works as it should, the multiplayer of this game is phenomenal.\n\nOne thing I greatly dislike about this game is the "LOLOL DAK SOULZ SO HAAWD!" stuff. The game has a reputation for being brutally difficult and unfair, but that's just not true at all and it's really annoying. The game's difficulty comes from its punishing nature. If you make a mistake, you're gonna get messed up. Playing carefully is the only way forward (read: get good). Nothing about the game is intrinsically unfair; that's a construct applied to it by the kind of people that always blame lag when they die in multiplayer games.\n\nThe community in this game is fantastic as well, but it has its fair share of tryhard children that will send hatemail at the slightest infraction of their self-imposed moral code. I've gotten death threats for not bowing before a fight before. You learn to move past these people, and you find some of the funniest players on the planet. Youtubers like VaatiVidya, Iron Pineapple, and formerly OnlyAfro (Rest in Peace good Afro) make quality videos that add to the community of the game.\n\nIn summation, this game is a must-play for anyone that doesn't mind fixing a small amount of issues. The game is punishing, but never unfair and the multiplayer is to die for. Get it?\n\nAlso, Git Gud","December 18, 2014","true","135.8"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","21","21","2","0"

A game that you actually play\n\nSo many games now hold your hand so much that you are not even really playing the game, you are just clicking a series of actions to keep the game progressing.

The reward.\n\nThe insanely gratifying feeling when you kill that boss after so many tries, Get through that area to that fog door, Finally kill that Hacker who has invaded you 30 times. Nothing, and I MEAN NOTHING   compares to that feeling, Especially no other series.\n\nDark souls holds a special place in my heart, It has been there in the hard times in my life to take my mind somewhere new.

Any time you die, it is your fault it is something you didn't do, maybe you did not understand it yet. But that in its essence is what dark souls is. A game to help you understand. A game to help you overcome its challenges and make you better prepared for life.\n\nCause thats really in an essence how we deal with life, LIke a moth Flittering towards a flame.","February 18","true","713.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","2"

Especially during the first couple of hours. The learning curve is steep but is also super entertaining.

I died a lot, I sill do, but learning how the game works and how to defeat every ennemy by learning their patterns and their weak spots really helps a lot.\n\nPvP in 2016 isn't like it was back then but it still works.

You know, I actually avoided playing this game at first (but still nabbing it in a pretty good sale, but let it sit for a year or two in my library...) because of the famed difficulty of the game. I just passed it off as something that it didn't really follow it's tagline.\n\nWhy did I pass this game up?\n\nI completely missed it's prime. What do I mean?\n\nThis is a single player game that combines multiplayer in it's world. But how? Well, you're given phantoms of what other players are doing at random times, being able to make pre-written messages and warn others (or trick others) about the future obstacles. Some are even more friendly, extending their hand to help escort you through a zone, and even fight bosses with you! Some...will invade your world, in a attempt to take your experience points.\n\nEveryone's moved onto DS3, so this game is quieter than it should be. Invasions are rare, co-oping with random players is a complete pain in the ♥♥♥♥...most of the PVP groups you can join in the game is rendered useless by the quiet of the game. Thankfully, there almost always seems to be at least a handful of people on, playing the game, at any time of the day.\n\nI'm counting this against the game, as, in it's current state, the community playing it has mostly moved on to DS3. Onnnn the other hand, those who prefer to avoid the multiplayer aspect will have a alright time knowing that invasions will be far and few. But it's still something that deters from the experience.\n\nLet me adress the tagline, "Prepare To Die." Yes, this is a game where you cannot take combat as a joke. If you're unprepared, you will die. Nearly every single time I've died, I've had to blame myself for the mistakes I made. However! There are areas in the game that made me scratch my head in utter confusion and anger when I died. For example, deep within the catacombs, there's a hole you can drop down. However, before you even reach the hole, a creature under it already has locked onto you and is aggro'd against you. So, when I dropped down, there was a high chance I'd be immediately killed IN MID-AIR. While you're in mid-air, you cannot perform any actions. So, you can very well be screwed while falling down. However! There's only a handful of hiccups this game has in it's level design. Such as the example I've personally dealt with. Perhaps I'm just bad at those segments, but there are times when my deaths are constant.\n\nA fair warning to you. If you find dragons sittin' around on a bridge, multiple small dragons, do not take them as a joke. No matter what level you are, they will still pose a very serious threat.\n\nThe combat in this game is satisfying. Oh my. Out of all the games in my library, Dark Souls has the absolute best. Performing Backstabs and Counters for the first time is just badass on every level. And even now, 120 hours into the game, I still find them satisfying and dropping little one-liners to myself with certain weapons. Pure magic players will find a little harsher experience than those who fit magic into their repritoire, but Pyromancers will be fine. Miracles and Sorceries will have to work harder to stay on top.\n\nThe less you know about Dark Souls, however, the better. Contrary to popular opinion, I actually kinda liked having to figure out the systems and Humanity on my own. So, try to be careful and avoid spoilers if you somehow already have.\n\nI say, get this game, and praise the sun! Even despite the fact that one of the biggest aspects of the game is a quiet one now, with DS3 having came out recently...it's still worth your time and money!","May 4","true","339.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","11"

It also features a very responsive combat system, and a wide range of possibilities in character design to add replayability.

The game gets called hard because it refuses to hold your hand and no one knows how to deal with that, but it's not really that difficult--it just has an incredibly steep learning curve. It does require the extensive use of a wiki to fully understand, which is very unfortunate, as there are some mechanics that the game only gives you hints for when in reality you need a textbook, for example, weapon upgrade systems. Luckily, such wikis exist, though at times they get things wrong. Overall, a highly engaging and enjoyable game with a very deep background lore. 8/10.\n\nBad PC port, though.","December 5, 2015","true","207.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","1"

It's punishing but boy is it rewarding. I never played Demon Souls so this is my first "Souls" experience. (Lets just pretend the GFWL and DSfix stuff never happened, it runs great)\n\nGoing through this blind the first time, it was literally one of the most nerve racking and scary games I've ever played (scary in the sense of losing everything you've earned thus far in a single instance.)\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about it was that it feels similar to how rogue-likes are played but within a over-arching game. Every death you learn something new. The game never feels like it cheating you. It's always telling you to be more patient, more cautious and punishing you when you fail to heed to the lessons you hopefully learned.\n\nThe in depth lore that has to be searched for and interpreted has pros and cons. I personally found  the digging to be well worth it. You could say that it could use a minimap but I would argue that having to remember the maps, item locations, and enemy traps are what gives it the essence of "Souls".\n\nI continue to mess around and play with diffirent character builds.

By now, we all know what this game is. There's no need for me to tell you that this game will kill you, but this game will kill you. Before you start it even! Some people will be at work for an hour just trying to get it to launch! I know I did. The game doesn't like DLL files in system32.\n\nThis game is terrible to you. First, its keyboard controls are abysmally mapped by default, but because of the way the mouse controls work, you can never completely fix the abysmal controls without plugging in a controller, which may sting for the more hardcore PC users, such as myself. Second, the graphics settings are also seriously lacking, and beyond that, the graphics themselves are seriously lacking. The game isn't actually rendered in your resolution of choice and the framerate is locked to 30 fps. All that is putting aside the horrific instability and temperamental nature of this historically terrible port.\n\nHowever, once you get used to the alien "Controller" device and install a thing called DSFix[lmgtfy.com], the game opens up a little. Only a little though. It is now that you are thrown into your new favorite circle of Hell. The entire tutorial is presented by way of glowing messages on the ground, some of which are hidden behind a particularly tough enemy. Personally, I'd prefer the game without those messages, but... you know, modern intelligence standards and whatnot. In any case, the full weight of the game remains on your shoulders from beginning to end, and you'll be hard pressed to find any partners for jolly cooperation these days. The NPCs will be there for you though, but you have to find some of them first, which requires not missing things, which requires fully exploring the world. Don't make the same mistake I did when I played for the first time... I missed about 33% of the entire game.\n\nThe appeal of this game lies within the gameplay rather than anything else. The soundtrack is mostly nonexistant, the graphics are lackluster, the dialogue is also mostly nonexistant, the story ISN'T mostly nonexistant, but IS left mainly to interpretation... you have to draw pleasure from combat to really enjoy the game, unless you'd be fine with a slow-paced slog through boredom to get some tidbits here and there. All of that said, not even the combat is the greatest! You can breeze through most of the game once you master the art of rolling into attacks, circle strafing, backstabbing, and to a lesser degree, parrying. No movesets required! Just use R1 for maximum effect!\n\nAnd I love it all to bits.\n\nThe amount of triumph and pride that I felt upon beating each boss is unmatched by any other game. The accomplishment of successfully defeating everyone's favorite duo without summoning anyone to help is one of the highest points of, dare I say, gaming as a whole. Dark Souls is an exercise in trial and error, hands on learning, and overcoming the seemingly impossible.\n\nIf you want a power trip, buy Skyrim.\nIf you want a powerful experience, buy Dark Souls.\n\nPraise the Sun, you magniflorious dickbutts.","April 12, 2015","true","128.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","21","23","7","2"

This was my first thought when Asylum Demon wrecked me for the 6th time... Then I saw that door there. And it took me 1 hour! Yeah I wasn't good in this game, so as other newbies, but instead of giving up I countinued because I was curious what challenges await for me. Then I spent another hour finding out that the skeletons don't want be my friends in the graveyard. *Travel in time* Ornstein and Smough (or Pikachu and Snorlax as I call them) was the first boss fight where I felt that now I need help I won't get through here without help. Then I saw a magnificently glowing sing and with that sign I saw promises for the future. Yeah Solaire got wrecked after we took down Pikachu. But then the reward was beauty and *cough* big "melons" >.> what I later found out it was a lie. Okay my review is getting longer so must short it.\n\nIn short this game was painfully, hard, and sometimes I felt it unfair. Yeah we all know that feel, but it never was unfair, everytime when I died I was about to ragequit but no because then I was thinking "I'm so stupid bc I did this instead of that" the game is rewarding, the reward is that you can survive more, get better, and if you take a time you can figure out the story too. I had this dark feeling every locations in this game like in the Painted World, it was so terrifying seeing those corpses as crows biting them (and the surprise crow people was gave me shiver).\n\nAnd now let me talk about the community and PvP. When I first encountered a fight with another player in my second playthrough I was so scared, I ran to Queelag with my phantom and guess what? I got killed because I didn't watched my back and took a chaos stormin full. But then again community is still helpful and after that the "enemy" helped with the boss. There are a lot of player still doing PvP, there are honourable players, and there are Darkwaiths and Darkmoonblades. If you don't study your enemies they will kill you PvE experience which needs to PvP.\n\nI'm not too good  to short things but finally I can say what's wrong with the game. The only thing what it bothers me, that's the summoning faileds and failed to invade nothing else.\n\nI would praise this game untill my death and after that too, If only I could be so grossly incadescent.","November 30, 2014","true","635.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

At the time of release, that game revolutionized the concept of difficulty. It was truly a challenging game that needed mastering. Dark Souls is no different, it is indeed very difficult and offers little to no help along the way. Tutorial is nothing more than explanation of controls and a few gameplay basics, nothing more. Dark Souls is not for the faint of heart, it takes a dedicated gamer to finish the game.\n\nPros (+12):\n- Achievement through struggle, unforgiving difficulty which is very rewarding\n- Minimalistic plot that's open to player interpretation and fan theories\n- In-depth character customization and lots of equipment to choose from\n- Multi-player is uniquely integrated into single-player\n- Beautiful art design and breath-taking sceneries, visuals are great\n- High replay value which stems from the NG+ system\n- Inter-connected world and amazing level-design barring a few rushed locations\n- Each single step you take has permanent consequences, the game is auto-saved every moment\n- Epic boss and enemy designs\n- Even the weakest enemy can kill a careless end-game character, there is no true safety\n- Teaches real life lessons and is full of metaphors\n- No quests, no mini-map, no guidance, you are truly alone in a hostile world\n\nCons(-4):\n- Audio and sound effects are boring and dull, soundtrack is uninteresting\n- Persistent network issues which will never be fixed\n- Intentional "easy mode" provided by some items or play-styles\n- Lousy English translation and occasional incomprehensible text\n\nGameplay = 10/10 ; Audio = 7/10 ; Visuals = 10/10 ; Story = 10/10\n\nVerdict: 9.75/10 - Almost Perfect\nDark Souls is truly a gem and one of the finest RPG titles of this generation, it is a game with a point to prove, lessons to teach and controllers to break. This is a must-play title for any true gamer in this generation.\n\nPC Port ReviewThis horrible monstrosity called a PC port is truly one of the worst ports in all history if not the absolute worst. This game is literally unplayable without a controller, if you're looking to play with Keyboard+Mouse you're going to be deeply disappointed. The game always displays X360 Buttons on the screen. Apart from that, the game itself is locked to 30 FPS and unlocking the framerate with mods causes several issues such as broken ladder animations and extremely short jumping distance.\n\nThe port itself is borderline broken without the help of various fixes and modifications such as DSFix & PVPWatchdog. This is an utterly terrible PC Port with countless issues and problems that will never be officially fixed. If you have access to a last-generation console, I would highly recommend buying a console version instead because the PC port is plain broken.\n\nHowever, if you insist on playing the game on PC, use of modifications and fixes is mandatory.","September 24, 2015","true","82.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","4"

This is a very unoptimized port; look at the PCGW page for the fixes.\n\nDark Souls is one of the hardest games that I've ever played yet my experience with it can only be described as gratifying. It consistently challenged me and appropriately rewarded my efforts for taking risks, never treating me like a child that requires constant hand-holding but as an adult who can assess and adapt to the current situation that he's in. The game forced me to be patient and calculating, testing my limits, and taunting me to throw my controller against the wall but all of the hardships that I came across were worth it in the end because it gave me that satisfying sigh that one gets after saving the princess, or in this case, defeating the enemy that pummeled you a dozen times. It will be jarring at first but if you're prepared to die (a lot) and overcome obstacles which the modern gamer would quickly deem intolerable, I'm sure you'll be rewarded with the same satisfaction that Dark Souls gave its players.\n\n\nAnd there you have it.","March 8","true","173.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","1"

Owning a game controller will allow you to skip 3 of the bosses: Lord ♥♥♥♥-Camera, and the mentally handicapped siamese twins, Keybohd n' Mawz.\n\nThe gameplay is ripped from Super Mario 64, with platforming and hopping into paintings to fight bosses, with Metroid and Zelda thrown in for good measure.\nThe soundtrack is actually composed completely by Finnish metal band Apocalyptica, who also designed the whole game, Keeping the frames at a crisp 30 frames per second.\nIt also takes advantage of Microsoft's revolutionary service: Games for Windows LIVE, which brings the power of Xbox LIVE right to your PC! I hope you hate playing video games, because Games for Windows LIVE sure does.\n\nTrademarked Souls™: Prepare to Trademark™ Edition is a fine edition to steam, and will compete directly with Valve's first person shooter action sidescrolling point n click adventure game DOTA 2.\n\nAwful/5","July 16, 2014","true","42.0"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","2"

Через некоторое время все-таки мое природное любопытство взяло верх, и я её купил. Это были не передаваемые ощущения, я наслаждался буквально каждой минутой этой игры и получил невероятное удовлетворение, когда прошел её. Итак, господа - Dark Souls.\n\nТут стоит сказать, что игроки в DS делятся на тех, кто дропнул её не дойдя и до половины, и на тех, кто прошел её и вероятно не один раз.\n\nПо началу не видно ничего, чем она бы отличалась от остальных подобных ей игр. Более того, она кажется скучной. Если это так - то мой совет просто перетерпеть, как это было со мной. Я поиграл день и дропнул её на месяц, после вернувшись - прошел буквально на одном дыхании. Через какое-то время , проведенное в игре, ты начинаешь её ощущать буквально всю пустоту и боль каждой локации, каждого моба, каждого пикселя.\n\nАтмосферу безысходности и одиночества удалось передать просто идеально - все сделано так, чтобы донести до игрока мысль о том, что он ничего не решит, этому миру уже конец, и он здесь просто очередной смертник. Никто тебе не будет говорить, что делать и куда идти (не зря же эта игра породила столько шуток про свою сложность). Сначала все кажется серым и мутным, гамма красок так подобрана, но это только по началу кажется минусом - позднее понимаешь, что если бы что-то было бы сделано по другому, то DS не был бы таким прекрасным, какой он есть. Он не похож ни на что, кроме своей предшественницы. Концентрированный гримдарк.\n\nПомимо прекрасной основной сюжетной линии (пусть и немного корейской, как по мне), есть огромное количество "углублений" в сюжете, которые действительно цепляют - и это не простые побочные квесты! Каждый персонаж, каждый квест в этой игре делает свой вклад в общее представление о том ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥еце, что там творится.","December 15, 2013","true","45.2"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","39","57","0","4"

If my lifespan permits, I would like to experience all the great games ever created, new or old. Dark Souls, is one of the brightest diamonds in history, easily in my top5 of all-time. But 10 years from now, what will happen to the online aspect of Dark Souls? Nothing lasts forever, even all things good will eventually come to an end. Before that happens, if you are a true gamer, do yourself a favour, overcome your own Dark Souls, and you will never be the same again. Put simply, to emerge victorious in this Trial of Mentality, you have to become a stronger person than you are today.\n9.7/10\n\nIF YOU HAVE MORE TIME TO READ\nFor those of you sitting on the fence due to reviews of a bad PC port, worry not. I am playing this on Windows 7, without any controller, without any 3rd party fix, and it works just fine. My guess is they had released a recent patch to fix most of the complaints. You can always change the key bindings to something you like. My only issue is that sometimes the camera is too near, but that is more of a small annoyance since you can't really zoom out.\n\nTHINGS I LIKE:\n+ Level up mechanic, reminds me of Diablo 2 but more extensive and better\n+ Choose the level of online interaction you want at any time, you can play it like Single-player, Co-op or PVP! It's like half an MMO. At minimum there are still some subtle "interference" between you and other online players (players can leave messages on ground to warn other players; bloodstains show a ghostly playback of how a previous player died; occasionally see "ghosts" moving around which is another real player)\n+ Variety of weapons & their associated combat moves\n+ Upgrading system of equipment\n+ Checkpoint system wil restart you at latest "touched" checkpoint when you die\n+ Epic Boss Fights\n+ Looting is easy because there is a shiny bright light over anything that is lootable\n+ No lengthy towning explorations or NPC conversations, just pure adventuring & combat\n+ 1-slot save system of no regrets\n+ Unlimited inventory space, take everything you want !\n+ Most importantly, this game makes you want to play it, you wake up everyday looking forward to your Dark Souls, and honestly, I haven't experience this kind of enthusiasm in any game for a long time","November 22, 2015","true","64.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

This was not only the beginning of my Dark Souls adventure but also the beginning playing with a xbox controller so of course I had to get used to that too.\n\nI died countless of times in the very first area and the very first boss "The Asylum Demon" was a really pain in the ♥♥♥ to defeat.\n\nI did kill the boss after many attempts and reached the second area "Firelink Shrine". This was the part were I completely lost all my hope since small enemies like skeletons and hollows were able to kill me pretty easily. Then I decided to give up, because I felt stuck and lost in this universe. Therefore I quit the game for a few mounths.\n\nThen a friend of mine started to suggest that I should go on with Dark Souls. My friend had an interest in Dark Souls because he watched Dark Souls 3 videos and he new that I used to play Dark souls 1.\n\nWith his help by my side I learned the Dark Souls basics and gave me advice in boss fights or other situations. This boost of hope restored my power of will to continue and as I played the game, my character became stronger and I had an actual clue of what I was doing.\n\nI finally managed to beat the game and all the bosses after many ours of victorious happiness and miserable defeats.\n\nAs long as you "git gud" and "praise the sun", you can enjoy this game.\n","May 18","true","51.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","17","19","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/recommended/211420/","bordje","Bordje |-/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bordje/","350 products in account","TLDR VERDICT\nDark Souls is an innovative experience that provides challenging, yet extremely satisfying gameplay and a unique twist on multiplayer. Backed up with an intriguing narrative; absolutely stellar world design; all-round fantastic gameplay driven and atmosphere. An absolute must buy or at least try, as I believe everyone should experience this game, even if it doesn’t sound like your thing.\n\nFULL REVIEW BELOW\n”What is bravery, without a dash of recklessness” - Hawkeye Gough\n\nYou are cursed. You are destined to die, again and again. You will keep dying, until you have lost your purpose and you become nothing but a hollow mindless husk. However, just maybe, there might be something different about you.\n\nThis review is written from the perspective of a fan of story driven RPG games and games with well-designed open worlds, with an emphasis on player discovery and experimentation.\n\nGAMEPLAY AND DESIGNDark Souls has fairly straightforward gameplay mechanics that are simple to understand but are supposed to be adapted to your playstyle. Contrary to popular belief, Dark Souls isn’t what I would call an especially hard game. Sure it has difficult moments, but it’s just completely different from what you might expect from an open world RPG, which throws a lot of people off. The game essentially punishes you for relying on what might be the norm in other games of its genre. You need to rely on a more practical way of thinking to get a grip of how the game plays. For example: heavy armour is hard to move around in and big swords are hard to swing.\n\nThe game introduces its fundamental mechanics very concisely and they aren’t anything you haven’t seen before. You have a health bar, a stamina bar, basic attack mechanics and so on. So if the game has such a simple and unoriginal sounding framework, why does it have such a massive following and a notorious reputation for difficulty? There’s a few reasons. The first is the enemies. Every new enemy in the game is different from the last. You need to observe their movements, their weapon and their body type to find an opening. The enemies are very firm, but fair (for the most part). They all have attack patterns and every pattern is avoidable, with a weakness you can exploit. Gauging what you attacks you can dodge and block and knowing when you can get hits in is all a part of the learning curve. Mastering bosses feels extremely satisfying. There are a few bosses that are arguably pretty “cheap” that might have you fighting the camera controls or jumping mechanics, but these are blemishes in otherwise fantastic array of enemies.\n\nWeapon and item variety is also fantastic. Whilst the stats and levelling system may seem overwhelming at first, you get your head around it very quickly and start experimenting. Almost every weapon has different move sets and they all feel unique. Just like studying your enemy’s vulnerabilities, you’ll need to look out for your own and they come from the type of weapon you use. There’s a massive selection of pretty much every fantasy melee and ranged weapon you can think of, with varying designs. If you replay other RPGs for alternate morality choices, you’ll replay Dark Souls for alternate weapon builds. Different weapon types require you to employ different tactics and can make entire playthroughs seem completely fresh even though you only changed your weapons. There is also a very intricate weapon upgrade system, which adds even more depth to the game.\n\nDark Souls also has one of the best implementations of multiplayer I’ve ever seen in a game. The multiplayer is essentially built around the idea that we’re all screwed, but we’re all in this together. You can leave notes for other players that provide hints and sometimes good laughs. You can summon in other players to help you out with tricky areas. You can also invade other players and kill them in PvP combat if you feel really mean.\n\nThe world design in Dark Souls is seriously genius. A lot of the areas interlock like a maze with shortcuts in logical places that actually make sense within the space of the world. No two areas occupy the same space within the world, everything fits together perfectly and you can see areas in the skybox of other areas. The amount of detail that actually went into the world design is jaw dropping. You navigate the world by walking around and looking for bonfires, which equate to checkpoints. These allow you heal up and bank your hard earned souls, which is basically currency. You lose all of your souls when you die and need to go back to where you died to pick them up. If you die again before getting them, you have lost them forever. This naturally can lead to a lot of stressful moments, especially when there is an invading player standing between you and hours of progress. The stakes just makes triumph all the more rewarding.\n\nSTORY AND NARRATIVEDark Souls adopts some very subtle story telling techniques. You get a big grand cut scene at the start, that sets the scene for the world, but all the lore after that is pretty much hidden. You can interact with quite a few NPCs, but they only offer small snips of information at most and say more about themselves than the world around them. The other main source of information is item descriptions which can reveal information about specific events or people. This is quite good for people who like to piece together the story based on hints and clues. If you prefer storytelling to be more overt and involved then you might not be a fan.\n\nPersonally, I am a fan of involved and cutscene/conversation heavy storytelling, but I didn’t mind the Dark Souls approach. It essentially makes the story optional for everyone who wants to ignore it. The main downside is that those hungry for more story may not necessarily want to dig for it and will come away feeling unfulfilled. I initially felt that, as I was constantly discovering awesome looking areas and enemies and kept thinking “what happened here?” and there wouldn’t really be a proper explanation. Of course, the game has a great community and the story explanations are all on YouTube (lookup VaatiVidya after playing the game) but the fact you have to go to YouTube can be a detracting factor.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCEDark Souls is a really rough PC port. It is essentially a complete copy and paste of the console version. It runs at 720p capped at 30fps and used to have GFWL. GFWL has now been patched out and the game now uses Steamworks which is a huge improvement. The bulk of the issues are fixed by an absolutely essential mod called dsfix, which uncaps the framerate and offers better graphics options amongst other fixes. The multiplayer elements also had some serious connectivity issues whilst on GFWL. In my experience, the Steamworks patch works well when playing the game normally. You get a good amount of multiplayer play, but may have issues trying to play with a specific friend.\n\nDark Souls has absolutely stunning art direction. All the environments, equipment and enemies are really uniquely designed and definitely emphasise the variety of locations you’re exploring throughout the game. It also does an excellent job of conveying all these completely diverse environments, which are still seamlessly interconnected. The boss enemy designs are especially well done. Almost every boss evokes some kind of emotional reaction, whether its terror, pity or respect. The actual graphical fidelity in the vanilla game looks passable for the time (2011), but the aforementioned dsfix mod really makes the game a lot prettier, despite a pretty hefty performance cost.","January 13","true","77.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I enjoy challenging games so I wasn't afraid of the rumors I heard about Dark Souls' difficulty.  Having never played Demon Souls, the spiritual predecessor, I was completely new to this series.  What I quickly learned is that the game is very overwhelming to new people and seriously lacks adequate in-game tutorials.  Many questions people start off with is "What character should I be?", "Which weapons should I use?", and "Which skills should I spend souls on?"  The makers of the Dark Souls seemingly want you to experiment in the game to figure this out and some say this is part of the charm.\n\nSince the game can easily take at least 40 hours to complete, I simply didn't feel in the mood to play a difficult game AND not know what the heck is going on.  So what I did instead was to read a few beginner guides to Dark Souls (spoiler-free versions), and I really feel this helped the game be much more enjoyable.  Even several hours into the game I would have to go look up what a certain item is used for on a Dark Souls wiki page as well, for example.\n\nAs for game play, there isn't much more for me to say that hasn't already been said 100x over.  I definitely recommend the game for those who enjoy challenging RPGs with emphasis on action fighting.  The large amount of big boss battles will give plenty of satisfaction.  The story and sense of adventure will also make you incredibly curious with each new area you enter.  When you are new to this game, it will engross you to the point that when you aren't playing, you'll be thinking about what is next and/or how to defeat a boss who has already killed you 10+ times.  This is one of those games you'll never forget.","January 2","true","117.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","2"

Not only is the game setting pretty dark and scary, Dark Souls is also pretty hard so you will most likely always fear whats behind that door or fogwall, creating a similar atmosphere to horror games.\n\nConcerning the difficulty of this game: You can beat the game pretty much naked, and without getting hit a single time for the most parts, but at the same time even with the best gear you can die in a few seconds to some easy monsters if you're not paying attention or do something stupid.\n\nLearning from your mistakes is what this game is all about. You will die because you didnt know there was someone lying in an ambush. You will die even knowing there is someone behind that door, but you havent figured out what to to. You will die even knowing a good strategy to defeat a certain boss or clear an area. The game is fair, so dont blame anyone but yourself, just try it again and try harder, you will succeed eventually.\n\nIf you're searching for a nice action RPG, a dark fantasy game or just a challenge, Dark Souls is the perfect match!","March 15, 2014","true","118.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

I have never thought that I will enjoy this game that much so that's why I am going to share my experience and information about this game with you.\n\nThe main element of this game, as you can imagine by reading the name of the game, is DYING! You will die very often and if you are not prepared to die, do not play this game, because otherwise you are going to rage-quit or delete this game.\nIf you are ready to die, let's continue with reading this and let's say something important about this game.\n\nDS:PTD is, in my words, single-player game mixed with multi-player. The thing is, that you feel like you play single-player, however, in a moment you realize that your world is connected to other worlds and you are kind of linked with other people. If you use your humanity (in-game item) to become a human as you were before you've died, you will "enter" the multi-player. It sounds hard or maybe I can't explain it that well, but once you are human, you can invade other worlds - it means going PVP with another Online Player, you can be invaded - somebody will come to your world to kill you OR, you can summon a player who would like to co-op with you.\nThat's why I like this game so much. Are you bored of killing NPCs, monsters, bosses? Just invade other world and feel the power of real Player-versus-Player. Is it hard to kill the boss in your world? Try to find summoning symbols on the ground and summon player to help you and kill that big as*hole together!!\n\nIf I wanted to sum up everything this game offers, this "review" would be super long.\nThis game is in open/closed world (it means that nobody tells you directly where to go. Everything is up to you. Where to go, where have you been,(there is no map, ok? you must use your brain!) where would you like to go, which area you choose first to go to or what to use/level up. However, those areas are connected together that perfectly that you can't get lost unless you are completely brain-dead. ), containing lvling-up, modifying your weapons, learning spells and having super great time with your character.\n\nPS. Very important to say! This game IS VERY CHALLENGING and DOES GIVE YOU great REWARDS!\nI would hardly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play challenging/rewarding game and likes this genre of game. (I would compare it with Skyrim or games like that, but don't blame me if you feel that you can't compare Skyrim with Dark Souls, because it is completely different. Maybe..it is :D, haven't played Skyrim long enough yet )\nAlso, I would not recommend this game to players who are used to do ONLY what they are being told, to players, who likes playing games on "easy-difficulty" (in this game, there is NO difficulty to choose. It is "Hard"-difficulty, so get used to it) and to players, who are not ready to DIE! :)\n\n\nIf you liked my "little-review", please, rate it up or comment below to let me know if I can improve something for next time!\n\nThanks for reading it.\nKubusta","December 28, 2013","true","64.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","5"

I had actually heard about enough to give me the impression  that buying it would end up being a mistake because I would find myself quitting before I managed to get so much as a quarter of the way into the game because of the 2hard4me. Ironically enough I couldn't put it down because of the ♥♥♥ kicking I was getting initially being a lot different from the lackluster wins it seems every other game throws out.\nAlbeit that Dark Souls is just about as far as one can get from a walk in the park with a title made in recent times (save for the most irritating of indie games) it's nowhere near as bad as most will set it out to be. There are almost no situations where I felt that what was happening was just plain unfair and the deaths were anyone's fault but my own. Every challenge presented could be easily overcome by taking things slowly and getting the timing right. If you're used to the hand-holding of modern day pewpewbangbangbang games like I am then maybe you'll have a little (or a lot) more trouble than you should be having with whomever (capra, stop plis; it hurts).\nThe animation quality is to die for, I have never once played a game where I sat in an area toying with weapons just to see what the attacks looked like before but I've spent hours doing so here. Regardless of if I planned on using it or not when I got a new weapon different from what I had seen before I was excited to see what it was like. I've now gone as far as making builds just to try weapons I didn't get to use in combat before due to stats. Voice acting is another point of interest, most characters were unique enough to actually want to talk to.\nOn the down side the story could have been portrayed a lot better in game, I myself had to watch a countless amount of Youtube videos to get in on what was happening beyond the basic outline. If you decide to go ahead and do so then chances are you'll realize you missed quite a lot of the plot while playing through. The dreaded four letters also take a part in Dark Souls, GFWL (best system 10/10); on top of that connection is P2P so without DSCfix good luck summoning anyone, really. Although I've met a decent enough amount of people who have adapted to playing with mouse and keyboard I would still have to put down that playing without a gamepad is rather difficult.\nDark Souls easily places in my top five favorite games and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next one. Praise the Sun, praise the sun, praise the sun praise the sun, praise the sun.\n\nTL;DR Gaem is gud, buy.","November 18, 2013","true","973.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","5"

Rather than likening it to other games – most of which are purely about sensory stimulation – I prefer to compare Dark Souls to an album. More particularly, an extreme metal album. Like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls is incredibly inaccessible. It has no desire for mass appeal. In fact, it thrives on alienation. It wants only the dedicated, the people who will strive to understand what it is trying to convey.\n\nAlso, like an extreme metal album, Dark Souls has an emotional agenda. It has one united vision. It wants you to feel isolated. It wants you to feel empty. It wants you to feel like you are nothing, and that everything around you has more right to exist than you. It succeeds. The monster design, the level design, the sound assets, the silence – all these things combine to unnerve and depress you.\n\nMore than anything though, Dark Souls wants you to prove it wrong. It wants you to prove that you have a right to exist in its world, despite everything it throws at you. It pummels you to the ground, yet it gives you hope. It gives you a reason to press on, even when everything seems lost. It wants you to go in as one person, and leave as another.","January 13","true","103.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

I myself am not one of these people over 20 hours of playtime into the game I gave up this game is for people looking for a serious challenge.  Just like the name says prepare to die cause you will die a lot.  I plan on going back to this game eventually and sitting down beating it but every time I look it I get so mad because other players can invade your realm and kill you on top of the challenge this game presents.   Its not for the casual weekend gamer at all its for the “hardcore dedicated have to beat it gamers”.  Two of my friends have beat I have not :(  Anyone who beats this game deserves your praise even if you have never played it or never intend on playing it.  That’s how much of challenge this game is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/211420/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Dark Souls is not a game for everyone. It will torture you, punish you and laugh at you, all at the same. But it will never be unfair. It will always play by the rules. Any mistakes you make are entirely your own. This game is hard. Maybe not all the time, depending on your build, but you will die. Not once, not twice. Hundreds of time. And you'll probably keep playing. Because the world of Dark Souls is something that needs to be experienced. I've rarely seen a world this detailed and this well executed. It reminded me a bit of a Metroidvania game, where instead of searching for upgrades you decide what to upgrade, thanks to the souls you'll collect from killed enemies. Before moving on to that part let me say that the textures in this game are simply amazing.\n\nAs I said, souls allow you to upgrade your character. But only at a bonfire. If you get killed before reaching a bonfire, you lose your souls. You'll resurrect as an undead (again) and get another chance at collecting your lost souls. But the enemies will have respawned and if you die again before reaching them, you'll never be able to recover them. It's tough and frustrating.\nEnemies will attack you from all sides, there's danger everywhere. You have to remember when and how your enemy attacks, detect their patterns.\n\nWith humanity you can become human again. This allows you to summon NPC's or friends. These allies are extremely helpful in tough situations. The only consequence of being human is the fact that other players can invade your world. This is frustrating if you haven't saved at a bonfire or/and the other player is simply too strong. Defeat them and you'll gain plenty of souls, though.\nIt's a choice you have to make, but just remember that humanity is hard to come by, especially in the beginning, so summoning someone isn't always the proper solution.\n\nAs of today I still haven't finished the game. It should take you at least 60-80 hours to beat, and that's a first playthrough. You'll never be able to see, do and collect all the stuff you want in your first playthrough. It's simply impossible. There's so much to take into account.\n\nDark Souls is a brilliant game that only the strong will be able to finish. It's one of my personal goals, although I doubt I'll ever be able to finish it. It requires a lot of dedication. If you're one of those persons I strongly suggest you play this game. You'll not be disappointed.\n\n(Use the Dsfix to improve the graphics and performance of the game. Don't start your first game without it.)\n\nEDIT: I managed to finish this just a few days after posting the review. I'm not going to rewrite the entire thing as I still agree with most of what I've written. Dark Souls has entered my personal top 3 of favorite games ever so it doesn't need any further explanation.\n\n[Rating: 96/100]","May 28, 2013","true","93.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

Though poorly ported it is still well worth playing with a controller at the ready.\n\nDark Souls is a game that I spent a large amount of my time with on console. Moving over to PC and experiencing it all over again, is time I don't regret spending. The fun from dark souls can be found in many different forms, though difficult as you progress through the game you can see yourself getting better and more powerful. The satisfaction of winning a boss fight, after they have crushed you countless time before is a feeling I have not found elsewhere. Though suffering from some issues such as the framerate cap and poor options this is a part of gaming history you can't miss.\n\nPositive features:\n-In depth combat and weapons variety that can be changed at any time\n-Beautifully rich and detailed world with varying areas and enemies\n-Difficulty harsh but fair\n-Unforgettable boss fights\n-Clever online system with active PVP community\n-DLC comes included\n\nNegative features:\n-30 fps cap\n-Requires a controller for best experience\n-Lack of graphical options and settings\n-Confusing navigation at times\n\nTo conclude Dark Souls is not a game easy to summarise.

I was a noob like you when i first bought it, i was worried like you are that it was going to be extremely brutal and frustrating, but it isn't for me. Well, it has been for the first 5-6 hours, when i actually thought: "why have i installed this game, why? It's terrible, it sucks; why should i use a controller, it's not fair; why the ♥♥♥♥ should i download mods for it to play at the ♥♥♥♥ing 60 fps and 1080p?".In those first hours i kept dying also to the worst skeletons of the tutorial, but going ahead with it it became understandable what the game wanted me to do: learn from my silly mistakes and make up a strategy on my own. The combat system is the best i've tried in my life, and it became understandable the difficoulty from the developers to create good keyboard keys to reproduce it. You'll have to block at a right timing, attack at the right timing, fall back at the right timing and dodge the hit AT THE RIGHT TIMING. You fail at one of these? You're dead, simple as that. The IA is very very clever, but it's not OP at all, you just need to ask yourself "what does this boss want me to do?" and you'll get it, after 20-40 times you try it. I actually found myself dying at the same boss for more than 20 times, but each time was better, untill i finally understood WHAT i was doing wrong. The good thing is that after these 20 times i wasn't bored at all, because the possibilities you have during a fight are infinite, and you'll never get tired of trying them all out!\n\nThe comparison between DS and Skyrim is stupid imho: they are both epic for what they have to offer. Skyrim for its great graphics, open world, storyline, quests, MODS and a lot more; while DS for its difficoulty, replayability, combats and strategy. What is really missing on DS are strange mods like skyrims (that couldn't even be isntalled without DSfix!).\n\nI have to admit that having to install DSfix and other graphic mods to make it AT LEAST enjoyable at 1080p and 60fps is baaahd, but come on, you'll have to work on it 20 minutes to enjoy your gameplay for ever!\n\nCome on, little newbie, buy it, enjoy it and remember to NEVER EVER look on the internet cheap ways to defeat bosses, you'll feel soooo bad after having done that, trust me! :)","October 12, 2014","true","130.4"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","1"

The question many new players will be asking themselves is weither to play it safe and go back to the bonfire and lose their progress, or to push on and risk losing their souls in hopes of finding another bonfire. Being the open world that Dark Souls is, each area connects with another logically and physically often through shortcuts opened up by the player. You can stop and look around at your distant surroundings and think to yourself, " Ah yes, I've been to that bridge before." and realise that each area of the game was perfectly placed with each other area in mind. This also serves the idea of experienced players being able to quickly build whatever character they want without being railroaded into a single path storyline creating replay value.\n\nSpeaking of storyline, there practically isnt any. Dark Souls is a lore rich game which often will be missed by first time players creating an atmosphere of hopelessness as you go around and around not knowing where to go. This aids in the player exploring the world on their own with little direction, but can be frustrating at times for the new player. The NPCs you find are primarily venders and story tellers, but will come and go with their own agendas further showing that the world doesnt revolve around you.\n\nDark Souls offers multiplayer in a few forms. Players can frequently see messages written by other players wishing to aid or hinder others as well as seeing ghosts and blood stains giving the impression of how others have died giving you a warning. Dark Souls also has optional co-op and pvp by recovering your humanity. Players needing help can summon phantoms to their world to help them progress and take down bosses, but this also invites enemy phantoms to try and stop you. The co-op and pvp however is totally voluntary and is not forced apon you at any time, however you cannot have one without the other excluding playing the game offline and summoning NPC phantoms.\n\nDark Souls is an absolute must play for anyone looking for a challenge.","December 7, 2014","true","352.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TachyonicKitty/recommended/211420/","TachyonicKitty","Ørb Casual Nub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TachyonicKitty/","102 products in account","We all know that this game is famed for being 'difficult' or frustrating so instead of justifying this or telling you to suck it up, I'll write about my experience of the game so far.\n\n'You Died'\n\nBut in all seriousness, Dark Souls: Prepare to Die is a game I think everyone should play at least once. It is reminiscent of old style RPG top-down dungeon crawlers in it's atmosphere with the level design allowing you to cautiously make decisions in which way you want to explore. 'Left or right? What if I miss a shiny by going this way?' you know the feel. It's really refreshing to see a more modern game handle this so well.\n\nThe combat however is what makes it really shine. You can't charge in and hope to obliterate everything by mashing a few buttons. Combat in this game, even against the 'trash' mobs, needs to be carefully planned. It's not forced like an RTS or turn based combat but if you don't think carefully about where and when to move, dodge and strike you will meet a bloodstainy end very quickly. While this probably sounds like less of a selling point, as you play the reward of overcoming a foe is that 'Awwyes' moment. Again, something a lot of modern games lack. It's also worth noting the class system is classic RPG style, with attributes that you level up so you can play the way you feel suits you.\n\nThe threat of dying is always there and the game does a good job of keeping you on your toes. Death is more of a learning curve in Dark Souls and half the fun is running into unexpected situations or biting off more than you can chew, each encounter (and subsequent death) asks you to take a moment to think how you could have handled that better. A boss may take more than a few attempts to overcome but when you do, you are equipped for future areas of the game. At first you'll probably be resistant to this, as many games treat defeat as the final stop, not a fully integral part of the mechanics. Once you accept this though, death is pretty fun.\n\nThe world, lore and atmosphere of Dark Souls is also some thing to mention. Without spoilers, the world is a dark medieval fantasy, which sounds cliche but it keeps a pretty unique feel and adds to the doomy storyline and mechanics. The creature and character design are also refreshing.\n\nNow for some not so good things. Firstly, this is a port to PC. A lazy one. It's so lazy even the tutorial messages reference Xbox controller buttons *searches keyboard for RT button* While I've been playing with keyboard for the time being I'd suggest you buy an Xbox controller. Keyboard is okay, but I spent a fair while in the starting area mentally mapping what key did what. They aren't intuitive. You'll have a better time with controller.\n\nThe resolution can also be horrific on larger screens, which is a pity because the graphics are interesting. To remedy this there is an easy to install mod on Nexus, DSMfix. Almost a must have in my opinion.\n\nOverall Dark Souls is a brilliant game worthy of time and attention. It has that old style feel that many games lack and is almost worth it just for that. However, if you are the sort of gamer who gets easily frustrated or doesn't like to be challenged in a game you should probably look into it more before buying.\n\n\n\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","65.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","4"

Because this is what a game should be:\n\nThe whole PVE gameplay is perfectly balanced (except for a single boss battle) even without a "difficulty selector", so no, there is no "easy difficult"; and yes, you'll die a lot, but only when you actually deserve it,\n(if you find it much too hard probably you are just missing something: try to explore or try another route; or you are playing with mouse and keyboard: buy a joypad).\n\nArts, graphic and engine good enough to make this game really good-looking, but "light" enough to work smooth in older machine: a mid tier notebook is more than enough to make this game run\n(even though it WILL fall to 15 fps in particular circumstance, whatever configuration you adopt)\n\nIn addition to the two previous consideration, you will have HUGE selection of weapon and magic, every single one of them has unique appearance, moveset and effect, making almost any playstyle peculiar AND potentially successfull in the game (except for some, obvious, joke and trap: don't use the dragonsword at your first playthrough)\n\nMultiplayer is very well done, except sometimes for latency in PVP (especially when players come from different region).\nExcept when you play offline mode and/or disconnected from the internet, you are actually playing in multiplayer, *always*, this mean: communication from and for other player (in form of orange message written on the floor), "ghost" appearance of other player in the same area at the same time, blood of dead players (and if you interact, you will see HOW that player is actually dead).\nFor PVP and COOP you need to perform another operation, this means you CAN'T be griefed unexpectedly AND at the same time if you need external help you'll have a counterpart (BUT, if you want to HELP another players you can do coop even without "activating" the PVP, you only have to be patient)\n\nThe only real downfall of this game is its PC-port: it is not so good ("awful" is the right term, to be honest),\nBUT the community did a set for excellent workarounds for this, the only thing you need to do is:\ngo to "discussion" panel\nread the 4 pinned discussions (especially   this one )\nprofit\nPraise the sun!","November 16, 2015","true","427.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You know why? Because other games don't feel as engaging or...fun. The challenging bosses and sometimes brutal ordeals isn't what defines this game-- its the cryptic storytelling, the atmosphere, the music that truly is the gem that is Dark Souls. For me this game is a testament to life itself, as it describes the countless failures (like dying in Dark Souls) one has to endure to finally hone one's skills to achieve success (like experiencing the euphoric feeling of seeing "Victory Achieved" after defeating a boss). So, don't be afraid to die my...son.","August 17, 2015","true","220.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Brilliant level design and combat mechanics are what make this game great.\n\nThe difficulty in this game is often exaggerated. The game is challenging, but always fair. Whenever you die, its always your fault, not because of some cheap game mechanic. The game is not so much hard as it is punishing. Choosing to give an extra greedy hit against a boss can mean the difference between life and death. Unlike most RPGs, power in this game is more than just a numerical value, actual player skill plays a bigger part. The immersive atmosphere and the feeling of overcoming challenges are great.\n\nThis game is the most incredible gaming experience I have ever had. I can remember every moment of my first playthrough, from my naive first steps, to what I felt while the credits rolled. I have never before seen a game with such thought put into it.\n\nHowever\n\nAfter spending over 200 hours on the console version of the game, I decided to buy the game on steam. I was disappointed, the PC port is a joke. The graphical settings are extremely lacking, the vanilla game won’t run in full resolution and is capped at 30fps. The store page isn’t kidding when it says that a controller is recommended, the keyboard and mouse controls are horrible.  On top of all that, the game uses Games for Windows Live, which doesn’t let you access your save file if you are not connected to the internet.   Edit: The game has been ported to steamworks, not sure how this affects the online just yet, but at least you don't have to go through all of the GFWL account nonsense\n\nFortunately, some of these things can be fixed with mods, DSfix does a great job of fixing most of the problems the PC port has, and DSMfix fixes the problems with the controls (I still recommend a controller though).\n\nI could go on and on about what makes Dark Souls so amazing, but this review is long enough already. If you are willing to install some mods to make it work, I would recommend this game to anyone, even to those who don’t like difficult games.","January 10, 2014","true","379.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025036440/recommended/211420/","76561198025036440","BAD COP","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025036440/","119 products in account","Dark Souls is a dating sim where you play as pretty boy Choy Sen Unded trying to decide who to take to prom.  There are many suitors to choose from, ranging all the way from the quiet and reserved Petrus of Thorolund (who is constantly torn between you and his ex, Rhea) and the notorious playboy Solaire of Astora (who is still coming to terms with his sexuality).  Many of the players I talked with chose to date Kingseeker Frampt, and I can understand why.  There's a certain bit of old world charm to him and he acts like a proper gentleman (not to mention I hear he's marvelously well endowed), however, he simply wasn't for me.  His brother Kaathe is another popular choice as they share the same good looks but with Kaathe having more of a "badboy" appeal to him.  Before I met either of them though I had already fallen in love with the well-intentioned but down-on-his-luck Siegmeyer of Catarina.  Siegmeyer is your quintessential nice guy, who has hit a bit of a slump after his wife left him.  Left alone with the pressure of taking care of his daughter, Sieglinde, he develops a bit of an eating problem, but don't worry he's still quite a looker! ;)  In his storyline, you help him regain his confidence and open his heart back up so he can learn to love again.  Just don't help him out too much, he's very proud and will get upset if you do everything for him.  You also get to know his daughter very well and she is simply an adorable and precocious little scamp!\n\nMy biggest complaint is that some of the biggest hunks are already taken at the start of the game.  For example, Ornstein and Smough stay in a commited relationship for the entire game and while they DO make a really cute couple I feel like the game is just tempting me into something I can't have.  I won't reveal too much, but there is an obscure sidequest in which you can get either Ornstein or Smough "out of the picture", freeing the other one up to date (or so I thought), but the other one will always find out and just be angry at you until you leave and then when you come back they're together again! Ugh!\n\nAnother great feature is that you get to dress up your character however you want.  Getting different outfits can be a real pain though as you have to got out and find them yourself and many times they're hidden away in tough spots.  Most of the time you're gonna be spending searching for a new dress or a nice hat that goes with your top, and I would rather just be hanging out and talking with the guys!  However, despite all the work you have to go through to get the damn clothes, they really are worth the effort as many of them are simply gorgeous and you can mix and match to your heart's content!  There are classic formal dresses (the antiquated dress, Crimson set); some nice and simple pieces (the dingy or maiden set); a couple goth outfits (the gold-hemmed black set); and some more unusual fashions (the Xanthous set).  Much to my surprise you can even dress up as a knight in shining armor, although I found it to be rather tacky.\n\nAs with many dating sims there is some "mature content", although I thought it was all fairly tasteful.  The bed of chaos and the gaping dragon scenes were a bit gratuitous but didn't go too far.  Ceaseless Discharge was pretty gross, but some people are into that sort of thing and you can basically just skip it if it really bothers you.  I do wish there was an option for turning off all mature content, but hopefully that'll be in the sequel.  Speaking of the sequel, I really think they should streamline getting outfits to make it a lot easier.  I don't think anyone actually enjoyed the difficulty and the game would really benefit from being more casual.\n\nAll-in-all a fun game!  It can really pull at you emotionally and even make you really angry sometimes but just stick with it and it'll pay off in the end.","August 23, 2013","true","258.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","1"

I'd heard a lot about it and the hype so thought I'd experience it first hand.\n\nTo critique this game is not so straightforward. There are major issues. It's a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port and you will spend your initial time downloading the DSFix 'mod' just so you can get it into a reasonably playable state. Forget about playing it on Keyboard and Mouse, unless you like extra punishment, a controller is a MUST (Steam controller worked well for me as an aside). The graphics are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (even for 2012, but remember at its core this is a last-gen console game). The absence of a tutorial or tooltips will have you alt tabbing and searching YouTube just to try and find out even the most basic of info that will be crucial to your game.\n\nYet despite all that the game rises to be head and shoulders over the sum of its parts. Once you accept the basic premise that you are there to die and learn from your mistakes (the game even has a mechanic where you can watch other people’s death, via a ghost, by clicking on their bloodstain to help learn from their mistakes). Then you will practice and practice and finally get it right - rewarding you with extremely satisfying moments, a feeling not often found in today’s games. There is something to be said for taking on a boss 6 or 7 times then finally defeating him. It's not just a matter of doing the boss fight, it's clearing the trash every single time, occasionally losing your XP in the process, which will serve to both destroy your soul and have you punching the air in triumph when you are finally successful.\n\nOverall the game is akin to flawed genius, you know something is not quite right, the game will brutally punish your mistakes and yet it is almost because of it that you will find yourself coming back for more. I'm pretty sure this is the only game I have actually Rage Quit in the last 5 or so years.\n\nI've recommended picking up On Sale because the game has been around long enough and on sale enough times that you can save your money, add it to your wish list and then grab it at the next sale (unless of course you have a burning desire to play straight away).\n\n\nThe Good:Brutal and satisfying gameplay\nCommunity support\nGood old fashion boss fights\nSound is greatThe Bad:\nCan feel lost as a new player, with very little information to go on\nThe graphics\nYou need to fix the off the shelf game (DSFix) before playing it to avoid a suboptimal experienceThe Ugly:\nA terrible console port, NOT supported after release\nCamera can be frustrating\nPro Tip\nAlthough you may need to go to the Wiki / YouTube to get some of the basics of the game, I highly recommend you stay away from watching boss fights and reading guides - the most satisfying experience will be making your own way through the game.","January 23","true","8.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

The game itself however boasts a solid combat mechanic ahead of it's time, which even in 2015 is one of the best on the market. The dialogue is minimal and the story itself isn't presented like traditional RPGs but the atmosphere just reeks of heart-crushing despair and helplessness. You can genuinely feel the fall of a civilization as you progress through the levels and see the destruction of monuments and countless fallen soldiers turned hollow.\n\nThe level design is a brilliant display of craftsmanship although in the later levels you acquire the ability to warp through specific checkpoints.\nThe colorful bosses will repeatedly destroy you until you get good to the point of not needing to rely on cheesy exploits.\nFitting music too. You will scream in terror at your first encounter with the Taurus Demon while the orchestra and chorus enhances the fear of being crushed to death.\n\nDark Souls has a crazy amount of content and great ideas executed perfectly, if not for the age of the game the full-price of $20 is a massive steal. It's multiplayer and co-op despite being released on the PC in Q3 2012, is still well alive. Of course not as lively as what it used to be but not dead to say the least.\n\nSometimes the player count can exceed what Evolve got on average during it's free-weekend, and that game came out this year.\n\nThere are so few criticisms for the game I would be nitpicking if I were to make one up. Besides it's obvious that the game had a limited budget and time constraints, but the fact that FromSoftware managed to create a game of this magnitude, is just inhuman. Seriously amazing job guys.\n\nOh, and don't forget to install DSfix![www.nexusmods.com]","October 1, 2015","true","246.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

But when I tried to play it, I suddenly heard the low voice behind me, it whispered something like: "oh hey buddy, you wanted to play? No, first you should install the "Windows Live" or you won't be able to save the game". "Yes, my lord," - I answered, and did what the voice asked.\n"Good! But I see LIVE doesn't work on your Windows 8, try to get some updates." So I did. Then I launched the game again, but the resolution was quite low and only on the half of my monitor. "AHAHAH! poor PC-baby! - the voice was laughing on me, - Well, don't worry, you'll just have to find another fix, it's nothing so hard, isn't it?". I googled some stuff and started Dark Souls with it, but it crashed.\nI was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, while the voice continued, this time in my head: "Oh boy, you just forgot to turn off the AA. Also, if you don't wanna play with 30 fps, you should get another patch. And don't forget to install a few more fixes for mouse and keyboard. Plus, you should...".\nTHAT'S IT, - I screamed, - ENOUGH! THAT'S THE HARDEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, I CAN'T EVEN LAUNCH IT. SHUT UP ALREADY, YOU HEAR ME? LEAVE ME ALONE, I DON'T WANT TO  PLAY YOUR STUPID GAME ANYMORE, PLE....\nThe door in my room opened.

The art direction, lore and player interaction are masterfully done. The amazing artstyle alone should come as no surprise from the individuals that have been creating numerous-but-unique mech designs for over a decade.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple, but satisfying. Allowing you to block, parry, dodge, light attack and heavy attack your enemies. What I like about the way the game handles itself with the combat system is how methodical it forces the player to be in unevenly matched fights. A lot of the enemies can be ran past once you understand the layout of the areas, but it can still be a rather tricky endeavor because of various environmental hazards that you'll find along the way.\n\nThe only true complaint I can lodge against the game mechanics are the absurdly generous input buffering for actions that usually do more harm than help. Also, be warned that since this game uses a peer-to-peer system for its multiplayer component, establishing sessions with friends or other people can turn into a frustrating ordeal.\n\nThe game itself is not nearly as diverse in terms of character creation/input as something like an Elder Scrolls game, but this is more than made up for with the gripping and unique world that From have managed to create. Obscurity is a major game mechanic theme of Dark Souls, and is what makes it so much fun to play. The joy of exploring areas that you previously had believed to be thoroughly searched, only to discover a new secret hidden within its crevices. It is this sense of exploration coupled with the very macabre atmosphere that make Dark Souls a truly wonderous experience.","March 15, 2014","true","362.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

Yes. Is it unfair? Mostly not. Is it impossible? Not at all. The main difficulty is how it is unfriendly to new players. You may have troubles understanding where to go, what to do, how to defeat some tough enemies, how to upgrade equipment, etc. Not gonna lie, I consulted some guides once in a while. But if you actually listen to NPCs, look at your environment, and use other players' help, everything gets much easier. The reward is astonishing.\n\nDark Souls features unforgettable action-RPG experience, a grim but beautiful world, violent combat, unique designs, original online features (both coop and PvP), an excellent soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba and high replayability. There are still enough players online, so you won't feel alone. The story is not a main point in the game, but it still has some great characters and side stories, however you need to look carefully not to miss them. Framerate issues at some locations and bad mouse/keyboard controls may spoil your gameplay, so a mod called DSFix and a gamepad are indispensable.\n\nOverall, I liked the game very much. To tell the truth, it took me several attempts to get used to it, but it was worth it.\n\n9/10","March 2, 2015","true","235.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

But as you die you will learn and eventually die a little less and overcome its obstacles giving you a fulfilling feeling of accomplishment.\nIn other words Dark Souls is a hard game. But that’s due to its unforgiving nature that punishes every mistake if you don’t play by its rules.\n\nI played it on PS3 and even though the port has some obvious issues, I have enjoyed it just as much.

If you don't have a controller, there is no reason to ever buy this game, and I'm not buying an XBOX controller just to play this game. Without a controller, menus are horribly irresponsive, mouse acceleration is all over the place, and the game never looks more than 1280x720p, regardless of effects, only options are motion blur and antialiasing.\nGameplay is, again, dreadful without a proper controller, developers don't bother with mouse sensitivity, so any turn will turn you 90 degrees regardless without mods and even then the game is a chore to play, you can't rebind mouse keys, game doesn't even show the computer keys, just controller keys.\nEven ignoring the necessity for controller (which is, frankly, inexcusable considering the game could have been much more well implemented for mouse and keyboard), the PC port is still awful, since no changes were made to accomodate PC, a painful lack of graphical options, an extremely obtuse control scheme that makes no effort to change for a PC title and instead rebinds every button in a jumble across the letter keys, badly optimized graphics, no quality change, etc.\nNow, the elephant in the room: Windows Live. Since June 1st, it has been impossible to go online play or save your game at all, which is, again, an inexcusable oversight for a PC port where save files can be saved on the computer. Don't trust any review before June 1st in regards to functionality, it's no longer relevant.\nThere is no way such a slapdash port should be seen as excusable compared to a console exclusive, regardless of developer of quality, period.","June 23, 2014","false","0.3"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","1"

I'd recommend it and I rate it 8/10. If you are looking for a challenging RPG that doesn't require grinding or deep deep levels of thought towards stats. If you enjoy hard boss fights that act as an exam on the game mechanics and enemies that will put up a fight, then this game is for you.\nGood:\n+The difficulty is not only offers a sense of challenge but also a sense of fear that any enemy can kill you if you dismiss it. It is mostly fair with one or two instances where it just gets silly, but that rarely happens. The feeling inside when you see a new type of enemy is a strangly good sense of fear and dread, wondering if they'll just up and one shot you, or explode or eat you is a weirdly great feeling.\n+The atmosphere is pretty depressing and dark which fits perfectly for the game.\n+World design is very good, the world not only is well connected but it aesthetically seems well connected. There is a vast array of areas that are extremely different, yet feel perfectly connected to each other.\n+Majority of the boss fights are fair, but only some are extremely hard (IMO). If you don't mess around and be serious you can smash most bosses. When you defeat a boss that you are having trouble on it is one of the best feelings leaving you wanting to play more.\n+Combat is very well designed. It's simple and easy to understand and once you get into the zone you will love just going from A-B because of the fantastic combat.\n+The multitude of ways to play makes the game replayable and diverse. You are also not locked into one class, you can level up into any stats you want leaving it open for unique play.\n+Story is interesting but quite shallow, it just left me wanting more of a story and I guess that's a sign of a good story that wasn't fleshed out enough.\n+PVP can be fun but it's too heavily affected by lag making it unfun and obtrusive, but this could just be a personal problem with lag so I'm adding it as a plus.\n+The RPG elements are easy to follow and understand, making it easy for you to get the most out of your character.\n\nBad:\n-Controls can be a bit clunky, making the roll and jump the same button is terrible design, especially when there is no move    assigned to L3/Left thumbstick.\n-The port and GFWL make it pretty annoying to use, but this can easily be ignored\n-As for story, it's interesting but it's pretty shallow. Dark souls fans will always make note of how the story must be found and searched for, this is true. If you look for story and lore you will find it, but, when you do look into it you hit a brick wall quickly. There is a very small amount of background information in the game. Through the game I was super interested in the story, wondering who is this guy and what's his story, and I'd be met with 2 sentences about him. Also, too much of this lore is speculation and it's extremely vague. It's good to leave some things up to interpretation, but god. Not this much.\n-Bad possibly even the worst fanbase. This fanbase enjoys talking down to every other RPG over the casual pastime they enjoy, they refute any claims of bad game design (major or minor), claiming that it would literally ruin the game and they are just generally mean spirited towards anyone who doesn't like the game or has a genuine criticism. It's best to just avoid them and their elitism.\n\n","June 12, 2014","true","51.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

The 3rd person fantasy RPG features a plethora of weapons to cater to a varity of different playstyles and a large world to explore.\n\nThe game opens with a cinematic that gives the player a history of the first flame and souls, but the rest is left to the player to interpret and discover.\n\nThroughout the inter-connected world of Lordran you will find bonfires that restore your healing items (Estus Flasks) whenever you rest at them. The implementation of limited heals creates this 'risk vs reward' aspect to adventuring, where if you run out of your charges, you can either press on towards a new bonfire, or return to the old one to give it another go.\n\nThe Bosses in Dark Souls are brilliantly crafted and offer both test of the players combat knowledge, figuring out the attack patterns, timing your attacks and healing, as well as the crawl back to the boss from bonfires testing your knowledge of the level.\n\nOne minor gripe with Dark souls, is that lag can heavily effect gameplay in certain areas causing annoying deaths and damage. This happens rather rarely, as to not majorly affect the games otherwise good controls.\n\nAll in all, Dark souls is an amazing game that is tough but fair giving a rich fantasy RPG experience to anyone who picks it up.\n\nPraise the sun!","February 9","true","132.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","6"

So, as a result, I avoided buying it. However, in the summer of this year (2015), I decided, why the hell not?  During the Summer Sale I bought it for roughly £7. (I forgot the specific price.)\nI can safely say now, after clocking up almost 300 hours on Dark Souls, and counting, that the purchase was absolutely worth it. So, let's get some context shall we? (There's a lot of context, so be warned!)\n[Also! Dark Souls likes to follow the story-telling method of not telling you the story; if you want to know the lore, you've got to go research it!]\n\n~Set in a pseudo-medieval fantasy world, the game explains that long before the present time, the world was grey, ultimately rocky and dusty and covered by huge 'Arch Trees'. This world was ruled over by the 'Everlasting Dragons' ; aptly named because they were immortal. At this time, there was no light or dark; no life or death in the world, only the Everlasting Dragons.\n~At some point in this world, Fire was born (The game doesn't really explain how, so run with it) and from this flame was born four 'Lord Souls' (Souls in the game, act as a sort of power source for magic and the like, as opposed to being a representation of one's personality.) Three of these souls were found by the 'Lords', a race of humanoid creatures that would later become the 'Gods' of the world, while the fourth was found by the 'Furtive Pygmy', who is widely believed to have been the ancestor of Mankind/The first Human. (I'm not going to explain this story arc; go look it up if you wish to know more.)\n~The Lords rebelled against the Everlasting Dragons, and using their one weakness (lightning-based magic), peeled apart the stone scales that gave the Dragons their immortality. (Without their scales, the Everlasting Dragons are not immortal) The Lord's succeeded, The Dragons were wiped out (supposedly) and this ushers in an 'Age of Fire'; where light and dark, life and death are brought into the world.\n~Now, in between then, and the game start, there's a lot of lore that I won't go into (Again, go research the lore; It's really worth it), but it's safe to say that the Age of Fire began to dwindle and the power of the 'Gods' began to crumble.\n~Fast forward to the present, the world is but a shadow of its former self; with both Kingdoms of the Lords and Human Kingdoms lying in complete desolation. This is because of the 'Curse of Undeath', a condition that replaces death with a form of immortality. However, the reason why it's called a curse is because those who are Undead with no purpose and no motivation/will to live will 'go Hollow', wherein they lose their minds and become reduced to mere husks. These husks are then plagued to wander the world forever; as nothing but shadows of humanity. They are hostile: attacking whoever gets close to them.\n~This, is where you come in. You are a cursed undead waiting to go hollow in an asylum. However, you are freed from your cell to fulfill an ancient prophecy to 'Re-kindle the Age of Fire' (Again, go look it up). And from there on, your quest begins.\n(Big nutshell I know, but this game has metric shed-tonnes of lore!)\n\nSo! With that explained, what's the actual game like?\n~Well, the game does have a reputation for being very difficult, and whereas I didn't really have too much trouble with the game myself, I understand that it can be quite hard to get used to. The game could be said to be a hack 'n' slasher, but also an action-adventure game with RPG elements. At the start of the game, you pick a class to play, (classes include pyromancers, knights, sorcerers etc) and you then play through the game, levelling up and gaining new items to fit that class. The classes can be blended, so don't think that if you pick knight, you're stuck to using melee for the rest of the game; you could do a knight-sorcerer blend, or a knight-pyromancer etc etc etc.\n~The combat (which is basically the core gameplay mechanic of Dark Souls), is very well polished and rounded. It's dangerous enough to maintain a high level of challenge, but balanced enough to be (relatively!) fair; if you die, there's a 90% chance that is was YOU that screwed up, not the game. This balance means that whenever you die, you don't become exasperated, you simply grit your teeth and go at it again. (Not always, but you rarely get to the instance where you might ragequit from the game) In addition, the game carefully avoids being artificially difficult (enemies with ridiculous health bars or stupid amounts of DPS etc), and is instead naturally difficult; with the difficult relying on how well you play the game, not how high-level you are. (It is entirely possible to complete the game without levelling up at all!)\n~The game also includes a unique game-mechanic called the 'Humanity system'. I shan't go into the lore, but basically, humanity can be picked up from monster drops as an item, and absorbed from fallen enemies as 'liquid humanity' (Humanity picked up as items can be used to increase the amount of liquid humanity you possess). This 'liquid humanity' is used to kindle bonfires (basically more health kits at checkpoints), and also to reverse the hollowing process.\nWhen you die in Dark Souls, you lose your liquid humanity, and also your 'Souls' (ingame currency for BOTH purchases and levelling). You can go to recover them from the last safe place you stood before you died, but if you die on the way there, they are gone forever.\n~This is due to the constantly moving world of Dark Souls, and that you can't simply revert a save in Dark Souls; a choice made is a choice made, it cannot be reversed or altered for the rest of the playthrough. (Again, another way the game is naturally challenging.)\n~You can also transition from two separate player states within the game; Human and Hollow. When hollow, you cannot interact with other players of the game, and you cannot summon NPCs to help you with certain boss fights. When Human, you can summon both NPCs and other players into your world for co-op play, but you also run the risk of being invaded by hostile players who seek a duel to the death. Therefore, it is recommended that you traverse most of the world as a hollow, only converting back to human when you need help with a boss or an area.\nAll of these factors combine to make the challenging, yet highly entertaining, odyssey that is Dark Souls.\n\nALL IN ALL, DARK SOULS IS A FANTASTIC GAME.\nI sincerely enjoyed the time I spent playing this game, and I intend to play it for many, many more hours to come. It's tough, engaging, and ultimately, barrels filled with puppies and kittens of fun. This game is definitely worth you buying it!\n","October 26, 2015","true","412.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Easy-to-learn, hard-to-master, not-too-bad-to-get-fairly-okay-at combat. A world with a complex history and obfuscated fate, and characters with more depth than they let on.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\nDark Souls is known to be "hard" or sometimes even "unfair". I strongly disagree with the use of those terms. Challenging, yes, certainly.\nA lot of modern games featurea hell of a lot of hand-holding. Lengthy tutorials, excessive hints, storytelling like you're listening to teacher read from a book.\nDark Souls has none of these things.\nDark Souls respects its players enough to let them figure out how the world works on their own.\nPeople who are used to the handholding may find themselves utterly lost in the world of Lordran - this is a perfect opportunity to get back into the old-school 'explore places and try things' mindset.\n\nThe key to getting through Dark Souls alone is a matter of keeping to a mindful approach. Keep an eye out for items. Always be prepared for combat. Listen carefully to what the NPCs have to say; they drop subtle hints about where you can or need to go, what the backstory is about, and it is important to note that they do NOT repeat the more important things they say.\nDon't worry though - missing dialogue won't stop you from advancing. Not at all. The dialogue is merely there to aid your understanding of your purpose and the world you are in. None of the lore is forced upon you, save for the single opening cutscene which explains little but hints at a lot. In fact, the lore is carefully hidden away, waiting to be discovered and puzzled out by anyone who would seek it.\n\nGameplay-wise, it feels clunky to start with, as all the unfamiliar options and weapons are open to you to be found, and/or left strewn across the world without ceremony. Soon enough, though, the controls will feel nothing short of intuitive, and this *includes* the option of playing with keyboard only (look up the keyboard controls in a guide and give them a go. Dark Souls does not *require* a controller, as such).\nDark Souls respects your ability to learn how to deal with the obstacles it presents, and that applies to every detail. The greater part of advancing in Dark Souls is less about leveling up and more about your own personal skill, which you'll find will naturally develop as you play the game. When you beat a boss, or even any minor foe, you'll feel the satisfaction of knowing it was your own skill that overcame it. The fact that you happen to be level 258 or so is merely a small aid, and adds a side dish of a sense of personal progress.\nIt is in fact entirely possible to beat the game whilst being level 1.\nDon't try that for your first run.\n\nOn the whole, the positive aspects of Dark Souls outshine what I have previously called the pinnacle of my gaming experience by a long shot. If you adore adventure, exploration, skill-based combat, atmospheric environments, deep story, and RPG elements, or any combination of at least two of those, this game is for you.\n\nNext, the bad.\n\nUh.\n\nWell, the tutorial's just a little bit cruel to less experienced gamers. Not too much so, though. Again, learn from things and you'll be fine.\n\nSometimes it is possible to get lost or stuck somewhere, if you missed a door or a key for example, and you may be forced to bring in either the help of spoiler-riddled guides, or a trusted friend. Though Jolly Cooperation is in no way a bad thing; you might even find it enhances the atmosphere in some cases.\n\nThe voice acting is merely passable. Barely even that, really. Dark Souls features a good lot of talented voice actors, but what may have been poor direction has left a lot of their lines sounding a bit.. theatrical. Not that it matters so much; there's all too many things to make up for that in the feel of the game itself.\n\nAlso, some storylines pertaining to some of the characters nearly brought me to tears. That was unexpected. But a good sign of immersion!\n\nOn the whole, Dark Souls definitely has some rough edges. But then I've never found a true work of art that didn't.\nCome for the challenge, stay for the delightful immersion into the strange, unusual world, and in thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, thou better damn well Praise the Sun.","February 18, 2015","true","347.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidTheSid/recommended/211420/","SquidTheSid","Ellen Baker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquidTheSid/","980 products in account","Well, the title says a lot. You will die: a lot. However, you will savor every death as you struggle to improve your own abilities and survive in the oppressive world that From Software has created. The greatest achievement of Dark Souls, to me, is that it treats you like an adult. It does not hold you hand, it does not force endless tutorials or make you follow some generic NPCs as you mow down waves of unnamed brown dudes. No, Dark Souls let you jump into the action rather quickly and teaches you everything you need to know from the getgo in a very unobtrusive manner. Combat is a struggle as you try to read the enemies' attack patterns and react accordingly with your own moves. If you play it like a traditional hack and slash, you will die and go nowhere. Therefore, everything becomes a game of balancing aggression and defense as you learn when to engage, how to engage, when to evade, and when to block. If this sounds complex, that's because it is. Dark Souls will suck up numerous hours of your time with all of its nuances and secrets.\n\nBut the one glaring blemish on an otherwise fantastic experience is the PC port. To be blunt, it's just not very good. It's a very barebones port that utilizes very little of the aspects that we love about PC gaming. However, DSFix largely ameliorates many of these issues, allowing you to play the game at a higher resolution and higher framerate, making it the definitive version of the game. Games For Windows Live, unfortunately, exists in this game and is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. You'll be disconnected from LIVE in the middle of an epic boss fight (it happened to me on the Bell Gargoyles the first time around) and kicked back to the title screen or have save data deleted because GFWL uses a primitive patching system that serves as a massive inconvenience. The keyboard controls, while functional (especially with community fixes) are far from optimal. You'll definitely want a controller for this game. Finally, the game can chug at times even on a high end rig, so don't expect a perfectly smooth experience.\n\nHowever, despite all of that, Dark Souls is a fantastic game. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best games I've played in a very long while. The sense of accomplishment you feel as you claw your way through its brutal world or fend off hostile monsters that can easily kill you is practically uncontested. Most importantly, Dark Souls respects YOU as a player and does not baby you or insult your intelligence. It's a truly refreshing experience and one that most gamers should pick up, provided they're willing to overlook a lackluster port.","November 30, 2013","true","203.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

What makes it so? A formula very close to the one present in games called "Metroidvanias". In short, the idea is that we have a game world almost freely explorable. Almost, because some elements require certain things of the player, be it an item, skill or practical knowledge. The design tries to not implore the one right way, leaving an aspect of creativity for the players. This, in case of a Metroidvania game, Super Metroid, allowed to form a strong community focused on sequence breaking and optimizing playthroughs in the means of tool assisted speedruns. Dark Souls seem to acknowledge such efforts and provide players with tools to unite in cracking the game open. Bloodstains, messages, summoning and on the other hand, PvP, makes you feel being a part of an interesting and mysterious endeavour.\n\nWhile Dark Souls does not have as flexible game world as Super Metroid, it adds its own fresh element in form of eeriness. There is no holding hand so present in 99% of modern video games. Hints are obscure and subcutaneous, in form of item descriptions and vague stories told by NPCs. In fact, most of the plot-meat hides there. One would think this equals to weak lore or story, yet quite the opposite happens. Remember 8-bit games and how you wondered what this sprite really portaits, or imagined details beyond what was shown to you? Remember the feeling of reading your first books? This is what Dark Souls brings: the canvas for you to draw on with your imagination while the game provides brushes and inks.\n\nDark Souls has one important gameplay aspect: you can be killed as easily by the boss as the weakest enemy. This effectively works as a kind of intimidation - you want to be cautios and situations can get tense. At the same time, your mistakes are almost always costly and the landscape also works against you. All of these create a tremendous immersion effect and often make you reconsider your approach, all the while instilling humility into you.\n\nWhat really makes the game fun at the core is the fighting system. The animations are detailed, attacks have the feel and power to them, different weapons have vastly different animation styles. Parry and backstab mechanics are plenty rewarding and never get old.\n\nRPG fans can find huge amounts of customization and variety of playthroughs, but what's important is that the game is fairly balanced in terms of equipment. A weaker gear can be just as much viable, because movement and attack style are equally important with damage dealt.\n\nLastly, you have huge amounts of satisfaction coming from won boss fights and clearing areas, but that's only the resultant of coherent design which allows you to learn, improve and fight with your weaknesses.\n\nIf you want to play a modern video game which does not insult your intelligence and does not constantly put a carrot on a stick in front of you, by any means, check it.","December 8, 2013","true","54.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epicman777/recommended/211420/","epicman777","Invictus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epicman777/","172 products in account","Prepare To Die is a good addition to this game's name. You will die. Lots of times. There is no getting around it. However, the first death is also the first step.\n\nDark Souls is a 3rd Person RPG, set in a fantasy world with very dark themes. You've probably heard about this game from a friend or some person on the internet, and one of the things you've probably heard is the challenge involved. Yes, this game is incredibly hard. No, it is not unfair in any way, and yes, you can do it.\n\nThere's a fairly high barrier to entry for the game, and even then the difficulty is higher than your normal game. However, Dark Souls is not unfair or just a bunch of cheap tactics. The kind of difficulty it presents is respectful. It isn't something like CoD's Veteran difficulty, where they just make the AI react as soon as you enter the room and one shot kills, making many certain spots impassable. Instead, they use creative enemy placement and tight controls to give you the feeling that even though you died this time, you can overcome it the next time. It has a great feelnig of trial and learning by error.\n\nThis is why the death mechanics are what they are, because when you die you lose all of your accumulated souls (kind of like EXP) and "humanity", but if you can go to where you died you have a shot at getting them back. But, die again and they all disappear forever. It gives a feeling that you learn from death, because when you enter that room where you died to get your souls back, you know the surprise that killed you, and can prevent it from happening again. It's a lot like the mantra "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me".\n\nBut good and difficult gameplay is not the only thing Dark Souls has to present. The game presents a world deeply rooted in lore, and you decide your level of involvement with the plot. Maybe you wonder how this person got here or how the situation got as dire as it is, and search through item descriptions and NPC chat to find the answer. Or just pass off the backstory of the horrible monstrosity in front of you and say "Who cares, the game has presented me with another trophy for my wall!". This method of story telling is so that the story does not intrude upon the game, as there are few cutscenes, and the few that there are are very short, and it helps give the game an interconnected, continuous feeling, and contributes to the dark themes of the game.\n\nIn addition to these themes, the game radiates a fantastic atmosphere. The HUD is very non intrusive, only conveying what it needs, and the game continues even if you are in the pause menu changing your gear. Its a sense of continuous action, and that you cannot let your guard down. Graphics are very good, and the game only puts in what it needs. See a giant castle or cave in the distance? You're probably gonna go there at some point. It all gives a sense that you have a purpose and a mission, and that you have to keep moving, even with all the depression included in this world. The soundtrack is also very good, being there at the critical points of the game, such as boss fights. At a lot of points there are silence, but this contributes to the feeling that the game is very tense. In general, everything the game includes is only what is necessary, no extra bits for the sake of content.\n\nEven the multiplayer is there for the sake of the game. There are 3 main types of ways players can interact with each other. First, players can scrawl messages on the ground for others to see, perhaps warning them of an upcoming ambush or trap, or misguiding them due to malicious intent. You have to choose which messages to trust carefully if you want to live. The 2nd way is by summoning white phantoms. Players may leave summon signs on the ground and get help from other players, or even NPC's. They help the player throughout the level, and disappear once the area boss is defeated, but not without reward. It fosters good intent among people. Then, the 3rd way is by invasion of a world for PvP. Players may use specific items in the game to "invade" another player, coming into their world as a dark spirit to kill them and steal their "humanity" and souls. The multiplayer is not a simple deathmatch added for the sake of multiplayer, its there to enhance and enrich the game experience.\n\nOverall, Dark Souls can be summed up as challenge through tight gameplay, creative enemies and terrain and unique multiplayer, with a great atmosphere provided by good graphics, soundtrack and a plot that you can uncover at your own leisure (though the low FPS cap for this doesn't help). All in all, an outstanding game that respects the capabilities of the player by providing difficulty not for difficulty's sake, but for the player's benefit. Prepare to die. But prepare for great emotional reward as well.","May 16, 2014","true","123.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFrontier/recommended/211420/","TheFrontier","Ocelot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFrontier/","89 products in account","This game is the most satisfying game I have ever played to date. I highly recommend it to people who like games that will immerse you in the games world 100% and make you feel like your characters success is your success. When anything and everything can turn out to be an enemy or trap you will be kept on the edge of your seat for your entire play through. Throughout the course of that play through you will encounter next to imposable boss battles and relentless environments that will test your wits and sanity. However every time you conquer one of those ‘impossible’ boss battles the sensation is next to imposable to describe but the sound you’ll make may be something like this “gaaAAAFFFF-aahhhh-YES!!” as you either jump out of your chair throwing your hands and flailing your feet or slump back in your seat and let out a sigh of relief. Either way you will have felt like you’ve leaped over Mount Everest 300 thousand times over and high-fived the heavens. The environments in this game may seem like an impossible feat at times, and maybe a little unfair if you don’t watch what you’re doing or where you step, because that thought will always be in the back of your mind like it was mine when you only have 25% health and but a single estus flask left. “I have to fight a boss after this!?” But worry not future warrior for once you embark on this journey the one thing that will raise your spirits possibly more than conquering the bosses, avoiding booby-traps, exploring enormous landscapes and finding rare loot. “What could be better than all those things?” you may ask. I have but two words for you. The Bonfire. The bonfire is the light at the end of your monster filled tunnel, it is what keeps you going and what keeps you sane, it is your savior and your home, it brings relief and peace of mind in a chaotic world. This is a journey that in my book ranks above all others because it is a real ‘do it yourself’ kind of game that does not walk you through the game like a diaper baby, oh no. In this world you may enter as a naïve wanderer but you will leave a seasoned veteran who feels like they have the world in the palm of their well armored hands, that “this game wasn’t so hard, I bet I can do it again no problem” as you chuckle to yourself. Well Dark Souls will take you up on that, several times over in fact. Conquering this adventure once was by no means and easy feat but should you have the resolve and will for it, have another go at it, only this time lets amp it up and make every single thing two times stronger and seemingly a thousand times more deadly. Every time it gets harder but simultaneously more and more satisfying. Dark Souls will take you to the brink of death and then shotgun you to success if you have what it takes. If you think you do, than dive into the madness and delight. Just, press, start.","February 23, 2014","true","259.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But each and everyone of you has min/maxed to match hardened veterans and count as a thousand. So gentlemen, together we are an army as powerful as a million and one regular invader. Let us rouse those slumbering ones who drove us into the realm of forgetfulness. Let us seize them by the hair, drag them down, open their eyes and make them remember.

The story is told in small conversations with NPCs and in item descriptions & placement. Incredible detail has been put into everything about this game which has a large community that regularly put out additional content (lore videos) that help expand a player's perception of characters. The combat is responsive and hinges of a huge variety of weapons, armour, and spells which really shines when you start playing online (and seeing all the crazy builds other people have come up with).\nThere are some technical hiccups however, with the biggest being the GfWL DRM causing some issues with the innovative co-op/PVP aspect of the game. GfWL is also set to go down at some time in 2014, so hopefully the game will be patched to use Steam to handle the multiplayer in the future.\n\nIn summary: this is a brilliant game, but a terrible port. If you can see past the technical issues, install the DSFix, and have a controlpad to hand, you may just fall deeply in love with this game.","December 13, 2013","true","257.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/transcendency/recommended/211420/","transcendency","Zen-Zinxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/transcendency/","68 products in account","Great game. It's not really the kind of game where you join up with a bunch of people and fight waves of monsters, it's more like you're one of the last people on the planet, everyone else is either undead or becoming undead, and every once in a while you can have the opportunity to join up with another player like you.\n\nThe game is locked at 30fps, but you can unlock it with a mod. Supposedly it's a bit buggy at 60fps, but I've never bothered to try it.\n\nDark souls is an RPG, you level up as you collect souls, you choose what stats to level etc. The contols are simple and within an hour or so you should have them down. This game shines in the customization department. There are tons of weapons and pieces of gear that can allow you to play whatever you feel like, even if you feel like playing some sort of green-skinned monster, you can do it.\n\nThe game world is lots of fun to go through, because it's all interconnected. There are no loading screens as you walk from one place to another, the entire world is essentially a labyrinth, and it is quite satisfying to discover all the connecting points and shortcuts throughout.\n\nPersonally I think what sets dark souls apart is the feeling of intimidation you get when you see a monster 10 times your size, and realize that you have to find a way to kill it before moving on. It's a challenge, based largely on trial and error combined with skill, it is not for those who want to be spoon fed an interactive story. As frustrating as dark souls can be, it matches it and sometimes exceeds it with the feeling of accomplishment.","September 23, 2015","true","289.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/211420/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ A high learning curve for the gameplay, illustrating how important game knowledge and skill are in order to persevere through the numerous difficult parts of the game, truly encapsulating the rewarding feeling of beating a certain dungeon or boss; the game is rarely (if ever) unfairly difficult\n+ Beautifully rendered environments and intricately detailed enemies makes exploring the world of Dark Souls simply breathtaking\n+ A ridiculous amount of content to get stuck in to: with many huge areas to explore, bosses to defeat, and items to collect (personally, the game took me almost 55 hours to unlock all of the achievements, one complete runthrough of the game will take roughly 20-25 hours). The included Artorias of the Abyss DLC will add another 2-3 hours on top of that.\n\n\nNegative\n- While the gameplay is the main focus of the game, the story could do with some more fleshing out; the characters met along the way and their backstories only add so much to the experience.\n\n\nWorth Mentioning\n• When the game was ported to PC initially, certain technical limitations constricted the game, essentially making the game not run optimally (courtesy of From Software not having experience on PC architecture). Luckily, a member of the community created “DSfix”, which essentially optimises the game for PC and greatly improves performance, nullifying many of the problems that plagued the game on release (low resolution, no anti-aliasing, frame rate cap etc.).\n\n\nVerdict\n“Possibly my most engaging and memorable gaming experience to date. Dark Souls is simply one of, if not the best, action RPG I’ve ever played. With difficult gameplay that only sets out to weed out the weak gamers from the best, you would be a fool to want to not challenge yourself and beat this game once in your life.”\n\n9.5/10 TJBs","January 25, 2015","true","57.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

How wrong was I!\nI expected a great game, not an excellent one! This game is by far one of the best games I've ever played, hands down.\n\nRight, the review.\nDark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition is a masterpiece.\nEverything about this game is beautiful, the levels, the enemies, the weapons, the combat, the magnificent multiplayer, the lore (if you care about it), and much more!\nSo many secrets lie within the huge world of Dark Souls, you'll spend dozens of hours just to complete your first playthrough, not to mention that there is a new difficulty level each time you complete the game, to a cap of 7!\nYou'll also, uhm... DIE A LOT!\nBut that's only if you deserved it - if you're not good enough or are not approaching your enemies carefully, you will get punished for sure!\n\nYou can create your own character, name it and change the looks of it. Then you get to choose a class and some starting gear.\nIn this game you'll also meet NPC's, some of which have their own paths and objectives, and you can deal with those how you see fit.\nDid you just meet with some guy and he seemed friendly? Why not joining forces? Or maybe you met with the son of the devil, you'll probably want to keep your distance. Or, just kill them all. No boundaries, right?\n\nI won't go into much more of a detail, because the very first time I played this game I walked in completely blind and climbed my way up through some difficult situations, had to explore and learn how things worked by myself, and I loved every bit of it! So I won't spoil you the surprises.\n\nBasically, if you're into RPG's with real time combat, where the story revolves around you (not some character made up by the developers), then this game is a must!\nIt's a very unique game (not counting the other Souls games) within its genre. But it has a VERY BIG PROBLEM called Games For Windows Live*. But if you have no issue with that, go ahead!\n\n*The game isn't supported by GFWL anymore, and it is working decently so far (23/12/2014), so I'd still recommend you to buy this game.\n\nAlso, this game was meant to be played with a controller (since it's a PC port from consoles), so if you're having trouble using a PS3 controller, check out my tutorial about it on my profile.","September 26, 2014","true","383.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Mostly because so little is explained in-game. I'd recommend watching a few beginners videos on youtube if you feel stuck. Once I got into the swing of it, I fell in love with this game.\n\nIt's the type of game that is so rage inducing, yet so satisfying. You actually fear for your life in certain areas because you are between bonfires, or deep in some unknown area exploring and trying not to die. The boss battles are great, particularly the design of the bosses themselves. I have found myself just appreciating them for a moment...and then they beat me to death in 2-3 hits...lol\n\nThe PvP and summoning are also great elements. I really hope that they switch it to Steamworks soon though, so that the game doesn't lose that aspect of the gameplay, or just die....\n\nThe combat in general is awesome. This is my first run through and I have just went for a strength/endurance build for the most part.\nIt's one of the only games that I have played where I am actually happy to go and check out things on a wiki page, while also trying to avoid any spoilers.\n\nAnyway, it's a fantastic game and very satisfying...and it has also made me facepalm hard, swear at the TV, and temporarily quit the game to calm down, but when you beat the boss or area you are stuck on, and get to grips with the subtly of the combat, it is hard to top.","May 17, 2014","true","135.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","20"

I've spent 200+ hours on this game on both PC and PS3 and I still never get tired of making new characters and trying out different builds.  The difficulty is tough but fair, and once you get used to the controls (and learn to roll dodge instead of use a shield), it becomes much more manageable.  And you WANT the challenge.  You want the bosses to be able to kick your ♥♥♥ fairly if you make mistakes.  You want to learn new tactics to defeat new enemies.  You want to dress your character up in the most badass Fashion Souls armor you can get.

The graphics are rather poor for 2011, but don't let that get you down. Dark Souls is a carefully crafted experience that you can only really fully grasp the first playthrough. Many players wish they could go back and re-experience their first time playing.\nThe replayability of the game comes in the diverse weapon choices and character builds, as poking enemies to death with a dagger is way, way different than swinging around a gigantic two-handed blade and, well, crushing them, I suppose. If you want the intended experience, I suggest starting your first playthough as the Warrior, as its a well-rounded character with a decent starting equipment set, and choosing nothing (or the Pendant... don't talk about the pendant! Please!) as your starting gift, as the items, which you can acquire in the game itself, are really powerful at the start of the game.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for?

That's not to say it's "easy" even if you know exactly what to do, just that it's the extremely cheap sort of "challenge", like playing rock-paper-scissors with three fingers sawn off while the other guy plays with both hands.\n\nThe short version is that most of the enemies have access to powers/abilities/outright hacks that you most certainly don't and you pretty  much have to look up guides and wikis to get through areas, moreso bosses, in a timely fashion. There is a bit of fun to be had here, but I feel like the game should have a South Park-esque warning label:\n\n"All combat is made to look more difficult than it rightly should be... Poorly. Due to shamelessly fake difficulty the following game should not be played by anyone."\n\nYou can enjoy the game, but less so as you notice the many, many ways it plain cheats.\n\nStarting with the obvious and thus possibly taken for granted; enemies have infinite ammo and spells to throw at you. You have no such thing. Those arrows, bolts, spears, magefire, and the rest can hit you from distances the player can't even target from. Even if you could lock onto things from the distances they apparently can, your magic dissipates into nothing at what can be insultingly short ranges and projectiles lose impact before too long. Enemy fire always seems to do full damage. Finally, enemy projectiles of all sorts will arc mid-air to hit you. I can understand magic doing this, as it's magic, and the player's Soul Arrows can curve a little bit as well, but ordinary arrows fired by you do not.\nSpeaking of curving in mid-air, most humanoid enemies seem to have some kind of leaping lunge attack that can track your position and hit you by changing the direction of the attack as they're flying, weapon raised. Once more, the player cannot do this.\nQuite a few foes have unblockable one-hit kill attacks, usually in the form of a grapple that can kill you from full health if you aren't pouring points into Health from the start.\nSome enemies (Silver Knights in Anor Londo especially, in my experience) can block damage with their shields when not blocking at all, but your weapon touches the shield before touching their bodies. The player has no such ability, even with the most powerful tower shield in the game.\n\nFair's fair if we could do everything they could, I could understand calling that a challenge to use the AI's own tricks against them. However, they're all advantages that monsters will hold over you forever, which is pretty close to the definition of unfair. Certainly, you can strike back on some of the bosses with unfair tactics, but is that the sort of gameplay you were hoping for here?\n\nA general limitation on the combat is the inability to move while firing a bow or crossbow, because if you could there would be no reason not to kite pretty much every boss to death. Challenge lies in overcoming an obstacle, be it in the form of the environment or an enemy. It is not being told you just can't walk around it because that would be too easy and the powers that be were too lazy to place different obstacles for those that pick a different path instead of great big walls. That is to say, ranged combat is not a viable means of getting through the game for most people because there wouldn't even be an illusion of challenge if it were.\n\nNow, there's an obvious reason for these things, "It wouldn't be challenging otherwise!" That there, I think, should say everything that needs to be said about the game, without these cheap tricks, it's not challenging at all, and as challenge is not defined by cheap tricks, it follows that Dark Souls is not a challenging game as much as it is a cheap, frustrating one. I've played for over 300 hours, (cutting out what might mostly have been grinding for items or standing around waiting to be summoned as a phantom while doing something else outside the game) and in that time I found ignoring the broken difficulty more of a challenge than any of the bosses, the only remote enjoyment I derive anymore comes from helping other people kill bosses in the now-legendary feat of Jolly Cooperation. Even that wears thin when you're only getting called maybe three times an hour in the highest-traffic summoning spots.\n\nNone of this is even taking into account the Invasion mechanic, in which players likely more experienced than you can jump into your world under certain circumstances and kill you for a laugh, or completely subjective things that might have just been me, like randomly slipping off cliffs when standing a good few feet away from them.\n\nI have two ideas of challenge in a game, God of War and Saint's Row. The former features some difficult combat that can be overcome through skill and determination. The latter features a bunch of rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with rocket launchers that you're more likely to overcome through dumb luck or even cheat codes. Dark Souls falls on the Saint's Row end of the spectrum, fake difficulty taken to an artform. If all you'd like is a big, dark world to explore, peppered with bosses to kill in a romp of medieval fantasy violence... Then I'd recommend a Castlevania game instead.","July 25, 2014","false","554.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

When the game came out years ago, I was tasked to make a review of it, and I bashed the game so God damn hard. However, over the time, some of it's issues got fixed, while others seem more or less forgetable. Is the game good? Well... It's more or less a "flawed master-piece". As usual though, I'll start with the bad stuff of the game.\n\nThe biggest issue on the game, something that has stayed over the years, is the fact that the PC port is a piece of crap. Now follow me on this, it wasn't a piece of crap before, but rather an ENTIRE crap. After a few years of the Games  For Windows Live release, the devs FINALLY NOTICED how bad it was, and since GFWL sort of died, they ported it fully into Steam, and fixed SOME of it's issues. However, the game still performs badly in some PC's, while playing with a keyboard is a sadistic experience. You NEED a controller. And it also doesn't help that all text and tips ingame show Xbox360 controller buttons. EDIT: I also forgot to mention Blight-Town, an area of the game. F#ck my #sshole sideways, that place still has insane frame-rate drops and plays like crap today. Avoid it at all costs. You can infact avoid most of it by getting the Master Key at the start AND I SERIOUSLY SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME. IT EVEN HAS SOME FPS DROPS ON CONSOLE FOR F#CK SAKE!\n\nThe second issue on it, is the multiplayer. Now, if you have played this game, I will ask you to read this to the end before bashing this review. It's fun and inmersive, but it's also broken as hell. To begin with, there's quite the amount of hackers roaming arround the game, some of them are nice and only modified their character in a cosmetic point. Others though, have unlimited HP, unlimited stamina, and even broken items that are not supposed to be used, like the infamous Instant-Curse sword. Of course it's fun when you manage to kill them, like I did already a ton of times (will put one of my videos about it under this text), but most of the time you'll die because of the hacks.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3-HyN00TLo\n\nThe other part of the broken multiplayer is something that I've also decided to exploit, and study how broken it was. There is some sort of level system when you invade, meaning that if you're level 100 it's not possible to invade someone of level 10 in normal ways. However, you can play the entire game at low levels, get insane gear and then come back to low level areas to EXTERMINATE other players in literally one hit, even through their shields because of their low stats. I literally started as Pyromancer, leveled up to lvl13, went through the game like that, farmed Giantdad set (except double Black-Flame, haven't yet gone NG+), and went through the Undead Parish killing people (and a ton of hackers) for days. And I was not the only guy doing it. For what I know, it's sort of fixed in Dark Souls 2, but the devs did nothing to avoid that in DK1, so you should AVOID multiplayer at low levels, or get ready to get completely annihilated. EDIT: I also did a video on that as well, forgot to put it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDyj29C2Mxk\n\nAnother issue I have is more or less with the community. Guys, let's sit down for a minute here and talk about this: Dark Souls IS NOT DIFFICULT. It's not. It's a fair game with fair difficulty. The issue is that most OTHER GAMES are TOO EASY, hold your hand too much. If you trully want difficult games, there's way better ones than this one. Dark Souls is a game where you are supposed to think before you act, not another of those casul games where you just run straight ahead, eat lead and then hide for 8 seconds until the blood of your screen cleans up. If you die, it's 90% of the times YOUR fault, the other 10% being unpatched bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC controls, broken multiplayer or bad network.\n\nThe last issue is something that a lot of people will sadly experience, and it's the fact that while it's cool that the game does not hold your hand at all, once outside the tutorial area you will NOT know where the f#ck you're supposed to go. The game doesn't trully give you any direction (except for the Firelink crestfallen NPC, but his hints ain't really that helpful and he will move from there midway the game anyway). That means you'll have to explore, and most likely you will go the wrong way, and face enemies WAY tougher than the enemies you're supposed to be facing at the moment, which will utterly f#ck the living sh#t out of you. A map could've been cool, and it wouldn't kill the inmersion of the PLAYER ITSELF (or the character) was the one drawing it.\n\nThat being said, the game is quite fun, once you go over those problems. It's really inmersive, and it's one of those kind of games were you can find a ton of different ways to get over a problem. The amount of variety in weapons, armor, spells and items is quite great, and seriously beats other games such as Skyrim, where most items are the same  but with slightly higher stats and different graphics. Here, most weapons feel unique, although some of them like the Pickaxe really suck in all kinds of ways. You can also upgrade weapons into different kinds of stats and even upgrade them into new, special weapons, most of them from fallen bosses.\n\nThe gameplay, ignoring bugs and such is solid. You trully feel like it's a dangerous place, and trully feel in control. You can build your own character, your own playstyle, and even go through the bosses in whatever dumb order you feel like.\n\nThe lore is there. It's explained through item descriptions (something I find dumb, but it kind of works out) and NPC's, which are GREAT.\n\nThe multiplayer, ignoring the fact that it was some huge flaws, is also quite fun. Is the game being too difficult on your casul butt? You can summon random players from other parts of the world into your game, to aid you through the area and beat the boss. However to do so, you need to be human, and being human also allows other random players to INVADE your game, and hunt you down. There are different covenants based upon the multiplayer aspect, although if you're playing alone and leaving the multiplayer aside, you won't give a crap about them.\n\nThe character creation system is also hilariously broken, allowing the player to, if you so desire, create some seriously disgusting abominations as your character.\n\nIn the end, it's a good game, and I do recommend it. However, you should only play it if you enjoy a fair challenge, like RPG-Action games, AND HAVE A WORKING CONTROLLER. Without a controller, the game is literally unplayable. I ended up picking it up for 5€ on a sale, and for that price it's a solid purchase.\n\nJust remember though, THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE.\n\nI also made a video time ago about my first serious playthrough (the first one was in PC at release and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, a year later I played it on Xbox360, where I had fun), showing that the game ain't really that difficult and it's actually a ton of fun, highlighting the best moments. It's filled with spoilers though, be aware of that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxmZk1C906I","February 4","true","18.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"

It's explained through item descriptions (something I find dumb, but it kind of works out) and NPC's, which are GREAT.\n\nThe multiplayer, ignoring the fact that it was some huge flaws, is also quite fun. Is the game being too difficult on your casul butt? You can summon random players from other parts of the world into your game, to aid you through the area and beat the boss. However to do so, you need to be human, and being human also allows other random players to INVADE your game, and hunt you down. There are different covenants based upon the multiplayer aspect, although if you're playing alone and leaving the multiplayer aside, you won't give a crap about them.\n\nThe character creation system is also hilariously broken, allowing the player to, if you so desire, create some seriously disgusting abominations as your character.\n\nIn the end, it's a good game, and I do recommend it. However, you should only play it if you enjoy a fair challenge, like RPG-Action games, AND HAVE A WORKING CONTROLLER. Without a controller, the game is literally unplayable. I ended up picking it up for 5€ on a sale, and for that price it's a solid purchase.\n\nJust remember though, THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE.\n\nI also made a video time ago about my first serious playthrough (the first one was in PC at release and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, a year later I played it on Xbox360, where I had fun), showing that the game ain't really that difficult and it's actually a ton of fun, highlighting the best moments. It's filled with spoilers though, be aware of that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxmZk1C906I","February 4","true","18.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"

There are some silver linings, but they all come with big black clouds attached.\n\nThere's something compelling here - it's vaguely Metroid-like in how you really do feel like you're venturing into the unknown. And Dark Souls passes on the common flaws of modern cutscene-laden action games, which is nice to see. But in doing so it draws on the worst parts of old-school D&D, then adds in a few terrible design decisions on top. So at the end of the day it's just a disappointing dungeon crawler, albeit one with an sometimes-rabid fanbase.","February 10, 2014","false","55.2"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","26","43","2","0"

Dark Souls sets of to be an “Old School” game, where the term old school means confusing, unclear, vague, and downright purposefully clunky.\n\nI knew what I was getting into, a game that is suppose to be tough at first, but over time has solid mechanics that keep you coming back in the same way Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) was. What this game is, is a complete miss an all cylinders.\n\nThe game starts off dumping you into a jail/keep where you have to escape from. During that about 20 minutes are very very basic tutorials. Right bumper = swing, right trigger = heavy swing. Which is good, but right after if gives you the button assignments, nothing. Oh and the stats system and leveling up good luck on that, nothing helpful is said about it. It's worth noting that any time your user has to look up a walk through to understand something as central as what stats do what to an RPG game, the developer should really take a step back and ask “How and what information am I communicating to the user?” If what is needed to be conveyed is central to the understanding of the game system, and is purposefully or negligently concealed you have already made a huge mistake. Dark Souls takes this mistake and makes it a central game mechanic.\n\nI get the sense that at some point the developers wanted to make a fighting/hack and slash system that was consistent, in that there was no slicing through enemies (because you missed the hit box) which is a good idea. Again though the game comes to a crashing to a halt when you consistently die without any understanding of what you could have done differently to result in a better outcome. Again Dark Souls hides information from the user, you'll get combat pop-up bars that are conveying information but what that information is you are never told. Is that meter something positive or a negative? You won't know because at no point does the game ever clue in the player to what their avatar is dealing with.\n\nI could go on but I have a feeling I'll be drowned out by people telling me I should have played longer then I did. I'm not a teenager, I have a full time job and I get precious few hours of free time. I do not want to use them dealing with a game that seeks to make itself more challenging by keeping information from me.","May 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","1"

I initially had passed on watching it in the theater because I thought it looked childish, but was convinced to give it a try now that it was out on video. Boy, was my initial impression wrong.\nThe story revolves around a selfish prince who is turned into a llama by one of his subjects. With the help of a kindly peasant he attempts to regain his throne, and in the process finds there's more to him than he previously thought or wanted there to be. While the moral is a good one, it really plays a secondary role to the comedy, which is literally non-stop. GROOVE takes the rapid-fire humor that Disney perfected in Aladdin and combines it with cartoon-style hijinx, the wit of David Spade, and a hilarious lack of reverence for the traditional Disney animated genre. Spade plays his role to perfection, and luckily never crosses the line into being obnoxious. Seinfeld fans are in for a treat, as Puddy plays a very special side-kick role. You really can't take your eyes off the screen for a minute, because you're guaranteed to miss a gag of some sort. The humor works mainly on an adult level, even though kids will be rolling from the funny visuals and some of the more obvious jokes.\nThe DVD itself is a good one. The digital transfer was excellent and the sound quality is top notch. The commentary track is one of the better that I've heard, with interesting and funny insight from all contributors. Animated menus. There's a deleted scene that was probably best left out, but is interesting to watch anyway, plus a few other fun features.\nIn the end, this is one of the best Disney flicks to come along in years. Hardcore Disney fans will eat it up. But even if you're not a fan of Disney's usual animated features you should give GROOVE a shot. Cast aside your pre-concieved notions and you just might be in for a very pleasant surprise. I was.

It could be the greatest game of all time. But you see that "Strongly recommended to have a gamepad" message? Yeah, I bought a controller specifically for this game, and it doesn't work. The controller works with every single other game, but this POS PC port is god awful. I've tried every bug fix, re-installed, and contacted support. Still doesn't work. I'm not going to play it without a controller, and the game's unplayable without it. Yeah, I could mod it to make it more bearable, but if you port a game to PC without making the game at least half decent, you don't deserve the money. If I could refund the game, I would.\n\nCURRENT REVIEW: The games alright, finally found a mod to make the game think that my XBOX 360 CONTROLLER is an XBOX 360 CONTROLLER.

It shows you your enemies move sets and potential traps so that you can do better with your next life.\nThat might seem like a bad thing in an RPG, but for this RPG it really sets the dark feeling of isolation and beeing "lost" in the very hostile world of Lordran. The world is nearly completely free to explore right from the begining, yet you won´t progress much if in the wrong areas. There even are areas that aren´t needed for the story at all, which is a thing most games don´t do anymore.\nAll this may result in a playtime of 60-100Hours on the first playthrough if played blind. (I admit, i didn´t play completely blind :( )\n\nAlso lore is handled very differently than in everything i´ve seen so far, there´s an intro video telling you a tiny bit and the rest is up to you to find and combine through conversations and item descriptions. That may mean that you really have to "work" to feel immersed, but it weirdly doesn´t make the lore any worse but  better since your imagination takes a Huge role.\n\nGameplay wise Dark Souls  is one of the best games I´ve played so far, it doesn´t have any complex or fancy combos, but it has a wide variety of weapons, shield, spells, pyromancies and miracles to fit everyones playstyle in some way.\nAdded to that is the harsh management of your stamina that is more than limited, a great counter and parry mechanic, sneaky backstabs and a working, yet a bit unfair and broken PvP and Co-op mechanic. The multiplayer sadly is a bit hard to manage because of the GFWL.\n\nDid i mention GFWL?\nThat brings us to the bad sides of this version of Dark Souls.\nIt is a bad port, like REALLY bad. You need to install a mod called DSfix to make it work, and even then GFWL could cause some trouble, which really is a shame.\nThese are severy problems that can be fixed easily though. There are a ton of Videos on Youtube that show you how to install DSfix and the steam forums are always nice if you ask there too, so don´t be scared even if you´ve never inbstalled a mod before.\nWhen the mod is installed the game runs well and even looks far better than console versions, and that really is worth the modding.\n\nAll in all this concludes to me telling you that this is probably the best ActionRPG you could (and should) buy.\nAnd as always:\nPrepare To Die!","January 26, 2014","true","91.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chacobos/recommended/211420/","chacobos","Solaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chacobos/","141 products in account","This is obviously a very late review of Dark Souls so why review it now? Well to start things off simple, the big sales are coming around so if you feel the urge to buy it from Steam but not sure about it? Well here's a review you may or may not find helpful. The other reason is...Dark Souls II is just less than four months away and what better way to prepare than to review its predecessor for newcommers!\n\nCombat:\nThe combat in Dark Souls is very basic, you have your left hand equipment for blocking and right hand equipment for attacking of two types, standard and strong attacks. Keeping this in mind that it can and might apply to all classes you may use, there are different classes you can make so you might be a sorcerer, cleric, strenght, dexterity, or mix. Also keeping this in mind, each weapon has a certain stat that scales and is required to use. This adds to the combat of what you can and can't use. Now onto the actual combat sequences: the actual combat is well designed and very fluid. Any time you die it is always your mistake of how you approached an enemy. It's no hack and slash game that's for sure, that is how you get yourself killed. Combat in this game is all about timing and approachment and it's glorious.\n\nStory:\nNow I will not get much into this, not that there is much surface story for you to absorb from just plowing through but, the story starts you off in a place called the Undead Asylum. After you escape you learn of these two bells and from there on out your journy continues There is a bit more of the surface story that can be hand fed to you but like I said, not going to spoil much. The lore or backstory of this is what links everything that may seem confusing together. Through From Software's brilliant design they have made it like a broken puzzle to find it all out. You learn everything through item descriptions, dialgogue, and even some times just by the looks of the area if your observant enough. It's hard work but the results will not dissapoint.\n\nBosses & Common Enemies:\nTo start this seciton off, we're going to start with common enemies, yeah those guys. The enemies in Dark Souls are of interesting nature, unlike in games like the First Person Shooters where they stand around like lost children, these enemies are aggressive and persistent. They are stupid enough to beat but smart enough to punish. Now when I say stupid I do not mean fit the shapes stupid, I mean they are trimmed down just enough to where they are not some diety sent form the gods to punish you, they are very much beatable. Some enemies may be smarter or tougher than others but all are beatable. The trick is they all know how to punish you for screwing up. Mistakes in Dark Souls are not forgiven.\n\nThis paragraph will all be for the details of the most epic fights you will face, even if the boss seems...eh. Okay, skipping the obvious known fact of Dark Souls being known for its intense boss fights, lets discuss WHY they're intense.  Music only plays on very few occasions outside of boss fights but when these boss fights do ensue, music starts that captivates the feel of your character's challange ahead of them, the terror that they are fighting. With that included you can even tell by the way the boss fights. If it's sad or depressing music, it is a story of tragedy or sorrow. Vice versa if it's loud and fast, you get the feeling the boss is  full of rage or beast-like properties that knows no mercy. These boss fights are something that are more than just a challange, they have a story behind them and are masterpieces, each and every one of them...except Bed of Chaos.\n\nGraphics & performance:\nNow this is a subject I usually leave alone but in Dark Souls's case, it must be adressed. Not because it truely matters if you played it on PS3 or Xbox 360 but because of how atrocious of a port this game was. Locked in at 30 frames per second with a very poor graphic quality locked in that wasn't even 720p made it look terrible on the stretched screen of the PC. It was an exact copy paste of the Xbox 360 version, no modifications to optimize this baby. Now before you start getting freaked out and shy away, there is a mod to fix this. It is called the DSFix mod and it unlocks the frame rate and graphics settings. If you don't got the mod the game will look muddy and not play smooth, with it installed you got a pretty, dark atmospheric game and have a smooth frame rate that doesn't murder your frames in the cruel area of Blighttown.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI know this review seems a bit short and very rushed and it is, 2:36 in the morning is not the ideal time to do these things. I am going to give it 2 scores, one w/o the mod and one with it. This is being done so you can get an idea of what  experience you will get.\n\nWIthout the mod:  6/10.\nThis game is nearly unplayable without the mod. The keyboard bindings are not so hot, the frame rate is locked in at 30 which for a PC game is not the ideal setting to be playing at, and very muddy, stretched graphics from the locked in graphics setting of something less than 720p stretched out onto a monitor.\n\nWith the mod: 9/10\nIf you got the mod installed you will not regret it at all and you are in for a masterpiece only obtainable by the skills of From Software and the publishing efforts of Namco Bandai.\n\n\nAfter notes:\n-It is highly recommended to use a gamepad for this game. Keyboard bindings like I said are not that good and this is a straight up console port.\n\n-Installation of the mod is easy, follow the files in the order below in whichever program x you have\nSteam\nSteamApps\nCommon\nDark Souls Prepare to Die Edition\nDATA\nNow drop the files you have extracted from the DSFix compressed into here and follow any remaining instructions.\nFind DSFix and edit the game settings there.\n","November 27, 2013","true","72.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The good things about it are stupendously amazing (combat, sense of place and immersion, Metroidesque world design) but the weird stuff about it is kind of crazily ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (opaque RPG mechanics, boss resistances/weaknesses that cannot be logically deduced). The barrier to entry is absurd and I would argue most gamers - not most people, most *gamers* - would need to take a look at the game wiki before even attempting the first level if they want to get any enjoyment out of it at all. I would also argue that half the reason for the fanatical cult following is that it's the exact opposite of all the boring lead-you-by-the-nose design-by-committee perpetual-quest-marker ♥♥♥♥♥♥-cutscene-riddled tutorial-fests that dominate AAA gaming at the moment. Like modern games are so scared you might get a widdle bit stuck somewhewe, so petrified of the rollercoaster stalling for a minute, that they've sacrificed the satisfaction you feel when you discover stuff for yourself and overcome real obstacles in exchange for an experience which is kind of okay fun the whole time but completely unmemorable afterwards. But boy oh boy is this game a crazy backlash against all these tendencies.\nI recommend it because I think it's utterly fascinating and totally fantastic that it exists, and that anyone who likes games should give it a go at least once because if you're the right kind of person for it you'll probably love it so much that it will ruin other games for you. But by the same token, The Legend of Zelda games conjure a lot of the same good feelings, without the trade-off of all that dread and fear and frustration. So this is a recommendation with a caveat I guess. I dunno. This is probably not a great product recommendation. I'm really bad at selling stuff to people. The only thing I could sell when I worked at a phone store was an iPhone most of the time, and that was because people would literally just come in and say "Hello, I want an iPhone".\n\nEDIT: After an investment of a good 25 hours, here is my revised review: this game is amazing. Buy it. Buy it now.","July 23, 2014","true","49.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It shows you your enemies move sets and potential traps so that you can do better with your next life.\nThat might seem like a bad thing in an RPG, but for this RPG it really sets the dark feeling of isolation and beeing "lost" in the very hostile world of Lordran. The world is nearly completely free to explore right from the begining, yet you won´t progress much if in the wrong areas. There even are areas that aren´t needed for the story at all, which is a thing most games don´t do anymore.\nAll this may result in a playtime of 60-100Hours on the first playthrough if played blind. (I admit, i didn´t play completely blind :( )\n\nAlso lore is handled very differently than in everything i´ve seen so far, there´s an intro video telling you a tiny bit and the rest is up to you to find and combine through conversations and item descriptions. That may mean that you really have to "work" to feel immersed, but it weirdly doesn´t make the lore any worse but  better since your imagination takes a Huge role.\n\nGameplay wise Dark Souls  is one of the best games I´ve played so far, it doesn´t have any complex or fancy combos, but it has a wide variety of weapons, shield, spells, pyromancies and miracles to fit everyones playstyle in some way.\nAdded to that is the harsh management of your stamina that is more than limited, a great counter and parry mechanic, sneaky backstabs and a working, yet a bit unfair and broken PvP and Co-op mechanic. The multiplayer sadly is a bit hard to manage because of the GFWL.\n\nDid i mention GFWL?\nThat brings us to the bad sides of this version of Dark Souls.\nIt is a bad port, like REALLY bad. You need to install a mod called DSfix to make it work, and even then GFWL could cause some trouble, which really is a shame.\nThese are severy problems that can be fixed easily though. There are a ton of Videos on Youtube that show you how to install DSfix and the steam forums are always nice if you ask there too, so don´t be scared even if you´ve never inbstalled a mod before.\nWhen the mod is installed the game runs well and even looks far better than console versions, and that really is worth the modding.\n\nAll in all this concludes to me telling you that this is probably the best ActionRPG you could (and should) buy.\nAnd as always:\nPrepare To Die!","January 26, 2014","true","91.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You will die alot but each death will teach you something, If you like the challanging gameplay this game is one of the best. This game is hard when you first play it because lack of instructions for beginers but as you go on game will become easy.\n\nPros:-\n\nLots of unique enemies. Each area has its own type of enemies. I should say these normal enemies will kill you more than area boss.\nGreat Level Design. All the areas in the game are interconnected.\nSome of the best boss fights I ever seen. It feels very satifying to kill some bosses.\nGreat sound design. Ambient music when you fight with boss feels great. Sound when boss hit their weapon and you block it with your shield feels real.\nLots of weapons to choose from. Every weapon has its own unique move set.\nYou can build your character anyway you like.\nGreat DLC content.\nCoop and PVP battles.\nCons:-\n\nPyromancy feels over powered. Most of the bosses in dark souls are weak to fire, Even some of them are good against fire they still die easily with fully upgraded pyromancies.\nVery bad PC port. One of the worst port I ever seen. Frame rate some times drops at certain areas not much but you can feel it. Although game's art style is great graphics doesn't feel that great.\nThis game is not perfect. It has its flows.

There’s no hand-holding here, you’ll learn the ropes by playing, and the game will test you at every step, frequently killing you. The challenges are finely tuned, appearing almost impossible at first, but are in fact perfectly fair and doable, and a source of great satisfaction once beaten.\n\nThe fantastic combat takes the center piece here, being easily the best you’ll find in any Action-RPG. It requires tactic, demands attention and rewards patience like no other; all while providing you a vast array of weapons and armors to equip, and diverse enemies to test them, through expertly designed levels. Another high point, the melancholic story is masterfully told through subtle details in the scenery, hints in the items descriptions and concise, well-written lines from a cast of memorable NPCs, never relying in long expositions or lazy “Lore Books” by wannabe-writers.\n\nFrom Software raised the bar with Dark Souls; it’s not the best game ever, but it’s one that excels in absolutely everything that it does.","August 25, 2012","true","90.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I tried to eat it straight out of the oven and I burned the ♥♥♥♥ out of the roof of my mouth and now I can't stop using my tongue to rub at the raw spot where I used to have skin. Dark Souls is sort of like that—it hurts, but it's a good kind of hurt that makes you wonder if maybe you aren't a little bit of a masochist after all.\n\nThe story of Dark Souls centers around a customizable player character, know as the Chosen Undead. In a world where the undead are cursed to become vicious "hollow" beings, the Chosen Undead embarks on a quest to gather the four Lord Souls of the realm and defeat Lord Gwyn so that he can rekindle the First Flame to put an end to the curse of the undead. The plot of Dark Souls is vague and unguided, with players receiving very little direction on which task they should be pursuing next or which area they should approach. The attractively lacking narration leaves much open to interpretation and requires players to explore Dark Soul's open world in depth—a perilous task in a world inhabited by enemies that are often much stronger than the player's initially weak character.\n\nBut it doesn't matter what Dark Souls is about. Dark Souls's unemphasized storyline allows for the main focus of the game to be given the limelight because, without a doubt, Dark Souls is a game whose shining element is its gameplay. Players are given a wide array of equipment options, allowing for an unending variation in playstyles. Where I played as a heavily armored knight with a spear and a greatshield that remained constantly on guard while poking out from behind my shield and slowly whittling my opponents down, others prefer the lighter, more perilous style of a dual-handed dodger armed with daggers and wearing nothing but rags. All styles of play are valid in Dark Souls, with the well-balanced gameplay and stats providing each one with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe enemies of Dark Souls are often aggressive and powerful, with many of them being able to destroy the player in only a couple of hits. Players earn souls for defeating enemies, which are used both as a currency and as an experience system in Dark Souls. When a player is defeated, their souls are dropped down onto the ground—often several levels worth of experience, all waiting for you to come back and claim it. Should you die before reaching those souls, they're lost and you must start over again in order to build those levels back up. Hours upon hours of gameplay, lost.\n\nHowever, Dark Souls balances its risk and reward experience mechanism just as well as it balances its combat. Dark Souls is challenging, but it never approaches unfair. Each death is well earned: maybe you didn't roll quite quick enough, or maybe you tried to heal even though you knew you should have blocked. Every mistake is your mistake. Every death is your death. There are never moments where you believe the enemies, despite their massive strength and formidable countenances, are overpowered or undefeatable. It's not a question of whether or not the bosses can be killed; it's a question of whether or not you have the skills and the knowledge to make the final blow. And when you die (and you will die, many, many times), you learn and you progress. And next time maybe you won't be quite so slow or so careless.\n\nFor years my best friend and I would check the used games shelf at GameStop (back when we were both console peasants, before the GTX series graced our lives) and we would see it: Dark Souls, the game that we always wanted but never picked up because everyone lauded it as "too hard to play—like really hard, man". And don't get me wrong, Dark Souls is hard. It is crushingly unforgiving, with a combat system that rewards cunning and tactics while testing both your physical and mental reflexes. The price for failure is high, but the satisfaction of victory? Well, that's the ultimate reward.\n\nAs a friendly heads up, many people say that the PC port of Dark Souls is particularly low quality (and it is). Nonetheless, the console version of this game runs at an abysmally low framerate, making a bad port better than no port. Be sure to slap a little bit of DSfix on it and read up on how to get the optimal performance out of the PC version of Dark Souls. Once it's set up, it blows the console version out of the water.","January 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

High poise heavy armor shrugs off this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n3) Since bosses will kill you frequently, you'll spend much time going from bonfires to boss fights.\n\n4) There's a hidden bonfire at the top of seth's funhouse and somewhat close to the boss bed of chaos (hidden behind an illusory wall)\n\n5) IMPORTANT: If you input a jumping slash attack (right bumper plus up) but can't start the animation immediately (you're blocking an attack) the game will eat your input and use the thrust attack (right bumper) with horrendous cooldown and start up. The game dropping that input killed and frustrated me more than anything by far.\n\n6) You will get one or a couple black knight weapons. Upgrade it with twinkling titanite and it will carry you to the end of the game.\n\nYou will be lost, you will learn how to die, and eventually you will learn how to NOT die.","January 29, 2015","true","79.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

It will make you feel small and defeated at times, but when you keep coming back for more and finally succeed, there's such a strong sense of accomplishment with your victories.\n\nDark Souls isn't your traditional "Quest Line" kind of RPG. The game gives you little to no direction, the game wants you to use your brain and figure it out YOURSELF. Dark Souls has a very "indirect" way of telling its story, through NPC conversations, world design changes, and item descriptions. It's very heavy in lore and its actually really interesting and well thought out. The game also draws very heavy influence in its design from the Manga/Anime "Berserk". Dark Souls is a game I would recommend to only the most hardcore of gamers, it can and will run circles around you, I know it may sound like "Why the F*** would I play a game like that?", but trust me, through the challenge, there is a very rewarding and memorable experience to be had. I love the souls series to death, truly special and inspiring game series, probably the most revolutionary game series in modern gaming.\n\nSeriously, I can't stress enough how much this game is amazing on all levels. Very creative and mysterious story and lore, interesting and unique interconnected world, extremely in-depth and well balanced statistical combat mechanics that are literally broken down to a science, loads of content, loads of mysterious secret items and game mechanics, loads of really cool viable weapons, loads of different kinds of armor/sets with differentiating perks, rewarding but difficult challenges, Truly unique signature online mechanics, dedicated cultish online community, like literally Dark Souls seriously--HAS IT ALL. In 20+ years of gaming, It is one of the greatest and most complete video game experiences I've ever had. It is the existing proof that the challenging old-school game influence can still thrive in modern day video games.\n\n10/10   "A truly amazing masterpiece, a once in a life time game that any true gamer should definitely experience"\n\nFun Fact: I bought this game on a Steam sale, the best $6.79 I've ever spent lol\n\nWell if you decide to give Dark Souls a try, don't cry like a B****, man up (or woman up?)\nand "Git Gud" you filthy casul!!!\n\n******** I HIGHLY recommend a controller for Dark Souls, this isn't the best of ports and has a very BAD KB+M setup but in all honesty, Dark Souls was truly meant to be played with a controller anyway, which is why i'm sure From Software didn't make KB+M a priority because they know, if you know anything about Dark Souls, you're not gonna use it, you're gonna use a controller. If you try to use KB+M with Dark Souls, You're an idiot and you're gonna get rekt lol","June 29, 2015","true","465.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","4"

Maybe /the/ best, so far. Why? I have no idea, I started playing, but I gave up, rather quickly, it was just too damn hard.  But then, I tried again and I made progress, where I failed the last time. What a satisfying feeling. And there the fever got me, I wanted to keep playing, to level up, to get the best equipment, or to just see how the next level looks like.\n\nBut on my way to the End, I cried, I danced in joy, or I was just happy I survive, with my heart racing like I've been running for miles. No game, I ever played, got me so tied up and made me want to play again, no matter how often I died.\n\nSome people say, this game has no story, well. On the first glance, there is none. But one of the strengths of Dark Souls, is also it's Story Line, it's hidden. You need to find piece of a puzzle, that you never will truly complete, it gives you hints and you have to make your own story from it. You are in a hostile world, you against everybody else, this just get's underlined by it.\n\nSeriously, who can take to die some times and is willing to play a game, where you aren't the Literal God of War, slaying everybody after a while without any problems.\nYou should give Dark Souls a try. This game is really a jewel in the RPG scene and a title, you shouldn't miss.","November 10, 2013","true","313.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

High poise heavy armor shrugs off this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n3) Since bosses will kill you frequently, you'll spend much time going from bonfires to boss fights.\n\n4) There's a hidden bonfire at the top of seth's funhouse and somewhat close to the boss bed of chaos (hidden behind an illusory wall)\n\n5) IMPORTANT: If you input a jumping slash attack (right bumper plus up) but can't start the animation immediately (you're blocking an attack) the game will eat your input and use the thrust attack (right bumper) with horrendous cooldown and start up. The game dropping that input killed and frustrated me more than anything by far.\n\n6) You will get one or a couple black knight weapons. Upgrade it with twinkling titanite and it will carry you to the end of the game.\n\nYou will be lost, you will learn how to die, and eventually you will learn how to NOT die.","January 29, 2015","true","79.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Git gud, they say. But it's not that Dark Souls is necessarily difficult, more that it has a steep learning curve. It can be intimidating for newcomers, as it was for me when I first played it. I got as far as Gaping Dragon and hit what I thought was a brick wall. So I shelved it for nearly two years.\n\nWith the release of Dark Souls 3, I thought I needed to give the original another chance. Boy, am I glad that I did. This time I had encouragement, and some determination. Again I struggled at the beginning, "f*ck this game!" being uttered on more than one occasion. But then it suddenly clicked. I don't know what it was, perhaps I genuinely started to get better at the game, perhaps I upgraded my first weapon, but I know that by the time I encountered Gaping Dragon again, I knew - this time - that I would succeed. First attempt. Fist pump! That feeling when you beat something you'd considered a massive difficulty spike, there's nothing quite like it, and Dark Souls serves them up on a regular basis. It gives you such a sense of achievement, it's like a drug.\n\nBut it's not all about combat. Dark Souls rewards exploration. Not just with trinkets, but with real, tangible benefits. Those "holy crap, I can't believe I just found this awesome thing!" kind of benefits. It's a remarkable game, the level design is inspired (ok, there are a couple of exceptions late in the game which seemed a little "tacked on"), the enemy and particularly boss design is excellent, and it grabbed me so hard I could think of little else for the few weeks I was playing it.\n\nAbsolutely grab dsfix, which improves the textures dramatically and improves the feel of the game unquestionably at 60 fps. It's easy to implement. And don't be afraid to ask people for help, it's almost a requirement, that sense of community encouragement in overcoming the challenges you face. Even now (May 2016) there's still plenty of multiplayer activity, people willing to help, messages to guide you, and the occasional invader to challenge you. It just feels right.\n\nGush, gush, gush, yes I know, but I don't care because Dark Souls really is that good... once it grabs you.\n\nWhat? Oh. Yeah, ok. I should, shouldn't I? Ok, just because it's you, Dark Souls...\n\nPraise the Sun! \[T]/","May 28","true","125.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","8"

Ok, fine, we also asked for TMNT action figures, but that's a separate review. In any case, I can still remember tearing open the packaging and pulling out the magical golden cartridge.  As all younger brothers, I took the instruction manual as my brother got to play first.  The game starts, of course, with the story of Hyrule and Zelda's abduction.

Zelda has become cutesy, easy, and the amount of hand-holding and tip-giving led me to stop playing the series altogether.  Dark Souls, on the other hand, drops you into a deeply engrossing, unforgivng world with measly weapons and no direction (sound familiar?).

With that in mind, let's get down to the dirty details :)\n\nFor starters, one thing I love about this game is that it is relatively noob-friendly (at least it was for me having never played Demon's Souls).  Its initial linearity helps new players learn the mechanics against increasingly difficult obstacles without necessarily having to worry about navigation *most* of the time.  While the enemies are by no means easy, for Dark Souls they are very primitive and therefore, make a good introduction for the kinds of attacks you will face throughout the game.  Enemies that are initially big bosses become plentiful regular enemies later on in the game, giving a massive feeling of personal growth and achievement to the player when the enemies that used to kick ♥♥♥ are getting cut down one by one.\n\nThe art direction in this game is extraordinarily well done.  By this, I mean how its sound design, visual style, and character design work with the underlying themes of the game to completely immerse the player.  Much of the world is filled with hulking structures worn down or destroyed, giving the player the sense that they are scavenging a once great civilization come to ruin.  There is almost never any music in the game, save for the boss fights and one area that is so awe-inspiring that it requires fitting music.  In many of the boss fights, the music is hectic and rushed, simulating the players' emotions when they just walked into a room with a giant behemoth eyeing your supple body for tenderizing.  Everything in this game looks and sounds like it wants to tear out your intestines with all manner of sharp or blunt object and wear them as various pieces of clothing.  Many of the NPCs in the game have very subdued voices and seem to be only sometimes be aware of your presence.  As the game title states, you will die and you will die a lot.  Caution is the word of the day and not paying to the environment later on in the game will prove very deadly indeed when many of the game's traps are introduced.\n\nThe story is told almost entirely through the environment, with some details being vaguely provided by NPCs.  As the story picks up with the player's journey beginning, the world has already fallen to ruin, with many of the once great heroes and gods of the time either dead or driven insane by the coming darkness.  Many (ignorant) people claim the game has no story whatsoever but paying attention to the environment is key to discovering the backstory and motives for many of the other characters ever coming to Lordan.  Some youtubers like VaatiVidya have very strong explanations for many of the characters in the game and they are incredible.\n\nThe combat in the game has a very weighted feel to it.  This game doesn't have a combat system like Call of Duty where everything happens at breakneck speed.  When the player swings their sword, the character has to quickly wind up for the swing.  It isn't slow by any means depending on your weapon of choice but it definitely requires deliberate action.  The combat is very much about decision making: when to block, when to counterattack, when to dodge, even when to run away to regroup.  Don't run into the game flailing around expecting to fight like Bruce Lee, it's just going to end with your death.\n\nA topic on everyone's mind when talking about this game is obviously the difficulty.  While the game is very hard, it isn't for the reasons many people state.  As hard as it may be to understand at first, YOU are what makes dark souls as hard or as easy as it is.  Your ability to observe your environments and predict the actions of your enemies will determine how successful you are in Lordran.  Overcoming difficult boss fights is a result of your very own hard work and determination to succeed.  The game never hands you a victory, it puts your prize on the opposite end of a room filled with traps and deadly foes and tells you to take what is rightfully yours.\n\nDon't go into Dark Souls thinking you will know how everything in the game works, even after playing for a while, without consulting online information.  While the game takes a hands off approach to educating the player about the mechanics of the game and how everything works, it isn't equipped to give *any* information on some things like how invasions and coop works, as well as some stats like poise.  This is my biggest problem with the game especially when it comes to new players.  There isn't any explanation for what being human does or what benefits you gain from consuming humanity without spending it.  Without consulting online information, your experience will be much more difficult especially later on when the level design becomes less intuitive.\n\nThis review is written while Games For Windows Live is still functioning and as such, I have no idea if the online will still work after the shutdown (probably not).  The game's online component is a mess, barely functioning for PvP and almost nonexistent for Cooperative play.  Thankfully, there is a brilliant mod that branches off the DSFix mod that makes coop way better than originally and that is very much appreciated especially if playing with friends.  PvP works but the amount of lag is unforgiveable in a game where losing to an invader can mean losing all your souls (currency) and a lot of progress.  98% of the time, I don't feel like anyone bested me in combat out of sheer skill, but because the latency with the servers condemned me from the start.\n\nIn short, the game is incredibly well put together and while a few things need improvement and the PC port DEFINITELY could have been made better, that doesn't make the game itself bad.  Especially with the community fixes for resolution, framerate, coop, mouse and keyboard, etc. the game is downright beautiful to play.  For sure, the game is VERY difficult, but it is by no means as hard as people make it out to be.  If you want a game that can bring you immense satisfaction as a player, you absolutely must buy this game.  One of my favorite game series of all time and I would recommend it to anyone who has the balls to overcome real challenge.  Incredibly deep and immersive, this game is a MUST BUY","May 1, 2014","true","111.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I did a lot of research into the game such as weapons, armours and so on but a lot of the discovery of the game has to come from just actually playing the game. I read that “so-so” weapon was great and “this was terrible” but learned that I loved this weapon for its ability to do this, and hated that weapon because it was too slow and so on.\n\nThe story:\nThe Story in Dark Souls is interesting, like many RPG games the lore is very deep with a strong and rich backstory to almost everything. You have to dig for all this however, searching online for the lore is the easier way to go about doing that so that’s what I did. The main story in the game however starts with you, whatever you are, man or woman and you can choose a class of a Mage all the way to the Knight, or a poor naked scrub. These affect how your character starts and how to can effect the work around you. You start in a cell, and are allowed free by grabbing a key from a hallow. After escaping you are thrown into the jaws of Dead Souls pretty violently though if you have any experience with games like this before you should easily grasp the ropes of the game. The rest of the Story is mainly about you completing quests and overall to beat the main boss. That’s all i will really say on this however.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is a classic RPG structure with Dark Souls combat system that is designed to be tricky but with trickery, come mastery, and once you master the combat in Dark Souls nothing can stand in your way.\nMany times you will encounter enemies, countless huge bosses and even real players who invade your lands and try to take your souls, however if you beat them, you can take their souls so the game has some gamble in it. Please be aware however the game has a scaling system that in my own opinion doesn’t really work. Sometimes I was thrown against high-levels who I was skilfully better than, however due to armour and weapons were no match for. Then I was thrown against enemies that didn’t know how to block and were cut down faster than wood so the imbalance was annoying however extremely exhilarating. When a player joined my game to duel I got a very high rush of adrenalin, will he be good, will he be bad and fights were often extremely intense and amazing. I’m not a very big PvP person but this game has the perfect combat system for such a PvP system.\n\nMy only issue with the game it’s self is guiding. The game is open world however that’s all you are told, you must pay attention in all cut scenes to know what to do and even then sometimes it’s a guess so yeah, I don’t like handholding, but this game is a bit like those mothers who leave there children and supermarkets and drive all the way home, make dinner and then realise, however by this time the child’s already been beaten to death & ♥♥♥♥♥ several times and found his way back home already. But welcome to Dark Souls is the common reply hahaha.\n\nGraphics:\nThis is when I can start getting picky with the game. The graphics are nice however the game is locked at 30fps and I believe is still locked at the rendering limit and is upscale. Please note however you can download a mod that fixes both issues. For the experience I chose against that but I’m going to download them now and play the game again at 60fps and non-up scaled res.\n\nThe art style of the game is very well done. The game is very dark however (again you can download a mod to fix that) one of the greatest things about the game is the Physics system however, a lot of destructible environmental objects is always fun for some known reason and sometimes event he buggy corpse ragdolls when you run past them and they get stuck to your foot and fly in the air as you run always brings a smile to my face.\n\nSo overall, I loved Dark Souls. The game is not the hard-case I’ve been told but the game has its challenges (Just saying. ♥♥♥♥ the Crystal section, invisible platforms can die in hell. They are cheap deaths and I find them to be a very lazy developer’s way of adding difficulty to the game.) Apart from the 30fps lack, 1024xsomething up scaled res and that specific level I have literally nothing to bad to say about this game I absolutely love it so much I actually played the game for 12 hours straight.\n\nI will give the game a strong 9/10 - It lost that extra 1 for been a poor port. Mainly in the eyes of 30fps, it may not bother some, and in this game it's not a ballache to watch however more is always better. Oh and it looses points for Cheap deathts, even in very hard games, its lazy and unwanted. *puts up middle finger*\n\nPro’s:\n-	Great combat system once you get it down\n-	Strong lore, great RPG roots\n-	Great weapons and armours along with designs of them are incredible\n-	Great built in physics system and large amount of bosses and enemies\n-	Good PvP system, still needs some tweaking however.\n\nCon’s:\n-	30fps Lock and up scaled res\n-	Cheap deaths\n-	Reused bosses (only some, I don’t mean mini-bosses either)\n-	The game is sometimes very confusing.\n","April 22, 2014","true","35.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mauno/recommended/211420/","Mauno","Mauno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mauno/","529 products in account","Atrocious port, one of the best games ever made. 'Prepare to Die' is pretty accurate: the first half of the game is brutal.\n\nGameplay\n\nPretty much requires an Xbox360 controller. Mouse & keyboard controls are incredibly bad, and feel terrible even with a mouse fix mod.\nDkS has the best melee combat outside Mount&Blade. Every swing has weight, every hit counts. Attacks are always telegraphed well in advance: everything can be dodged with proper timing. This works both ways, and it might take some time to get used to the player's attacks not being instant, but requiring a similar wind-up that the AI has.\n\nExcellent weapon variety, with nearly every weapon having at the very least some minor unique quirk, and most weapons having full, unique movesets. The player's equipment choices are mostly personal preference: the weapons feel different and they're all perfectly viable when upgraded. Armour variety is also great, but what you wear doesn't make a huge difference. Resistances from armour are good, but dodging and blocking are far better tactics than eating hits.\n\nThe magic system is a bit intimidating at first. Highly limited amount of casts, and very long casting times. Three different schools of "magic", all of which feel powerful and interesting. Playing a sorcerer does make the game significantly easier, especially later on when items that increase magic damage are easily available.\n\nThe player character levels up by spending souls ( currency, essentially ) to level up individual stats ( strength, dexterity, etc. ). A single character can, in theory, be a master of everything. Leveling up gets more expensive every time, so most of the time it's more advantageous to plan a build in advance and stick to it. At character creation, the classes only really determine the starting equipment: the classes don't lock a character into a single path.\n\nIncredible freedom in the character development system; encourages replayability by having a massive amount of perfectly viable builds to come up with.\n\nEnemy design is, overall, excellent. They range from undead knights to giant mushrooms and clams. They all have unique movesets, and despite the AI being very basic (run at player, try to kill), the combat feels fresh when you move through the levels and encounter new enemies.\n\nThe levels are (for the most part) designed masterfully. A maze, with shortcuts available everywhere. The world feels real: all the areas are connected perfectly, and highly encourage exploration. Huge variety in the design of the levels: Duke's Archive is a huge library, Tomb of the Giants, a pitch black cave full of skeletons. Some areas, like Lost Izalith, were clearly rushed and lack the complex geometry and intelligent enemy placement of levels such as Undead Burg.\n\nStory\n\nHighly unconventional storytelling in this one. Most of it is delivered through item descriptions accessed in the inventory. If you never read them, all you'll really know is that there's a prophecy, and you killed a bunch of dudes. The story hidden in the descriptions, environment and NPC "quests" is absolutely brilliant, however.\n\nHaving to dig for it makes figuring things out so much more rewarding than being told everything in cutscenes. There are 'holes' in the story, and those are filled by the player, and his actions. Everything in the game exists for a reason:  nothing is randomly just 'there'.\n\nI found the main storyline and the NPC stories extremely interesting, but it definitely takes some effort to be able to really enjoy.\n\nGraphics & Audio\n\nThe graphics are terrible. Looks like a console game, because this is literally a 1:1 port from the xbox360. Locked to 30fps, 720p, relatively with low res textures. All of these can be fixed on PC, though: I run the game at a 4k resolution, 60fps and with fan-made HD textures. DSFix by Durante has a bunch of variables that vastly improve the way the game looks. Well worth installing.\n\nWeapons and armour  look pretty good, but that's mostly due to their brilliant design, not graphical fidelity. The environments range from beautiful (Painted World, Ash Lake) to hideous (Lost Izalith).\n\nSound design is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Very little music: only plays at a central hub area and boss fights. The rest of the time, all you'll hear is footsteps, monsters and other environmental sounds. The lack of music gives the rare times it does play so much more impact. Hearing the Firelink music after a raid on the Catacombs is very comforting, and hearing boss music gets the adrenaline pumping as you face Smough & Ornstein.\n\nIn conclusion,  Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made. It is a terrible PC version, but most of the issues can be fixed, and the result is an experience no gamer should miss.","December 23, 2014","true","214.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It's not easy, actually it is one of the (if not THE) most difficult games I played. Every step of your path must be chosen wisely, you can't undo a mistake in most situations, so beware of your decisions. Every single battle is a challange and will put your patience, skill and timing to the test. Even situations in which you already excel normally might be the end of you if you're not carefull or rush too much. There are some minor setbacks, like the fact that the controls' explanations are not adapted to the computer version. Nevertheless, the game is awesome. Unlike other games, the storyline won't be given to you, except for the introduction, so be ready to find out what's happening on your own.

Let’s get straight to business: DS – PTDE is a 3rd Person Fantasy Action-RPG, directly ported from the Xbox360 and PS3 version. The setting is a standard high-fantasy medieval world with lots of undeads, demons, lizardmen, dragons, knights in black or shiny armors of all sorts, but the lore and plot is rarely mentioned at all throughout the playthrough, as you mostly play alone (or with friends/other players in online co-op) with very rare encounters with sentient NPCs which can offer a little bit of insight on your mission and objectives. Game progression is almost non-linear: after having beaten the first obligatory “tutorial dungeon” you character reaches the first (and only) main quest hub and is given the generic mission to “fulfil the prophecy and ring the two Bells of Awakening”, with absolutely no clue on how to proceed: it is the player’s duty to start exploring the world and find a way to progress and clear a path, and this is where the real fun begins.\n\nEven if you have been living under a rock for the past 2 years and have read no other review of DS – PTDE, you will understand one basic concept during the first 10 minutes of gameplay: as the name itself implies this game is INSANELY HARD. The developers have intentionally designed it to challenge the player at every turn, with absolutely no mercy even for beginner’s mistakes (even in the tutorial dungeon you will die A LOT during your first playthrough). Some examples, just to give an idea:\n\n-          No save-load mechanic is implemented: the game autosaves your position and progress basically after every action you perform, causing every gameplay choice to become instantly PERMANENT. Did you just killed a NPC with a fireball by accident due to him being too close to a menacing skeleton? That NPC will be permanently DEAD, even if this means losing access to his wares (in case he was a merchant) or to a side quest. You will have to find another way around the locked door or find someone else to sell you those precious arrows you were looking for… The good news is that the developers have literally thought of everything, so an “unwinnable” scenario is virtually impossible to achieve (without cheats), even if you mindlessly slaughter every living and undead being in sight (including merchants and questgivers)\n\n-          Even if your character is cursed with the undeath and technically cannot die, every single hostile monster or NPC can single handedly ♥♥♥♥ you and send you back to the spawn point with little effort. Even the least menacing zombie, armed only with a broken sword, can AND WILL kill you a dozen time if you do not remember to dodge his attacks or keep your shield up the whole time. Underestimating any encounter, even when overgeared, will lead to the usual YOU DIED screen in few seconds\n\n-          If you are so lucky and brave to reach one of the various checkpoints placed at various strategic locations, and use it to rest and replenish your forces before proceeding EVERY SINGLE MONSTER YOU HAVE KILLED UP TO THAT MOMENT WILL RESPAWN (with the exception of bosses and minibosses), leaving you stranded in the middle of a dungeon with no way to get out without fighting your way back to the beginning. There is no turning back in DS – PTDE, sorry\n\n-          Is it also worth mentioning that being killed will result in the same effect: respawn at the checkpoint and a horde of fresh monsters to fight all around you. Oh, did I mention that spawn points are usually very far from bosses, punishing the player even more for deaths during boss fights?\n\nAlthough the above points could be interpreted as lazy or poor design, the reality is that DS – PTDE is one of the best balanced games I’ve played in many years of PC gaming: every encounter and situation can be easily won by using the correct strategy and taking advantage of the weakness of the enemy; if you are rushing through an area while swinging your sword or throwing fireballs without any care for the surrounding environment you will soon be overwhelmed and the familiar YOU DIED screen will be shown. A tactical approach, with perfect knowledge of the surroundings (to avoid the frequent ambushes) and the correct gear combination will increase your survival chances immensely, and some boss fights will even become trivial with the correct strategy.\n\nOf course this implies a trial-and-error process, but there is a reason why this game is called “Prepare to Die Edition”.\n\nUnfortunately this game has also blatant flaws, and the most important lies in the graphic engine: being a direct console port (made by a SW house which was specialized only in console titles with no PC experience) you can forget about HD resolution, smooth framerates and all the eye-candies of a typical PC AAA title. But it is even worse: the PC version of DS – PTDE is locked to 720p resolution and 30fps, IN 2014! You know that 3500€ gaming rig that you just bought and that runs BF4 at ultra in Surround on 3 27” monitors? It is completely wasted since you will experience the same resolution and detail of a 2005 console anyway.\n\nAnd what about mouse and keyboard controls? Forget about them, as all the menus and in game text refer to Xbox360 control layout and using a M+K combo will be a frustrating experience (Steam even has a warning on the store page claiming that a 360 controller is strongly recommended for this game).\n\nLuckily for you, my friends, the modding community has solved this issue since a long time with two brilliant an small pieces of software: DSFix and DSMfix (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix and http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864979455329386779/). After a very simple setup process you will be able to enjoy the game on your PC as it should have been since release, with full HD graphics, 60+ constant fps (with the possibility of downsampling to push the detail even further, if your rig can take it), SSAO, MSAA, FXAA, smooth mouse controls and customizable keybindings. Last but not least, there is also a co-op fix called DSCfix which improves the experience of online co-op play over the standard GFWL junk (http://sdrv.ms/128mNwY).\n\n\nTL;DR version:\n\nPROs\n\n-          Very challenging gameplay, but never too difficult to become unbeatable. If you die too much, it is generally your fault\n-          Longevity (50+ hours of gameplay for a single playthrough, with the possibility of New Game+ with increased difficulty!)\n-          Endless combinations of character growth and gear allows for very different approaches, all equally rewarding, to the game\n-          A sequel is in the works!\n\nCONs\n\n-          Direct Xbox360 port: use of unofficial mods is mandatory to make the game playable\n-          Awkward game controls with M+K (also fixed by a mod)\n-          Absurdly steep learning curve\n-          Some gameplay mechanics are obscure unless google is used (e.g. crafting)\n-          Even with mods the graphic engine does not take advantage of all the possible features of a modern gaming PC","January 24, 2014","true","137.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is both bleak and beautiful, and is one of the most impressive games made in recent years.\n\nThematically, Dark Souls is about death and perseverance in an unforgiving world. This is echoed in the gameplay by a near-complete lack of guidance; for example, techniques critical for success go completely unexplained, like how to kindle bonfires (and what that even means). Thus, community involvement such as reading guides or walkthroughs is a must. The online elements within the game are also helpful, but the game is just as much fun to play offline.\n\nIf the inaccessibile presentation wasn't bad enough, it turns out that Dark Souls really is too hard. I'd probably enjoy playing it more often if it weren't so repetitive (dying and repeating the same segment over and over again). Frankly, I have the most fun late in the game, when I've powered up enough to explore new territory and take on bosses with relatively few deaths – you know, like a normal game.\n\nOn the whole, I still can't deny how absorbing and satisfying the whole experience is. There are so many fascinating details hidden away that are exciting to uncover. I love the powerful images, tense moments, and sense of accomplishment that comes when my perseverance pays off. Dark Souls is not for everyone – not by a long shot – but for those who can get past its steep learning curve and cruel difficulty, it can be a wholly unique and inspiring experience.\n\n(Rating: 9/10 “Great”)\n\nNotes: I played this PC version with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. It is nearly identical to the PS3 version of the game I played before, and comes packaged with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.","December 8, 2014","true","96.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

'Prepare to Die' is pretty accurate: the first half of the game is brutal.\n\nGameplay\n\nPretty much requires an Xbox360 controller. Mouse & keyboard controls are incredibly bad, and feel terrible even with a mouse fix mod.\nDkS has the best melee combat outside Mount&Blade. Every swing has weight, every hit counts. Attacks are always telegraphed well in advance: everything can be dodged with proper timing. This works both ways, and it might take some time to get used to the player's attacks not being instant, but requiring a similar wind-up that the AI has.\n\nExcellent weapon variety, with nearly every weapon having at the very least some minor unique quirk, and most weapons having full, unique movesets. The player's equipment choices are mostly personal preference: the weapons feel different and they're all perfectly viable when upgraded. Armour variety is also great, but what you wear doesn't make a huge difference. Resistances from armour are good, but dodging and blocking are far better tactics than eating hits.\n\nThe magic system is a bit intimidating at first. Highly limited amount of casts, and very long casting times. Three different schools of "magic", all of which feel powerful and interesting. Playing a sorcerer does make the game significantly easier, especially later on when items that increase magic damage are easily available.\n\nThe player character levels up by spending souls ( currency, essentially ) to level up individual stats ( strength, dexterity, etc. ). A single character can, in theory, be a master of everything. Leveling up gets more expensive every time, so most of the time it's more advantageous to plan a build in advance and stick to it. At character creation, the classes only really determine the starting equipment: the classes don't lock a character into a single path.\n\nIncredible freedom in the character development system; encourages replayability by having a massive amount of perfectly viable builds to come up with.\n\nEnemy design is, overall, excellent. They range from undead knights to giant mushrooms and clams. They all have unique movesets, and despite the AI being very basic (run at player, try to kill), the combat feels fresh when you move through the levels and encounter new enemies.\n\nThe levels are (for the most part) designed masterfully. A maze, with shortcuts available everywhere. The world feels real: all the areas are connected perfectly, and highly encourage exploration. Huge variety in the design of the levels: Duke's Archive is a huge library, Tomb of the Giants, a pitch black cave full of skeletons. Some areas, like Lost Izalith, were clearly rushed and lack the complex geometry and intelligent enemy placement of levels such as Undead Burg.\n\nStory\n\nHighly unconventional storytelling in this one. Most of it is delivered through item descriptions accessed in the inventory. If you never read them, all you'll really know is that there's a prophecy, and you killed a bunch of dudes. The story hidden in the descriptions, environment and NPC "quests" is absolutely brilliant, however.\n\nHaving to dig for it makes figuring things out so much more rewarding than being told everything in cutscenes. There are 'holes' in the story, and those are filled by the player, and his actions. Everything in the game exists for a reason:  nothing is randomly just 'there'.\n\nI found the main storyline and the NPC stories extremely interesting, but it definitely takes some effort to be able to really enjoy.\n\nGraphics & Audio\n\nThe graphics are terrible. Looks like a console game, because this is literally a 1:1 port from the xbox360. Locked to 30fps, 720p, relatively with low res textures. All of these can be fixed on PC, though: I run the game at a 4k resolution, 60fps and with fan-made HD textures. DSFix by Durante has a bunch of variables that vastly improve the way the game looks. Well worth installing.\n\nWeapons and armour  look pretty good, but that's mostly due to their brilliant design, not graphical fidelity. The environments range from beautiful (Painted World, Ash Lake) to hideous (Lost Izalith).\n\nSound design is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Very little music: only plays at a central hub area and boss fights. The rest of the time, all you'll hear is footsteps, monsters and other environmental sounds. The lack of music gives the rare times it does play so much more impact. Hearing the Firelink music after a raid on the Catacombs is very comforting, and hearing boss music gets the adrenaline pumping as you face Smough & Ornstein.\n\nIn conclusion,  Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made. It is a terrible PC version, but most of the issues can be fixed, and the result is an experience no gamer should miss.","December 23, 2014","true","214.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

played Dark Souls on the PS3 back in 2011 at launch, coming from Demon's Souls after about 100 hours or so, I was quite excited and avoided a lot of pre-release material, and all I could say was wow, and I still feel that way, if I were to add up the amount of time I've spent playing Dark Souls on PS3 and PC, I would estimate that I've put 1,000+ hours into the game, I also obtained the Platinum Trophy on PS3 for the game.\n\nNowadays, it seems a lot of developers are getting more scared to take risks, particularly the bigger guys making AAA titles, this is understandable as these companies will either stick to a winning formula, or follow the trend of what people are buying and liking, From Software on the other hand, has strived to make games that they find fun, rewarding, complex, varied and memorable, in this regard, Dark Souls 1 is a gem, and one of my all time favourite games.\n\nThere is absolutely a learning curve if you've never played the game(s) before, but once you get past this, you'll be surprised at really just how easy it is, knowledge is power when it comes to the Souls games, and as you obtain knowledge about the world, the weapons, the crafting system, the magic, general equipment, enemies, bosses and environments, you will be asking yourself "why is this game considered so hard again?", just as I ask myself at this point when I play through it.\n\nThere is fantastic level of variety in all aspects of the game, when it comes to the enemies and bosses you encounter, the weapons you can use, the different armour sets, the spells and miracles you can obtain, the locations and environments you come across and travel to, it all adds up to make you want to push on and master the game, and once you do obtain that level of skill, you'll understand why this game has such a hardcore, passionate fanbase, and one of the most dedicated in gaming as a whole.\n\nIn terms of character variety, Dark Souls has a system we calls "builds", basically there's different starting classes to choose from, each of which starts off with different stats and equipment, frankly, this only matters for the beginning of the game, typically I will personally start off with a Knight, and then level my stats in other areas to make a highly proficient Spellsword character, I have made other builds as well, but stat investment is VERY important, weapons in the game also have what is called "scaling", and as well as leveling up weapons with the brilliant crafting system, this scaling aspect will affect the damage you can do with a particular weapons based on your stats, so for example, a "Dexterity" or "Dex" weapon, like a Scimitar, will have a high "Scaling rank" (Like "A") when it comes to the Dexterity stat, meaning that the more you level Dexterity, the more damage you will do with that Scimitar, scaling ranges from S (the best) all the way to E (the worst).\n\nAs far as the story goes, mainstream reviewers criticized this part of the game for being non-existent, and this is not the case, the basis of the story is explained in the opening cutscene, but the story and lore in general present themselves in a more mysterious way than most games out there do, they present themselves through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and through emotion and general feeling, by simply paying attention to what is going on while playing the game, it's a superb way of telling a story and uncovering the rich lore of the game, you'll find yourself making connections from one item description to another, and coming up with your own theories for what may have happened, if you look at VaatiVidya or Epicnamebro on YouTube, you'll see that the story and lore are extremely deep and interesting, and we all certainly had a lot of fun putting the pieces together back in 2011 and beyond, even today, we continue to come up with new theories and we continue to discover new things about the game, which is incredible.\n\nThe Multiplayer of the game is incredible and super unique, it hosts a realtime MP system which can be accessed without the need to go to another menu, the MP relies on the use of in-game items including a "White Sign Soapstone" (in order to place your personal "sign" down and be summoned to help another player in their own world), and a "Red Eye Orb" which will allow you to invade and attempt to kill another player in their world, there are other items in the game that allow for MP interaction, and co-op of up to 3 players can take place, the MP system can make for some extremely fun scenarios and some epic and fun battles.\n\nThe general sound in the game is amazing and perfectly fitting, everything sounds just as it should, the music that plays during boss battles is incredible, emotional and very varied, I have nothing to complaint about in regards to the soundtrack, it is amazing.\n\nAs far as the PC version goes, it was disappointing at launch in a lot of regards, for technical reasons mind you, it lacked a lot of the basic features a PC version of a game should have, such as high resolution and framerate support, however, a brilliant modder named Durante has since implemented a modification called "DSfix" which allows the game to run at higher resolutions and 60fps (albeit with a few issues when it comes to the higher fps), and also support for texture mods, some of which I use, anyone has access to this tool and it's simple to download and install.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Dark Souls enough, if you are a fan of Fantasy Action RPG's with a dark tone, mysterious story, incredible enemy, boss, level design, beautiful visuals, amazing art design and style and insane variety in weapons, armours and just about everything else, you owe it to yourself to play this game, continue to get better at it and master it, and just have a whole load of fun while doing so, experiencing a new world that doesn't herald YOU as its omnipotent master from the get go, but forces you to earn that spot, should you want it.\n\nIf you are quite intimidated and would like a pretty understandable rundown and tips regarding the game, I suggest looking at Rurikhan's video "Dark Souls for Dummies, 10 Tips" on YouTube, which you can find right here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvFZDb6WIDo\n\nI myself have also done a full YouTube Playthrough of Dark Souls on PC fairly recently, with some of the mods mentioned above for a higher framerate and resolution, if you are interested, you can check that out here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xCfNNHoMY\n\nThanks

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainTinker/recommended/211420/","CaptainTinker","Calypso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainTinker/","245 products in account","--DISCLAIMER--\nfirst of all, in my review the thumb doesn't matter. I could also pick a thumbs down rating, Only the text review represents my oppinion about this game, nothing else.\nThe other thing is: I'm not someone who purely says that the game isn't possible. I'm just pointing out, what was enjoyable for me in an objective way. If you don't agree with my critics to this game, then it's fine by me. I'm not telling you what to enjoy and what not and if you actualy enjoy the things I don't enjoy, then have it your way. But then I ask you to respect my oppinion aswell as I respect yours.\n--DISCLAIMER END--\n\nDark Souls is an interesting experience indeed. It always keeps you on your toes but it also gives you a break if needed.\nIt is a challenging game without being unfair to the player, at least overall to a certain point. It is an action RPG game to my liking but, unfortunatly, it has also alot of downsides.\n\nFirst of all, and I'm sure everyone agrees with me is, that this is a very poor port of a game. It is a shame that there was no effort put into porting this game or even optimizing it in general, since a constant and high framerate in this kind of game is the most important aspect (timing in general). Now luckily, I have an Xbox controller for my PC and I highly recommend a controller in general for this game, since the controls on the keyboard are messed up. Now there are mods out there which help making this game playable, but I am talking about a product the developers delivered to us, not the fix that the community came up with without the developers giving a crap about there game and doing it themselves.\n\nNow the most thing I enjoyed in this game was the first playthrough. I created 2 characters and managed to play through the game with both of them with 2 different playstyles. The first character was a more tanky character with a greatsword. My 2nd character was a high lightweigth build for pure dodge and counter with a katana. The game provided me with a decent challange and, although the game has it's frustrating moments, it never made me quit the playthrough.\nNG+ (New Game +) on the otherhand is something I don't recommend to anyone searching for an enjoyable playthrough, simply because the difficulty scaling is to dull. Giving them more Healh and higher damageoutput doesn't mean difficulty, it just tests your patience with the game. I'd rather have smarter enemies with different attackpatterns instead of just heavylie based "trial and error" enemies. This counts especialy for dodge builds. In most cases, if you happen to stagger from an attack, you will die because you'll get stunlocked untill you die. While this alone is not a problem, some enemies will be more of an annoyence because of their high hitbox detection (4 Kings for example) where it doesn't matter if you dodge their swing or not you'll get hit anyway.\n\nAnother positive thing about this game is that it doesn't hold you on your hand, like most games do nowadays. The game doesn't point out, where you should go now or what you should do. You have to figure that out yourself. Now the game does have a somewhat linear pattern you have to follow, but that's only at the beginning of the game and to a certain point. If you are 1/3 through the game, the whole game is open for you to explore. You can get the idea of what to do in order to progress by talking to certain NPCs, but you have to actually listen to what they say and you still have to think for yourself where you should go to do your task. The game my have cutscenes, but all of them are skipable and are not regular at all (mostly an introduction to a certain boss or if you did something significant for the story).\n\nThe combat system is great overall. It is easy to learn, but hard to master. Dark Souls doesn't make you rely on the abilities of the characters (like certain MMO's or even RPGs where you just have to spam their individuel abilities and wait for their cooldown) all actions depend on the player himself and you'll get more then enough variety to that. You can for instance do a light attack, a heavy attack, a guard break kick, a jumping heavy attack, parry, block, backstab, dive attack. Most weapons also have their own move sets, giving you a large variety to pick from for you to use to your liking.\nBut the obvious thing is that the combat system is almost purely made for 1v1 encounters. That means, if you have to deal with alot of enemies at once without having a weapon which can hit multiple targets, then you'll notice the downsides of the combat system or rather to certain enemy/ boss encounters (Ornstein and Smough are only considered to be one of the hardest bosses purely because, if you don't have any help, then you'll have to deal with 2 heavy hitting bosses at once. if you atleast get help from Solair, an NPC character, then the boss is manageable without big problems)\nThe good thing is, that these kind of encounters are not that often and you are most likely able to lure them out 1 by 1.\nBut areas like New Londo with ghosts, atleast on new game+, they will be a hard time if you are not able to 1hit them because they will swarm you and they have a decent range with their attack and the fact, that they can attack you through the wall makes it unnececary hard and you'll most likely be forced just to sprint your way through this area.\n\nThe bosses are both the things you will enjoy the most but they will also be the most frustrating thing in the game. The statisfaction after killing a boss is very pleasing and you will feel rewarded for that aswell combined with the combat system. Most bosses are also unique in their own way, although that doesn't always mean that it's something positive. Some bosses are very easy and don't provide a challenge at all while other bosses have a huge difficulty spike and require certain strategies to work with. And some bosses are just downright tedious. The best example for that is Gwindolin. It may be an optional boss, but if you seek to play all of the game's content, then you'll be forced to one of the most tedious bosses of the game. I'm not saying that the boss is hard the boss is in fact one of the easiest bosses the game has to offer. This boss fight in particular just stretches in it's lenght in a very artificial way (you will always have to run up to the boss while avoiding it's projectile attacks and if you are in close range, you'll be able to land 1-3 strikes before the boss teleports away where you just repeat the process). I think the most enjoyable boss fight for me was Sif, the Wolf. It wasn't to difficult for me even on NG+ and it wasn't to hard either. Overall, I say that bosses are one of the best things the game can possibly offer. It is in fact one of the only reasons to why you should play the game, atleast when you are not into pvp, that's a different story.\n\nWhile I like the idea of being connected to different "nodes" and being able to see different phantoms of players who play the game aswell, this system stands in it's own way if you consider to play this game in coop. The problem is just that if you try to play with a friend, you have to hope for you and your friend being connected to the same node. If you are not, you cannot play together. Now for that there also exists a mod to help you out with and certain configurations but, that's not an excuse for such a design for online playing. I'd rather have a traditional, more working way to play the game online rather then what it has to offer now. For me, it's not a big downside for the game but for those considering buying this game to play coop, be prepared to either do alot of things to be able to play effectivly or be prepared to be patient.\n\nOVERALL: I recommend this game to those who want an action RPG with a decent and overall enjoyable experience and for those, who dare to play the game's NG+ mode for extra frustration.","January 8","true","112.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

They all have unique movesets, and despite the AI being very basic (run at player, try to kill), the combat feels fresh when you move through the levels and encounter new enemies.\n\nThe levels are (for the most part) designed masterfully. A maze, with shortcuts available everywhere. The world feels real: all the areas are connected perfectly, and highly encourage exploration. Huge variety in the design of the levels: Duke's Archive is a huge library, Tomb of the Giants, a pitch black cave full of skeletons. Some areas, like Lost Izalith, were clearly rushed and lack the complex geometry and intelligent enemy placement of levels such as Undead Burg.\n\nStory\n\nHighly unconventional storytelling in this one. Most of it is delivered through item descriptions accessed in the inventory. If you never read them, all you'll really know is that there's a prophecy, and you killed a bunch of dudes. The story hidden in the descriptions, environment and NPC "quests" is absolutely brilliant, however.\n\nHaving to dig for it makes figuring things out so much more rewarding than being told everything in cutscenes. There are 'holes' in the story, and those are filled by the player, and his actions. Everything in the game exists for a reason:  nothing is randomly just 'there'.\n\nI found the main storyline and the NPC stories extremely interesting, but it definitely takes some effort to be able to really enjoy.\n\nGraphics & Audio\n\nThe graphics are terrible. Looks like a console game, because this is literally a 1:1 port from the xbox360. Locked to 30fps, 720p, relatively with low res textures. All of these can be fixed on PC, though: I run the game at a 4k resolution, 60fps and with fan-made HD textures. DSFix by Durante has a bunch of variables that vastly improve the way the game looks. Well worth installing.\n\nWeapons and armour  look pretty good, but that's mostly due to their brilliant design, not graphical fidelity. The environments range from beautiful (Painted World, Ash Lake) to hideous (Lost Izalith).\n\nSound design is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. Very little music: only plays at a central hub area and boss fights. The rest of the time, all you'll hear is footsteps, monsters and other environmental sounds. The lack of music gives the rare times it does play so much more impact. Hearing the Firelink music after a raid on the Catacombs is very comforting, and hearing boss music gets the adrenaline pumping as you face Smough & Ornstein.\n\nIn conclusion,  Dark Souls is one of the greatest games ever made. It is a terrible PC version, but most of the issues can be fixed, and the result is an experience no gamer should miss.","December 23, 2014","true","214.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

But you must be warned about the many bugs of the PC port. If you are aware yet and still wanna play it (tough guy, arent you?), just remember to install the patches (if really needed) to improve your gameplay. I dont want you to rage (more than you need) in this game. The armors and enemies are awesome. My favorite character is Artorias (hipsters calling it mainstream in 3... 2...). The story is awesome and you have a awesome role in the game. You can change your fate and do whatever you want as you get more experienced in battle. Remember: Even if you turn into the best warrior in the world, you'll need to die someday (Irl too but it doesnt matter right now, right?)...

Yes you will Die you will Die a lot but the rewarding feeling when you kill the Boss after numerous atempts is something you don´t get alot of todays Games.

I would recommend VaatiVidya´s Lore Videos on YouTube for anyone Interested.\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics are a little dated.\n- The qualtity of PvP highly depends on both Players Internet Connection.\n\n\nWarning: The Port from From Software is really bad. I played it with the DSfix mod wich bumps up the Framerate up to 60fps and adds useful Keybindings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005234391/recommended/211420/","76561198005234391","Loki","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005234391/","158 products in account","I originally played Dark Souls on the PS3 back in 2011 at launch, coming from Demon's Souls after about 100 hours or so, I was quite excited and avoided a lot of pre-release material, and all I could say was wow, and I still feel that way, if I were to add up the amount of time I've spent playing Dark Souls on PS3 and PC, I would estimate that I've put 1,000+ hours into the game, I also obtained the Platinum Trophy on PS3 for the game.\n\nNowadays, it seems a lot of developers are getting more scared to take risks, particularly the bigger guys making AAA titles, this is understandable as these companies will either stick to a winning formula, or follow the trend of what people are buying and liking, From Software on the other hand, has strived to make games that they find fun, rewarding, complex, varied and memorable, in this regard, Dark Souls 1 is a gem, and one of my all time favourite games.\n\nThere is absolutely a learning curve if you've never played the game(s) before, but once you get past this, you'll be surprised at really just how easy it is, knowledge is power when it comes to the Souls games, and as you obtain knowledge about the world, the weapons, the crafting system, the magic, general equipment, enemies, bosses and environments, you will be asking yourself "why is this game considered so hard again?", just as I ask myself at this point when I play through it.\n\nThere is fantastic level of variety in all aspects of the game, when it comes to the enemies and bosses you encounter, the weapons you can use, the different armour sets, the spells and miracles you can obtain, the locations and environments you come across and travel to, it all adds up to make you want to push on and master the game, and once you do obtain that level of skill, you'll understand why this game has such a hardcore, passionate fanbase, and one of the most dedicated in gaming as a whole.\n\nIn terms of character variety, Dark Souls has a system we calls "builds", basically there's different starting classes to choose from, each of which starts off with different stats and equipment, frankly, this only matters for the beginning of the game, typically I will personally start off with a Knight, and then level my stats in other areas to make a highly proficient Spellsword character, I have made other builds as well, but stat investment is VERY important, weapons in the game also have what is called "scaling", and as well as leveling up weapons with the brilliant crafting system, this scaling aspect will affect the damage you can do with a particular weapons based on your stats, so for example, a "Dexterity" or "Dex" weapon, like a Scimitar, will have a high "Scaling rank" (Like "A") when it comes to the Dexterity stat, meaning that the more you level Dexterity, the more damage you will do with that Scimitar, scaling ranges from S (the best) all the way to E (the worst).\n\nAs far as the story goes, mainstream reviewers criticized this part of the game for being non-existent, and this is not the case, the basis of the story is explained in the opening cutscene, but the story and lore in general present themselves in a more mysterious way than most games out there do, they present themselves through item descriptions, NPC dialogues, and through emotion and general feeling, by simply paying attention to what is going on while playing the game, it's a superb way of telling a story and uncovering the rich lore of the game, you'll find yourself making connections from one item description to another, and coming up with your own theories for what may have happened, if you look at VaatiVidya or Epicnamebro on YouTube, you'll see that the story and lore are extremely deep and interesting, and we all certainly had a lot of fun putting the pieces together back in 2011 and beyond, even today, we continue to come up with new theories and we continue to discover new things about the game, which is incredible.\n\nThe Multiplayer of the game is incredible and super unique, it hosts a realtime MP system which can be accessed without the need to go to another menu, the MP relies on the use of in-game items including a "White Sign Soapstone" (in order to place your personal "sign" down and be summoned to help another player in their own world), and a "Red Eye Orb" which will allow you to invade and attempt to kill another player in their world, there are other items in the game that allow for MP interaction, and co-op of up to 3 players can take place, the MP system can make for some extremely fun scenarios and some epic and fun battles.\n\nThe general sound in the game is amazing and perfectly fitting, everything sounds just as it should, the music that plays during boss battles is incredible, emotional and very varied, I have nothing to complaint about in regards to the soundtrack, it is amazing.\n\nAs far as the PC version goes, it was disappointing at launch in a lot of regards, for technical reasons mind you, it lacked a lot of the basic features a PC version of a game should have, such as high resolution and framerate support, however, a brilliant modder named Durante has since implemented a modification called "DSfix" which allows the game to run at higher resolutions and 60fps (albeit with a few issues when it comes to the higher fps), and also support for texture mods, some of which I use, anyone has access to this tool and it's simple to download and install.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Dark Souls enough, if you are a fan of Fantasy Action RPG's with a dark tone, mysterious story, incredible enemy, boss, level design, beautiful visuals, amazing art design and style and insane variety in weapons, armours and just about everything else, you owe it to yourself to play this game, continue to get better at it and master it, and just have a whole load of fun while doing so, experiencing a new world that doesn't herald YOU as its omnipotent master from the get go, but forces you to earn that spot, should you want it.\n\nIf you are quite intimidated and would like a pretty understandable rundown and tips regarding the game, I suggest looking at Rurikhan's video "Dark Souls for Dummies, 10 Tips" on YouTube, which you can find right here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvFZDb6WIDo\n\nI myself have also done a full YouTube Playthrough of Dark Souls on PC fairly recently, with some of the mods mentioned above for a higher framerate and resolution, if you are interested, you can check that out here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xCfNNHoMY\n\nThanks

The hardest game ever to hear some people talk, but in all honesty, the game's difficulty is vastly overstated. Yes, it can be brutal, and yes it's going to drop you into a big mean world full of intimidating uglies that want nothing more than to paint the walls with your warm red fluids, but NOTHING in Dark Souls is insurmountable. It's a game that merely plays on some of your worst habits as a player of games and will punish those who think they can rush things their first time through. It's tough, but fair.\n\nCombat comes down to analyzing your enemies, knowing your weapon and defenses, and managing your stamina. You don't need an overpowered build to win any encounter, just awareness and the ability to react. Nearly every piece of equipment in the game is viable and allows the game to be played pretty much however you wish. (Just don't put ANY POINTS AT ALL into Resistance. It's pointless.) This is definitely not the kind of linear stat progression and equipment system most RPGs present players with, and the game feels much more satisfying overall since you have so much of a say in how you want to defend yourself.\n\nBeing dropped in fresh will be overwhelming at first since the game provides no real direction on how you need to progress, but exploring the dreary and imposing world of the undead is rewarding in itself. You'll never know what's around the next corner, but that's part of the fun. It's hard to think of many other games so focused on atmosphere and discovery these days in the same ways that Dark Souls is.\n\nI can get why the game may not necessarily appeal to everyone, but those who can tough out those initial few hours are in for an immensely rewarding experience. One of the generation's best, right here.","November 7, 2013","true","122.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlemsG/recommended/211420/","SlemsG","The Bard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlemsG/","179 products in account","This game.. There's a lot to it and  there's a lot to say about it.. Let me start off by saying that this game is pretty casual, it's not challenging whatsoever, it's almost as easy as Minecraft. But the fact of the matter is that it's super fun! You can play it with KBM (keyboard+mouse) WITHOUT any downloaded fixes that are required in order to make the game playable with KBM. If you have a controller, you can use it. But I'd say stick with KBM. The game itself is really unique, especially the humanity system, basically your character starts off as an undead without his humanity, unfortunately there are absolutely no pros for being an undead, only cons. You can restore your humanity by using an item called 'humanity', by doing so you will open the bridge between you and other players and it is AWESOME! When you become human, NOTHING BAD WILL EVER HAPPEN TO YOU. NEVER. Friendly people will ocasionally come to your world, helping you with the game if you're struggling (which would be weird because the game is pretty easy). You can go to other worlds as well! Only as human though.\n\nNow the bosses. Oh, the good old bosses. They're average difficulty I'd say. You don't really need any tactics while fighting against them, they're just very predictable each encounter. Whenever I play this game, I CAN NOT WAIT for another boss battle because they're so relaxing and calming. Then there's this awesome RPG system, I must mention that you can not go wrong with your souls (the game's currency) spending, you can recklessly and without any thinking spend your souls into any stat you desire and it will not affect your game drastically. There's not a lot to choose from, weapon and armor wise. It's just enough to keep the game simple and casual.\n\nIf all of that didn't convince you to buy the game I'll list all the things to summarize everything.\n\nReasons to buy the game:\n1. It's really casual.\n2. It's not very challenging.\n3. You can play this when you're in a bad mood or just feel sad. It will definitely cheer you up!\n4. No need to think a lot how to spend your souls (the game's currency).\n5. Boss fights are really relaxing and calming!\n6. No fixes required to be downloaded in order to play the game using KBM (keyboard+mouse).\n7. Controller is optional (not really worth using in my opinion since the game has full KBM support).\n8. Everything I said is a load of crap, the game is fk-ing annoying and cancerous, for your first playthrough the bosses are fk-ing impossible and makes you want to slit your damn wrists and choke on your own blood (Bed of Chaos, Artorias etc.) .\n9. The euphoric feeling that you get after beating every boss after countless tries and different approaches.. I sh-it you not, it's better than an org-asm. Your heart's racing, body shaking, palms sweaty, knees weak, arm's are heavy, mom's spaghetti.\n\nIn all honesty, this game is hard as sh-it, but it's the good kind of sh-it, you should definitely buy this game if you feel like everything you're playing is easy. It will definitely make you rage quit at least 20 times before finishing your first playthrough. I absolutely love it. I recommend you get the game and try for yourself. And if you do, here's the first tip, DON'T SPEND ANY SOULS IN RESISTANCE. And for Christ's sake, use a controller.","December 7, 2015","true","97.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/recommended/211420/","CPTMOISTPANTIES","Cpt. Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Dark Souls is an 'open-world' game in the vein of 'Metroidvania' titles, which is to say it's open ended but not as open ended as Western titles tend to be. The map design is such that areas are generally linear, but paths branch out at points into other linear areas, which either lead to dead ends  or to connections to previously explored areas, or a new area altogether. This design in linearity with branching paths and backtracking is synonymous with 'Metroidvania' titles. Ultimately all linear areas connect and its your duty to explore them thoroughly and keep a mental note of places you've yet to visit due to a present task, since its completion will then lead to yourself asking, ''where to next''.\n\n''Oh right, there were those two areas that I didn't explore, time to get to it''\n\nThe old school comparison goes further, as the game also has a ton of secrets. This game's secrets can be divided into three categories: alternative paths in levels (self-explanatory); illusory walls (walls that, when struck, disappear thereby revealing a path); and item-environmental interactions. alternative paths and illusory walls typically contain items behind them, sometimes unique items and weaponry not attainable otherwise. ''item-environmental interactions'' are best described as items that are used/equipped in conjunction with being in a particular area. These are fewer in number, but lead to optional boss fights and optional areas to explore. There's a lot to love in a game that has a lot to uncover in addition to just straight up exploration.\n\nDark Souls is also an infamously difficult game, a reputation that isn't entirely merited. If you die you keep everything in your inventory minus Souls and Humanity; Souls being currency for weapon upgrades and levelling up whilst having more Humanity means better resistances and more item drops from enemies. Dying even once sounds bad, but the bonfires (which work as respawn locations and checkpoints) are always spaced apart evenly and you never lose much progress when you die since, in general, you can always get to where you previously were after death in as little as 1 minute or less.\n\nAs for Souls, in general losing them doesn't matter since enemies respawn everytime you rest at a bonfire, and you can easily grind them back again. Typically if you're in an area that gives you more than a third of the souls required for a level-up with each death then its beneficial to grind the area for levels rather than constantly dying and losing all those souls. With all the deaths you could've stopped dying and levelled up a bit more rather than wasting time. The idea is to not carry around a ton of souls because you will often die, but you will also often have a checkpoint just a few seconds away from your place of death anyway.\n\nIt's the type of challenge that is fair and welcolmed, but also highly overrated. There were a few spots that were difficult to get past due to enemy placement and level design, but typically if the area is hard to the point of causing rage inducing deaths, then either you shouldn't be there yet or you should but are slightly underlevelled and therefore can easily grind a few levels and upgrade weaponry and armor. Don't let talk of this being THE HARDEST GAME EVER dissuade you from trying it, because it's challenging but also fair and has levelling, which can, if EVERYTHING ELSE fails, just lead to you theoretically being level 100 with perpetual grinding and beating whatever area you're presently in.\n\nNot that grinding matters anyway, you get the majority of your damage and defense from upgrading weapons and armor. Unlike most RPG's, your stats don't matter as much as you'd like them to. Weapons generally have stat requirements to wield them (typically in dexterity or strength), so your initial points will be to meet these requirements. But weapons also scale off those stats, so that mid to late game when you have a significant number of points into whichever stat said weapon scales off of, it does a lot more damage than before. So you have a dual system whereby weapon damage is dictated by its upgrades, but also by your stats. Different weapons scale differently as well; there's a rating system from S to E, where the higher the rating a weapon has on the spectrum for a particular stat the more damage it gets off said stat. This system dictates which weapons you wish to keep and wish you'd do away with (along with their attack animations), so the RPG elements and item management make this a sort of action-RPG/Metroidvania hybrid.\n\nSpeaking of 'Metroidvania', I'll harken back to the point and say that just like the first few Metroid titles Dark Souls also starts with as minimal a narrative as possible, and it's to its detriment. One of the hardest things in starting the game was giving a damn about it. You get a 4 minute cutscene in the beginning vaguely talking about Gods, and are then thrust into the gameworld with a very vague, ''go ring bells plz'' objective. It's very difficult for me to really get into something when there's no plot to it. I understand that no one wants an experience that sacrifices atmosphere for 100 NPC's and 500 cutscenes with PC's strung about the land detailing 10 pages of the game's plot in each.\n\nBut it's not a scenario whereby you have to sacrifice one to get the other. Dark Souls supposedly has a considerable amount of lore but good fuc*ing luck getting it all in-game in a comprehensive fashion. It's the type of lore that was pieced together by the fanbase after multiple playthroughs and really analyzing item descriptions. I assume the rest was either in developer interviews and artbooks or stuff that came in the later titles. Some is fan conjecture. It's such a shame because you can weave a narrative that takes advantage of the groundwork laid but if, for the majority that played the game, it dwindles down to, ''I gotta google it'' then you've failed to convey a story.\n\nThe game's narrative is akin to walking into a room mid-conversation with three people talking, or watching the last 20 minutes of a movie; you can understand it by the end of it if you piece it together, and if you were to view it again you could understand it all moreso but it's a REALLY bad way of relaying a story. It's one of those games that starts with the assumption that you already know what's going on, and talks about what's going on here and there. In other words, something that would require multiple playthroughs and rewatching and re-reading cutscenes/dialogue scenes to understand what the creators made. Like I said, it's a failure in story-telling and what prevents something from being damn close to perfect.\n\nPlot aside everything else in the game is awesome, and if you're into the exploratory nature of Metriod titles (old and the Prime series) and are looking for an action RPG then you can't go wrong with this game. Very few games merit the praise they typically get, but Dark Souls lives up to expectations. You'll need to google the upgrade system as it pertains to weaponry, but otherwise the barrier to entry isn't as steep as you might imagine.","April 23","true","119.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/recommended/211420/","ShitBackInLimbo","Shepard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/","45 products in account","Genre: RPG/Open World\nIf you're the person who loves challenge, and who don't mind dying a lot and also want to try new things, then you're gonna love this game. Otherwise if you're the person who plays games at easy/normal just so you can experience the game and move on avoid this. This game takes time, and to get better you need to die a lot.\n\n\nGameplay(+)\nGameplay is different than in other games and it doesn't feel that smooth in the beginning. Some people find it slow at first, but that's cause Dark Souls is one of the games that tries to be more realistic as far as the gameplay is concerned.\n\nWeapons/Armors: You have two slots in each hand, for weapons or shields(you can put weapon or shield in whatever hand you want). You also have armor. You can combine parts of armor sets however you want. Game offers a big variety of weapons, armors, shields etc. There are many classes of weapons: Straight swords, Greatswords, Ultra Greatswords, Axes, Katanas, Hammers, Whips, Bows and many others. When choosing armors and weapons you need to worry about their weight and your equip load. Other than weight weapons and shields also have stats requirements. Usually you need certain amount of points invested into Strength or Dexterity, or both, and sometimes you need to invest into magic, miracles etc. Some weapons scale of strength, some of dexterity, and some of both, which means that increasing those stats increases weapons damage, and also weapons have different types of scaling. You can also upgrade weapons, shields and armors with some materials and souls(souls=Dark Souls money and exp points).\n\nMagic/Miracles: Game also offers a big variety of magic spells and miracles. They have their stats requirements too. You need to invest points into intelligence/faith to increase magic/miracles attack and defense, and to be able to use those spells/miracles. There are  additional items that improve magic or miracles attack or defense.\n\nEnemies: Enemies are very creative, there are many type of enemies and a lot of them are hard to kill at first. Boss fights are absolutely amazing, and killing a boss in Dark Souls feels like great accomplishment. Game has plenty of bosses, and many of them are optional. After killing the boss you'll get souls. Some bosses also drop boss souls which you can either eat to accuire more souls or save them for later, so you can craft boss weapons at blacksmiths. Every time you die enemies will respawn at same places, but bosses won't. Once you kill them, they're dead till the next new game + cycle.\n\nNew Game +: After you finish the game, you'll automatically progress into new game +, with everything that you've collected in ng. You can play ng+ endlessly, and the game's difficulty increases every time untill you reach ng+7, where it stops increasing.\n\nSome other things about gameplay: Bonfires are checkpoints in this game. Every time you rest at bonfire, all enemies will go back to their place, and all enemies will respawn, except from killed bosses. Every time you die you lose all souls you have and you need to find that same location to pick them up before you die again, unless you want to lose them forever. After dying you'll respawn at last checkpoint you had been rested.\n\nMultiplayer(+)\nThis is one of the things that makes Dark Souls games pretty unique. You can invade worlds of other players with special items and fight them there, or get invaded in your own world. You can also call other players from their worlds by activating signs on the floor with purpose to either fight them or play co-op with them, and you can post your own signs too.\n\n\nAtmosphere(+)\nOne of the things that makes Dark Souls so great is dark and gloomy atmosphere, that makes you feel lonely in that cruel world. Not knowing what's behind the next corner, it forces you to have your eyes wide open all the time.\n\n\nStory/Lore(+)\nStory in Dark Souls is not told in the classical way. To find explanation of the story you must listen to what NPCs have to say, and read descriptions of items, and still after that you're not gonna be able to understand a lot of things, so you must create your own theories about what happened. There are good theories on internet from youtubers like VaatiVydia, Silver Mont, Dave Control Live, TerraMantis,etc.\n\n\nBad port(+-)\nThis is really a bad port, and it's almost unplayable without DSfix which can be found here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=684 .You can't get banned for using this, and almost every Dark Souls player uses this. Port by default is locked at 30 fps, but DSfix lets you unlock fps, and it also makes game pretty stable with improved graphic. Still some people complain that they have dips with unlocked fps and set on 60, but I really can't help you with that since I am playing on 30 fps since beginning without any problems.\n\nVerdict: This is an an amazing, very challenging game, and that combined with an amazing gameplay, atmosphere and lore makes it a masterpiece. Sadly it is an awful port, but there is a mod that fixes most of the issues.\n\nPersonal rating: 10/10","August 6, 2015","true","240.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWallet/recommended/211420/","MrWallet","Mr. Wallet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWallet/","334 products in account","I played this game all the way through the first non-tutorial boss. this includes a big detour fighting some skeletons in a graveyard for about an hour before my friend told me that those things should have been killing me and I was supposed to go the other way. Basically the whole thing is a giant patience test, where the only way you ever die is by being greedy and wanting to end an encounter sooner by getting more hits in. When the only way you can lose is if you're anxious for the central gameplay to be over with sooner, there's something seriously wrong in the game's design.\n\nIf this game is challenging, it's after the first boss, who I beat on the first try because he telegraphed everything like mad.\n\nIf this game is atmospheric, it's after the first boss, because I just had generic medieval castle to go through.\n\nIf this game is rich or deep in story, it's after the first boss (and an NPC who talks to you a while afterward), because I still have no idea what the series is about or how anything is supposed to work (including a lot of gameplay elements, for which there is no written information anywhere - wiki walks are fine for sandbox games but just annoying in a beat 'em up).\n\nIf a game doesn't give me a reason to play it by the end of the first real area, then either it has nothing to offer, or it's stringing me along instead of respecting me as a customer. Either way DS1 was a huge letdown and I really don't get all the hype.\n\nIn a word, the game is "tedious", and I'm amazed at how many people seem to confuse that with "difficult". It's difficult to force yourself to play in a way that will win, because you'd rather play in a way that seems fun but gets you killed. This is not the kind of difficult that a video game is supposed to be.\n\nPick it up on sale as a casual time-killer but look elsewhere if you want a game that actually wants you to have fun. If you're looking for a challenge in the same general genre, I recommend Rogue Legacy.","May 14, 2014","false","3.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","9"

The detail on the buildings, Anor Londo specifically, is to die for (since the things in the place might kill you anyway!).\n\nIt is a tough game, for sure, and should not be sat down with while in a mental state that says "I will be good at this, better than anybody else, and I will beat it." You will more than likely end up frustrated in the end.\n\nThe pc port is iffy, albeit playable (but makes the game a lot harder), but with a controller it's equal to playing the console version of the game.\n\nThe major downside to this game is that when trying to either invade or summon, it is a hit and miss.

But then like Rihanna you come crawling back begging for more. The worst thing about all of this is that even though it will make you want to rip your teeth out, you'll love every second of it. The feeling of finally figuring out how to beat a challenge is so amazing at times you might feel like throwing a small party in celebration, and the rush you get when beat the game (your tormentor for the past many hours of game play) is even more so. You will be hard pressed to find a gaming experience as thrilling and rewarding as sDark Souls, as soon as you start playing it will become your most hated addiction.","July 26, 2014","true","113.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Well, it shouldn't!\n\nPeople will play games forever, whether it's marbles or Dark souls, but either way, somebody is gonna rage quit! some people will play a video game just to 'Beat' it. However, this game does it a little different.... instead of giving you a choice of beating it or not, it decides for you - and it's never in your favour! This game beats you.... to a pulp.... then runs you over in it's car.... and gets it's mates to help beat the crap out of you.... not even exaggerating a little bit!\n\nBut why should that scare you off? It's just a game right?\n\nWrong, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nThis is more than a game, it's an achievement, an accomplishment, a challenge and a test for all gamers out there!\nThis game is not reccomended for those who are prone to rage quitting, and it's definately not for the faint at heart!\n\n'But what's the point if im just going to die all the time?'\n\nShut up, you're adopted! let me tell you what's in store for you!\n\nThe rewards may be a few souls and a weapon.... but thats in game! Inside your head you have just played the same part of the game about 500 times, and you've died equally. You were about to walk away when you gave it one more shot!\n\nfinally, you got the SOB down to its last bit of health and you stabbed it right in the ♥♥♥♥♥! You stood with your head held high when you finally killed that boss and you made it known that you owned it and you had intercourse with it's mother while shouting at the screen. The satisfaction levels are over 9000, and you could even say that you smiled after so much anger and frustration.... and trust me when i say that THAT very smile feels amazing!\n\nthis game will take you a LONG time to finish..... the first area..... let alone the whole game! but it's not about time, its about how much you want it! it's about your desire to accomplish something! You can say to your weaker friends 'Hey look noob, i finished Dark Souls! what did you do in the last 600 hours of your life?'\n\nhaving said that, this game IS NOT a waste of time at all! if you play for an hour and dont even get to a new bonfire (Checkpoint [Very Rare]) dont decide it's no use, just keep trying.... there are more secrets in this game the illuminati dont even know whats going on!! Look for shortcuts, try new areas dont get caught in a rut!\n\nSo yeah, thats what i think anyway! please consider playing this game (If you can get it working on steam [Need a games for windows account])\n\nDark Souls..... You are worthy of nothing less...\n9.3/10\nDylan Burton","January 29, 2014","true","42.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

You are an Undead, a cursed being trapped within the purgatory that is the Undead Asylum. Who you are and what brought you here are a mystery. The curse makes one forget it seems. As you break out of your cell messages written with soapstone start to appear. Slowly you will make your way through the Asylum, heeding the cautionary tales written by those who came before you. You will seek comfort in the warm embrace of the bonfire, an oasis amidst the rubble and death. Before long however, you will be faced with insurmountable odds in the form of the Asylum Demon. This is where you will most likely die. However death isn't the end of things, you're an Undead after all. Soon you'll feel the warm embrace of the bonfire once more. At this point you will try again, again and again. Until at long last you slay the beast and are liberated from this place. This is where Dark Souls starts and your journey begins.\n\nThat journey will be beautiful and engaging. The world you'll explore, the characters you'll meet are all lovingly crafted and will stick with you until long after. The gameplay is brutally unforgiving and exceptionally rewarding. Every bit of progress you'll make in this game will be a personal victory. It is incredibly captivating, challenging and simply put fun. If you are looking for a lengthy hands off narrative with compelling, tense action orientated D&D style gameplay. Then do yourself a favor, pick this game up and praise the sun!\n\nThat being said, it is not without it's faults. The port of this game is sloppy to say the least. Natively it runs at sub par resolutions and has it's gamelogic locked at 30fps. This means that out of the box this game is practically unplayable for most PC gamers. Luckily there are ways to fix these glaring issues in the form of DSFix. (V2.4 at the time of this writing) It is a third party injector created for Dark Souls Prepare To Die Edition that enables you to alter render settings at the engine level.\n\nAll in all I can not recommend Dark Souls enough.","January 20, 2015","true","175.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The underlying game is genius, truly wonderful that eggs you on to discover what lays around the next corner. The fusion between Fighting game, Adventure, RPG is almost magical. But it is let down by it unforgiving personality. Some of the bosses I beat first time round (so it's not a skill problem), and nearly all of the bosses (up to the Lordvessel) were destroyed within a handful of attempts. However, this game really shouldn't take 50-60 hours to complete! A lot of that is wandering around trying to figure out what to do next, or trying to figure out the game logic. This game would be 10/10 if it was designed so that the same content (main) would take the average user 30 hours at most to complete. The first 30 hours were amazing for me, but it just became a plod and some of the later bosses felt like boring trial and error until something worked. Some of the challenge was not real "challenge" either. It was bad level design (even though overall the level design was rather superb), bad bonfire placement, glitchy and unpredictable collision boxes.\n\nI wanted to just love this game, and although I do truly see the brilliant glint in Dark Souls eye, it's still a Diamond in the Rough. Sort out all those shoddy hitboxes, clipping and dodgy bonfire placements and lessen up on the bulking up game time via over repetition.\n\nStop allowing AI to hit through stone walls, where my blade fails, but then on the other hand let a dragon be shot slowly to death by an arrow because he hasn't detected you are slowly killing him. it feels cheap because it is.\n\nStill I can recommend this game to anyone that loves Dark fantasy, a deep challenge, and very wonderfully created world (even if thin to non existent on plot). But that kind of makes it even more mysterious.","November 19, 2014","true","61.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has a steep learning curve, for sure. But it rewards the patient and persistent. One can easily glance over the story since it isn't presented in the same way that most AAA games today present their stories. But the world of Lordran is full of deep, interesting lore. The game may seem like it plays stiff at first, but the combat is actually fairly intricate and quick reactions can mean the difference between life and death. From beginning to end, you feel like you're just a frail human up against the world and its gods. And because of that, you'll feel all the more accomplished when you finally triumph over them all.\n\nAnd I can't write a review for this game without mentioning the incredible community. I feel online play is an essential part of this game. Whether I'm bringing in a sunbro or two to help me bring down a boss or I'm getting invaded by Dickwraiths every 5-10 minutes, I've always had fun with it. Every coop fight feels like an epic "brothers-in-arms" struggle. Every invasion, even the ones where I get roflstomped and mocked, feels like another hurdle that I have to give my all to overcome. Also, the humor that comes out of this game's community...just beautiful.\n\nPeople praise or condemn this game for its difficulty. I feel the difficulty comes mostly from the fact that the game respects you as a player: It doesn't pull any punches and it doesn't take you by the hand to guide you through it. It acts as though it assumes you have the capability to overcome what it throws at you. Still feeling overwhelmed? You can seek help from the community through messages on the ground or possibly even from walkthroughs if you're truly desparate. It's part of the lore after all. And so are the troll messages, watch out for those haha.\n\nI didn't expect it but this game quickly became one of my favorite games once I started playing it. I feel that this is something that all gamers should at least experience. It's not perfect but nothing is. That said, this game still provided an experience beyond my expectations.\n\n10/10, Grossly incandescent","March 28, 2014","true","208.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It requires you to change the standard way you play video games.  It's ok to die, in fact, that's how you learn.  It requires precise skill and patience, but the reward after killing a boss or progressing through a level is unmatched.\nA brilliant and rewarding game.","March 26","true","65.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some of them even say it's too hard, but this game is like any other game in terms of dificulty. The only job you have here is learn the game: you need to learn enemy movesets, and your own, parry times, when to dodge or when to tank, if you can tank, and you need to learn enemy placements. Never just run into a place thinking you can dodge and speedrun first time.\n\nI've played this game on the 360 for a lot longer than 140 hours, and my time on PC just adds to it. The game developers knew just where enemy placement would be perfect, and in what amount so that when you lost it was your fault. Not all areas and bosses feel this way, "Bed of Chaos", but the majority of the game is fair. I've personally seen people get stuck at the tutorial boss. It's not unfair difficulty, it's just a lack of Dark Souls skill.\n\nThanks to steamworks the multiplayer is a lot [less confusing than GFWL's, ]albeit a little bit slower.\nMost of the time I can connect to my friends with little to no downtime, but there are those times when it feels like you are in offline mode.\n\nThis game has PvP, and it's everywhere. There is a forest where invasions are a regular thing, and there is an arena in the DLC area. Red Sign soapstones are things for honorable physchopathic murderers.  Almost any place you can encounter a boss you can get invaded. PvP is really great in this game because it requires all the knowledge i previously mentioned. If you get invaded, never underestimate your opponet, or you will not survive for long.\n\nPeople really like the story of this game. I do as well, but it's not just told outright to your face. It's scattered everywhere, from item descriptions to NPC dialouge. Descriptions and NPC dialouge is also a great way to discover the lore about bosses or enemies.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It's got all the things I love. Great PvE, great PvP, and most of all it allows you to either make new friends or meet hiliariously bad trolls.","February 16, 2015","true","514.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Enemies and bosses alike based around this combat system creates the most fun I've ever had killing anything in any game EVER.\n\nPros: Well designed enemies, weapons, bosses, armor, you name it. The world is immersive, the gameplay fun and challenging, the characters believable, and the lore interesting. Fun enough to outweigh all the cons.\n\nCons: Bugs, faulty physics, anything below Lower Undead Burg, Duke's Archives, difficulty spikes, hackers, Windows Live, and some enemies (Bonewheels, Torch Hollows, Misquitos, Ghosts, etc.) are incredibly cheap, the PC controls are absolutely horrific (thank god you can use an Xbox controller, with one the controls are great and responsive).\n\nOverall, the good parts of the game completely outweigh the bad. Sometimes you just need to consider the cons a necessary challenge so you don't smash your controller.\n\nI give Dark Souls an 87/100.\nTo put things into perspective, this is my favorite game of all time.","January 1, 2014","true","480.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The amount of work that FromSoft put into the level design is astounding. Everything just seems to flow perfectly, your eyes are drawn to (or away from) things that you are supposed to find. Unlocking a shortcut or finding a new path can sometimes stop you in your tracks and blow your mind.

The lore is deep and rich, but you only scratch the surface in game, everything else is mystery or up to your interpretation. The frustration and feeling of accomplishment that follows.

Well, this review is from a 100% Completionist of the game :D\n\nOk, so to start, Dark Souls: Amazing game. Great storyline, large variety of combat styles, plenty of sorceries & miracles to mix the game up a bit. Overall, super fun. Dark Souls... however does have its own infamous quirks, such as its ridiculous difficulty compared to modern AAA titles. Features like no Health Regen, No Map for guidance, Enemies with the ability to One-Hit Kill even in the best Armour, etc etc.\n\nDoes this make it bad? Certainly not! For me (and thousands of others), its a welcoming change to the overly-easy game market nowadays. Really makes you think how to approach the next room, or avoid the next bosses attack patterns.\n\nOk, on to my personal ratings of the game:\n\nPro's\n> Deep Lore for Storyline Background.\n> Amazing variety of areas & enemies to take on\n> Very Ambient & Atmospheric Soundtrack\n> Large variety of Weapons & Magics to choose from\n> Unique approach to Co-Op / Multiplayer\n> Requires Strategy, and not just Blarargahrgara run in and swing\n\nCon's\n> Occassional frame rate drops in certain areas\n> Bosses can glitch out sometimes & either insta-kill or insta-die\n> Lacks information on how to progress at certain points\n\nOverall, I think the Positive outweigh the Negative alot!\n\nAnd being this is the Prepare to Die Edition, it comes with the Artorias of the Abyss Expansion, which is verrrrry fun and very different compared to the base game :3\n\nWould I recommend Dark Souls? Yes. Especially if you enjoy a game that will make you struggle to beat, then this is the perfect title to pick up ASAP!\n\n9.5/10 would 100% Achievements Again!

Endless deaths and trial somehow push me through wanting to collect my souls for a level up and move on through a tough boss battle. The game is very punishing but rewarding in all the right ways, making me come back for more each time. If you like a challenge, are prepared to die many times, and enjoy unique level designs then this is the game for you. I don't just recommend this game but i highly recommend it. I've become addicted to it and I am an overall BAD player. I suck. If I can do it so can you. I can promise that its well worth your time. Practice makes perfect in a game like dark souls. The lore is rediculously interesting and the amount of replayability is high as well. There is a lot to do in this game and every time you move forward you will feel relief and happiness before the despair of realizing the next area you are about to go to seems to be an even bigger trial than before.

I actaully tried this game many months ago and had really bad first impressions because of the difficulty. But, I decided I really wanted to experience this game, so I picked it up again. One thing to note is this a really bad PC port, but at least it doesn't have GFWL anymore. Now, you can unlock the framerate without getting kicked off of GFWL. I highly recommend getting at least DSFix. Lastly, please use a controller for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tryzon/recommended/211420/","tryzon","Jaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tryzon/","234 products in account","If the horror stories are to be believed, Dark Souls is a punishing game that only those with infinite patience will ever see the end of. As with so many legends, there’s a grain of truth to these claims that’s been exaggerated out of proportion; yes, Dark Souls is a merciless beast whose demanding nature will put off a lot of people. But is it insurmountable for the average gaming enthusiast? I’d argue no.\n\nAfter a cryptic intro that raises more questions than it answers, Dark Souls places you in a prison cell armed with only a broken sword. On top of that, your character died before you even had a say in their life. All this sets the tone for an adventure that pulls no punches, and by the time you find a decent weapon you’ll have already run into some lethal creatures. But there’s nothing inherently unreasonable about the opening segment of gameplay; you’re told what buttons do what, then given a weapon and left to figure out the most efficient means of killing stuff with it. The result is a game that trains you to approach new areas with caution, never underestimate an opponent, and always have an escape route if things go ♥♥♥♥-up. It’s an intriguing hybrid of old and new game design, sans most of the cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your nostalgia doesn’t let you remember.\n\nThe combat is the dominant gameplay feature, of course, and I don’t hesitate to call it some of the best I’ve seen: a dagger feels completely different from a giant hammer, and neither can be called definitively better than the other. Dodging attacks and getting backstabs is a legitimate tactic, but so is tanking damage and punching through blocks with heavy weapons, not to mention the abundance of magical options I was too scared to try for a long time. It’s a strategic experience that something like Skyrim can barely dream of unless modded up the wazoo.\n\nSpeaking of strategy, Dark Souls is one of precious few games that actually give meaningful penalties for death. Every time you die, you lose your accumulated points and have precisely one chance to retrieve them. If you ♥♥♥♥ that up, the points are gone forever. It’s harsh, to be sure, but checkpoints are never obscenely far apart and I learned early on that if you know your downfall is imminent, you might as well try and die in a spot that can be reached easily. It’s just another system to use to your advantage and will only screw you over if you push your luck: know when to retreat and spend your points, rather than lose them deep in enemy territory. That the entire world respawns when you use a checkpoint is bizarre at first, yet makes a lot of sense to me; sitting at a bonfire becomes a tactical decision, since it provides safety at the cost of undoing your progress elsewhere. And as crushing as it is to lose your hard-earned points, those moments are also the best times to throw yourself at a boss or speed through a tough area to grab items.\n\nNavigating the metroidvania landscape is the other great art of Dark Souls. Locales are varied (along with their inhabitants) and frequently bigger than they first appear, overflowing with hidden loot, shortcuts and even optional bosses. Backtracking does become a nuisance beyond a certain point, and the teleport option is hard-earned, but the only places I truly dislike are the handful suffering from framerate dips (on consoles) and finicky platform segments. Other than that, I find the game’s setup enjoyable, not least due to its role in one of Dark Souls’ most surprising triumphs: storytelling.\n\nThere’s a wealth of lore to be found in subtle background details and item descriptions, and it really felt like I was piecing together the world’s history from the clues left behind. The slow realisation of just how boned the land is fits perfectly with the sense of dread pervading the gameplay, and even your character’s ability to rise after death is contextually justified. For a game that could’ve relied solely on its combat, I find it doubly impressive that Dark Souls manages to have a memorable world, and with a minimalistic style that’s refreshing in an industry whose attempts at storytelling often rely on overwritten cutscenes.\n\nAnother remarkable aspect of Dark Souls is the online integration: players can leave messages that randomly pop up in people’s worlds. Some are helpful, some are amusing, and some are outright lies. Then you have a clunky but workable co-op mechanic, along with the danger of being invaded by other guys whenever you de-zombify yourself. The whole arrangement is seemingly unique to the Souls franchise, and has created a profound sense of community while also reminding you that nobody can be trusted.\n\nAt its core, Dark Souls represents a raw yet fair challenge where death is almost never anyone’s fault but the player’s. And while your initial perception may be one of cruel chaos, dig deep enough and you’ll find a sense of order. By almost any measure, I think Dark Souls must be called an impressive piece of work. The only question is whether you’ll enjoy an action game which requires you to be methodical and treat every fight like a matter of life and death. Unlike some parts of the fanbase, I understand that it’s possible to not like something for reasons other than sucking at it.","February 24, 2015","true","166.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Dark souls has many things going for it but also some negatives about it as well.\n\nWhat is Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition? Dark souls is an Open World, Action RPG and a very good one at that. You are a Chosen Undead who is suddenly freed from a prision cell and begin your quest to venture out into the world that is Lordran to find out what is happening in this Depressing and Dying World and what you, the Chosen Undead, must do. Gameplay focuses mostly on PvE(Player vs. Enemy's) and if you wish to take part in PvP(Player Vs. Player) that is up to you. Combat in the game is mostly melee combat but also uses sorceries, pyromancy, miracles, and ranged combat(bow and Arrows). Pretty basic stuff.\nSouls, which is the games currency, can be used to buy various items from NPC's throught the world as well as Level you up(if you have the required amount to level up)\n\nWhat's so good about this game that people always talk about it?\nWell for starters one of the key features I found to personally be my favorite is that it gives you no direction whatsoever. I don't have a mini-map telling me where to go or what objectives i need to do. It just throws you into this Huge world and that's it. Go on and explore it all you want. Second is the story it tells. Most games normally have a cutscence in-game and tell you about the story and so on. In this game, the story is all around you. The Boss souls you aquired, the NPC armor sets, rings, items, etc., each have their own little story to tell in this world. Lore is everywhere, your job the find it and piece together what has happened in this world or what has happened to the NPC's. Another is Graphics. Tho Graphics don't really affect gameplay but the game looks beautiful on it's max settings as well as the lack of lighting in some areas give that immersive feeling to the game. Combat system is tight although it does have it flaws for PvP, but besides that it works just fine. Another i feel is a good thing is the Trial and Error system in place. Let's say your going to fight a boss for the first time and die, the game DOES NOT and WILL NEVER hold hands with you.  The game expects you to LEARN from your mistakes about why you failed to kill this boss or enemy. If you keep going in, not learning from your mistakes and expecting anything will work, you are wrong. Learn form your mistakes and perform better and you will be greatly rewarded for your tirals.\n\nWhile this game is great it indeed has it's flaws.\nDiffiulty in this game is high. This game will be very difficult for anyone new since you are expected to know the mechanics quickly after the tutorial area is done. I, myself, am guilty of raging and not playing this game for a while but i got my act together and finished it. Lack of knowledge is another one. Although i did mention this as a pro but it can also be a con if one doesn't know where to go and what to do. Although it should be fairly simple where to go in my opinion. Next is about the networking issues. Standard game has some issues indeed which is why you need to download the DS Fix if you want to play PvP and summon friends to aid you. Next would be PvP networking. Sometimes if either you or the host have bad connections, either party can have a bad time at fighting against each other such as lag backstabs and lag hits as well as host disconnects. Shame but it happens so be wary of these.\n\nSo is this game worth getting? Is Dark Souls, the game considered to be the hardest ever made, good?\nTo answer both those questions I say Yes and ♥♥♥♥ YES\nThis game brings alot to the table and more if you wish to have a varied experice trying out different covenants, builds and PvP. Excellent game if you wish for a true challenge that will challenge your intelligence and how you can handle yourself in certain situations.\n\nIMPORTANT STUFF *READ IT*\nAs a sidenot that it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to have a controller. As the keyboard and mouse is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you have the DSC Fix which is a mod to improve networking in the game. Also there is a possible issue with the windows live and market that will auto install after you finish downloading it via steam. When it's finished downloading be sure to uninstall live and marketplace and then download the latest version via windows live website. As this will fix the issue of your gaming crashing 3-5 seconds after launching it because of the old windows live issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 18, 2014","true","63.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

It's a real challenge I like that, and offers plenty of hours of replay value but the thing that I hate about is it's really designed for a controller and GSWL drm but besides that I enjoy it. PVP is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing rad, though hard to do at times. It isn't watered down with what exactly to do nothing to hold your hand all the way, though there are hints. Boss battles are amazing, and rewarding once you defeat your first major boss. Can't rush through things all the time, you have to think before you make your next move. Even looking for off the wall areas is a challenge in it's self exploring even the most unlikely places you think there could be something there is a chance something is there. Lacks in lore but I'm willing to look past that because it excels in everything else. Lastly I seem to have not got bored  40 hours in, that's usually a good sign.\n\n*So TLDR? (aka your brain can't read more than a sentences words because your dumber than a inbred redneck)\n\nThe main thing is it's a challenge, a great one at that on the level I felt playing games as a kid even greater at times. The port to PC could have been better though. Even if you die thousands of times don't give up the reward of feeling victory is the more so sweet.","February 19, 2014","true","258.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had purchased this game for PS3, as its cover (and back of it) had reminded me of 'Monster Hunter FU' for a whopping 70 AUD. Turns out it barely resembled 'Monster Hunter', unless you can call it a dark and medieval variant of it. Aaaanyway, I got the game and got p*ssed off by the first boss (patience wasn't my strong point) and didn't play it for months. Then I came back to it after awhile and passed the first boss quite easily as I had decided to roll between its feet instead of in its attacking range. From then on I was hooked by it. Did a couple play throughs and cursed my way happily through the game.\n\nThen one day I decided I'd buy it for my computer too, I couldn't be bothered loading up the PS3 anymore, so here we are. Since DS1: Prepare To Die Edition on the PS3 I moved onto Dark Souls 2 which was fun, but it was great to play the this one again after a fair while.\n\nThis game is fun and addictive, however you can get easily frustrated and p*ssed off by it too. Dark Souls can be a bit vague at times and you'll feel like you have done the same thing for the past eternity if you get stuck...but this game is very much worth buying and playing!","May 20","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That being said here is a brief run-down of the most common quesions I have received from early adopters:\n\n-The Difficulty -\nWhile it is a game that is willing to punish the player, it does not do so unfairly. If you are the kind of player who expects to run headlong into an ambush of 12 undead skeletons and live to tell the tale, this is not the game for you. You gain no special status by being the player, other than your ability to learn. If you like that, you will LOVE this game. If you dislike having to learn how to play a game properly, you will dislike this game. It is that simple. The immense sense of accomplishment you gain from learning more about this game is what keeps players coming back again and again.\n\n- Level Design -\nDark Souls understands something that I think Bethesda has missed with Skyrim, and that is that the immensity of a map does not equate to content. Dark souls is by no means a monster of a game, but the number of things to do and places to explore is quite overwhelming. Every nook and cranny of the game is jam-packed with new characters, invisible walls, diverse weapons, and extensions of the storyline. Another thing that is to be applauded is the masterful connectivity between areas. You may not know where you are until you find a shortcut to some previous area you had been. Learning about these shortcuts makes the map a bit easier to traverse, but also puts on display the genius of the game designers. Everything is connected and makes perfect geographical sense. The use of depth to create distance and elevators to reduce it was a stroke of pure genius. It makes it all the more satisfying to travel to an area using the shortcut you found.\n\n- The Story -\nThere is as much story in Dark Souls as you want there to be. That is not cryptic language or market-speak either. If you so wish, you can completely ignore the story of Dark Souls and kill everything in the game. For a lore-lover like myself, that would be a travesty. Through dialogue of the NPCs as well as item descriptions, you can gain insight into this deep, rich, and intriguing universe full of betrayals, discovery, wonder, and of course darkness. Many of the NPCs who aid you in battle have motivations, hopes, and backstories of their own which give them reasons to help you along in your quest. Discovering these relationships and motivations is part of Dark Souls' charm.\n\n- The Combat -\nDark Souls uses a very deceptively simple combat system. Without going into too much detail, melee combat consists of timed attacks and blocking as well as some critical attacks, while the various magics are mediated through their respective "wands". When you kill enemies, you acquire souls, the world's currency. These can be used for leveling up, buying items at vendors, or improving items at blacksmiths. Dark Souls rewards players greatly for specializing early, but does not punish those who choose to spread their experience points around. Upgrading weapons and armor encourages you to try many different configurations to find the one that suits you as well as the different enemies you are fighting. For example, you may want to have high fire-resistance for a dragon fight, if you intend to take the flames head on. Another major factor is that Dark Souls contains dynamic weight for your character. Want to wear 120 lbs of armor? That's fine, but you will have to accept that your character is going to move around like a sloth until they are strong enough to move around in it comfortably. All of these factors combined make battles in Dark Souls different every time you play them.\n\n- The Bottom Line -\nSo is Dark Souls good? I would go beyond saying Dark Souls is good. It is masterfully simple, rewardingly addictive, and unbelievably rich. If any game this decade was worth full retail, it is this one. And you won't even have to pay that anymore! So buy it!","April 5, 2014","true","281.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroFistTime/recommended/211420/","BroFistTime","The Finest Milksteak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroFistTime/","256 products in account","IMO, 10/10 game. Reminiscent of the N64 Legend of Zelda games, with a bit more RPG elements and of course, multiplayer.\n\nThere seems to be three types of people when it comes to this game:\n\n1.) You play for an hour at best, can't beat the first boss or figure out where to go, and you venomously "hate" on the game because you are too casual or refuse to "git gud." This people are fairly obvious to spot. Admittedly, you can dislike a game, no sweat off my back but I'm talking the ones who are a real chode about it.\n\n2.) You play through the whole game once, and either like/dislike it for what it is; but after this, you do not play again and miss out on New Game+, AKA the real challenge. IMHO, the first playthrough is the tutorial. Totally fine and worth your money.\n\n3.) You play the game religiously almost daily, starting so many new characters all using different builds; some for helping friends through areas, bro-op'ing bosses, creating your own challenges (SL 1 runs, *hint*Lightning Reinforced Club +5*hint*), or just some PVP'ing. This is my category, as I have 200+ hours logged on the PS3 before even picking the PC version up.\n\nThe neat thing about this game is that no matter what category you fall into above, its worth you purchasing. Even those who buy and hate it, I personally feel it was worth you doing so just to know. And if you do feel buyer's remorse, remember you could've spent your time & money playing Aliens: Colonial Marines.","April 15, 2014","true","315.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's pretty much a straight port from Xbox 360 without much work done to accommodate the game for the PC.\nSecond: modders fixed the greatest problems with it, which makes this game far more enjoyable.\n\nYou are the Chosen One. Destined to save the world. You know, like always.\nThe twist? You are undead. Dying isn't something you need to be really afraid of. You actually shouldn't be afraid of dying, because you will die. A lot.\n\nIt's a tough game. Even your standard enemies might pose a threat to you.\nAnd then come the bosses. Not only can they be quite big and hit REALLY hard, simple attacking them won't do you any good.\nLearn their attack patterns. Learn when to strike. And after you've learned, die a lot and try again until you get it.\n\nAfraid to face the bosses alone? Try jolly co-operation!\nTurn into a human at a bonfire, summon a player and try to tackle the boss together!\nBut beware of invaders!\nAs soon as you turn human, other players can invade and attack you. And believe me, they will.\nYou also may find some messages left by other players; warning you of great danger, pointing you to amazing chests or tell you to roll down a cliff (don't do that).\nBe aware that there might be cheaters around, so if you wanna be save from other players, stay undead, but keep in mind that you won't be able to do co-op that way.\n\nThe story may not be the greatest, but the lore is quite extensive, albeit mostly hidden behind conversations (with some really messed up people) and item descriptions. You want to know something about the world you're in? You'll need to work for it.\nThis also isn't your typical medival fantasy world. There are no populated towns or cities filled with NPCs, shops and quests. It's a post-apocalyptic world, where death and destruction reign supreme.\nYou will encounter the odd friendly NPC here and there, but don't ♥♥♥♥ them off or they will try to kill you. Again and again.\n\nBeat the game without breaking a sweat? Try New Game+! Done that? Try New Game++! And that gets one for a while.\n\nImo an absolutely fantastic game with a great art direction and lots of challenges to conquer.\nI'm really glad this game came to the PC. And it did so because of a petition! Isn't that amazing? How often does something like that work?\n\nIn this regard: Praise the Sun and prepare to die! A lot.","January 19, 2014","true","73.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But to me it is much, much more. Dark souls is a game that takes years to master, and has been part of my gaming history for years and I cant stop coming back to it. The game has the most depth in its lore I have ever seen and I am doubtful I will see a more complex story then this one. There is a story behind every room, item, and character, and quite frankly I am in love with it. The way the story is told is just fantastic. You are dropped in a universe you know nothing about, right at the beginning you can go one way with enemies that are suitable for a new player, or you could take the wrong turn down a dark shadowy path to a group of enemies that one shot you. Thats what I love, you see something too hard for you, progress in another area only to come back and best that enemy. It is insanely satisfying. I love the fact that while progressing at any time you can be invaded by another player who will utterly destroy you. It adds so much unpredicatability to the game that you are on the edge of your seat when you see that invasion notification. The pvp is also insanely in depth and has many different ways to play it. Not only this but I have never seen such a strong community. Players are always sharing stories and things they find in the world. With a wide range of fan art, it shows the true appreciation the players have for the art style of the game and themes the game holds.\nTHE CONS:\nThe only cons I can find in this game is the port. To be blunt about it, the game was literally copy and pasted from the xbox 360 version. That being said you need to use mods online to fix up the game to be playable if you are not using a controller.","April 25","true","16.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/211420/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","If you want more reviews for TV shows, movies, games across all platforms, and more, come check out my blog!\nhttp://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/\n\nAlso, be sure to use this link below if you do purchase this game, otherwise it WILL NOT work.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/864980153227392683/\nThanks to my friend Shadow for sending me this link before I purchased this game!\n\nTo be honest, I meant to do this review earlier because it would take too long for me to beat the game, as the average playthrough is about 60 hours long. To add on to that, my crave to review games is pretty hard to contain. So, here's my review of Dark Souls, arguably the best RPG of last gen to many.\n\nDark Souls has been highly praised by gamers and critics and was a solid GOTY contender, but it was overshadowed by Skyrim, which got all the attention. It's true, I am a Skyrim fanboy and I love everything to it, but this game still deserved a lot more recognition than it got. Plus, now that I got a handy Xbox 360 wireless controller, I wanted this game bad. However, I still was worrried due to GFWL ruining my experience. Thanks to one of my awesome friends though, he gave me a link that would fix that annoying problem. But, I don't want to provide negatives because of GFWL and all of that, Enough of my nonsense, to the review!\n\nGraphics\nThe visuals look outstanding yet bland at the same time, depending on how you look at it. The world of Lordran is beautiful about 70% of the time, while the 30% is the more dull part of the game. The dull parts of the game though are harder to explain, and half the time you won't even realize the bad parts to the visuals. The atmosphere is thrilling, dark, and epic. Not much to say for the visuals, heck, even the character models aren't too bad, but there's nothing too great about it.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is easily the strong point to the game, no doubt. Everyone says the game is hard, and that's certainly true, but when someone describes the gameplay to Dark Souls, they always just say "Wow, this game is HARD! Did I also mention it's hard?" and whatnot. I'll give you an unbiased non-hard mentioning gameplay review here. The combat is smooth and actually pretty realistic. Your supplies are actually LIMITED for once, and also the combat is nice and slow because you aren't some kind of MGR Raiden or DMC Dante. You're a regular warrior/sorcerer/knight/pyromancer/whatever else there is. And plus your stamina actually is important unlike other games. Because of the realism in the combat, this game can be very slow at times. Therefore, Dark Souls is for the most patient of gamers. They don't mind repeating the same part over and over again while discovering new ways to get to the next point in the game. The successful realism and well paced gameplay makes Dark Souls have some of the best Action-RPG gameplay seen in years. Phew, check it out, no mentioning of the difficulty! Woohoo!\n\nStory\nThe story may seem vague at first, but then you realize it's basically a puzzle- find the pieces and put them together to make one big picture. It isn't straightforward at all. It wants you to talk to the NPCs and all of that, which makes Dark Souls pretty heavy in lore when you know where to look. You're no god or some kind of super prophecized legend or anything (although in a way you are) and yet Dark Souls successfully does that. The story is what most dark fantasy games should have. There's also Solaire of Astora (Praise the Sun!) on the "bright" side of things and he is known to be a very enjoyable character in the game. I also made a song I'm still working on, but let's not get off topic.\n\nAudio\nDark Souls' audio is among the best I've seen when it comes to sound effects. Again, Dark Souls successfully captures some of the realism intended into the game. The knight, more specifically, sounds amazing with the sound effects instead of listening to the normal quiet footsteps even the most armored of people have in other games. As for the voice acting, everyone seems dark and grim, a major pro to a game that's trying to have a dark theme to it. And for the music, the songs don't really play that much, but when they do, you know you're in big trouble or you're in a safe place. The soundtrack actually is a guide in this game, providing signals to you when traveling throughout Lordran.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability is pretty strong I hear. Like I said, I never had the time to beat this game yet, but I hear there's new game+ and you can also make multiple characters. Based off of what I seen, the people who stay to enjoy this game get an easy 120 hours.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Dark Souls is an outstanding RPG no one should miss, given you don't mind a challenge. Dark Souls is what dark fantasy games should be like. The atmosphere is perfect, the sound effects realistic, and the gameplay smooth. In fact, sometimes when I play Skyrim, I view myself as if I was in the world of Lordran, traversing through the beautiful undead world. If Skyrim could make me do THAT, something is going right with Dark Souls. Even if it isn't my favorite RPG, Dark Souls is one outstanding, dark adventure other Action-RPGs should be looking at.\n\nGraphics- 6.5/10\nGameplay- 10/10\nStory- 8.5/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability- 9.0/10\n\n.:9.1/10:.\n+Smooth gameplay\n+Strategically placed lore\n+Amazing sound effects\n+Brilliant atmosphere (No game has been that good with atmosphere since Bioshock)\n+Lots of realism for a fantasy game\n+Solid replayability\n-Mediocre to above average visuals","September 5, 2014","true","9.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRedColonel/recommended/211420/","TheRedColonel","TheRedColonel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRedColonel/","72 products in account","Dark Souls is, to put it briefly, a masterpiece with minor flaws.\n\nIt's an incredible game, with an entrancing setting that can be both beautiful and haunting.\nAs you guessed from the title, it is very dark, in terms of both setting and themes. However, it's not pitch black. There's always some hope, or some beauty, or some light that keeps this game from being nothing more than a depressing march from start to finish. The game feels more like 'Purgatory' than 'Hell', if that makes sense. Hope is frail in Dark Souls, but this game will never leave you feeling completely hopeless. There is ALWAYS a way.\n\nFinally, the big question everyone asks: Difficulty?\nHonestly, Dark Souls is not the brutally difficult game everyone tells you it is. Aside from two or three actually tough bosses, Dark Souls is only as hard as you allow it to be, as cliched as that sounds. If you appreciate learning, can think laterally and can adapt to meet changing situations, Dark Souls is a very enjoyable challenge. If you allow yourself to get easily frustrated, insist on blindly rushing things, and stubbornly refuse to change tactics if required, the game will punish you, and rightly so, because you're stupid. There is no "one-size-fits-all" plan. Dark Souls doesn't punish "unskilled" people, it punishes stupid people. In the first hour I couldn't even kill a pair of skeletons, now I've finished the game. Perseverance is critical. If you're going to think like a loser, you're going to be a loser, it's as simple as that. There will be times when you'll want to throw your hands up in the air. Don't do it. Never give up.\n\nDark Souls is honestly not a brutally tough game. For any Brood War players out there, if you could beat "To Slay The Beast", you can beat this whole game,  Dark Souls is much easier than that was.\n\nSo don't be afraid, don't hesistate, do something positive for yourself, and experience Dark Souls. When you make it to the end, you won't regret it. Also, get DSFix. It's a painless five minute install, and is absolutely necessary for a good experience.\n\nPS - No spoilers, but there's this thing called a "Purging Stone". You might want to have at least one of those on you at all times. That's all I'm saying.","February 19","true","115.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
