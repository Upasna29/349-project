It is very simple and straightforward but it will definitely get you thinking as to how to outsmart your oppenents.\n\nFor $5.00 you cannot go wrong in my opinion.\n\n\nWARNING\nIf you are looking for an in depth single player experience then this game is not for you and clearly it was never designed to be. It does what it does pretty well and doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.","October 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

I am a big fan of strategy games and enjoy playing them. With this game though there is not much content at all. (yet)\n\nDo not take this as a bad thing though, I feel what this game does it does well indeed. There are three modes - Local VS, VS AI and VS Online. You only get heraldry points through winning online battles (what these do is unlock visual customisable options to your crest)\n\nWhen playing the game, before you start the battle the troops are randomized and there are limited quantities of troops to choose from, in which you and the enemie takes turns in choosing. So before you even start the battle, your mind is already mentally at battle against the opponent.\n\nYou then take turns after you placed the troops to move to different squares. What I did was wait at my spawn for the enemy to come to me (like a camper) and then control my troops from there outwards. The game was pretty easy for me to learn and I even skipped the tutorial.\n\nI have a preview video available here for the game, it's worth viewing the video as I explain and show the game better:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXIvHF5S-0\n\nThe game also has some brief levels of customisation although they are only visual options to your coat of arms.\n\nIf you're looking for an in-depth strategy game which is full of all options and tactical add-ons then I would avoid this game. However I still find the game enjoyable and would most definitely recommend it to people new to the genre and more intermediate players. The game runs stable and I have not encountered any bugs.\n\nA good way to improve this game would be to add more content and/or a story mode single player. It's very promising start though to an early access game.\n\nThanks for reading and if there is anything I could add please do let me know.","November 9, 2015","true","0.6"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","21","28","3","0"

When I played this game and I am glad I played this game, it’s getting me hooked to the strategy genre. The game is a combination of turn based strategy, and chess. Having not played most strategy games I had a blast with this game. You can play with AI or play online with random people or invite your friends to play with you online. Furthermore you can even play locally with friends with the turn by turn system.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game looks good and the top down view gives plenty of details and the texture quality seems to be nice as well. There are presets of graphics on this game so even if you are playing on a very old PC you can crank the settings down and play. Other than that there’s the usual resolution adjustment, post processing filter of some sort (looks like motion blur to me) and a couple of other options like use regular windows cursor instead of the games’ one.\n\nSound:\n\nThe music in this game is very good and the tutorial is voice acted and surprisingly good voice acting at that. I have no problems with the music I can listen to it all day long.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou can play the strategy game by yourself with the AI, there’s 3 levels of AI. Easy, medium and hard. You can play online with random people within your skill level or you can play with friends (online and local). When you beat someone you get points and as you get points you unlock styles/designs for your shield which is like your custom avatar. I think this game is very underrated as I had a blast playing. It has one of those Steam notification systems where steam will send you a notification when it’s your time to move so I think that’s a neat feature as you can also minimize the game and do something else in the meanwhile.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll in all this is a very fun game and I highly recommend it if you like chess and strategy games.Price is reasonable too and if you want it even cheaper wait for a sale.","April 26","true","1.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

In a game will you found 3 game modes: single player, local player vs player game and the multiplayer.\n\nThe single player is enough poor at the moment, you can choose from 3 difficulties. The real game start when you go to the multiplayer, this is more enjoyable play with real people than AI, however at the moment sometimes you should wait a bit long, because not to much people have this game. In a game you have 6 different units. One general and others(axeman, swordsman, knight, crossbowman, longbowman). Both opponents have instantly one general and in order can chose 1-1 different unit from randomly available amount . When a battle start both opponents have 10 units what they chosen. In your tour you choose for your all unit an action, all units have different stats and move point.\n\nAfter all battles you can earn points, points allow you reach higher rank, this add for you next title near a name and new designee elements to your crest.\n\nThe graphic is looks nice. Game sounds and music also nice.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+Leaderboards\n+Steam achievements\n+Quick battles\n+Nice graphic and music\n\n-A bit week single player\n-Not to much players at the moment\n\nIf you like strategy games, especially turn based you should try out this one, the price is good for it and i think worth it. Yes a game have some weaknesses, but i think the developers shortly fix it.\n\n8/10","January 22","true","2.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","1"

It combines elements of chess, tabletop wargaming, and turn-based strategy all in the span of about 15 minutes per game session.\n\nIf this was a tabletop board game it would probably be called a "beer and pretzels" game, meaning that it can be easily understood and played even by casual strategy gamers. This is not meant as a slight because this game was designed with a good learning curve.\nI feel like people who play chess or similar games will quickly pick up on the unit mechanics.Each unit employed gets a certain number of hit points, attack and defend values, and movement points. Two ranged units-Longbowmen and Crossbowmen-can attack up to 3 hexes away without entering melee. This can be crucial when maneuvering them because often a single hit from a melee fighter can kill them. The three types of melee units:Swordsmen, Axemen, and Knights are well-balanced.Finally both sides have a General, the most powerful unit on the board whose death means a loss of 1 hit point from all other allied units unless it would kill them.That reminds me of Warhammer rules for morale loss.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects is how you "draft" these units. At the start of each battle the Random Number Generator selects how many of each unit type will be available and then the 2 players take turns deciding which units they want until all are on the board, 10 vs 10. I was pleased to see that it is possible to win no matter which units you end up with, although of course individual players will likely refine their tactical style.\n\nThere are achievements and a reward system, in this case several ranks from Lord/Lady to King/Queen. There is also a "Heraldry" system and while it may not get as complex as "Argent, two bars and in chief three gad-flies sable" as you gain Glory you will be able to unlock more designs for your coat-of-arms.\n\n\nI was only able to test the AI version of this game because there just aren't apparently very many people playing it which is a shame.It's a charming little strategy fix for people who don't have a lot of time. I would recommend the developer do 3 things:\n1.Add more units to the ones available, this would help greatly with making the Single-Player battles more varied.\n2.Team with a Bundle site like Humble, Indiegala, or Bundlestars to get this game out to more people.\n3.Consider a "Best 2 out of 3, 3 out 5, etc" game mode for SP and MP.","April 9","true","1.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

This means that if you are in range to attack a unit, and the enemy decides to move one space away, then you will essentially waste your turn. I feel like the game would improve a tad if there was a movement phase, and then a combat phase.\n- I felt the draft mechanic was a bit strange, essentially units are randomized at the beginning of each game and then you get to take turns picking which units you want which makes both sides have slightly different units.","April 17","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingIsaacLinksr/recommended/386350/","KingIsaacLinksr","KingIsaacLinksr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingIsaacLinksr/","386 products in account","A Paladin’s Steam Review: Rise: Battle Lines. There's Something Lacking About These Battle Lines.Genre: Simultaneous Fantasy Turn Based Strategy Multiplayer Only.\nDeveloped & Published by: The Secret Games Company & Digital Tribe.\nPlatform: Windows, Mac & Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nPress key provided free of charge by developer Read the Full & Unabridged Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nRise: Battle Lines is a streamlined simultaneous turn based strategy title. It’s gimmick is about providing quick 15 minute strategy battles between you and other human opponents. Each player sets out the moves their collection of units will take in a turn and then the game plays them out at the same time. The resulting carnage will be decided on the actions taken. There is only a single mode to play in this game. It’s a mode that takes place on a large hexagon board where two armies battle it out for supremacy. The last unit standing, doesn’t matter which, wins the game. Compared to most turn based strategy games, Rise goes for a lighter, more focused experience. Every unit only has a couple of flat stats which create their speciality. You can fight against the AI or another friend in real time or “by email”. Winning or losing affects your your heraldry points regardless of who your opponent which grants you unlocks for your shield and allows the game to match you against more appropriate opponents, in theory. So, let’s talk about the strategy component of Rise.\n\nStrategy Exploration\nRise is about positioning and attacking units at the right time. If you move on an enemy and do a significant amount of damage or kill some units before losing your own, you may very well end up winning the game. This game can be distilled down to two armies bashing each other until one side or the other eventually hits a tipping point. Once this tipping point is past, the game is basically over because the losing team can’t do enough damage to finish the remaining units off. The tipping point is going to be different because there’s a variation on what units you can choose from but it’s always there and I almost want to say losing even a couple of units early on is enough to secure your defeat. It’s hard to say for certain just how devastating losing units is because I wasn’t able to play against a variety of opponents to see how things would work out. But the time I did spend seemed to indicate that this is the case. It’s not helped by the AI.\n\nSee, this is my main issue with Rise: Battle Lines. There’s a lack of variety to really change things up. Units do the same thing every time and there are very few to choose from. So, while the game attempts to change things up by randomly generating how many of each class will be available, the limited amount of said classes generally guarantee that both sides will get at least one of the units they desire. This isn’t always the case, I did have a couple of battles where an entire class didn’t get any generated. But it doesn’t happen that often and I found it didn’t really change the pace of the battle. Said pace is ultimately having two armies mashing and grinding into each other until one falls. The battlefield is too small to really add any real flexibility in how armies move around. There aren’t any randomly generated obstacles or AOE abilities to change things up. Once a battle is decided, there are few ways to truly recover from it.\n\nAs such, it leads to a very repetitive experience with each battle. We could talk about how there’s some nuance with the simultaneous turns or the classes but it doesn’t really matter when we have a map like Rise: Battle Lines has. It’s a straightforward board that basically encourages the two armies to smash into each other until one side falls over. Doing anything else isn’t encouraged unless you fight against different opponents and even then the differences are very minor.\n\nThe Multiplayer Experience\nBefore I start, Rise: Battle Lines has a small character limitation for the player’s name. (I could only fit KingLinksr). I really wish games would quit having that limitation. Functionally, the multiplayer of Rise seems to work well without any problems. I was able to get into random ladder matches fine and setup games with other players without trouble. Though the loading times to get into these matches was on the long side.But, there’s the elephant in the room. The game doesn’t have a multiplayer community. I was able to get some random player matches while it was in early access and then fully released. However, those players quickly quit playing, myself included. The average playing stats on Steam doesn’t paint a rosey picture either. The only reason to get Rise: Battle Lines now is to fight against the AI or friends. And really, the game is only worth getting against human opponents due to the aforementioned problems with the AI. The only time I lost was against a particularly experienced player. For the time being, I don’t see the multiplayer experiencing changing any time soon.\n\nPC Settings and Audio/Visual\nRise has a very simple settings screen for a Unity-engine title. Resolution settings only include native resolution and a couple of other resolutions. I don’t know why it limits them. On my 16:9 monitor I only get 1920x1080 and 1600x900. On my 16:10 monitor, I only got three resolutions including 1680x1050. It’s a curious and unnecessary limitation. There’s a graphic quality slider that goes from very low to very high. This isn’t a performance demanding game though so very high is what you’ll likely use. It also has a Tilt Shift slider. I guess it’s so you won’t be distracted by the area outside the battlefield? It’s inclusion is a little baffling. All other graphical options aren’t included as it doesn’t seem to use them. Yes, this means no AA included and there are jagged lines everywhere. Fullscreen and custom cursor can be turned on or off. Audio settings include SFX and Music volume which is nice. The game does run well and I never ran into crashes. Though I noticed that alt-tabbing out of the game caused the GPU to start running hard. The UI is functional but doesn’t really take advantage of the screen like it should with its small windows and tons of scrolling in the help menus.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI can confirm that the features listed on the store page are here in the game. I can confirm that it’s a fifteen minute streamlined strategy experience with some minutiae that might make things interesting for a short while. But this game isn’t fun to play because there's just not much content or interesting strategies to experience. I got the sense pretty quickly that I’ve seen everything that’s possible. Outside of the minutiae in stats and turn-by-turn tactics, each battle is largely going to be the same. Send units forward, to the sides, wait for the “right time” and strike until one side is decided the victor. It’s a title that simply needs more variety in maps, units or something to keep players coming back to it. Games like these generally have some hook and I don't feel it. I was really surprised it left Early Access as quickly as it did but the result of which shows. The multiplayer community is extremely small, the Heraldry system is a lacking reward for winning battles and a few strategies can be used to easily win against the AI. It’s a concept that remains woefully underdeveloped. As such, Rise doesn’t get a recommendation from me.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","January 30","false","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This mechanic has a lot of potential and makes you think more about what you think your opponent is going to do rather than what you want to do on your turn.\n\nRise: Battle Lines also thrives on being simple to learn and quick to play. You can learn the game in minutes and you can finish a match in 10-15 minutes. If you are looking for a highly strategic game you are going to be disappointed. If you are looking for a quick pick up and play game that has just enough strategy I think you could have some fun with Rise: Battle Lines.\n\nI do have two issues with Rise: Battle Lines though.\n\nFirst I wish the game had some more variety. The game only has six different types of units and I kind of wish the game would add a couple more. With only six different types of units I think the game could get repetitive kind of quickly. After extended plays it might feel like you are fighting the same battles over and over again.\n\nSecond I wish there was a little more strategy and a little less guessing in the game. Being able to guess what the other player is going to do on their turn seems to be the most important thing in Rise: Battle Lines. If you guess well you are much more likely to beat your opponent rather than having a good strategy.\n\nOverall Rise: Battle Lines has the foundation to be a good game. If the game can add a little more variety it could be a good game.

The random pieces draw also keep this interesting as you don't always get the pieces for your main strat and have to adapt to keep ahead of your opponent. Also one of the main things that drew me to this game is that both players get to choose their moves at the same time, so games are a lot quicker than with most turn based strategies like Civ.\n\nThe game is still early access so I know more features will be coming.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/386350/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Rise: Battle Lines is a hex-based (largely) multiplayer based battle strategy game. Sure, it’s not the most unique idea but it’s a very well developed game that fills a niche quite nicely.\n\nPlay the tutorial: Even having played other games of a similar nature I was thankful that I played through the quick tutorial. Rise is a very simple game to learn to play once you’ve gotten the basics down but you will want those basics before you throw yourself in from the deep end. I must say that with the amount of strategy involved there’s going to be a ton of mid and end game strategies to learn that will give the game the depth that it needs to thrive.\n\nReward system: The game incorporates a rewards system. The system enables you to unlock different designs and things to make your crest better, etc. However, I have to agree with other players who believe that it needs to be tweaked. It doesn’t feel rewarding enough. If it is expanded it could ultimately become one of the tools that gets more people playing.\n\nPoor single player mode: I would advise against purchasing this for a single-player mode. While it does contain three computer AI opponents you’re going to be disappointed. The game was made to thrive as a multiplayer game. I believe that the single-player mode was included in the game to satisfy a need rather than to serve a purpose. It’s a good tutorial system (above the standard tutorial) but to get the most out of the game you’re going to want to play multiplayer.\n\nTwo multiplayer modes: To ensure that Rise: Battle Lines wasn’t just another dead on arrival multiplayer game the devs included what is essentially known as a ‘play by mail’ system. You can start a game with a friend and when it’s not your turn you do not need to be in the game. When your opponent plays their turn you will get a little notice outside of the game telling you that it is your turn. Although this system has been used for years in other games it was a very good decision to include the system in the game.\n\nIn summary, Rise: Battle Lines is a very well made hex-based battle strategy game that thrives with its multiplayer. Recommended for strategy buffs and their friends.\n\nFor reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 20","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Ive grown up with the mean games you could find on the NES/SNES and similar ones. But Ive seldomly felt as lost as when Ive clicked "issue orders" in this game. This game is just really really random and it makes you feel really bad about the choices you make because theres very little to know about what happens at what time and why.\nWhat the game taught me that I couldn't have explained to myself:\n- all of your units lose 1 hitpoint if your general dies\n- Attacking units deal more damage than defending units\n\nWhat the game taught me that I couldve explained to myself:\n- units have different place in the row (something like initiative)\n- units have hitpoints\n- units have more initiative closer to the general\n\nWhat it didnt tell me:\n- how close to the general do they have to be?\n- can you tell units to walk here and attack there? If not why do the crossbowmen say cannot attack after moving and the bowmen say cannot move after attacking? Like what the hell? Is that a joke?\n- how do you know whether your archer can do something before his archer? Is it just random? Sounds fun.\n\nAnd the biggest question of all - Why cant I give my units orders after one another? I cannot react to anything. Its the second unity made game with this weird restriction of giving orders pre-everything and I have no idea why. Its not fun all it does is make it random. Sure you can try to read what your opponent will do but he can counteract it by doing something differently. It all ends up being random.\n\nEspecially if you add in the fact that units of the same type seemingly randomly attack after one another, which can easily determine win and loss seeing that attackers deal more damage.\n\nOverall I wanted some strategic game to play every once in a while but it looks like a mess to me. Sure if you can chew through it, maybe theres depth that will forever be lost on me. But Id rather get my refund through while I still can. It wasn't worth my 1.50 €.","April 13","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The meat of the game should be in the multiplayer, but it has been very hard for me to find opponents lately.\n\nHowever I did play several online matches, and thus far I won all of them, every time using the same strategy. This makes me wonder if there are other valid strategies as well... I also feel like some of the soldiers you can choose from are always the best choice and some are always worst.\n\nWhy a thumbs up?

Each game is fairly short (say 10 minutes) so you don't need to dedicate lots of time to each session.\n\nIt is an interesting mix-up between chess with a timer, choosing troops, estimating how each troop is going to last, the randomness of your events panning out at the same time as your opponents, and so on.\n\nIt's deeper than it appears from the fairly simple playing board. As each of your troops moves, so does the opponents. This makes it very different from chess, although the same type of thought processes are needed to outwit your opponent's decisions and come out on top.\n\nIt's early-access, so I'd expect there to be further polish and improvements coming soon. Even so, after the recent updates (early November 2015) it is playing well.\n\nThe prospect of getting to the top of the leaderboard, and also showing off your self-designed coat of arms is quite fun. Also, the fact that you can select your friends for personal sessions of combat is cool too.\n\nRecommended!","March 28","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
