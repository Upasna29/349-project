"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/392690/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nErwin’s Timewarp is an adventure game. You play as the pet dog of some scientist who built a time machine and sent you to the past, and you’re tasked with finding various pieces of this machine in order to return to the present.\n\nStarting the game you’re able to put it in various resolutions of window mode, and you can also choose to play at full screen; this is something I usually really appreciate as I don’t always like to play certain games in full screen. However, there’s little else in the form of proper menu and options. The only sounds to be found in the game at its current stage were also only in this menu, and unfortunately, the music was completely awful to me. I could not click out of the menu fast enough.\n\nVisually the game is kind of cartoony. It’s relatively good looking and the textures are nice, as well as the details on the areas; for an indie unity game in 3D/top-down/isometric view it ran surprisingly well on my computer, so kudos to the dev for that accomplishment. I usually have a lot of optimization issues with indie games on unity.\n\nAs I mentioned before, there’s little in the way of sounds or music outside the menu, and that is almost a blessing considering my dislike for the meny music.\n\nYou’re also tossed into the game with little in the form of tutorial, explanation, or back story. In fact you’re only told a couple times about what’s going on and what you’re supposed to do and find. If you didn’t read the description on the steam page, you’d have no idea what you’re supposed to do until you encounter that alien – which btw, I’m still wondering why there’s an alien there.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to follow on what you need to get in order to do what, but the way of interacting with things is a bit uncomfortable. Sometimes objects will highlight but not pop up hints, the icons offered as menu aren’t clear on what they do until you click them and find out, and they won’t appear until you’re in some particular range and angle from the item. Still, the rest of the controls (mostly movement wise) are fairly good despite this.\n\nWhat makes the game a bit harder is that you have to spend quite a bit of time trying to figure out what to do at the start, and you CAN die (and you can save, too, so be sure to save): some characters will hurt you, and you must also keep yourself fed through the game, which I guess is an interesting twist for an adventure/puzzle game, but frankly I’m still unsure if it works.\n\nThe character animations for the dog and companions are fairly good, but the human animations leave much to be desired. There were also some bugs in which, for instance, you’d get stuck against certain things.\n\nAll in all it seems like an ok game, and I can see some potential in it which is why I would recommend to keep a watch on it if it sounds interesting; but it really needs a proper introduction and a brief tutorial. I understand Early Access is expected to not be completely functional, but there’s “we’re still testing out things”  and then there’s “this shouldn’t really be open for sale and/or the public as a whole yet”.\n\nIf you like adventure games and want to support the dev, I’d recommend it, it’s an ok game with what it has so far. I can see potential in it, but currently it’s not something I’d recommend to just about everyone.\n\nI'll keep a watch and might change my rating once the game is further fleshed out.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\n* Key provided by the developer\n\nFollow Completing the Backlog's Curator page for more reviews.\n","November 27, 2015","false","2.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

No cutscene, or text box. It's a bit disorienting, and I found myself quite lost, although after fidgeting around for a few minutes you figure out what you're meant to do.\nYou can interact with objects if you get close enough. Although this interaction isn't very reliable. Sometimes you need to get the correct angle and distance, and will need to twitch around until you get it right. Once you've found the position, a small menu pops up with a few interaction options. These all do nothing to really explain what exactly they do. Trial and error is the only way to find out.\n\nAfter putting an object in your inventory, you'll most likely need to use it later on by interacting with something or someone. Most of the game consist of walking around relatively similar looking areas, with little variety in gameplay.\n\nThe graphics are decent. I like the slight mix between realistic and cartoony styled characters. They have goofy proportions, while their textures are decently realistic.\nThe absence of sounds and music in-game is a bit annoying. It adds to the generally unfinished feel of the game.\n\nOverall, I felt like the game got stale pretty quickly. The lack of tutorial or help hurts your inital impression of the game, and after you figure it all out, there's little content to keep you gripped. I hope this improves in the future, considering it's in Early Access. However, I can't recommend it in its current state.","December 23, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Erwin's Timewarp is currently in Early Access and is a cute puzzle game where you play as a dog named Erwin who has gone back in time. In the current level available for the game, the year is 1984. You roam around collecting items which will help you solve puzzles and meet your alien sidekick Herbert. There is no hand holding in this game, you have to explore and find everything on your own. Erwin has a hunger meter and in this level there are plenty of food bowls around to keep his meter from running out. Graphicly the game looks pretty good with nice textures and detail. The controls are responsive and smooth, I wish it had full controller support, but you can move around using one, so maybe full controller support is in the works. This game has a lot of potential and I anxiously await the full release.","September 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The game is currently in Early Access and right now you can play in 1984. You roam around collecting items which will help you solve puzzles. One example is having to lure a police officer away so you can climb stairs on top of a building. If you have found the correct items, you can light a fire causing the police officer to investigate and allowing you to reach that otherwise inaccessable area.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand. You will have to explore and find everything on your own. This is not a bad thing at all as it makes each puzzle more satisfying when you complete them. I have come across no bugs at all and the game runs very smoothly.\n\nI am impressed with the attention to detail of items throughout the level. (The sand pit looks great). I hope this level of attention to detail continues in all future levels.\n\nInstead of having a timer counting down, you have a hunger meter which counts down. There are food bowls scattered around which will refill this meter. I thought this was much better than having a generic clock ticking down and it made me feel a lot less rushed having this system in place.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and I look forward to playing future levels as they are released. If you are interested in puzzle games then this is one that should satisfy.","September 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

You have also been sent a companion named Herbert who is there to help you do so.\n\nGameplay- A lot of the game consists of walking around, searching for items and solving puzzles. Most of the placed items feels a bit... out there. As in, a bomb just casually placed in a box? (This isn't a huge issue.) You also have a hunger bar which basically acts as a timer. You can try to refill this bar by eating bowls of food scattered around. Sometimes NPCs can struggle trying to follow you around and there are a few bugs, mainly with getting caught in things. Currently there is a bit of a lack in content as this game is early access, but it seems to have potential.\n\nControls- Controls are nice and simple.\n\nGraphics- Visually the game is pleasant and there is a lot of attention to detail. If you just take a look at the screenshots you can see how graphicly there has been a lot of effort put in.\n\nMusic & sounds- There is no background music and I think that is something games like these really require. The sounds are also quite poor.\n\nTrading Cards- The game has been updated with trading cards which is definately a positive.\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Game is enjoyable\n✔ Visually appealing\n✔ Controls are easy\n✔ Trading cards\n✔ Lots of detail\n\nCons\n✘ A little bit of mindless placing of objects\n✘ No music and poor sounds\n✘ Some Bugs\n\nConclusion\nErwin's Timewarp is an enjoyable game that is lacking in some areas. The game does seem to have a lot of potential so I will be looking forward to playing it when new features are added. For the time being my rating will stay as it is until further updates.\n\n6.5/10","October 31, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"
