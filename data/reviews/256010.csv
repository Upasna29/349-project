If anything, this half-finished game will make them bawl their eyes out.\n\nThe devs didn't deliver on many of their promises for the game, and it shows in the lack of features and game world interactions. Painfully minimal, there's no more banter between mercs, NPCs are jokes or avatars of backers who serve no real purpose in the game world, other than as glorified interactive credits. They barely got working merchants into the game, post release.\n\nDon't buy this game. I backed it, and regret the decision. After Full Control's insolvency and dissolution, there's no further support from developers, no further hope of getting a finished game and have the myriad of bugs fixed and promised features implemented.\n\nThe game will forever remain a half-finished, misspelled love letter to the franchise.","March 28, 2015","false","5.5"," 182 of 195 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","182","195","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukecoke/recommended/256010/","nukecoke","Poppel Surströmming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukecoke/","13 products in account","Jagged Alliance: LOST CONTROL - A game made by FULL CONTROL.\n\nShort version: This game is a big disappointment.\n\nI had a bad feeling about the game when I watched the videos of the Alpha version, then I thought, well the game was still pretty far from finish maybe things would turn out to be better (and it came out yesterday).\n\nCombat:\nDespite the plastic 3D-models and UI designed by some "Hello world!" level programmer, the tactical part of the game is not there at all. It plays like a cheap clone of XCOM with that half-shield/full-shield mark when you take cover but note that you can't do any smart shooting behind an object. The object just block both line of fire and line of sight of yours and enemies'.  The whole combat part is to play the "move from a cover to another cover" thing. Enemy duck down, you crawl down, stand up, move a bit, duck down, blah blah blah. I cleared the 1st town with only my IMP merc and not got shot once (default difficulty). I would be grinded to meat pieces if it's a similar situation in JA2.\n\nOne funny thing is that enemies tends to rush to your face and not doing anything, I assume they don't plan their AP very well? Remember how you get beaten up by the melee/sprayer enemies in JA2? It's not likely to happen in this game unless you are very very reckless and do nothing when enemies come to you. After you hit them, they sometimes stand in the open ground and do not move. Sometimes they run back and forth a bit. Sometimes it says "Panic" and the wounded enemy run to some random directions. So they behaved like Kamikaze-commandos then suddenly became cowards? Do they have a political commissar kicking their ♥♥♥ but has a limited area of effects?\n\nSometimes I just rush with all team members when there are few enemies left (remember how cautious you were when getting the last rats in every battle in JA2?), because getting hit is not that lethal at all, since you heal even faster than Wolverine in X-Men. Btw: Sometimes you can have >100% chance of hit. How is that possible?  During battles, sometimes when you change the direction your merc is facing, you quit the combat mode, and it says ENEMY CONTACT LOST. It's really confusing.\n\nEnemy will attack the land you occupied very quickly. Once they sent the troops and headed to my land, so I send my team to chase after them. They took down the millitias I trained, I felt so bad about it and I wanted to avenge them. There were at least 10 enemies in their troops so I was preparing for a bad fight. Then, after they took the last pieces of my land, they vanished from the map!!! I felt like a dog chasing a vanishing sausage.\n\nThere were some people on the Steam community posting posts to tell how they like the combat and how thrilling it is. I did give the game a second try due to those positive comments, I tried to enjoy the combat, but I failed.  I also saw some posts regarding the postive comments of the combat:\n\n[Quoted from Steam Community]\n\nOriginally posted by Keyboard Cowboy:\n..It sounds like you guys are playing a completely different game than I am... o.O\nOhh well... :o\n\nOriginally posted by SoulsandBlood:\n..Seems like we are playing a different version.My AI is as dumb as dirt.\n\n[/quoted from steam community]\n\nMaybe I got a wrong link of the download of the game, too?\n\nScripts & story:\nYou start with receiving some mysterious radio distress from someone and you must kill some evil Prince who is rich and bad. The whole intro feels pale and vague. The scripts of the game were written by some guys who thinks he/she is humorous but there were no humor at all. It doesn't stop mentionning Lynx banging Buzz, or Ivan drinking vodka while loading the game, trying desperately to hook up with old fans of JA series. Not a nice trying I'd say. Even in the very beginning of the game, in the IMP text, I saw they spelled "rathar than" as "rather then". Ye, English is not my 1st language either.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nShort version: It's cramped.\n\nYou can't interact with most part of the world. I didn't figure out how to jump over a short wall or fence, or jump on the roofs of houses. You can't shoot dead bodies or break a window or open/close a door. Full Control promised many things in the begninning. You can check them here:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2079547763/jagged-alliance-flashback\n\nDid they have the things they promised in the final game? Ok let's check with "Destructible Environments" first since it's the update1:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2079547763/jagged-alliance-flashback/posts/462594\n\nI tried throwing grenades to various things, including wooden barrels, wooden fences, walls, sofas, tires, rocks, sandbags, cows and pigs.... and nothing got destroyed. The only thing I destroyed with grenades is a huge sun umbrella, it looks like the one in the main title screen.\n\nOther things:\nThere are lots of animals roaming around on the island. I mean LOTS of, cow, sheeps, pigs, chickens, birds..it feels like an island version of Mongolia. Why do people fight when they are so rich?  Don't the evil Prince have feasts with his pawns? Are they all vegans?  I tried to kill the cows in the game, but found out that you can't. Even grenade can't kill a pig or a chicken. Not to mention that I want to boost up my strength by punching them! However, you can use the bodies of cows or pigs as cover! Try to lean your body on a pig in real life, please. And don't do it in front of your neighbours.\n\nYou can stand in fires and not get burnt.\n\nYou can't loot the civillian houses, because in 1988 people were as poor as ♥♥♥♥, there are nothing in their houses. Only in one or two houses out of 20 you can find a case containing some loots. Most NPCs are filled with random taglines, like "Hola" "Can I touch you?". Why the heck you want to touch me?? Also there are side missions like "Please sleep with my wife so I can work". Hmmm, the island dwellers are really friendly aren't they? One thing is really annoying, you must face the directions of the NPCs to see them. No, standing around them is not enough. The town people duck down when you fight your enemies and refuse to talk to you. They don't really need to, because they are as invincible as the animals, but you can't use their bodies as covers.\n\nMercs:\nI hired Buzz and she has less than 10 taglines, and she sounded like a buffalo with a cold. Then I hired Lynx, thought maybe he would spice things up a bit. But nothing happens. Where is the banging part they mentioned before??  They don't even talk to each other!  Later I learned that merc Vicky Waters from JA&JA2 is a farmer's daughter. Is that Fallout-looking wrecked car shell in the northern farm supposed to be a 1964 Chevy? It doesn't look like one. Later I saw the Danish girl Monica "Buns" Sondergaard, yes the annoying kindergarten teacher (but I like her) being some local gangster's body guard. I thought she was 12 years old in 1988?\n\nBtw: when you hire someone by calling them, they appear in front of you right after. Are they paratroopers already? Or are they waiting on some satelite and got beamed down to you?\n\nWhen you talk to recruit-able NPCs, you can ask telephone numbers so you can recruit them later. Then the NPCs vanish in front of you!!! What the heck is that? I want to master that skill too, so I can FLASH to the BACK of the evil Princes and a**l them with the tampon-looking bandage!\n\nOn the Steam community people say things like, oh they are a small studio and they lacked money. You know, they missed the cheapeast things to add in this game, the highest value for money things in this game --- All the interesting details that exist in JA2, and they somehow promised to create them in this game.\n\nI donated 25USD because it lit up my hope to see a better new JA game. I'm going back to JA2 now.","October 23, 2014","false","6.3"," 404 of 491 people (82%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","82","404","491","29","15"

If you're a fan of any type of tactical turn-based games - avoid it!\n\nLong one:\n\nYeah, i'm a long time fan of Jagged Alliance games like many others around the world. I don't regret that i was a backer during KS campaign, it was my choice and i was fully conscious about what i was doing. I only regret the final result of this project.\n\nI really don't want to write a book about gameplay, so i will focus on advantages and disadavtages of this game. Here we go:\n\nPros:\n\n- Graphics, you can love it or hate it, but i think that graphical style that was taken was a good choice.\n\n- Fighting, well, sometimes fight is annoying, but sometimes it can be fun.\n\n- Music, not bad.\n\n- The game is clearly described, you can easily sense what is it all about\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics, style is ok, but there are too little details and 3D characters have jest few polygons.\n\n- Sound, i don't mind soundtrack, but sometimes sounds in the inventory are too loud and overdriven.\n\n- Just one save slot!\n\n- Very small quantity of stuff thrown around, so there is no sense in wandering on a map, there are only few containers in which you can find some loot.\n\n- Can't open/close the doors!\n\n- There are no second floors, and you can't go on the roofs!\n\n- There is no possibility to modify weapons!\n\n- Bugged and totally unrealistic weapons. There is no such thing like UZI in .45 caliber, there is no such thing like Thompson with 7, 10, or 15-round clip. Sometimes I had action points, proper ammo and just can't reload the weapon.\n\n- Can't see bloody thing during the rain/storm.\n\n- Pathfinding is totally broken. You can click on a single and simple part of the ground and some of your merc will choose the most complicated and longest possible way to get there (and some of them will probably stay just where they are).\n\n- User interface is not well designed, you can easily click on a random place and accidentally move your merc.\n\n- AI, there are no sophisticated tactics that enemies can use, They just get closer and closer, one by one. Forget about flanking and such things.\n\n- Useless militia, you train them, they lose and so on... There is no possibility to enter combat when your militia squad is fighting.\n\n- Strange mechanics, aim shot is useless and sometimes you can embark into weird "never-ending" shootout. It looks like this: the distance between your merc and the enemy is about two squares, you have rather high hit probability and you just can't shot him no matter what. Another thing: 103, 105% hit probability? What is it? Are devs kidding us?\n\n- No noticeable mercs relationships, They're just callous puppets.\n\n- You can use cow as a cover, the cow is...armoured...\n\n- There is no, absolutely no optimalization!\n\n- What the hell "interrupt" button is doing in UI? Interrupt action should act automatically when given character have enough action points!\n\n- Illegible table of guns characteristic.\n\n- There is a shop of course (in text, not graphical form!). You can buy, but you can't sell your own stuff!\n\n- Camera angles are uncomfortable\n\n...Jesus, i have enough, there are probably quite a few things that i could mention, but this list annoyed me enough. As You see, this game has been practically deprived of the most needed functions. I don't really see sense in existing of JA-ish game which is so neutered. Just look at Silent Storm and even 7.62, or Back in Action. These games have some flaws, but this is nothing comparing to Flashback. This game is so bad that i don't see any potential in it and any chance to upgrage the main problems of it.\n\nPeople from Full Control said something like this: "KS campaign succeeded with minimum amount of money needed to create Flashback project, and that's why fans and backers will receive minimum amount of content". Pure and simple, 368k $ was practically the lowest amount of money necessary to achieve lowest stretch goals and start developing of this game. This is the point where Full Control made a huge mistake, they should never start developing this game with such a low budget. Some would say: "but minimum budget could not be lower due to low interest in community. If the amount was higher , this game would never have been created!". Exactly! Jagged Alliance: Flashback should not exist!  This is so weak and embarrassing piece of crap that only brings shame to Jagged Alliance brand.\n\nMaybe if FC had more manpower, capabilities, experience, consistent vision and skills to make things right, then they might have a chance to make a really decent game... But they hadn't and they were overwhelmed  by the task which they have chosen, They had to feed their families and stay aflout, we received a game that is poor in almost every aspect. Was it worth it? I don't think so...\n\n\nI believe that time will come and we will finally receive worthy successor of JA: 2. It doesn't matter how long i will wait, real mercs never die!;-)","November 14, 2014","false","6.7"," 218 of 282 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","218","282","5","6"

Just an JA:Online (cover-marks ("shields") even haven't been changed) with great advetrisment. Tactics?

That said, this game is a huge disappointment.\n\nThough they have progressed towards making a JA game, they have fallen FAR SHORT:\n\n-No world interaction.  You can't open doors, crates, climb onto roofs, or blow holes in walls.\n\n-The UI feels a lot worse than those of yester-year.  How is this even possible?  It seems incomplete and clunky, making even simple tasks awkward.\n\n-Character inventory is shallow.  Though they have added a "squad inventory", lack of items in the world and the randomness of enemy drops makes this a collection of junk rather than an armory.\n\n-In game engine is also clunky.  The game looks out-dated (JAZZ: Hired Guns anyone?) and plays poorly, with AI taking far too long to execute turns.  When a 2D game from 19 years ago looks more appealing, you might have failed.\n\n-Combat is lacking.  Enemies make poor decisions and don't try to flank, rushing at you and using the closest cover once in range.  Line of sight is extremely limited, making some scenarios (firing at a diagonal around the box right in front of you) a case of leaving cover to shoot at enemies who will miss you from 6 feet away.  It's honestly comical.\n\n-Lack of video options.  You can change "bulk" settings, but have to direct control over AA, V-Synch, texture quality, etc.  This seems both lazy and cheap in this day and age.\n\n-Sound design is weak.  Most sounds and music are pulled from JA2.  Again, this seems less of an homage and just a matter of frugality.\n\n-Map size is small.  This might just be an initial mis-giving, but there just isn't much there once you get into a sector.  No hidden items, no containers, limited NPCs...  Bland and empty.\n\nGive this one a wide berth until they ACTUALLY finish it.  As it is now, it has fewer features than that abortive JA: Online crap.  Play JA2, Xenonauts, XCOM, or even the UFO series instead.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n-Cover is NOT implemented well, with enemies shooting you without you being able to shoot back; in some cases, they even shoot you THROUGH walls.\n\n-Militia is a joke.  You can't fight alongside them.  It's a cheaper version of the automated combat from JA2, but far simpler and with a graphic-less UI (at least JA2 had  portraits), and the enemy is CONSTANTLY roaming in larger bands than you can train in 2 days time.  I guess this makes up for the TINY map, as you need to re-conquer sectors.\n\n-Inventory is poor, with no attachments and most enemies dropping ZERO items, despite shooting you from extreme range with assault rifles.\n\n-Combat is a complete joke, with enemies being unaffected by traumatic gunshot and grenade wounds.  Occasionally, they might "panic", but it's a die-roll and not something that makes sense.  There is no suppression system, and the AP costs are so ridiculous that you will mostly be using snap shot and not moving once combat begins.  The enemy, of course, seems to have a lot more AP than you, popping off three shots after moving when you can barely manage 2.\n\n-Wound system, continued from above, does not remove APs from injured parties, but is based on hit location, with legs removing AP, head reducing next-shot to-hit, and body just causing damage.  I was not impressed when an unarmored soldier took a .50 HP to the chest and proceeded to run up to me and punch me.  STUPID.\n\n-CTDs.  On enemy turns, the game likes to crash (look for the tell-tale change of cursor and lack of animations).  This is somewhat reminiscent of JA2 1.08, so I guess they were somewhat faithful?  Try windowed (resolution hit) and you can cut back on the level of incidence.  SESO, otherwise.\n\nThis was a regrettable waste of money AT THIS TIME.  Luckily, they did much better with Space Hulk, so give them your money for that and HOPE that they don't abandon this one in the mean-time.","October 23, 2014","false","11.7"," 164 of 219 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","164","219","2","1"

At one point, I was only playing just for the tactical combat, which is a sad thing because as any JA fan knows, the game was about much, much more.\n\nWhere the original franchise shone (JA, JA2, Deadly Games) was the attention to detail, the amazing voice acting and characterizations, the humor, strategic depth, the fact that all the mercs and NPCs felt "alive". It felt like you were in an interactive movie, not playing the game.\n\nI logged hundreds of hours playing the original JA series, and I didn't want it to end! Sadly, I couldn't wait to finish this one...\n\n(updated 25 June: since i realized some readers may want to know why)\n\nPros:\n\nNot many. Tactical combat is acceptable. Weapons appear to be realistic and follow physics models when deciding outcomes. The battles made the game bearable.\n\nCons:\n\nVoice acting nowhere close to the original JA series. Characters feel empty and 2-dimensional. NPCs could be developed more.\n\nStoryline was blah. I guess they did the best they could with a couple of twists here and there. Anyone remember a company called Sir-Tech and how they developed stories??\n\nNeutral on graphics, etc. They don't impress me that much for this type of game anyway, which is driven by other things.\n\nLacking overall strategic depth. Apart from the tactical battles, the strategic management aspect of the game is pretty mild to non-existent. In the original JA, you could commandeer vehicles, travel by chopper, meet strange NPCs at random, etc. On this strategic map you can... train guards... oh wait...we do that already...\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you're REALLY REALLY curious and the game is on sale, pick it up and give it a test drive, otherwise don't bother. Hopefully some other devs can pick up the JA franchise and give it the attention that it (and the fans) deserve.\n\n4.0/10","June 16, 2015","false","49.8"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","49","55","0","1"

The fact is that fans of the series were hoping for a new installment in the beloved series which would harken back to the good old days of a stubborn Fidel, broken-language Ivan, cheerfully deadly Scully and mysterious and powerful Magic.\n\nThose characters are present, along with much of the classic cast. The problem is not the characters, but alas, Jagged Alliance is about much more. I played Jagged Alliance upon it's release, and Jagged Alliance 2 years later. Sir-Tech's vision of a modern mercenary group in an XCOM style of gameplay was brilliant, and I didn't even discover XCOM until much later.\n\nFlashback, however, offers none of the strategic delights of roaming a jungle and hiding behind trees, glimpsing enemies for a moment before they fade out and flank you, or sneaking around buildings to approach enemies stealthily and take them out. You move your units in a turn-based manner, you equip them with various weapons and gear you find or purchase in your travels, but that is where the similarities end.\n\nTactical combat is a joke, with a poorly designed interrupt system which rarely triggers despite having an experienced teamate facing the enemy around a blind corner. ranges are ridiculous, and weapons fall off to a 0% chance to hit at such a short range that early combat takes place within 4 squares by necessity, and marksmen with an 85% score rarely have above a 60% chance to hit a center-body shot even at that range.\n\nThe result is a grindy slugfest wherein utilizing good tactics for cover and concealment and positioning and intersecting fields of fire fails to draw out enemy mercenaries into makeshift kill-zones and enable your team to kill them with minor injuries. Perhaps this was intentional, but for me... the tactical advantages gained by good positioning and approach techniques were a big part of the game. Sadly, this is not the only shortcoming Flashback exhibits.\n\nThe sectors are largely empty. Gone are the days of finding secret crates stashed back in a corner of a sector, looting it and finding that much-needed lockpick or ammunition of flak vest. Perhaps they have populated some key sectors with these things, but in the four starting areas there's not so much as a single crate to be found - and believe me, I scoured the zones. So while they have filled the zones will all kinds of terrain features to fill up the squares, there is nothing to interact with to make exploring sectors and looting buildings in any way interesting, which was a huge part of the JA series experience.\n\nThe UI is clunky and unintuitive, and it fails to offer some of the more interesting dynamic features of JA2 - that is, line of sight cones and rooftop access. The diversity of available weapons - which has no option to raise or lower - simply makes the entire game more difficult, decreasing the likelihood that you will find weapons or ammunition on enemy corpses which match those your party is using. The dialogue screen is almost identical to JA2, which is not a compliment - dialogue was one of JA2's weak points - but falls short of even that in failing to provide more than a very simple and linear dialogue. Where at least JA2 gave certain mood-flavors to your responses, Flashback offers only prewritten script which fails to cover any reasonable range of optional responses.\n\nThe English is bad. I realize this is an overseas company who bought the IP, but really... the English is bad, in a finished game product which is supposed to be the professional and legitimate successor to a great franchise. Grammar is where the main mistakes are, but the mistakes are grating when you consider you're paying for a professional product. Using "is" instead of "are" and "them" instead of "it" where appropriate may seem a petty criticism, but my eyes get crossed and I have to reread the already-boring dialogue because somebody didn't do a decent proof-read of their script before release, and it's annoying. Some may not care, but it's still worth noting in a list of the shortfalls of the product.\n\nThere are glitches. Sadly, this is to be expected of most modern games, and I won't detail them. They are numerous, but the ones I discovered are relatively minor and akin to what you will find in most games shortly after release.\n\nOverall it seems the company was looking to make a quick buck on a popular franchise, released a comic-sketch version of the mature and gritty mercenary game, and decided to call it a day. I wonder if the designers ever played the games, because some of the basic features left out were core to the overalal JA experience. For my money, this game wasn't worth it. As always, YMMV, but as a long-time fan of the series, I can't recommend this joke.","October 27, 2014","false","1.8"," 110 of 156 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","110","156","2","0"

After an hour or two, I've had enough.\n\nThe problem is, it's shallow.  I just see so many features missing or glazed over.  At least with 'Back in Action', the game had a pretty robust combat system that innovated on the original .. if JaBia had delivered on it's promise to bring over the personality and substance of the original JA2, and bring with it the new combat, it would have been awesome, instead of a disappointment.\n\nFlashback - well, it's even worse, I'm afraid.  It has fewer features than JaBia, the combat is dull, the AI is pretty much utterly stupid (sorry, to be specific .. you can be shooting at the AI and it will run past you and stand to it's back with you so you and your buddies can kill it).\n\nIt has promise, and I really would be interested to play this game with another 6 months of rich development, but my feeling is that the people making it have exhausted all the upfront kickstarter money, and rather than grow a set of gonads and spend their own time and money perfecting the product - to yield the ultimate financial and reputation rewards of creating a wonderful, memorable game - they just launched early and incomplete.\n\nAnimations are absent .. like, taking cover seems to be just .. standing there.. there is no corresponding action from the merc (at least that I can tell??) that they've taken cover.. nor can I see any easily accessible stat/graphic/icon or anything that tells me that they are actually in cover ..\n\nIt's just .. weak.\n\nIt's a weak, disappointing title, and I have buyers remorse.\n\nI regret buying it, and I actually don't give a flying poo-poo about twenty bucks .. I regret buying it because by doing so I'm supporting an outcome that I find increasingly unacceptable in the gaming world - releasing unpolished, feature incomplete, over-promise-under-deliver titles.\n\nI'd recommend you steer away from this game if you are considering buying it, at least in it's present form as at 25 October 2014.\n\nUPDATE:  As at 7 February 2015, I've had a second look and injected some more time into the game (apparently, according to the defenders of the game - some vested modders from "the Bear Pit", you have to have a minimum of 3 hours gameplay to have a valid opinion .... although I can tell if a game sucks pretty much right away, and you'd have to be mental to hack away at something that sucks just to confirm it doesnt suck, right?).  Anyway just to update, several months (and a few patches) later, the game is still quite awful .. it's boring, feature incomplete, poor AI, and as they fix other bugs, they apparently create new ones, like all the females for some reason now like to crawl around on their stomachs... if you're thinking about buying this game - think twice - you can get a lot more bang for your gaming buck elsewhere.","October 24, 2014","false","4.0"," 123 of 180 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","123","180","3","3"

Interface has improved; NPC stores were implemented; stealth, melee and weapon attachments were added.  The game doesn't look nearly as unfinished as few months back... but in the end the big problems are not addressed and probably will not be as they seem to be a part of the design.\n\nOn the turn-based tactical level the game is pretty good actually.  You could wish for more destructible environment or say high-grounds system, but in the end the game is enjoyable as it is...\n\nThe island map though is just all wrong...\n\nHealing is too fast - in the original getting a merc wounded would put him/her of commision for days, in Flashback chances are they'll be fine by next morning... so there is litle incentive to run a clean mission, as long as merc still breathing by the end of the fight you'll be fine.\n\nWeapons and equipment is too easy to come by making a equipment management a chore where it used to be a crucial considiration.\n\nMoney is too easy to get - despensing with the whole fund mamagement component.\n\nSquad inventory means you no longer need to decide what to take and what to leave in the sector - grab eveything, no worries\n\nMilitia is useless even on the easy dificulty, you are probably better off just leaving sectors unguarded and recapturing them as needed (map travel times in Flashback seem to be shorten too so you'll get back in no time)\n\nMercs lost their personality and uniquness - they have voices and background stories but when you have to make decisions about team building, equipment or tactical use - there is no significant difference between Ivan and Grizzly, Magic and Fidel.\n\nAnd then there are also more obvious problems.  You still can't open/close doors, can't climb to the roof, CAN summon mercs out of thin air, and CAN take cover behind immovable bulletproof cows.\n\nIn the end the game is OK, more than OK in fact... but you are still better of playing Jagged Alliance 2.\n\n\n***original review***\n\nI am afraid I cannot recommend the game as it is now.\n\nThe game is a very passable squad-based turn-based tactics, and to be fair it came closer to the original than any other JA wannabes in the past 15 years, but...\n\nIt's like someone have tried to replicate your favorite dish.  They figured out most of the ingredients right (team management, strategic map layer, exploration, turn-based tactical combat), but they never got the original recipe so take their best guess to the proportions and processes.\n\nThis shows up in a number of way, but first and foremost in the lack of polish.  JA2 sported the incredible level of attention to the details and polish that was trademark of Sir-Tech... Flashback - lack of polish shows in everything from ability to summon merc out of thin air, to clunky interface, to counter intuitive advancement system, to NPC names like beta_thug, to when and what your mercs say, to lack of balance in both strategic level and squad management.\n\nOn top of that Flashback is literally unfinished game (several features are unavailable or unfinished)\n\nWhile the game had "Early Access" sticker on I kept hoping that all those problem would be fixed... in theory there is still a chance (developers promise patches that will do just that)... but until then... I do not recommend paying for this game.\n\nBottom line: It's an OK game with great potential, but at the moment if you want JA experience you better of playing JA2 (especially with 1.13 patch)","November 7, 2014","false","10.2"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","70","100","0","4"

My answer is, "Yes with a but, or no with an and..." I give it mixed reviews.\n\nYes, BUT this isn't really Jagged Alliance. The original did a semi-decent job of making you feel like you were sitting at a laptop in a dark hotel room somewhere anonymous directing mercenaries over satellite - you were their shadowy handler, working quietly to depose a cruel tyrant and liberate the oppressed. This one just drops you in - rather than a mock "laptop" interface where you read the emails of your employer, viderconference, even browse the web to buy guns/flowers to remember your dead, in JA: Flashback, you're just dropped in. No buildup, just "here you go!". It partly fixes this "feel" problem by having your main character be the apparent handler, hiring mercenaries as you go (and said mercenaries appear magically out of nowhere instead of a 24 hour delay where they are choppered in), but I think this loses out to the feel of the original.\n\nThe bottom line: The good news is that this appears to be an attempt to recapture the original with 3d graphics and a new plot, with a new combat interface. The bad news is that this game doesn't succeed in the depth of the original (less searchable locations, less apparent subtlety). The WORSE news is that Full Control polled the audience for what they wanted in the game, rather than take on ALL the design work themselves, The rather predictable results are things like a long list of character names such as "Night Eyes" and "Jackie Chen", and a combat interface reminiscent of X-COM: Enemy Unknown, making the game feel somewhat juvenile and unsophisticated.\n\nThis game misses the original on several levels. The scale of the maps are somewhat more restricted (larger squares, less of them between buildings), so combat becomes a little more frenetic and "AAAA, please let me roll good numbers!", where chance matters for more than sound tactical planning. Rather than subtly applying camoflage makeup, approaching at night, dropping the roof guard with a silenced SMG and jumping on the roof to drop every guard in the compound with sniper fire (I turned that into a science in JA2), your firefights are more likely to be an attrition brawl where friendlies just stay in cover waiting for the enemy to walk into their guns, and you hope they run out of guys first. While the "cover" indicator is welcome, it only has three states of none, partial and full, and doesn't distinguish between visual cover and hard cover. While JA2 didn't have ANY cover indicator, it was quite possible to lay in what felt like a furrow in the ground, unseen and shielded by a small rock and a clump of weeds. If they fired, you could usually get enough of a fix to return fire, and blind fire was quite a reasonable tactic. JA:F seems to have removed a lot of these subtleties in an effort to make more of a development/engine friendly game, where level building became simpler and playtesting counted for less.  A straightforward remake of JA2, keeping completely true to the mechanics/interface of the original with a new plot would almost certainly have required a lot more work that this one appeared to - and I think it shows in the lack of "polish" in JA:F. A straight remake would have been a better game.\n\nHaving followed Kickstarters (I was a backer of JA:F) for awhile, I've noticed that this is the second game (that I am aware of) that Full Control has released that has drawn on previous franchises and received markedly mixed reviews (The first was Space Hulk). There exists something in creative work called the "Editor's eye", the judgment and flair, the elan, to know what to put into a game, what to leave out, and how the whole will come together to look as a final product. I suggest Full Control has a lot of soul-searching to do regarding theirs. The game feels unpolished, juvenile, unserious and simplistic, and almost all of these flaws could have been fixed by a harsher editors eye in its design. Good luck, Full Control. I won't back another game again.","October 21, 2014","true","2.3"," 187 of 298 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","187","298","4","8"

It is overpriced for the rushed state it is in. I will state some of the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n-Graphics are nice, improvement over the original. Sectors look good, as well as weather effects, mercs pictures and weapons look great.\n-Character Creation is added which is very good, I would have liked to have some sort of custom portraits (but that may be modded in in teh future)\n\nCons:\n\n-Biggest con; The voice acting and quality of voices. They even added a merc with a computerised voice, appearantly a reward for a Backer during the Kickstarter Campaign. But although it gets explained ingame, the quality of that one (and the normal voices) is way below par. As FC has the license (and I can imagine also the original voices), they could have added the original JA2 voices.\n-Sloppy, boring interface; Minimalistic (with a capital "M")- Nothing like the original. Copying and updating the original interface would have heldped with immersion very much.\n-No laptop as in JA2\n-The shop NPC has no UI. No pictures of what you buy, nor an indication how much money you have left. You just have to click blindly until your money is gone and you cannot check ammo-requirements for certain guns, without going out of the shop menu.\n-Militia defending screen has been cut from the game, and now shows plain numbers. Militia are more useless than in JA2. Furthermore, you cannot assist in the defense of a sector together with militia, even when your mercs are in the same sector. The militiua get killed first, then your mercs can fight.\n-The whole game feels rushed, you can see that funding ran out. The whole game does not breather the atmosphere of the game it tried to remake; Jagged Alliance 2 and continues the trend of JA2 successor failures. All praise go to the original makers from Sirtech, who made a game which cannot be remade, not even in the current market!\n\nSo I do not recommended the game in its current state. You better wait for either the price to drop and/or until the modders from The Bear's Pit got their hands on it. They made JA2 even better with patch 1.13, so it is possible to improve JA2. Surely someone can make a true remake of the game, it is a shame Full Control didn't have the funding to take this the whole way. I am very disappointed in the state of the game and it really should be renamed into Jagged Alliance: Under Construction.","October 23, 2014","false","4.9"," 82 of 122 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","82","122","0","6"

Is it worth it?  etc.\nIf you are a Jagged Alliance fan then my answer would be yes. (and if you have no clue of the previous titles the answer is still yes - scroll down)\n\nAnd the reason is:\n\nWell the answer isn't simple to give, so hear me out. If you are expecting a JA2 scope game you are bit optimistic - huge budget differences and development time. I know I know excuses excuses, but it is the main problem with the game that there was JA2 before it with a large budget. JA2 has set the bar pretty high (even vanilla - not talking about 1.13 mod - that's years of sweat and blood). This game was kickstarted by a indie dev looking to revive it with a low budget so comparing it to JA2 isn't entirely fair.\n\nThe reasoning is - this is the first game since JA2 and JA2:UB that really is close to a true jagged alliance game. So killing it off here means no more JA titles, Right now the game isn't as complex or advanced as we hoped, but the game isn't bad on it's own. It's below JA2 in my opinion in terms of depth, but the core is there. If this thing takes off the next iteration will be probably the thing we are hoping for.\n\nHowever, not saying the development was entirely transparent or well though out (the devs probably know as well where they made mistakes), but they were open with the fans in the forums and listened to the community and they still listen. I think the main mistakes came from that they thought of new features that would be cool to add (features that were not really requested from the community) and they kind of spend too much time on them and that cost them time to implement the other features.\n\nBut what is done is done, time to look into the future and keep the JA spirit going.\n\nEnough of the introduction and the game itself:\n\nIf you are are familiar with JA titles this title it will feel like a pretty JA title, but the depth of something in between JA2 and JA and added value. It's still enjoyable and fun, but it has some new things to get used to.\n\nIf you are not familiar with JA, this is basically a turn-based strategy game with a touch of RPG. Right now you can comapre it to Shadowrun Returns, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Arma Tactics etc. BUT what sets this game apart from those titles is that this has more strategic and tactical depth, options, guns, characterized mercs and freedom.\n\nThe graphics are nice mostly and the art style is up for debate as always - in other words a matter of taste.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly fluid and fun, but I can't really say this to newcomers to turn-based strategy games - maybe I'm used to getting killed easily at times.There are some things that need to get used to - for example the Interruption systen which I personally do not fancy.\n\nIn terms of depth there are sufficient amount of weapons which degrade over time and need fixing (same goes for armor and other equipment). A lot of guns means a lot of ammo as well, different types of it. Also grenades, flashbangs. Characters have their own responses to different things and actions, also a lot of stats that show how useful a merc is at something (or is not). Different firing modes burtst, full auto, single shot and option to choose between firing prone, crouch and standing. Cover system, targeting different parts of the body etc etc. Island economic, train militia in squares and manage pays of mercs while earning income. For JA fans this is pretty standard, but compare to other modern TBS games this is sufficently complex\n\nYou can create your own merc based on a questionare! And fill out hes/hers stats and give a custom name.\n\nSo far the story looks solid, will update it when I'm through the game entirely. Same goes for the lenght of the game.\n\nReplayability is pretty decent - pick new mercs, new strategy, complere all side questes - same as for older JA titles.\n\nThe game has a good modding community - mods are already in the making (the game was built open mindly to modding). There is already fan made sector in the game and junk items.\n\nWill update in the future.\n\n\nEarly Access review:\n\ntl;dr version - Early access, listening to community, feels like JA2 already, old die hard fans supporting.\n\nAt this stage don't expect a full game. Expect to play little by little while they improve the game based on feedback and input. Right now everyone who wants to support and help build the game - jump aboard. People who want a full ready game have to wait until it is finished, there is a lot to do.\n\nHonestly saying Full Control is devoted to making a fine addition the JA series (JA, JA:DG, JA2, JA2:UB) and this can be seen from the actions before the early access. They have managed to get the very grisly (yes, this pun) skeptic fans of The Bear's Pit (Longest standing and active Jagged alliance community) and different modders (1.13!) to jump aboard and support this cause.","May 16, 2014","true","23.3"," 163 of 263 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","163","263","0","13"

It's not really a bad game, but it feels like the "mobile version", not the full-fledged sequel. Would I recommend it? Well, no. If you are a fan of JA2, you will be disappointed. If you are new to the series, it is a misrepresentation of what the Jagged Alliance legacy is all about. Perhaps if you thought JA2 was tedious and you just want accessible and simplified turnbased combat, you might like it. But then I'd say you are what drives everything that is wrong with the game industry today, and you should stop playing games all together.\n\n***EDIT***\nDisclaimber: If you think my playtime is too short to write a review (an understandable point), you can view this as a First Impression. I base my opinion around the comparison to Jagged Alliance 2 made by the developers themselves in their kickstarter pitch. JA2, a game that I have played for countless hours thoughout the years since the launch of the Tixa Prison Demo. The time needed to realize the simplification and laughable lack of features compared to that titan of the genre is about half of the time I played this game, the rest of my game time was put in to give the developers the benefit of doubt that it might pick up further down the line. I stopped playing when I just could not see a reason to sink more time into this instead of playing something less disappointing. More in-depth explenation of the factors that play in to my opinion can be found in the comments of this review.\n/***EDIT****","October 21, 2014","false","0.7"," 138 of 222 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","138","222","0","41"

What happened was that it didn't have a chance.\n\nTwo things were working against this game: The sub-standard budget ($360,000 Kickstarter budget + however many sales this game got on Early Access at $30 minus royalties) and Full Control's developers, who have in the past turned the board game Space Hulk into Space Suck through a ham-handed understanding of the mechanics and lack of polish.\n\nThe former is unfortunate - because of this, features had to be cut. Features like character animations, a bunch of the mechanics from Jagged Alliance 2 (which is telling, because Flashback was supposed to be a lot like Jagged Alliance 2 with v1.13 patch features), running and managing your own base of operations, and skill trees. The developers didn't have enough funds or manpower to implement everything, which is a major disappointment.\n\nThe latter is also unfortunate, because this game has one of the worst looking user interfaces I've ever seen. There's only one font for this game and it's an obnoxious '90's looking Geocities font that slides off the eyeballs. Thankfully, there isn't anything worth reading here, because the character bios and flavor text that help make Jagged Alliance's storytelling have been neutered by word limits and bland writing. The enemy AI is poor, the kind of poor intelligence that makes enemies stop when they see you and open fire, like dumb turrets asking for a bullet in the face. There's all sorts of minor yet annoying bugs that coalesce into one huge Megazord of ♥♥♥♥. There is voice acting from every one of the mercs, but a lot of them re-use lines from Jagged Alliance 2 except in a worse manner OH ♥♥♥♥ HERE I AM COMPARING THIS GAME TO JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 AGAIN.\n\nAll of this is a huge leap backwards, turning this Jagged Alliance game into something functional yet generic. I did have a little fun (I ran out of bullets for my squad thanks to terrible loot distribution, but had three or four flashbang grenades. So I had my gunner flashbang all the mercs while my melee-only character runs up and delivers fists of death into faces), but I'm not interested in seeing where this game goes because it's too much of a mess to play.\n\nI will say that the soundtrack is good and is successful at capturing the spirit of the old Jagged Alliance games. And I admire Full Control's persistence in trying to fix all of this with post-launch support and soldiering on when things look seemingly impossible. But I haven't seen anything in the past 16 years that would be a true successor to the franchise, and how Flashback turned out I don't think I'm ever going to at this point.\n\nRest in peace, Jagged Alliance.","February 12, 2015","false","3.2"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","38","51","0","3"

This is BIA all over again.\n\nFirst three hours of playing revealed several obvious bugs and simple oversights and simplifications, such as:\nSave button occasionally not visible, luckily it reappears if you go to Load menu and come back, otherwise would have lost progress\nSecondary weapons sometimes do not work, but work fine if you spend AP to put them to backpack and back again\nDrag-dropping ammo to a weapon breaks the inventory screen, ironically needing to reload the game instead of the weapon\nRe-arranging squads sometimes unpauses the game, resulting in fun times when preparing for defence.\nTotal armor is not visible anywhere\nStamina does not regenerate out of combat, you need to rest a combat turn\nSidestepping or walking/crawling backwards is not possible\nCover of my mercs sometimes lowers chance to hit enemies standing in the open\nNo place to extend a merc contract until it expires, or even see their daily wage, let alone a total of your squad.\nNo way to climb to roofs for elevation bonuses\nThe whole island is visible at once, and you can magically see all enemy squad locations\nNames of mercs in a different squad appear in middle of the screen during battle in a different sector\nAfter conquering the first small area, I started to train militia in a chokepoint sector. After training four militia, first enemy patrol comes in: 8-man squad, with long range weapons. I had my team in the same sector, prepared to defend with militia. For some reason, you first get automatic combat resolution of enemy vs. militia, and all four were easily slaughtered. After starting the actual battle, my troops were no longer in defensive positions, but spawned in the middle of the map. Defending against long range weapons with pistols and SMGs required very cheesy tactics, only possible because of the simple AI. I managed to train another four mercs before the next squad, only for them to get slaughered again. After one more cycle, with no way to repair weapons, the game will soon be uninstalled.\nEnemies don't usually drop weapons, but I understand that as a design choice. I would expect to have some place to buy medkits and repair kits though, the only "store" in first town is a weird dialogue hack, where you can't even see your cash total, or stats of the weapons you are buying.\n\nNo manual, especially no information about character creation, status effects, or stats like "reaction time", and even in-game tooltips or tutorials don't cover those. IMP character creation has a random element to what perks you get and in which order, it would have been better to allow the player the option to manually select perks, instead of having to re-roll through the questionnaire. This looks like a feature that was cut short in development, like many others. It seems that the four perks you get at start are not all active until later levels, so it is weird to get locked into that choice at character creation.\n\nWeirdly all mercs from previous games are back to Level 1, and their salaries don't seem to match their skills. I'm not sure if they will change as the game progresses, otherwise you are more or less limited to the starting squad that you train up. They have pretty weird perk choices as well: Ivan, Buzz, Lynx and Shadow all come with a Shotgun-crit-chance perk.\n\nThere are some good points, like squad inventory, a movement cursor that shows visible enemies from target square, and simple militia training (unlike having to manually haul weapons to civilians, like in JA:BIA).\n\nThis might be playable after a major bug fix and feature update, but until then, stay away. Basically, this looks like early access. Time to reinstall JA2 wildfire...","October 25, 2014","false","9.1"," 68 of 103 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","68","103","0","0"

But each time all we get - a crushing and stunning dissapointment. The only thing that developers consistently do is copying mercs names, and filling the merc roster with our old pals. When you finish hiring guys to your party, you are thrown out of nostalgic dream and meet the harsh reality like when falling into dirt on your face.\nStep by step my dissapointment grew stronger and stronger, until my patience finally cracked and I shouted at my monitor and beated my mouse in an epic wrath.\nSo, these were my steps which I hope you don't ever feel by yourself:\nStep 1: Graphics.\nMy first thaught was "really, guys? you forgot to draw a face on that character model?" I do understand that kickstarter projects are not supposed to have outstanding graphic design, but THIS is just a trash. Ok, in the real gameplay graphics are not looking so bad, but why then i have this enormous lags at my Core I7 GeForce 760 GTX???\nStep 2: Interface.\nAt a first look, everything is in place, but when I tried how it really works, it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Choosing all squad members at the same time is a real challenge, I need at least 2-3 tries before it works. And still they do not move together - just one by one with a great distance.\nDialogue buttons are written in such colours so I can barely see what I say. But, actually, it doesn't matter.\nWhen I tried to buy a gun it was ♥♥♥♥ing torment. First of all - I can't sell my guns! Yeah, that's it - throw them out if you don't need them. And I thought developers can make something more comfortable that text trade interface.\nStep 3: Sound\nMY MERCS ALWAYS SAY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥IN WORDS!!! I had to turn off voices to save my nerves.\nYou can turn all sounds off except gunfire, and you won't feel something is missing.\nStep 4: Gameplay\nThere is no button like "stealth" or something - but the game insists that it actually has stealth. Actually, no matter how i tried, I haven't managed to get so close to the enemy to hit him with a knife.\nThere are no weapon mods: no silencers, optical zooms, laser pointers and all that stuff.\nAmount of guns is too low, and MY GOD, look at the guns' brands - "Bolt", "Tinchester", "M1 Dagrand" and so on... This is ridiculous...\nMercs can not climb on rooftops, and even over small tiny garden fences. I haven't seen any locked doors, and even any CLOSED doors - there are just doorways.\nTactics is rudimentary... When you enter a sector you cannot choose entry point, you just go through the main gate. If you croos your ways in jungle with a traveling soldier squad, be ready to get surrounded right in a middle of a location by 7-10 guys. The only thing that saves you - is that they are extremely stupid and keep going on you like on a firing range. Fights come to this: pick a good position, and wait until enemy comes to your aim.\nAnd the thing that ♥♥♥♥ed all the game finally - CALCULATIONS!\nHow the ♥♥♥♥ my mercs cannot hit the target 5 times in a row with 82% chance ho hit???\nIt seems to me that accuracy calculations are just a fake, cause my actual hits don't confirm the chances.\nWhen I had two turns with 2 enemies standing on a perfect range (8-10) and 3 of my mercs with 75 marksmanship an 75% chance to hit could even hit a single time, it was the last drop. And I thought: "why am I tortuting myself with this crap? It's a bad game, no matter what title it carries. If it wasn't called Jagged Alliance, I'd quit after a first very battle and deleted it forever". It's not JA, it's not even a decent game, it's another time that people make money of our good memories.\n","October 27, 2014","false","4.7"," 63 of 95 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","63","95","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuvos/recommended/256010/","kuvos","qFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuvos/","2353 products in account","Note: this is written by a fanboi of the originals JA series. To the uninitiated it's a fair game that resembles the original series. Not sure whether it's worth the price tag, but it's a fun game, though clearly needs some polish. I give it thumbs up because it's a nice game to play, even if it's a long stretch from the original series.\n\nFor the fanboi-ish review: meh. This review won't be very positive. So this is supposed to be a fanbased remake of the original. Clearly it resembles the original in some ways. But it's actually the little and subtle things that make this game far from "like" the original. On top of that it feels unfinished, content seems missing, hints seem missing, achievements somewhat broken, but mainly it feels as if the story line was rushed in.\n\nNote that in all this, I played on the default level, which feels very much like "easy", and I played in a save-game mode. For my playthrough that came down to a sector reload whenever I lost a soldier. Other damage is pretty irrelevant, at least in this game mode. Played on windows on a high end machine.\n\nSome details.\n\nThe UI feels clunky. The game itself runs very smooth. This is a high end pc so I expect nothing less. However, the menu items, the quest list, the interaction all feels very laggy. Dragging items often need to be done twice. Feedback on actions, like reloading a merc from the map sometimes gives you immediate feedback, sometimes requires you to swap a gun around or something. Pressing forward or fast forward will start with an initial lag, really annoying. So generally, all the interface and interaction feels pretty bad, pretty unpolished.\n\nThen there's interaction things that are weird, or maybe just different from the original series. It's not possible to select your entire squad with keys, only by mouse. The interface lag sometimes causes you to move your merc when you intended to attack an enemy, causing you to run straight toward your enemy with your sniper rifle. I'm sure it still hurts, but... Also, the old game had good inventory maintenance things, specifically view a sector inventory. Instead all loot (and dead bodies) disappear after you exit a sector. But it's also not possible to sort items in your inventory, only filter them by very high level categories. And whenever you move anything around from the fifth page of inventory, it refreshes the inventory and bumps you back to the first page. Combined with double dragging and general lag, makes that a bad experience. There seems to be a lot of low hanging fruit here and I keep wondering why it hasn't been picked up.\n\nGame mechanics. One of the first things that annoyed me is how unfriendly the friendly fire system is. Because seriously, if you are standing behind some guy, certainly you won't shoot him while aiming for somebody way further away? Even worse, if you're aiming for some guy and there are one or two friendly mercs in between the target and you in a straight line, you're nearly guaranteed to hit them both. And if you were aiming for the head/legs, you'll hit your mercs there too, regardless of your stance. Ok your stance matters in that a standing merc will not hit a lower stanced merc. But if you're all proned, this still works. However, this works for the enemy as well. My best laugh was an enemy that was nearly dead, fired its last bullet, killed one of his friends trying to hit me, then kicked the bucket due to bleeding. Heh.\n\nBleeding is bugged. It makes sense to bleed every turn, but if you have an interupt, you'll also get a bleed tick. Get 4 interupts? Then also 4 bleed ticks.\n\nI played most of the game with just four mercs with 90+ aim. Other characters were just mules and militia trainers. Aim and dex seem the only interesting properties for the four mercs. The rest is kinda irrelevant. More than four mercs just becomes a hassle in fights, managing them all. Especially with the aforementioned friendly fire, it's a pita. Four mercs can group together or ambush enemies.\n\nThe AI is terrible. Oh and bugged. It's terrible because as soon as you shoot a single bullet they'll come swarming for you. Nearly all enemies do this and near the end I just dropped down in a line of four, shot a single bullet at an enemy, and picked up anything that came towards me. Especially that elephant gun with head shots is godlike. The enemies should try to circle around a bit, flank you from different sides, remain stationary in their hideouts, stay hidden until they had a fair chance of hitting me, something like that you know? The AI is also bugged in that it sometimes doesn't seem to compute AP properly. So you'll get a system message that you can't do this action because there aren't enough hitpoints left (often right after an enemy changed stance). It's funny because at least it shows that the engine isn't cheating; same rules apply :) But really, the user shouldn't see these messages at all.\n\nBeing attacked in a sector is another thing. It's very unfair. You sometimes get like 10 seconds to round up your men and dig in before an enemy spots you. Without the ability to select all mercs in one key stroke, that gets a bit frantic. Especially since the game will reposition your men somewhere in the centre, randomly, so you can't really "prepare" for the "ambush" either. In that sense it's really an ambush, but in my opininon it's not the fair kind of ambush.\n\nThe militia is... different from the original series. So on the one hand you no longer see your friendly militia walk around. In fact, you won't see them at all. You won't fight with them (they get their own, text only, phase) and you can only train them in a linear time. This is weird because no matter how many mercs, or their experience in antyhing, you'll get your militia in a linear time. And once a sector has a certain number of militia, it's pretty much safe from hostiles. You can only lose militia by being attacked, and once you have the max (15?) you won't lose any militia during an attack. They'll become elite and that's it. The biggest danger is taking over a city on the front line and having to build up a buffer of militia before the enemy attacks again. It also means that having 5 militia means nothing as they'll not even put up a fight against 9 enemies. They'll die and you'll face 9 fully healthy enemies after they do.\n\nSo health. You don't actually see enemy health. Kind of annoying at times, but kind of realistic in a way so not a problem per se. You do get to see them bleed, but that's kind of irrelevant. You get a tip of how strong the enemy is, but very very poor tip (soldier, militia, elite). Your own health is irrelevant as long as you're not dead. The enemy AI does seem to pick on one target at a time. That can be annoying, but it's a good tactic and they should do this as it's the most efficient way to eliminate a squad fast. Once you conquer a sector you can usually take your time to heal up though. You don't need to patch up mercs before "resting". You can assign a doctor to speed things up, but your merc won't bleed to death if you don't apply a bandage, like it would in the originals. Eventually, your merc heals up and you can continue with the next. I felt little pressure, especially after settling in the beginning.\n\nAnother thing you can do is repair your stuff. However, you won't find (m)any repair kits until much later in the game. This is annoying since your stuff is going to wear down and you'll have _no_ way of repairing it until you acquire a new repair kit. There's no way to guide the repair merc on which items to repair first. Worn down guns never choke, they'll only perform worse or stop working entirely. So either your gun is gonna fire or it won't, there's no risk at all. Broken guns won't get fixed.\n\nThere's more. Morale is useless, no arbitrary shooting, no time lapse in free mode, no teachers. But Steam limits these reviews, so:\n\nI enjoyed the game but it should be early access.","December 30, 2014","true","54.8"," 82 of 128 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","82","128","4","0"

You can create your own merc now, which presents you with a screen crowded with uninspiring text that honestly looks very uninspiring. The entire game using 1 font that isn't very pleasant to read large chunks of text with. The inventory and character screen all look the same with some really simple text boxes for info and filter types.\n\nThe game feels very rushed at no real surprise, because it is. Full Control decided to put a year of work into Jagged Alliance Flashback during and after the Kickstarter with time for vacations and to get through a large bug list for their other game, Space Hulk. Unfortunately it really shows in the game, as it looks messy and rushed from the start.\n\nOld review:\nWith one update left to go before the final version, things don't look good for the new game in the JA series. Even this 'late' in development (only 18 months) the game feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Touting itself as a spiritual successor to the very popular Jagged Alliance 2, Flashback seems to forget its roots and a lot of the time, what made those games good. It's uncertain what will be in the final game compared to the early access version we've been playing, but the devs attitude towards the game recently make it sound as if they'd just like to be done with making it. They went to Kickstarter without a plan, and upon being funded, quickly realised they were out of their depth. They spent most of the time making the website and assigning community officers and their game suffered because of it. Already they are implying core features will be added after the game has actually been released, but I find that hard to believe with their obvious lack of motivation to continue on the game.\n\nThe game plays like a basic isometric turn based shooter. You can target head, bodies and legs with your weapon. Up until recently, you couldn't choose the amount of AP you took on the shot and had to keep 'rolling the dice' to try and hit someone. The UI is unintuitive and hard to comprehend at the best of times. It's colored with a flat gradient and unflattering font. Mercenary portraits and interactions are limited and static. Inventory management might as well have been removed because clearly they don't understand what made it good in JA2 (pockets of various sizes for different items etc). The art style isn't consistent; some areas feel totally out of place due to their pallette.\n\nFor what it's worth, this game does some things right, just generally the things you wouldn't attribute to Jagged Alliance. The cover system is nice, and hitting enemies in the head with a low-percent chance to hit is satisfying, it just makes you wonder if this game would have benefited if it wasn't tied to the source material it loosely bases itself off of.\n\nJagged Alliance: Flashback is an empty experience that just kind of exists. People will get this game confused with Back in Action. At this point, if you want to play Jagged Alliance, you'll be playing JA2 with the 1.13 mod. It's sad but teaches you a thing or two about Kickstarter!","October 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 74 of 116 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","74","116","0","3"

Shanga is probably already working on it.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a review for version 0.2.1\nFirst the negatives:\n- Unfinished product with a lot more work to be done by the devs. Remember that this is the first version of the beta.\n- There are a couple of bugs (one of them gamebreaking, but possible to fix by editing the save files) in the game, and as this is a beta, there are probably gonna be a couple more in the future.\n- High price for an unfinished product - this is because that's what the kickstarter backers (at least) paid for the game + beta\n- This game is a kickstarter project and as such has a very small budget, so the devs might not be able to put everything in the game they and we want.\n\nThe things I am missing most:\n- No healing yet\n- Only one autosave that saves after each sector\n- The mercs don't have a lot of personality yet\n- Overall a lot of tactical and strategic options still missing\n\nSo if you can't deal with not having those things - don't buy the game yet, wait for a couple of months for the devs to include those features.\n\nIf however you are willing to support the devs and pay the price, you are going to get the following:\n- Finally a new turn-based JA game (with real-time to explore).\n- Every buyer gives Full Control a bit more to work with, so the more people buy now, the better the game will be in the end.\n- Devs that are obviously determined to make the best JA game they can and that have already proven to listen to the fans\n- A game that (to me) already feels more like a JA game than BIA ever did.\n- A game that is going to be highly moddable. The devs promised to make it as moddable as possible and so far they have delivered. They even got some of the JA2-modders on board.\n- One of the (if not THE) best modding community ever. Seeing what they have done with JA2, I can only imagine how great JAF mods are going to be.\n\nI recorded some of my gameplay:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfQ_raecCiw","May 20, 2014","true","110.3"," 68 of 106 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","68","106","0","0"

It was one of those games which despite its (often hilariously) simple production values, managed to combine rather deep tactical turn-based combat with tongue-in-cheek badassery. So I got a little excited when these folks put out their pitch about how much they loved Jagged Alliance 2 and intended to make a spiritual successor, and figured, "Hey. I'll support this."\n\nEarly access was basically unplayable, but I figured hey... it's early access. They're going to smooth things out.\n\nBut they never REALLY smoothed it out. What we ended up with at release was a rather lame reskin of the combat interface from the new XCOM, minus any of the polish and a lot of the functionality. For some reason, the game takes place in a country where literally every door is left open. There seems to be no useful stealth mechanic, or any form of suppressive fire.\n\nLiterally the only thing they've captured from the original -- and the only promise they really kept -- is the bad voice acting. Somehow they've managed to make each and every character in the game as grating as Ira or Biff.\n\nSkip this. If you have JA2, download the fan-made 1.13 patch which refines the combat system and adds a wealth of new equipment. This isn't a spiritual successor. It's an abortion.

Full Control should be revealed as the irresponsible and lazy team that they are and shunned for their attempt to scam the Jagged Alliance community.\n\nSeriously, I paid the same amount of money for The Witcher 3. Do I see the difference in quality? Oh boy, do I indeed!\n\n***\n\n2014\n\nI don't really write huge reviews. But as a JA fan I feel like I need to get this out there and warn people about this crappy beta that in no way resembles JA.\n\nI will probably try to play it a bit more in search of any kind of sense in playing it, maybe it's out there, but I really have no high hopes here.\n\nBut seriously, guys, even JA1 had a better interface and management with all the mechanics in place like weapon upgrades and such. Yes, it was primitive (from the modern perspective) but it was all intact, made sense and was quite easy to use. FFS! Even the interrupt system was all good. And this here product doesn't even reach that old level of quality, which is, quite honestly, just plain freakin ridiculous.\n\nI actually had high expectations for this since there were two lousy attempts at JA glory, called "Jazz" (you probably never even heard of it, goes by the name "Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge" outside Russia i believe) and JA: back in action (I literally shiver all over when I have to say or write JA in the name of this... this... thing) both of which were just godawful. And when people in IT community pointed out the existence of this project on Kickstarter I read the info and for whatever reason believed the devs on the spot. I really hoped that Flashback would actually finally be a worthy tribute for one of my all time favorite turn-based games. Then I paid for early acces and tried every version till the very release updating my review. And all I saw was disappointment. And now we have arrived and I am ashamed, ashamed for being so naive and trusting mostly. But also for supporting blindly what was never going to happen.\n\nDon't even think of buying it. It is incomplete and there is a good chance it never will be. All you need to do is look at the screenshots and gameplay (so called) videos to realize this isn't JA. It's just some crappy attempt to rip off people. Or it's an honest attempt to make a good game that ended up in a failure. Either way one thing this game is not - a JA successor. Sorry.\n\nYou want a cheap turn based tactics - go right ahead and get this on the next sale. But if you want a JA game, better play the good old JA2. Maybe one day we'll deserve a good new JA or at least a decent remake :'(\n\nP. S. Also one of the devs gave a nice little speech on what's what that consisted of nothing but excuses. "We don't have enough cash, we don't have enough people, we can't make a decent art style, we can't get it fully done in time, blablabla". Not Interested In Excuses!!! Already PAID for it! So deliver or GTFO! I know game development is some tough ♥♥♥♥ but if you weren't up to this in the first place you shouldn't have started the "resurrection of a legend". You could've just called the game "Mercs, tactics, guns, whatever, pew-pew" and do your best. But, nooo! You had to call it JA (cuz you needed the money real quick, to this day this is how I see it). Well that calls for some certain level of quality and you couldn't reach it. Not even close, man!\n\nP. P.S. Oh, and don't be lazy guys, scroll through some of the reviews. OMFG! We even have some generic fake positive reviews. Wow, just wow. How low can you go, people?\n\n*****\n\nGameplay logs here:\n\n28.10.2014 Put a few more hours in it and GOD is it pathetic! How do I prolong the contract with my man Shadow here? Hell if I know.

If you're a modder on The Bear Pit, then it's exactly what you expected.\n\nAs a fan of previous Jagged Alliance games, I've put more time into this title then I expected to. I did not do this becaues I felt like I was having a good time. I kept playing because I was convinced that if I gave it more of a chance it would grow on me. Almost exactly like how I felt with the older titles, as well the failed remakes like Brigade E5, and Back in Action.\n\nAlthough unlike the other titles, this game just did not grow on me.\n\nI had picked up the Early Access and gave the first island a shot. It felt simple at the time, melee wasen't even in it at this point, so I knew I was pretty early and so forgiving of the barebone features.

I was shocked.\n\nUpon release, it still lacked soul. It lacked the many familiar features one can find in most other failed Jagged Alliance remakes. The developers and development community insist that many of these features are either not needed, too expencive, or coming in future patches.\nA month later however, the only new feature is ammo types. In the meantime the company has released another project, a re-imagining of their Space Hulk game.\n\nThere is a quote from a post their Dev team made on the Forums that reads:\n\n"In hindsight there were so many things we could and should have done differently, be more prepared, produce a playable version and not spend so much time on creating a website. Looking back we really should have spent more time producing solid high level designs to communicate our vision to you."\n\nAs a modding platform, it's supposed to be flexible enough so that one day someone at The BearPit might pump out a JA:F 1.13. But that kind of doesn't help the average Jagged Alliance fan who intended to back a videogame and didn't realize they were actually investing in moding utilities.\n\n","November 20, 2014","false","26.2"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","5"

Do I wish it had a bit more content, absolutely. But what is there is at least as good as JA:2. Yes, JA:2 was a bigger game. But in an era where you can't get games like JA built anymore, because everybody's wasting their time on FPS, this is a diamond.  I'm happy I backed it on the Kickstarter, and happy with the end result.\n\nI think that the gist of the complaints are that this isn't as fully featured as JA:2. For example, you can't walk backward, and you don't need to pick any locks because all the doors are already open. I agree, it would be nice to have those things, but they are nice to haves not must haves.\n\nThe meat of the old game is there. You pick Mercs, take control of and hold territory, and are always on the hunt for better equipment, and equipment attachments. There are side missions, vendors, and new Mercs you meet along the way.\n\nThere are definitely some things missing, but there's also new stuff that I think is pretty cool. First and foremost, this is a new game, built with modern computers in mind and it doesn't crash all the time like JA:2 used to. In some ways it has more strategy. For example, I love the way the game forces you to defend your territories while you're training militia, because you can't have a whole squad of trainers. It's also got a new map and a new mission as well as new Mercs and equipment. The UI is way cleaner and easier to use. The concept of a squad inventory, while less realistic is far more easy to use than having to go hunt for all the equipment drops you left all over the damn map. There's a whole perks system that implements all kinds of useful special abilities like "never accidentally shoots friendly mercs" (granted there were special abilities in JA2).\n\nThe bottom line is that it's not JA:2 and as a result the die hards are predictably unhappy. That said, this is the first of all the games that have come out bearing the name "Jagged Alliance" since JA:2 that is actually worthy of it's name. Give it a try, you'll like it.","December 4, 2014","true","21.9"," 53 of 92 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","53","92","0","4"

After a few days (sectors taken), you need to wait several minutes, until all enemy turns are done.. you can imagine, how long it takes, when you need to fight 12 enemies...\n\n2) you can only use one squad in a fight, even when multiple squads are in the sector. This means, you are unable to attack from several sides at once (e.g. 2 from south, 4 from west).\n\n3) enemy AI is stupid. Once the game starts, enemies run blindly into your direction, so it's very easy to get them out of cover\n\n4) when you hire a merc, he appears _instantly_ in the sector. No need to plan ahead, no need to get them from an airport to the sector you need him.\n\n5) the whole economy is unbalanced and partly stupid: you hire a soldier with all his gear, once the contract ends, he leaves all his gear in your team. Next time you hire him, he brings the same stuff (every time for very little money).\n\nI can continue with these kind of things... so it looks very close to the original and very promising, but it get's totally boring way too fast, while the originals (and even Back in action) is fun to play even after years again and again.","January 17, 2015","false","13.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

It feels like it's still in beta, with several features that should be implemented but aren't, like doors that actually open and close, only ground-level height, and an 'energy' bar which has no real purpose.  There are also numerous misspellings which should have been caught months before release.  Overall it's a barebones, unpolished experience that you are being charged a premium price for.  The devs claim to be updating with additional features, but I'd be surprised if they can turn what was released into anything resembling the previous games.\n\nFor prior JA fans, this is not the JA reboot you're looking for.  Getting into the features that were cut would take too much time, suffice it to say the vast majority of them are gone.   For new players, it's a functional but lackluster turn-based isometric strategy shooter.  It does what it's supposed to, nothing more, but there are other games out there in the same genre and style that do everything better, and for a lower price.  Give XCOM: Enemy Unknown a try instead.\n\np.s. My play time should be about 4 hours higher than what's displayed, it's been reset a couple of times.

As I have always stated, for a game nowdays, you are better off you do not judge it by the cover, but by how the author responds to criticism.\n\nSo... PATHFINDING was horrible on launch. FIXED. Now you can select your team and direct them to one spot without the fear of one or two idiots going around the map because the system told them their path is blocked.\n\nWEAPON CUSTOMIZATION is in. We now have a great system of ATTACHMENTS, with a maxiumum five slots, weapon specific, fully-moddable. The devs added about a dozen of standard attachments, the community can add hundreds if they want.\n\nSHOTGUNS are in the game, together with WARSAW PACT WEAPONS pack. Iconic guns like Makarov, Polish resistance SMG Blyskawica, Spetsnaz VAL Silent Sniper (VSS), Czech Skorpion SMG are in the game. And yes, shotguns act like shotguns, shooting a burst of pellets (with moddable vertical/horizontal spread). And VSS acts like a true silent weapon.\n\nSTEALTH works now. Actually at the time of writting this review, it works too well for the player. Devs added silencer attachments, NV scopes and that makes you absolutely deadly at night.\n\nHOLLOW POINT and ARMOR PIERCING AMMO have been added and they work great. Also this opened up the game for modding an infinite ammount of ammo calibers and variations. I've already published a 9x39 subsonic ammo mod you might want to try out.\n\nWe also got our FREE DLC with all the above, with two new quest lines being added to the game. One leads to a secret treasure near Badilla, the other allows player to control lighthouses around the map for easier reinforcement insertions.\n\nAnd finally, MODDING has been enabled again!

It's unfortunate since I think most were hoping for a higher level of polish but I will still keep this as a recommendation. Just wait for a good sale and know what you're getting into won't be the best experience, but it can still be a fun one.\n\n\n\n-- ORIGINAL --\n\nNot fantastic but decent.\n\nIt's not a flawless game; kickstarted with a slim budget it shouldn't be expected to be, but that doesn't mean it's garbage either. The gameplay is mostly what you'd expect from a turn-based tact. and, in general, plays it out well. There's a few bugs still: I've had one character start every map in the prone animation but with standing odds and move distances. The line-of-sight has been off occasionally, which is probably the biggest issue and tied in with LoS is that cover doesn't seem to behave right. Patches have been helpful so far though and that seems like an issue that would recieve attention. If you really want a list of flaws, many people have gone to no small effort to list them out already. I can understand why, particularly older versions, would raise some ire but I'd simply encourage people not to let the more extreme nit-picky points sway you too quickly.\n\nThe graphics are fine - the world is well painted and there's some diversity in settings while keeping with the tropical island theme but the area of enagement on any one map is likely to be small. There's no special effect that will make you go "Wow!" but it's not needed. Just look at the screen-shots and you'll see exactly what you're getting, there's really not much more to say that the pictures don't.\n\nI think it helped that I haven't played the other JA games. I've read plenty of the negative reviews and many aren't wrong, the story is pretty flat - though I started playing it late enough to avoid the worst of the issues. In the end I didn't have any special expectations regarding the series and I knew it wasn't going to be a big-budget title, for me this game was mostly in-line with those considerations and is perfectly playable but, if the other reviews are any indication, just approach realizing you're going to be getting an indy game, not JA2.","January 6, 2015","true","8.7"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","30","50","0","0"

Sure,  there will be those that have played every game for 500+ hours or created massive mods, but I truly adore the series, even the weird but fun Back In Action.\n\nNow, I won't say the game doesn't have its issues; as a game built on less than 500k, it has faults that a much larger budget would have obviously helped fix, but the core that is there is very solid and addictive. It felt Jagged Alliance-y from the very start, with the classic island-nation motif and cadre\nof insane mercs for hire. While the mercs are not as talkative as I would like, what they do say gets\ntheir personalities across perfectly.\n\nIf asked should you get the game, I would say ABSOLUTELY!, and that is because you must be a strategy fan if you're checking the reviews to help make up your mind. A big reason to buy it is that\nit will help ensure that the game does get patched and get even more content and features as more\ncash comes in.

Heck, even if you don't play it now, by buying the game you\nhelp get more content made so that when you're ready, you'll have a much better game.\n\nSo, in summarization, while certain features need work (AI, party chatter etc) any and all of these\nissues are due to a cash shotage not a vision or idea shortage, so buy the game already and help\nmake it even better!

I have played the original JA games so I do have something to compare this to and I have also played Kalypso's very disappointing JA BiA.\n\nJagged Alliance Flashback is very well designed and I absolutely love the game engine. It's stylish yet simple with an almost pastel colour palette that really aces the presentation. Sound is also excellent and the music does not overpower the experience. The turn based combat is well built and flows very naturally, although I'm not a fan of the To-Hit system but it's less random than X-Com so that's something.\n\nThe random characters with the wacky names and inane dialogue kind of struck me as odd but I suppose they were probably part of a backer reward far above my teir. Wish they'd done something a little less in-your-face with them but it's easy enough to ignore. Speaking of characters the stable of AIM mercs is well fleshed out and the dialogue with NPCs is decently written; the story is standard JA fare and works well as do the excellent (so far) level designs.\n\nI definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good turn based tactical RPG-lite shooter whether you're an original Jagged Alliance fan or not this has a lot to offer. It's an excellent spiritual continuation of the series and I'm not sure what all the negative fuss was about. From what I remember of the original pitch it was never touted as JA3 and I for one never expected the amount of polish that has been put into this game considering the rather meager budget Full Control worked with. Well done guys!\n\nSide Note: JAF also gets HUGE bonus points from me for having a good solid version of the IMP which was my favorite part of JA2 and was MISSING from BiA. Bad Kalypso.

Right from the start it's clear that the people making this game are fans of the original and that they're truly trying to re-capture the gameplay. The map, its sectors and the way you move on it are all faithfully recreated. Movement in the game itself has been modernized a bit by using larger tiles, but the game honestly benefits from it. The addition of very clear indicators that not only show your cover but the angles towards your enemies is a fantastic one. There's no guesswork in whether or not a piece of cover works at an awkward angle, the game straight up tells you before you move. Not only that, but it tells you this in regards to every enemy visible to your guys.\n\nThe gunfights feel satisfyingly lethal as well, and with added polish will no doubt match the brutality that I came to love from JA2. Your mercs can die and often quite easily, if you're not careful with them, and it takes little to make them bleed. The blood effects are fantastic as well, with battlefields quickly becoming spray-painted in red, splattering onto walls, objects and the ground in fantastically exaggerated ways. There's no realism in it, but this is one front where realism truly is neither needed nor wanted.\n\nAs with any early-access games, bugs are to be expected before its release, so no points are taken from their existance. Only just ecchoing the ever present warning that if you buy this game during early access, you're getting it as is. What I played was satisfying, fun, visceral and deadly, and it's no doubt the closest thing to a true and real Jagged Alliance game we've had in over a decade.","October 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","28","49","0","0"

Like Shadowrun Returns, a very simplified game compared to the original Shadowrun tabletop RPG, JAF is not as complex as its inspiration (JA1 and JA2) but it certainly has the potential to grow into something unique and special for the franchise.

How hard would that be, basically create JA2 with modern graphics, and a different campaign.  No problem, right?\n\nApparently its a huge problem.  Why something that could be done over 15 years ago (JA2 was released in April 1999), can't be done now is simply beyond me.\n\nAlmost as soon as I started the gane I was thinking "nope".  They dropped the ball, badly.  I haven't played that long, I will admit, but already its clear the game is half ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAll the little things that added so much to JA2 are missing; containers, strange things you'd find, different ammo types, mods for your guns (even if some of them were silly), interesting voice overs, strange characters, even the horribly voice acted Ira added something interesting to the game.  And Meltdown, my absolute favourite character of all.  The game had personality!\n\nNone of that is here.  This feels very bland and basic, I'd say even worse than Back in Action - and that is a pretty low bar to actually slip under!\n\nJA2 was originally praised for "its non-linear gameplay, freedom of action and variety of tactics, mercenary character traits, story-telling and role-playing, detailed world, challenging opponents and excellent audio."\n\nFlashback is not going to get that praise.\n\nThe graphics are primitive (for modern games), but servicable - I can forgive that.  There are few voice overs (I'd say what is there was lifted straight from JA2), otherwise the audio is middle of the road.  The UI is clunky and basic.\n\nAnd the combat?  Full Control also developed a free game called Frontline Tactics that I played for a while (like all free games they want you to pay for it with microtransactions, amusingly enough the MT system didn't work when I was playing).  I instantly recognized the combat as being that system put in this game with some small tweaks.  Its very basic and repetitive, and the AI is very stupid.\n\nI can't even recommend getting this game on sale.  Unless it gets a major overhaul - and it would have to be such an extensive overhaul that I simply can't imagine it happening - I would have to suggest that people play JA2 instead.\n","October 25, 2014","false","1.3"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","26","46","0","3"

Note that I freely admit to having only about an hour of playtime in the game--I was turned off that fast.\n\nThe bad news: Releasing to final before your game is feature complete with what you promised, failing to understand the core traits of the game franchise you based your KS on, and depending on an especially loyal fanbase/mod community to fix your game/bring it up to an enjoyable level should not be a viable business strategy. Sadly, it's the route Full Control have opted for here.\n\nYes, I'm a backer. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about losing money to KS, because KS is fair game, and I thought Full Control did a decent job with Space Hulk. They've really dropped the ball here though--or maybe should never have attempted the JA franchise if they weren't willing to put the time and love this game deserved into it. Saying "We only got 'x' dollars to make this game" is a poor excuse when it's apparent there was very little understanding of where to spend those x dollars. Saying 'development will continue based on how much we sell on release' is an extra slap in the face for everyone who felt this game released well before completion. These may be sound financial decisions to an extent, a la Double Fine, but you end up spitting in your loyal customers' faces for releasing a ♥♥♥♥ game and then telling people development depends on people buying your ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nSo what went wrong? First and foremost, your Mercs have no personality. The voicework is terrible, and not in JA2's cheesy, 80's action move feel. It's just bad, and there's no real interactio between your mercs. Nothing to create player investment in their lives (or, more importantly in JA, their deaths)\n\nThe strategic layer is simplistic with poor enemy AI--possibly worse that JA2--and less features (no roofs, empty environments). The RPS and NPC interaction is almost ocmpletely nonexistent.\n\nInventory mechanics and the UI don't work well, there's no real interaction with militia or character training, and zone inventories are effectively non present. Oh, and the story is banal and hackneyed.\n\nSo, what do you get--basically a poor 3D update of the JA franchise--which has already happened twice prior with similarly disasrous results. Th eonly redeeming feature here is that modding support MIGHT salvage some of this game.  Given that the average gamer feels completely ripped off by this title, howeverm I doubt the longevity is there as even the hardcore supporters are beginning to give up hope.\n\nBuyer beware--IT'S not yet TIME TO SWING INTO ACTION. The rest of us who bought in to the KS will be praying to Bear's Pit. Good luck, Shanga and friends.\n\n\n[wrote longer review, but Steam was having one of its All the Reviews You Can Eat for $4.99 nights]","October 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","27","48","0","4"

Especailly the latest build.\nI've never been much of a beta-player, but because I invested in the KS, I've given it some spins along the way, to help development and get some sneak peaks at the action. Being a married father of two young girls, play time is severely limited and with a brimming steam library, I've settled on prioritising finished builds.\nSo far I like it for what it is, a TBS with a nice atmosphere in tropical surroundings. While I did play JA & JA2, I'm not as enamoured by franchise as many of the cult following. Because of this, I'm trying to view this attempt at a JA-game in a forgiving light, given the relatively low budget the game ended up having.\nI enjoy the direction of the game so far, with regards to combat mechanics, interface and  grafical choices, although the interrupt mechanics seems a bit clunky and confusing at the moment. Hopefully it will be ironed out pre- or post-release.\nOverall, I'm please with the effort so far, and look forward to the post-release support I've grown accustomed to from Space Hulk. Impressive effort on the limited budget.\n\nUpdate Feb 6th\n\nIt seems the post-realease support has been what I had hoped for, and many things have been added since the release, both promised and a little ekstra. Mods have already been made to enrich the experience and I've enjoyed my time since release. Few kinks remain, and the current build is well worth the asking price.

I really wanted this to be it and backed the project without hesitation. Now I kinda regret that decision, because it seems like this game had no hope to come nowhere near the masterpiece that is JA2.\n\nI haven't put a lot of time in the game, because I just don't feel like it. As others have said before me, the game is shallow, the UI is clunky etc. I'm really not that dissappointed anymore, since playing the beta a few times saw my hopes dwindle to rock bottom before the launch day. Yes the graphics are "updated" to 3D and all but the game just feels unintuitive and uninspired considering it's pedigree.\n\nI'd rather play JA2 with the 1.13 update over this. The thing is, JA2 is starting to be a bit too familiar and the game engine has it's inherent limitations and is starting to show it's age, although it's held up commendably to this day. I still have some hope left for this game, since there must be some patches coming even after the release. My hopes aren't set too high though, since the problems of JA Flashback seem to lie deep in the game design rather than in some easily fixable quirks and bugs.

This game brings back the turn based combat of JA2, it brings back many memorable mercs (like Hitman, Lynx, and Shadow). In some ways it feels a bit more simplified than JA2 was even in vanilla form, however, the core elements are still there.\n\nRight now I feel like the campaign is horribly short, JA2 was a far longer game with far more map space to explore. There are many JA2 features that the Flashback team wants to add, but these features are still in development, so in a way, in its current form Flashback is an incomplete product.\n\nTo that end however, I am still regularly impressed by the quality of content and features that the dev team regularly produces. New features are being introduced (we just got weapon attachments) and bugs are being fixed.\n\nSo what do I recommend? I recommend that if you are a Jagged Alliance fan, you buy this game. Please support these devs, they have actually done justice to the JA franchise. They have the support of The Bear's Pit modding community which has been responsible for the absolutely EPIC JA2 1.13 mod/patch, Shanga is already hard at work making mods for Flashback.\n\nHowever understand that many features that you might be expecting in the game for a technically released title are not there yet (vehicles come to mind, also missing "Bobby Ray's Guns n Things" mail order equipment), and be prepared for the fact that the current campaign map is painfully small/short.\n\n----- Pre-Launch Reviews ------\nThe Early Access price is a bit on the expensive side but I love JA2 and have many hundred hours logged on it. When the early access offer came up on STEAM, I jumped on it. I'm willing to take the risk and from what little I have played of the early access, these developers are on the right track with this Jagged Alliance.\n\nUPDATE: With each new pacth/content release, this game gets a bit better and better. Of the Alphas and Betas I've played, this one is playable.\n\nUPDATE 2: It is amazing how quickly this game has been supported and developed. Every early access content release was weighty and added new mechanics that were staples of the classic Jagged Alliance games. I'm honestly astonished.\n\nGiven that this is a Jagged Alliance title, I can't wait to see what the modding community does with this game.

I have been involved in the alpha and beta phase of development and waited to post this review so all the latest updates can be reflected in this review. There area lot of reviews out there farom gamers with < 5h of gameplay and some early version - so these review will not reflect the actual state of the game. Jagged Alliance Flashback is now up to date with attachments, stealth and more weapons and maps!\n\nSummary    If you are new to Jagged Alliance, the game will be mostly fun and new to you.\nIf you are a long time Jagged Alliance fan, you will but it anywas?! But you will find out that many features you would expect are missing and some are different, so let me say some are more basic. But you will get the best turn based combat  out there and the feeling of playing a Jagged Alliance title.\nIf you are a game modder you will find an editor and scripting language LUA. You can build you own mercenary title here.\nReviewFor both sides I will post some interesting aspects:\nNew players will love the 3D graphics and level design. It is so advanced in comparison to Jagged Alliance 2. Remember when you lost time by playing JA2 all night long? This will happen to, if you get over the first few maps and get the interesting gear and heavy enemies. You will get to create you own mercenary with questions like you are used to in Jagged Alliance.  If you go deeper, there are interesting story elements where you can decide if you wanna kill someone to be part of the factions. Unfortunetly the boss himself, the prince, did not appear for me after 40h of gameplay. Deidranna with story elements and Elliot was more present so you knew why you what you do. The NPCs are not voiced, so you really don't care enough for the population - JA2 was ar more serious and dark title. JA:F is a bit more friendly but hard in combat.\n\nLike     Real JA gameplay with old mercs we all love\nTurn based combat with real time when no enemy is present\nStealth system\nSquad inventory\nbetter indicators tactic wise (sound, cover!)\nlots of sidequests\nportraits in JA2 style (2D)\nmodding capabilities\nweapons and sound fx in generall very good\nsoundtrack overall ok, to fancy for me (jungle!), liked the silent soundtrack of the beta more\nregarding time and budget (1 year and 300k) the game is incredibly good.\nDon't like     UI and item management (frustrating)\nno voice overs for NPCs\nno animated portraits\nno sector inventory\nstrategic map and contract management too basic\nno battles with milita in one sector\nno real death animations like wasteland2 or JA2\nmultiple squads in one sector missing\ntown loyality missing\nno retreat system\nstory and scenario not really immersive\ninteraction between mercs is basic in comparison to JA2\nno roof tops (to be fair: due to budget from the beginning not supported by devs!)\nThe game has its rough edges but is fun to play and for real gamers: it is challenging as you really need to think before you shoot!\n\nIf anyone could fix the UI and item management and add voice overs and animated portraits, thing game would be a\n7-8/10 instantly.\n\nSo have fun and give it a tray and then get back to JA2 or JA2 1.13!","January 7, 2015","true","42.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

In about an hour of gameplay I haven't noticed any game-breaking bugs which is good. There's now quite much more content, new bullets, all that good stuff.\nBuuuuut, there are still plenty of issues:\n- It runs on 12-17 FPS on my GTX 970 when there's light on screen. Like, WAT? I can run almost all new games maxed out. And this one which is not even that graphically intensive gives 17 FPS, really?\n- Map view (sic!) runs on 10 FPS for me. If you wait a bit, it goes up to 20. But it's a Map View. Why?!\n- There are still a lot of small annoying bugs (e.g., pressing level up button generates level up sounds even when it's inactive)\n- AI still ignores positioning of it's own units and just shoots through them killing their own without problems.\n- Aiming is still a pain in ♥♥♥.\n- Still no combat log anywhere to be found.\n\nSo, still would not recommend.\n\n== As of v1.0 (release) ==\nThe game still has quite a potential, but ridden with bugs. And not just some random non-repeatable bugs, but stuff that can be quite easily reproduced (and wasn't present before actually). Like endless loading screen, disability to click after using grenade, etc.\nUI is not that good at communicating things. Well, may be aside from the combat stuff which is probably the best and most polished aspect of the game.\nAnd it's still missing some features, that was announced on kickstarter.\n\nThe devs did promised to fix everything and add more stuff in latter updated, but at the moment the game is sadly not something I'd recommend to anyone. May be in a few month?\n\nMore details in the video:\nhttp://youtu.be/m0TY_oGyEBA\n\n== As of v0.9.1 (pre-release): ==\nI'm sorry, but I have to change my review from "recommended" to "not recommended".\nThere is no way in a million years it's possible for a team of devs to finish all the missing features, polish the rough edges and fix the remaining bugs in the little time that's left until release (which  is Oct. 21st, so in like 10 days from now).\nThe saddest part is that the combat is fun. And there's still a ton of potential and interesting ideas.\nBut the lack of polish and bugfixing will just ruin it.\n\nThere is a slight chance that devs have a huge chunk of game hidden and they did not released it to Early Access users (why though?). And that at release day they will put that update up, and all will be good. But that chance is so minor that I have to go with "not recommended" before I see what happens at release :\\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttp://youtu.be/gZ_j7fcnCrQ\n\n\n== As of v0.2: ==\nThe game at the moment doesn't really have too much going for it - only pretty basic mechanics like shooting, walking and talking are available. Buuuut, so far this looks better than any other try to re-incarnate JA series.\n\nIf you are a fan - you probably want to support them.\nIf not - wait until next updates since at the moment there's not that much to do in the game.\n\nMore detailed overview in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otOwTBzre_E","May 17, 2014","false","7.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","2"

But this one deserves some love since it seems to be getting a ton of hate.\n\nI've been a HUGE JA fan ever since I found a boxed copy of JA2 in a clearance bin over 12 years ago.  I was really looking forward to this game but then was turned off by the horrid reviews that it received upon release.  I decided to just wait for a Steam sale and pick it up cheap.  I picked it up a few days ago and I'm actually pretty happy that I decided to give it a chance.  Is it as good as JA2?  No....that game is pretty tough to beat even after all these years.  This game doesn't have the amount of cool features that JA2 had and is not as immersive.  I miss the website/email UI and the merc interactions.  There are a few things that I wish were done better in this game and there are a few small bugs that weren't hammered out.\n\nBut having said that...this game is actually pretty good.  The combat is fun and the graphics are impressive once you get into the game.  Even though it misses a few things from the original games it still manages to capture the essence of what I enjoy about the JA franchise.  I can create my own merc, load him up with guns and gear (that actually are shown on the character model) and send him out to wage war.  There are a few great mods on the Workshop that really help improve the games camera and gun info.  ALL in all I would recommend this game to JA fans and newcomers to the series.  I hope that modders (or fingers crossed) the devs revisit this game and add more content and squash the remaining bugs.  It is soooo close to being a great JA game.  But even in it's current state it is FAR better than what some of the reviews are saying.

Still it's a little bit expensive for what offers so I suggest waiting for sales when the price goes down to something around £15. Anyway it still needs some further work to add very basic features (ie. a button to highlight all the object in the screen the user can interact with, a button to automatically sort the inventory or at least a way to let the player organize the squad inventory manually and so on).\nI know I don't have a lot of hours under my belt so I will probably come back to refine this review in the future.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter some more playing I decided to change my review from positive to negative because I think the effort they put after they published the game is not enough. This game has been published too soon and still feels incomplete. I would suggest buying this game for something like £10 or less. The more I play the less fun I get. The point is, as I said above, they fixed a lot of bugs so the game is fun enough but still lacks features and playability. I must say that "JA: Back in Action" is just more fun than this one so if you like the genre is probably better to replay one of their old games rather than spending further money on this one. I feel like there's lack of strategy, the gameplay is too repetitive and boring and there's no online store anymore. The merchants around are poor, they don't have plenty of choice and the time you would require to give your teams the proper equipment makes of all this less fun and doesn't give enough variety to the gameplay to keep you going on for hours. But let's spend a few words about the lack of strategy. If you're outnumbered like 4 with poor equipment vs 8 with bulletproof vests you can still easily win just hiding yourselves in a room and shooting everyone that comes through the door. They're stupid enough not to throw a grenade to you. Also the looting could be more varied and rich.","January 21, 2015","false","11.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It is a tactical game with enjoyable battles which follows the footsteps of the original Silent Storm maybe more closely than those of Jagged Alliance, but if you have played the SS saga you might agree with me in that this is not bad at all. It also has some timely influences from modern genre hits (XCOM, Shadowrun), such as the way cover works, and it brings back most of the classic JA mercenaries we know and love, with an art direction and management possibilities more consistent that those in the BitComposer JA remakes.\n\nAs of weak points, it also has some, so do not expect a great story like Shadowrun Dragonfall or the carefully tailored scenarios of JA2, as battles here are quicker and need less thought. Also each sector map is smaller, which takes out most of the joy of trying wild or careful approaches (you´ll find that simple flanking is often the greatest trick you can play).  Having said that, at the time of writing this review I have not finished the main mission, so if my impression changes in the endgame I´ll correct this. Finally, regarding bugs and problematic designs, all my complains at release have been taken care of in the latest patches, which also included new scenarios and items.\n\nIn a nutshell: If you are a hardcore tactical fan this is will be probably too simple for you. I had my hopes high for a JA3, and this is not one. However, I also find a lot of fun in more lighthearted experiences such as Shadowrun Returns, and I find this very close to it and accept it as so. Some months from now you´ll probably not remember your grand campaign to kill the Prince of San Hermanos, but you´ll have spent some very enjoyable hours kicking his...","January 6, 2015","true","9.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

It is a prequel to Jagged Alliance (1).\n\nThe main focus of the developer seems to have been the tactical combat (and allowing for modding - see below), and the tactical part is pretty solid - I absolutely love the fact that rifles and sniper rifles are less accurate at short range, thereby leaving a niche for handguns and submachineguns in the later game.\n\nThe game has a decent selection of weapons, from the lowly .38 revolver to awe inspiring sniper rifles and lmgs. Also a solid attachments system has been added, allowing you to attach scopes, expanded magazines, bipods, duckbills and other stuff to your weapon of choice.\n\nWhile the graphics are not revolutionary they do look very crisp and show solid craftmanship.\nThe music is quite catchy and very late 1980s ad while the gunshots are a bit flat, I think that the voice acting is very good and close to the spirit of the two former games.\n\nThere is a wide selection of mercenaries to choose from (both new and younger versions of merc from JA and JA2), and I've come accross many personal favorites such as Ice, Ivan, Lynx, Magic, Buzz and even Mike. Also IMP is in so you may design your own custom mercenary.\n\nThe game shows amazing modding potential and depending on your ambitions posibilities range from very simple (editing JSON files) to very complex (using Unity3d).\n\nI find myself spending more and more time with Jagged Alliance Flashback, and while it is not perfect and certainly no updated version of JA2, it is a solid game and one of my favorites right now.\n\nI rate i 8/10.","January 6, 2015","true","56.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Unfortunately, that shows just about everywhere.  The game opens with you as an the sole survivor of a covert CIA mission to assassinate a drug kingpin on his island.  A servicable plot, but rather than use a cut scene or even a slideshow, this is presented in a popup.  *All* of the non-essential NPCs were given away as Kickstarter rewards, so towns are populated by internet usernames spouting insufferable in-jokes.  The game engine is obviously some kind of game-maker-like product that feels very cheap.  The maps are genuinely gorgeous, but lack interaction: doors don't exist (no really, they're all open), I didn't see any kind of lootable objects, rooftops don't exist (JA without rooftop snipers?!?), livestock is immobile and immortal cover (seriously, goats count as heavy cover).  Whereas JA2 had a notoriously catchy soundtrack that cued the action perfectly, I heard no music whatsoever in this game.\n\nUltimately, it's an okay game, arguably better than JA: BiA.

Although it sounds corny and isn't very creative, it does work and provides a good environment for such a game.\nTo free this unlucky nation, you've got to hire some mercenaries that fight along your side. And, as you continue your journey to fill a truck with bodybags you're also allowed to do some quests. Some quests are even crucial to the story and without them you won't make any progression.\nAnyway, the entire thing feels like a free roam campaign. You've got your overall objective and it's up to you to figure out the best way to do it.\n\nAnd how does this game handle?\nFirst of all, I do like the game X-Com Enemy Unknown and I mean the new one. The thing with Jagged Alliance Flashback is that the combat is a lot like in the new X-Com Enemy Unknown. It's not hard to grasp and it can still be pretty challenging and exciting.\nThe selection of gear is also good. There're all kinds of things ranging from pistols to god knows what. Some are even really funny.\nThe graphics are good for such a game and the sound effects also. So, there's not much to complain there.\nBut, if there's one thing I don't like that much, then it's the camera. Something feels strange about it. Maybe it's the angle or the minimum and maximum zoom level and how it handles this. I'm not sure what it is, but it needs some tweaking.\n\nGameplay is also good. It's fun, interesting and it allows to employ your own ideas.\n\nSo, my verdict is a positive one.

First mods are being made, and I am confident this game is only at the very beginning of its evolution. JA2 wasn´t legendary when it was hitting the shelves. I think Flashback has potential. Let´s hope it can unfold.","January 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

If you want JA3, this is not it.\n\nThis game is on par with shadowrun in how it was developed and its feel. It feels like a small indie game but with a lot of modding options. I'm excited to see where the community takes it, like the near new game they made out of JA2.\n\nSome will ask what the point of this game is if it is not JA3. It is to keep JA alive after the unfinished mess of Back in Action. If this does well than turn based combat lives and JA3 will get funding. If not, or if this game wasn't made, then it all ends.\n\nIvan deserves more!","January 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

As an IT professional myself, I appreciate the way Full Control managed the Kickstarter campaign and despite the ups and downs they seemed to make good progress.\n\nWhen the first playable alpha version was released, I was impressed. However, the progress didn't go as fast as I had hoped towards a beta version. That being said however, I do appreciate the openness with which FC communicated to their backers what the progress was and whether they ran into obstacles. I cannot give them enough credit for incorporating feedback from backers during the early development stages - a thing that seems to be unheard of when compared to other EarlyAccess titles and Kickstarter game projects of the recent past (Spintires...)\n\nBottom line is: JA Flashback is a great little game with rough edges. I would recommend this game to true fans of the genre. Certainly, it broke with some of the JA "traditions", but hey, they never said they would do a remake with HD textures! So all you "hardcore" JA fans of the first hour: quit being grumpy old farts and try something new! :-)\nI like the game, I haven't spend nearly enough time with it yet but I will definitely play more of it soon and since there appears to be still active development going on, I am excited to learn what additional things might be added to the game.","January 16, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Did it succeed?  Not completely.  First off, if you're expecting Jagged Alliance 2, you'll be a bit disappointed.  Flashback is closer to JA1 than JA2, in my opinion.  That's not necessarily a terrible thing, though, as JA1 was a great game in its own right.\n\nSo let's dive into the details.  Like the games it is attempting to emulate, Jagged Alliance Flashback is a turn-based, tactical, squad strategy game with some RPG-lite elements.  You control squads of up to 6 mercenaries (you get to make one of your own then hire the rest), as many squads as you'd like, provided you can afford to hire them.  You get dropped off on a tropical island and are tasked with overthrowing a warlord.  The way you do this is by systematically taking over sectors to gain control of the island and capture areas that will generate revenue for you, allowing you to hire more mercs.  You can train militia in controlled sectors that will defend the area from enemy attacks.\n\nMercs, including the one you create, have stats and skills.  Stats go up when you level up while skills go up as you use them.  It's a very simple RPG-lite system where you have fairly little control of how your squad mates will evolve.  Beyond a short backstory, a different look, starting stats and skills, and different (often hilarious) barks, the hirable mercs are completely interchangeable and have no real personalities.  In fact, no one in the game has much personality beyond extremely simple motivations in the game, which is one of its biggest weaknesses.  The story is quite straightforaward and frankly pretty dull too.\n\nCombat is the meat of the game and is thankfully quite good.  It's obvious this is where most of the resources of development went into, and rightly so.  The combat is turn-based and really well executed, in my opinion.  I'd say that it's better in many respects than XCOM.  While your characters lack special abilities, the combat mechanics themselves are quite well implemented.  As you might expect, combat revolves around positioning, cover, and AP (action point) management.  Every action, whether a movement or firing a gun, requires a certain amount of AP.  If you don't have enough AP then you can't perform that action, simple as.  You can stand, crouch, or lie prone anywhere on the battlefield (it costs AP to change stances) and can move in each stance (run, sneak while crouched, and crawl).  Crawling costs more AP per distance than sneaking, snaking costs more than running).  Crouching and lying prone also gives both offensive and defensive bonuses and can make you or your target impossible to hit, due to cover.  There is an overwatch-like interrupt system too where you can save AP unused during your turn and an interrupt will trigger if an enemy walks into your cone of vision and you can spend AP to do whatever (fire, run, crouch, etc).  Line of sight is implemented quite well, and lighting, time of day, and weather both significantly impact gameplay as they play into line of sight and the fairly simple but well implemented stealth system.  Stealth uses line of sight, visibility, and noise (crawling makes less noise than running, firing a weapon without a silencer gives your relative direction away, etc).  It all works really well and makes for a satisfying turn-based tactical experience.\n\nVisually, while the game won't win any awards for graphical fidelity, I found the look of the game to be quite nice.  It uses a somewhat simplistic art style that purposely omits small details in favor of more solid shapes.  The highly saturated color palette works great with the tropical setting too.\n\nThe audio is pretty good too.  There is not much in the way of voice acting, besides some pretty funny barks, and there isn't a whole lot of music, so you'll be hearing the same combat music a lot.  The weapon sounds however are very punchy and satisfying, which adds a lot to the game.\n\nThe game is somewhat buggy.  Nothing game breaking, mostly little annoyances that can be put up with or worked around.  It's a somewhat rough around the edges budget title, but there's nothing I encountered that ruined my day.\n\nIf you like turn-based squad strategy then I would recommend this game, particularly if you're a fan of the old Jagged Alliance games.  just know that it;s closer to JA1 than JA2.  The game is far from perfect and has its share of shortcomings, but overall I thought the quality combat mechanics carried it and made it a satisfying experience.  I'd love to see Full Control make another JA game now that they have a framework and solid mechanics in place and could concentrate more on writing a better story with characters I might care about.","January 22, 2015","true","33.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

That said, there are lots of small annoyances, that hopefully get patched as time goes by.\nFirst of all, the game crashes regularly on my Mac.\nSecondly, there are several minor annoyances in-game: Whenever my soldiers enter a sector, their order is randomized and some are standing and some are crouching. Some icons are really small and barely clickable (like sector information/militia training). The UI feels kind of weird at times, sometimes I have the feeling my screen is too big (which it might as well be), sometimes it just isn't as responsive as I would expect.\nI can't much talk about the story, since I am just a couple hours in, but I have already encountered several side quests which seem really fun and appropriate.\nWith all that in mind, I am still looking forward to playing this game a couple more hours and remembering the memories of the past.

However, I am not a hardcore fundamentalist fan. What I like about the game is that, when you have properly tweaked it, you can usually play through whatever storyline has been made available fairly easily - that is, that the game is fun and satisfying. This means that I enjoyed Jagged Alliance: Back In Action quite a lot, which apparently many did not. It also means that I put some money into the Jagged Alliance: Flashback Kickstarter expecting pretty much the game that has emerged.\n\nJagged Alliance: Flashback is intended as a base upon which modders will create wonders. That is important, because it promises a lot of fun in the future. But the base itself is pleasant to play and, like other versions of the game, it tends to reward gamers in proportion to what they put into it. Saying that in another way, I like it better and better the more I play it. I think that most negative comments on this game (and JA: BIA) are from gamers who want a simple update of JA2 and have not played these later games on their own terms. Jagged Alliance: Flashback is already better than a good game, and there is every chance that modders will make it even better than that.","January 7, 2015","true","125.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

With that said, if you're a die-hard, JA series fan completely in love with JA2, you're not going to appreciate this game at all.\n\nIt took me a long while to look at this game in it's own right, not compairing it to JA2. When that factor is removed, it's actually a pretty solid game and can be rather enjoyable. The graphics are decent, game mechanics are pretty solid, and the story isn't too horrible: we've all played much, much worse. The biggest thing that I appreciated was Full Control bringing back the turn based game play.\n\nThey've been getting a lot of flack from backer's and customers, some with good reason, some without. Being huge fans of the series themselves, they undertook an extremely ambitious project to bring back the feel and passion that the origial and second game brought out in us. And, in my opinion, they've gotten it closer to that than any other developer has. It's not perfect, and it needs some decent polishing, but it's still a pretty fun game.\n\nIf I was to recommend this game, it would have to be a "Yes" with a "but" included.

Shooting at his torso would increase your chances of accuracy, but would only wound him. Instead you aim for the head and go for the killshot. You miss and immediately pay the price with your life. Restart mission.\n- Even as Early Access, the game has an active modding community that makes full use of the Steam Workshop. This could greatly increase your playtime with the game while waiting for its full release.\n- There are many systems in place that haven’t been fleshed out yet, but show great potential.\n- These include things like: XP skill progression system, equipment loadouts, and numerous weapon types\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game does not have a decent User Interface yet, which leads to confusing directives and less than intuitive menu navigation\n- Bugs, as expected, are numerous. Some examples:\n- Inventory management screens that won’t disappear after you leave them\n- Buying mercs that don’t show up on your next assignment\n- Stuck on a mission that won’t progress even after its objectives have been completed\n- There isn’t a full-fledged tutorial yet, which means I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the mechanics. I imagine I still haven’t quite figuring out the proper way to play the game.\n- This may just be my personal preference, but the camera is very difficult to manipulate. The default setting does not move with the arrows, but first needs to be rotated correctly. Not a game breaker, but a pain the butt none-the-less.\n- The depth to the game just isn’t there yet, which will turn away many that are looking for a deep Jagged Alliance experience. The story isn’t complete and the missions are not all implemented. Storylines are completely flushed out and characters aren’t fully developed.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nWhile the game doesn’t have the most realistic graphics, the blood and death are still present. I would not allow my children to watch me play it, but I imagine it would be fine for some that are more mature.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nThe version played was not complete, but I played what was there. The gameplay, as I mentioned before, was very enjoyable. I don’t imagine I will be firing it up again until the game is out of Early Access, however, because I definitely found myself wanting a deeper experience.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a redlight.\n\nJagged Alliance: Flashback is a great starting point for a long awaited reboot of the original Jagged Alliance games. However, the content that is currently available just isn’t worth the $44.99 asking price. At this point I can guarantee the game will be worth the wait when it comes out, but only purchase it at full price if you are willing to support developers that will do the Jagged Alliance brand the justice it deserves. Do not purchase it expecting a fulfilling gaming experience.\n\nReviewer:\n\nMisterS42\n\nA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com","June 16, 2014","false","12.9"," 56 of 111 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","56","111","0","0"

Yes there are still rough edges, yes it still needs content and no its certainly not better than jagged alliance 2 (in its current state at least).\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that Full control made a game with what they had, not what they wanted. The tactical combat foundation is there and with some content and polish it has the potential to become something truly special. The developers can only continue doing so if their product is supported.\n\nIn summery. If you are looking for a triple A title, look elsewhere. But if you are a fan of the series or turn based tactical games in general your at the right place. Its not the Jagged Alliance I came to know and love yet but there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Simple tasks like finding the right ammo in either a mercs inventory or the groups inventory is so difficult it's hard to believe any user testing was done at all.\n\nThe camera is a joke. It's way to close to the action, yet pulling it out pivots the angle so that it is directly looking down, but still not far enough out to give a good view of the battlefield.\n\nI put more effort into this review than they did this game.

A lot of the mercs you'll be familiar with are there and the gameplay is very similar to the original games.  Theres a good range of weapons (see mods note below) and all the ammo types you'd expect to find.  The overworld map works the same as the original games and militia can be trained to hold on to the places you liberate, allowing you to hire more mercs as the money starts rolling in.\nThe map isnt as large as the earlier games, and theres a few bits of questionable voice acting/script and they should have had a naming convention to stop some of the names of NPCs from Kickstarter backers only been funny if your 12 and still into purile humour - but they also seem to be at random and none game changing - so can be ignored.\nMy biggest niggle is some of the quest text isnt very helpful, so you end up doing a fair amount of headscratching saometimes for the ones that dont have a set location (most do - and they show an icon on the sector map, so those aren't an issue).\nI installed 4 mods just to help, The 3 info mods by Shanga - 2 for map icons and one that gives all the weapons proper names and reveals the bonuses from add-ons like scopes etc and handily lists on Ammo what weapons its used for.  The final mod was a small one to add toolkits / medkits to the basic shop, as i found very early on that the early enemies dont seem to drop them and i couldnt find any toolkits anywhere so had weapons starting to collapse.\nThe problems this game had during development are well documented and i wont bother going into them, but i dont think they affect the gameplay.\n","October 18, 2015","true","27.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","5"

This is not Jagged Alliance 2!” lynching mob I’ll say: I like this game.\n\nThere are many people around the forums accusing this game and the developers as a “cash grab” or similar terms, usually based on nostalgia reasons. As a Jagged Alliance fan of the very first hour myself, I can partly see where they are coming from. Compared to JA2, this game has much less content, the game world isn’t as vibrant and full of surprises and the voice acting that made the characters of JA2 so memorable has taken a step or two into the wrong direction.\n\nHowever, this game does have its merits and I dare even say some improvements over its “older brother”. These things can be a matter of opinion of course but I like: team inventory, weather influence (clearly shown on the tactical screen), number of enemies visible on the mercs icon, half/full cover visibility, much more clear how/when interrupts are occurring, panic mode, visible which enemies are/aren’t targetable from a new location etcetera. Also, I think the music is spot on.\n\nI have two major gripes with the game: One is the emphasis on loot, combined with the awkward way to obtain that loot. Pixel hunting is no fun at all, instead containers should have some visible clue when a merc is standing close. Second gripe is the lack of challenge: some enemies must of course come running towards you, but not all of them - especially not when they’ve seen all the others that went running before them die so easily. Some of the enemies should camp (easy fix, I would say?) or even try to flank you. Also, money never felt like a real problem because once you liberated the first mine you can just sit on it and watch your bank account grow. A “hard” or “iron man” mode would certainly help.\n\nAll things considered, I think my 7 euros (I bought it during a sale, mostly because of the bad reviews) were well spent. Just don’t expect the richness of JA2, and for those people that are still waiting for that worthy successor: please stop making claims like “even the graphics were better in JA2” and stop your “piece of crap not worthy of the name” rants without even a single reason why or any constructive criticism. You are not helping. Instead, you might even scare future developers away from this already niche genre.\n","February 19, 2015","true","47.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","3"

Not a chance here.\n\nBeing able to relatively see with ease the bullets you pick up type and the bullet types for the guns is such a hindrance and annoyance.\n\nThe game has missed out explaining what some of the keys on the keyboard do (still not sure which button it is for quick save).\n\nThe lack of choice in mercs to choose from, the starting amount of money is pitiful.\n\nThe first screen has you up against 3 guys which means lots of Reloading until you beat them. The first screen, the very beginning of the game. You might think they would help ease you in but thats not acceptable. Is it a case of making it so tough that people dont see how badly this was developed?\n\nThe unability to have 2 TEAMS in 1 square for a battle is preposterous. Possibly my biggest gripe.\n\nThere is virtually no help in your missions except one line which is as bare as the effort thats gone into making this game. This is very confusing.\n\nThe controls are messed up and confusing, you can easily accidentally send a merc some place you didnt mean to and in between battles the whole group will automatically stop if you change 1 mercs direction. That is so infuriating.\n\nAlso gone are the amount of voice lines that build a mercs personality and the easy transsfer of items to mercs.\n\nHonestly, this has really messy controls unlike JA2 which seems so divine in comparison.\n\nAnd then one of the best things about JA2, a simple option was to reduce the trees to tree stumps so you can easily see your mercs. Not in this monstrosity. You CAN move the screen round which is a step up from JA2, but with all the trees, and theres millions of them, its annoying.\n\nI am a very big fan of JA2, and its on such a high pedestal, but this has been a streamlined and annoying hastily made game.\n\nPerhaps this game has been dumbed down so much that its gone beyond enjoyment for me. But I really am disgusted with the developers. It has completely missed the excellence of JA2 and I find it insulting they have released this degenerative mess.\n","January 22, 2015","false","10.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

Instant gratification was never particularly my cup of tea anyway :)\n\nI'm only a few hours in, but I'm having fun playing so far. I enjoy the updated graphics and the overall combat seems polished and engaging, even though the game goes easy on you to being with. While the AI is not blowing me away, I did get surprised by a few choice sneakers here and there.\nThe story is a bit bland, but keeps the tempo going and the occational random bark from npcs makes me smile. There is a nice variety of weaponry(although they seemingly weren't allowed to use official names, due to legal barriers I presume) and though some might find the mood of the merc hiring dated and simple, I think it captures that 80's feel nicely. My only real gripe is with the somewhat clunky UI, that leaves a lot to be desired, and hampers play in the beginning, but you find a way to work around it and it's not something i'll lose sleep over :)\n\nI am, naturally, saddened by the news that the developers have had to let most of the team go, and have stopped making new games, due to the poor reception. But they've said they will continue to support their current titles as best as possible, so I'm sure they will bounce back, while adressing that annoying, though hardly game-breaking, prone bug for us females.\nSo far, I do recommend this game, especially at the new reduced standard price. Should you find it in a sale, I would recommend it even more so.\n\nUpdate May 6th\n\nI've now gotten a lot further into the game, and it hasn't changed my overall opinion. While the story still is a weak point, the combat remains solid and challenging, while giving me many different equipment setup to try and experiment with. I've actually gotten used to the ui by now, and it's not really the issue some people are making ti out to be. Maybe playing more then half an hour would soften things up, eh ? :)\nAnd no more proning females!","March 28, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","1"

It needs to be freely rotatable. There is nothing more annoying than having to spend time constantly mucking around with the camera to be able to see whats happening behind buildings and trees.\nThere are also major issues with the interrupt system, cover system and LOS.\nThe AI could do with a lot more work as well.\n\nPut these together with a few seemingly easy to fix interface and feedback issues and you have a game that is unpolished and difficult to become immersed in.\n\nI just started a new campaign on JA:BIA with the rebalancing mod.

I'd say it was my first kickstarter disappointment. Part of the problem may have been that I finished Shadowrun Returns and Wasteland 2 first, so my expectations going into JA:F were very high. Right from character creation, JA:F was confusing and frustating. I had to look up a guide to get the perks I wanted for my custom character, and I'm still not sure how some attributes and skills are connected. The benefits of training militia are unclear. I never was able to win a fight with militia, and militia can't join you even if you're in the same sector when attacked. Combat and the overall campaign felt futile. For every sector I'd take over, I'd lose another on the other side of the island. So it became a constant retreadding over the same territory. I wouldn't mind if ammo was scarce, but enemy weapons often just disappear. Stealth proved inconsistently effective as well. Perhaps the most frustrating part was the lack of clear mission markers and clunky UI. I would often have to return to a sector to hunt down the person who gave me a mission without remembering where they were. The locations all look extremely similar, so memorizing an NPC location is extremely difficult. I've covered this review without mentioning graphics, because for me, mediocre graphics are much less important than good gameplay. I stuck it out through countless reloads before finally ragequitting and uninstalling. I'll give the developers credit: They delivered the game the promised; it's just not particularly fun to play.","January 12, 2015","false","38.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

This game is a poor update of a classic series with little to recommend it to veterans of the previous JAG, Silent Sentinel, Xcom, etc., games.  I disagree with those who say this game is like the original -- it's far from  being that.\n\nThe detailed control of your mercs is gone.  You can run, crouch, or lie down, but you cannot walk.  You do not control the attributes of a merc when he/she levels.  You can't hide/unhide.  Weight is no longer a factor, my merc is carrying a rifle, a machine gun, two pistols, ammo for the above, plus several more items.  What the mercs can't hold on their persons is kept in a squad pack (maybe they pull a little red wagon behind them with all this stuff in it).  Your gear is limited by the number of slots.\n\nThis is a ONE LEVEL game as far as I can tell, still being early in the game.  No hiding in holes, climbing on rocks, wading into deep water.  Lots of pretty trees, flowers, cows, pigs, etc., though.\n\nYou hire mercs from a pool of them that contains some of your lesser favorites from before, and none of your favorites (okay, none of mine).  At any given point, a third of them are "away" and unavailable.  Each merc charges by the day, week, or 2 week period and they are not cheap.  Yet I feel the game forces you to create a party very early in the game because the enemy forces quickly become large (6-8 troops) who are heavily aremed.\n\nThis is another example of a solid meaty game being updated by exchanging the meat for tofu.","December 4, 2014","false","139.8"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

I'm an old JA2 fan too but it's not fair to reject it right away simply because it's not a new JA2.\n\nThe game has been out for TWO days and the devs have already launched a couple of patches. They have promised that more patches will come soon, including a better shopping interface and more weapons and attachments.\nSo give it a chance.\n\n+++++ POSITIVE +++++\n* Good music and sound fx\n* A lot of the graphics are reminiscent of the old game (e.g. character portraits)\n* Cool character creation quiz\n* Pretty nice environments (I can see a lot of building blocks for modding purposes)\n* Nice transitions from night to day. When future patches makes stealth a viable option, night missions will be cool\n* Rotating the map 90 degress is practical and looks nice. I use it a lot\n* Character animations are cool. My mercs look badass when they are moving in on the enemy\n* It just runs on my PC - no setup, no crashes, nothing\n\n------- NEGATIVE-------\n* Tree tops blocking my view. They need to be transparent\n* Sometimes the AI acts strange (like an enemy standing on the same spot being shot for several rounds without running or figthing back)\n* I would like more visual options in character creation (e.g. more faces and hairstyles)\n* Tactical bugs related to cover need to be fixed (e.g. line of sight behind cover doesn't always make sense)\n* Stealth needs to be a truly viable option\n* Some NPC names are too stupid (I also contributed with a name but it was not THAT stupid)\n* Minor UI bugs (e.g. sometimes you can't see the whole list of save games and the save button)\n\nAll in all the game is enjoyable. But I think that it was released a bit too early. It needs some updates fixing some of the tactical problems.

In addition the developer repeatedly displays contempt towards their Kickstarter backers who are critical of the game, they threaten to stop development if they don't get better reviews, and they say updates that still don't bring all the features they promised backers are "gifts" that everyone should be grateful for.\nOh and Kickstarter backers who pledged extra money just to have their name credited on the website still haven't been credited. None of them.\n\nHere's a list of some of the things Full Control promised during the Kickstarter period and didn't put in the "finished" game. They said that this is what the minimum Kickstarter funding goal would achieve:\n\n- Base management with mercenary training facilities\n- Inter-team personalities. Discussions between your mercs. Different merc combinations would affect performance based on how they get along.\n- Researching new weapon upgrades\n- Upgrading captured villages\n- A waaaaaaay more complex story with at least 4-5 different factions and you have to choose which ones to trust, and how to gain their favour. Angering certain factions by killing their men would result in them hunting you. Hard choices. Shades of grey.\n- A proper JA2 style tactical game. This is a direct quote from Full Control during the Kickstarter funding period: "Flashback will be using the same mechanics for the tactical layer as Jagged Alliance 2. We are NOT dumbing anything down or replacing complexity with simplicity."\n- Promised translations missing\n- Skill trees for weapons based on practice with them\n- Building fortifications\n- Helicopter pads for your base\n- Building repair shops, medical facilities\n- A shooting range\n- 10 "bonus" sectors with specific themes that were unlocked as stretch goals (only a few of them actually got put in the game)\n- Destroying enemy facilities to stop them utilizing them\n- Multiple height levels\n- Visually aiding the player with movement paths and weapon ranges\n- Non lethal combat options\n- Dual weilding small weapons (A "must have" feature according to Full Control)\n- Night ops being a "core part" of the game\n- An in game radio station which covers events on the island as they happen\n- ETC.","January 7, 2015","false","41.5"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","18"

At least the portraits are there.\n\n-IMP\nIt's there and it's ace.\nYou get a set of 12 questions that you answer and that gives you perks according to how you've answered. It's pretty much just as you remembered it in JA2.\n\n-World Map\nIt's tiny, there are around 20 or so sectors which are occupied by the enemy and the number of enemies in each sector will never go above 9 for some reason.\nThe sector maps aren't that much larger either but that doesn't matter as you'll more than likely find all the enemy soldiers in the same spot.\n\n-Leveling\nYou get xp for hitting your enemies and completing quests.

Back in Action was almost a 3D high def reboot but fell short in many ways. Anyway, I digress!

Flashback gameplay feels much more like the "classic" Jagged Alliance 1, it is smaller in scale than Jagged Aliance 2 and offers less interactions. Back in Action was a (failed, in my opinion) attempt to create a Jagged Alliance game with a modern style. I really disliked its "Plan and Go" real-time / pause mode, and think the re-enactment of JA2s story was weird at best.\n\nI am a huge fan of the Jagged Alliance series, I own (and played) all the games, and I do think JA2 and especially the fan-made 1.13 version are the pinnacle of the series - JA2 1.13 is THE one game I would choose for that shipwrecked-on-an-island scenario. Jagged Alliance Flashback is no match for it, but still a good game that I never regretted backing on Kickstarter, and it is WAY better than the bad reviews it is getting right now, shortly after its release.","October 30, 2014","true","34.0"," 15 of 37 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","15","37","0","0"

There are some weaknesses in this game. There are problems in dealing with the environment. For example, you can't close doors, swim, climb on roofs or boxes.\n\n\nAs for good things, they are:\n\n- Pretty nice graphics.\n\n- Rather good atmosphere: music, humor...\n\n- Lack of equipment (not types of equipment). You need to think and to use stuff carefully. It is possible to run out of ammo or bandage. I reminds me good old times of JA1.\n\n- Different battle conditions. In some sectors at night especially if it is raining cats and dogs guys like Bull can kill all the enemies without using guns. Only melee combat. But in other sectors you need a sniper. So you should have different people in your squad and use them in proper way. I think, now there is no best type of a merc with equipment to be extremely effective in any situation,\n\n- You have to control strategic map and carefully follow your enemies movements.\n\n\nNow I've finished the game. And I think it is rather comfortable to play.\n\n\nAlso we can expect some upgrades from the community. JA2 has really cool modding squads and The Bears Pit is already in business. FC knows about modders and promised to help them.\n\n\nI would recommend to play this game, through it is not as good as JA2 is.\n\nUPD The game became much better with the patches. New stuff was added. A lot of bugs were fixed.","October 24, 2014","true","16.4"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","0"

Because it still lacks core elements JA2 had!\n\nGampePlay 4/10\nFeels claustrofobic, and as I said its a downgrade in general.\nIt gets a 4 only because its a turn based tactical game, and I like those.\nBut almost any other game out there did it better...\nAnd to have the JA name written all over it just saddens me... :(\n\nAs far as a "story" goes, I was really interested in a prequal to JA. That will explain how the organisation was founded.\nIf you expect any kind of story form this game... you will only find disapointment.\nThey managed somehow to make the world feel even emptier then JA2 was...\nMostly because of the total lack of attention to the small things... like a certain flower shop... or CUTSENES!\nHow can you ♥♥♥♥ that up?\nAll you had to do, is COPY FROM THE ORIGINAL...\nSTORY 0/10\n\nThe only good thing about it, is its modability... and Shanga did some really nice work.\nBut who will want to seriousely mod a bad game?\nModders need to work night and day to even bring it to the lvl of JA2 not to mention 1.13\nWhich was what I payed full control to do.\n\nHorrible game, only revisit after Full Contol are bankrupt and the game sells for penuts.\nHopefully by then, modders fixed evrything missing and wrong with this.\n\nAlso, dont mind the few hours I have on this.\nI mostly played this at a friends house.\nWhat was supposed to be a celebration of a new JA game, quickly turned into us mocking the game while we took turns on each map. We both stopped following the development of the game, after we saw it was not really going well (the AC fiasco) and deliberatly didnt play the unfinished versions... so the surprise was genuine!\nI think I have ~60h under my belt.\nMore than enough...\nI just cant be bothered to play this game alone... waiting for more mods... then maybe.\n","January 6, 2015","false","8.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","5"

I've played all JA games and many mods.\n\nWith left click you run around and pick up dropped items(gun armor helmet). With right you change your MERCs view-angle, how precise you want to shoot, single and "burst"(3 single shots) and your stances. In inventory you can equip head, face(sun glasses/night vision?) torso and leg, you have 14 inventory slots and your skills are displayed there. You have 6 skills and 3 stats. On your "laptop" button you can move around on the map with left click and then deploy. Thas it. That is the current state of the game. That is pretty much all you get to do in this game.\n\nThe graphic and environment made me relate to the "cute and niiiiice" games my girlfriend likes to play(Cartoon). Compared to this, JA 2 is more raw/wild and Realistic and JABIA is more detailed(also realistic).\n\nThe lack of weapons and attachment varieties, as well as all those beloved features that made us love JA2 so much doesn't bother me(yet), since it's still coming.\n\nIn my opinion, this game will never be THE JA3 all the JA fans are waiting for. The atmosphere of JA2 will not resurface in this  game due to this cartoon-like game look, however awesome the released and modded versions of JAF are going to be.\n\nBut JAF might turn out to be a different but interesting game, and here's me hoping.\n\nI bought this game having read some reviews and watched some YT videos. I knew what I was getting into, I bought it merely in respect of the JA franchise and I do encourage anyone with enough money lying around to get it and support the devs. Anyone looking for a half finished game or long hours of entertainment should, for now, look elsewhere.","May 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 53 of 121 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","53","121","0","7"

While I dont mind the style of the overall game, the portraits (especially the lack of options for a custom merc) are ....well....sad for a JA game.\n\nFC jumped up and down saying that THIS is the successor to JA2 and they would make it the true version of that, but so far I am not seeing it.\n\nI understand...low budget etc etc etc.\n\nI backed the game @ 25.00, but honestly....I feel a bit cheated since now I can get the same game for less.\n\nAnd while my 25.00 helped fund them....I'm still a bit disappointed with that price.\n\nThis sounds mean, but anyone that spend more than 25.00 got screwed.\n\nI'm not terribly TOO far into the game and like i said, I do enjoy it, there is just so many things missing and it DOES NOT flow like a true JA2 successor.

I got the feeling that there are many aspects to explore on how to min-max the fights and different strategies. I only played the first sectors that were not so challenging yet, so I really only used one kind of aim and worked with positioning (going into cover, popping out of cover, waiting behind walls with interrupt and so on) But i have the feeling that there is still a lot to explore, like min-maxing weapons and mercs, maybe playing with the moral and energy System. I'm really looking forward to the "hard" fights that won't work on the first and second try, i believe that's when the game will become very interesting.\nThe last turn based game I've played that i can compare it to was Blackguards. Blackguards was more expensive and polished and smooth but i got bored pretty fast, it's too stream lined and you don't get the feeling that the world is actually alive, it's just a series of puzzles with nice scripted transitions.\nWith Jagged Alliance Flashback those nice transitions are missing, you kind of get thrown into the world and have to figure out what is actually going on and who are those guys that you have to fight for and against (which is hard if you don't like to read in games). But what makes it better than blackguards is that you actually are playing in a living world. Moving on the global map is not for free it costs money and time and the chance of being attacked. Also in sectors you can't just stand around and take forever to manage your inventory because chances are a roaming enemy will discover you.\n\nAllot of people seem disappointed because they compare it to the old Jagged Alliance games. I can not make this comparison.\nAfter playing a little I've got the feeling that theres is a lot of interesting gameplay still ahead of me, and strategic challenges motivate me more than nice cutscenes.\n\nThat's why this game deserves a thumbs up from me and another one of course for the Linux compatibility ;-)\n\nwill try to update this review after I played some more.","October 23, 2014","true","5.5"," 14 of 40 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","14","40","0","0"

The environments themselves also goes along with the feel of the game to create a lovely experience, both graphically and thanks to splendid level variation through the islands with towns, bases, prisons, junkyards and even a bear pit!\n\nI enjoy the battles in said environments and I also like to spend a lot of my time in the world map that has a lot of enemy movement so that you have to be tactical and plan ahead with what you conquer and where you decide to plant your squads, giving time for your militia to grow.\n\nIt's astounding what such a small amount of money, for companies in the game industry at least, can create.  I've had and will keep having a great time with this one.","October 23, 2014","true","25.8"," 11 of 40 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","11","40","0","0"
