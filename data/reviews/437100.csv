I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nMy Night Job is fairly simple as your goal is to save 100 survivors from an abandoned mansion as you are also trying to make sure you do not die and hope that the mansion is not destroyed by its monstrous guests. Do this by using various environmental objects to kill the monsters. This is not an easy game by far and there are tributes to classics all around the mansion. The tributes include the different areas of the mansion and six special survivors you can recuse which give you certain bonuses. An example of one of these is the girl from the ring which you can rescue through one of the televisions within the residence.\n\nThe game controls are simple and My Night Job is easy to get into, but sadly after a while it does not have replayability. Nothing is really added or given to you to truly change each experience except the special survivor locations changing every time. Even with the lack of replayability is does have a nice concept, interesting interactions, and even a highscore system for the competitive few.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe graphics are pixelated and made to match with the music and style of the game to create a old school feel and bit of nostalgia with the different environments, creatures, and certain characters. The music is enjoyable especially with the introductory little cinematic. The detail to the environment is noticeable and is able to be appreciated as you inspect it.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Easy to get into\n+ Lots of references to classic horror\n+ Nicely detailed environment\n+ Unique survivors give you bonuses\n+ Great interaction with environment\n+ Challenging\n\nCons\n\n- Can easily get repetitive\n- Mansion layout is always constant, again not adding to the replayability\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe game is easy to get into, but does not contain very much to have kept my full attention with nothing new really offered, thus making most of my playthrough the same and very repetitive. I loved the references to classics and the detail of the environment along with the old school feel. Overall I would say worth it for the references and the initial gameplay since I was able to enjoy it quite a bit, however again seems to easily get repetitive\n\nTL;DR\nNot much replayability currently within the game to date, however it is an easy game to pick up, and it is nice to play with all of its references within creatures and areas within the mansion. The music is nice and the environment is quite detailed. If you are able to appreciate the detail and the reference to classics this might be a title for you, overall a recomendable title.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 4","true","10.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/437100/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Cartoon-styled side-scrolling beat'em up game with surprisingly complex and challenging mechanic.\n\nBasically, you're dropped just outside of some big mansion, filled with respawning monsters and "civilians", as well as some items you can use as weapons - from umbrellas and chairs to gas baloons and everyone's favourite - the Chainsaw!\nIn short, you beat monsters, gather people and led them to rescue (helipads on the edges of the mansion). For each rescue you collect some goodness, like healthkits, guns with ammo etc. After you rescue 100 people, your main goal changing to blow up the mansion, by settling some C4 in the basement. Meanwhile, as you running back and forth through the area, the monsters are growing their numbers, and if they reach some trigger point, they starting to tear the mansion apart - yeah, before you'll be able to save everyone and leave the place.\n\nSo, you're not simple bash some monsters - that's the lesser goal, while the three main things are to save people, prevent monsters to crush the house prematurely, and only after you save enough, then blow everything. In The Right Time. Also, you can hunt achievements (such as bash 20 gargoyles with bare hands or save 1000 people), and then Activate those trophies in the Secret Room of the mansion, to get some powerups for that (only 2 at the time, though).\n\nSo, yeah, it is quite a challenge. If you're can tolerate a bit of goofy cartoon animation, at its core, the game is quite a solid one. As many people said already, it could only be more fun in some co-op play, which so far is not aviable.\nNonetheless, I recommend "My Night Job" to everyone. It's 8.2/10 mark in my book, for the complexity and overall fun.","April 22","true","4.7"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","26","36","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/437100/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","My Night Job is a beat 'em up sidescroller with retro graphics, fast paced gameplay and an enjoyable soundtrack.\n\nIn My Night Job you find yourself in an old abandoned mansion which is slowly being taken over by hordes of the undead (and other little nasties). Your job is to stop the mansion from becoming overrun by the zombiesque creatures whilst finding and escorting survivors to safety via a helicopter. The gameplay itself is very fun if not a little on the basic side; you'll find various weapons around the map and you must use those to kill as many of the undead as you can whilst evacuating survivors to key locations.\n\nThere are multiple rooms in the mansion, all connected to each other in some way and you must navigate through looking for anyone who is still alive. There is a limit on how many survivors you can have with you at once, but worry not, there are evacuation points located around the map where you can drop your survivors off for various rewards (health pack, a loaded gun or cash). When you start you only have your fists as weapons but there are plenty of new things to find that you can kill the zombies with. Most of the weapons in game are melee with the exception of guns (which so far I've only been able to get randomly from the evac point) so be prepared for plenty of close up combat. The weapons seem to come in two varieties, the first being your usual sword-style attack weapons. Things like plates, fish and umbrellas all fall into this category as they do one hit at a time with a small range that only affects those in front of you. The second are AOE weapons and these do damage over an area wiping out many zombies at once. Though MUCH superior in attack damage these weapons have significantly less durability than the other weapons. There is also the very awesome chainsaw which can only be found in one location but can destroy room after room of undead with very little effort; perfect for when you're being stomped in too many rooms.\n\nYou'll come across two types of survivors whilst you play: normal and VIP. Normal survivors do nothing special and can be found waiting in rooms in the mansion to be rescued. Some of these survivors will have weapons and others will be completely helpless so you'll have to make sure you have something to defend them because they can and will be attacked whilst waiting for you to rescue them AND while being escorted to safety. The second type are VIPs which can be found by activating certain icons you find in rooms. It seems to be random if you get a VIP or nothing but when you get one you should try and rescue them ASAP. Once you escort a VIP survivor to the evac zone you'll get an added bonus power-up that can be activated one time. For example one of these turns you into a clown that does increased attack damage but can only use fists for a while and another releases a rather angry sounding cat that'll clear the current room for you. These small bonuses can completely turn the tide of the game for you.\n\nThere are different types of enemies but most of them are just basic melee attackers with different speeds (besides the odd SuperRobot with guns for hands) and they can be killed pretty easily but make sure to watch your health bar because they can deal lots of damage before you even realise. The undead will attack you and survivors whilst you share a room and slowly fill the rooms you don't occupy. One a room is filled with zombies they will not attack you when you enter and instead start 'stomping', you must stop this happening as quickly as you can. After stomping long enough the room will collapse and once all the rooms collapse you've lost. Survivors cannot spawn in destroyed rooms so the more rooms that are destroyed the less people you can rescue thus making your game a lot harder. Rooms are colour-coded on your map so you can tell the danger levels in each room and quickly work out where you need to go and the best route (I must mention the layout of the mansion is a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times).  I really hate the minimap, it would be a godsend if you could adjust the size and/or placement\nYou can unlock Steam achievements that can then be activated in game for bonuses for that run such as speed boosts, so there is an added incentive to go achievement hunting.\nOnce you die, you're dead and you must start again from the beginning.Your achievements are still unlocked though and can still be activated in the special room in the mansion, but other than that there is no progress saved.\n\nThere are a few problems with the game thoiugh. Firstly the weapon balance seems a little off in my opinion. Despite AOE weapons having less durability they are still the best option because of the lack of the players health in the game. I think the normal weapons need a bit of a damage boost. Secondly, the lack of tutorial is a real issue. Besides how to move and attack nothing else is explained and you'll have to work things out on your own. VIP survivors need an explanation on how to activate them and what they do when rescued, the purple ghost thing you find on top floor also needs an explanation because right now I have no idea what to do with him, and despite there being a goal of setting explosions I still have no clue how to do this. This may be a later objective but I have no way of knowing if this is the case or not. Lastly I do feel the game could do with another way to regain health than hoping for it randomly as an evac bonus, I'm spending far too much time running 3 or 4 survivors to the helicopter just in the hopes of getting some health. I'll also add that I've noticed that if I rescue 3 or 10 survivors at once the bonus is the same besides cash making it a lot more efficient to do small batches rather than large even though it's more fun to collect as many survivors as you can at once. You should be rewarded on the number you bring (more gun durability, spare health packs).\n\nOverall, My Night Job is a very fun casual beat 'em up game and a welcome addition to Steam. Perfect for those who aren't looking for a story; anyone who enjoys games that feel like they'd fit perfectly on a retro arcade machine should give this one a shot as you won't be disappointed.","April 24","true","4.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n\nIntro\nMy Night Job is a side-scroller beat’em up taking place in a gigantic mansion filled with a variety of different monsters. Your goal is to lead as many survivors you find throughout the mansion to evacuation points while staying alive. When too many monsters accumulate inside a room, they start stomping and damaging the mansion and the game ends when either your health bar or the mansion's health bar falls to zero.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are very old school but retain a certain charm behind them. Even with many characters on screen at once, the graphics are very smooth and you can always keep track of your character.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is very straightforward. You either move left or right, and you can jump, attack, or dodge. You start out only armed with your fists but there are plenty of weapons you can pick up while moving around the mansion, ranging from couches to refrigerators. All weapons either have a ammo count or limited durability forcing you to constantly be on the lookout for new weapons to pick up. You also receive bonus health or ammo depending on the numbers of survivors you lead to an evacuation point. Special survivors also grant bonus power-ups upon being rescued, giving you abilities such as revival upon death or increased melee damage.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros:\n•       Very easy to pick up and a single play session does not last very long.\n•	Achievements you unlock grant you permanent bonuses such as increased speed/health but you must unlock them  •	from a secret room in the mansion first\n•	Unique blend of survival horror and beat'em up\n\nCons:\n•	Tutorial could be more in depth going beyond basic controls\n•	Weapons are either really strong or weak, enemies usually die in one hit so weapons that have high splash damage •	•	reign supreme above others\n•	Lack of a story\n\nOverall Thoughts\n\nThis is a solid beat'em up game that is great for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. At the moment only single player is supported although I feel this game has great potential for supporting Co-op.\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group  here","April 21","true","3.5"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","24","34","9","1"

The game is pretty hard and will require you to be quicky- and a tad lucky- to be able to complete it. Sadly the amount of retries means it can get repetitive pretty quickly as the mansion stays the same and so do your objectives: sure there's a bit of randomization in survivor positions and room attacks but not enough to keep things fresh. And once you beat it, well, you're left with trying to go for an higher score or unlocking achievements (some are pretty grindy).\n\nMy Night Job is really fun and should be right down your alley if you like challenging beat'em ups, but the small amount of content and its intrinsic repetitiveness are things you'd consider before you buy.","April 24","true","6.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

If you die or the mansion is destroyed, the game ends and you register your score just like in a arcade (by using only 3 letters and/ or numbers).\n\nThe mansion gets destroyed if any 4 of its rooms are destroyed. No room is the same: they all are very detailed and they all look different. There are also "secret" rooms that do not appear on the map.\nIn your way, there are a great variety of monsters. To be able to face them, you have an even greater selection of objects, which can be used as weapons, at your disposal. Each object has different range and damage but there's a limit on much you can use them since they will degrade from use. Usually, heavier objects do more damage but they also get destroyed faster.  Some objects can also turn against you,  like the (carnivore) plants.\nIf the character is not holding any object it will fight barehanded.\nPeople / "hostages" will follow you when you pass by them and they will be rescued when you arrive at one of several helicopter's landing pads. Rescuing them will earn you money and, sometimes, weapons or HP boosters. To receive upgrades you have to rescue special characters (there is 6 of them). There are also a few upgrades scattered around the mansion.\nAll hostages have HP, meaning they can die if you are not careful. They can also attack monsters but they do it at a slower rate, so be careful. There's a limit on how many people you can have following you and if you exceed itm some will be left behind until you save the ones who are following you or if they die.\nAchievements do, actually, have a purpose in this game: they will give you bonuses.\nAlthough they are few, this game also has its shortcomings. One of which, is the fact that there is only one map to play with (reason why, I would advise to wait for it to have a discount)\n\nNOTE: I found a bug while playing this game (the achievements didn't register on steam) but the developers quickly fixed it.","May 21","true","3.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I absolutely loved My Night Job from the moment I first installed it and began playing.   Something about running through a mansion slaughtering wave after wave of creatures using every type of weapon imaginable just comes across as fun.  I loved the numerous references to movies, such as the girl from the Ring..  (awesome touch).   Really reminded me of those games I'd play at the China Dragon across from my house.  The Chinese Dragon was Chinese food take out place, with numerous arcade machines, kids from the neighborhood would spend hour in there, trying to beat out high scores..   It was glorious just like this game, kick back and enjoy trying to beat your high score over and over again..\n\nStory\n(no real story exist but I made one up in my head) You are Mr. Ponytail McHipster, totally in debt, because what hipster isn't behind in his bills...  Sitting in his recliner, drinking some beer, watching some rock videos, when suddenly a commercial hits, the Army needs YOU, and they are paying loads of cash...  Immediately Ponytail knows what he needs to do, after a quick phone call, and a few handshakes later, McHipster is tossed out of a plane with a walkie talkie and instructions that he needs to kill monsters, save people, and protect the mansion.\n\nGameplay\nAmazing side scroller action, loads of weapons, like film reels, chain saws, shotguns, potted plants and wooden chairs.  The mansion is made up of various rooms, inside the rooms you'll find monsters, various weapons (60 weapons exist, or go all Bruce Lee and fight with your bare hands) Also in the rooms you'll find a hodge podge of various people you have to rescue and take to one of four helicopter ports for rescue.  Saving them give you money, you'll also receive a random gift, whether it's extra money, some healing, or maybe even a nice weapon to help slaughter the hordes of creatures you'll encounter.\n\nThe weapons you pick up have a durability bar, which adds some strategy into the game, go into a new room with a nearly broken chair and you run the risk of death or being seriously hurt, pick up a chainsaw and run from room to room like a manic can be fun, but pay attention because once that Chainsaw runs out you'll be left totally exposed..\n\nOccasionally the survivors will give you some extra benefits, like an adrenaline shot that revives you when you die, or a key, others give you attack buffs or a special cat attack that clears out your current room.  Many of the survivors are special references to pop cultural, horror movies, etc etc etc.  This game plays like a hot knife through butter, silky smooth, it gives off a very 80's horror feel.  Fast paced keeping the gamer on the edge of his seat until the very end.\n\nPro's Fun to play\nSilky Smooth controls\npick up and play game,\nfairly challenging without being frustrating\nThrowback to the high score games we got in the late 80's and early 90's\n\n\nCon's\nCan be fairly repetitive,\nMight have been nice if some open story existed,\n\nRecommendation\nI recommend this game 100%, it's a fast paced thrill ride, If you enjoy old school retro styled game.

At its core the game is a pretty simple 2D beat 'em up sidescroller, however, that doesn’t make it any less fun and engaging than other, more complex, beat ‘em ups.\n\nThere isn’t really a story to the game per say, you only have this introductory cutscene with no dialogue that shows your character applying for a night job in some sort of special forces. After applying you’re sent to this mansion in order to rescue survivors from monsters, and that is pretty much it. That said, in order to survive longer and to complete objectives, you’ll have to rescue survivors in the mansion by taking them to extraction points. The game manages to gradually get more challenging as time passes, kind of like Risk of Rain. It can get quite hectic after a while, when you’re running from room to room to keep them from collapsing. There are 2 types of survivors, normal survivors that you can find in rooms and some have weapons, and VIP survivors that you can find in certain locations that grant you a power-up upon rescue, such as a revive or cat that instantly kills every monster in your current room.\n\nThat said, besides rescuing survivors, you also also have to keep monsters from destroying the rooms of the mansions. You can see the state of each room in the minimap with different colors (green>yellow>red). If you see a room turn red, you should head there as fast as possible and eliminate the monsters before the room collapses. The minimap can be somewhat confusing, especially when certain stairs/elevators don’t take you to the floor directly above/below you but to another floor. Still, each one of the rooms is different from the others and overall the game is very detailed, thus making it easier to navigate through the mansion. Part of this is because of the pixel art, it looks pretty good and has this retro feel to it which reminds me of old games from the arcades.\n\nThere is some enemy variety but most of them resort to melee attacks that only differentiate in speed and range, however each one of the enemy types is easily recognizable and distinguishable from the others. As for your own arsenal, there is tons of different weapons to choose from such as, chainsaws, plant vases, shotguns, boxes, books and chandeliers. However, I feel like there is a balance issue with these because melee weapons are split into two different categories, weapons with Area of Effect (AOE) and non-AOE weapons. While non-AOE weapons deal very low amounts of damage they endure a lot more hits, on the other hand, AOE weapons have very low durability but deal high amounts of damage. The way I see it, even though non-AOE weapons endure more hits, AOE weapons are just too good to ignore and I never saw myself using the others unless I had no choice.\n\nOne complaint I have about the game is the lack of a tutorial, even though it isn’t that hard to figure out what you have to do. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that in its nature My Night Job is very repetitive and that it has only one level, which represents some sort of throwback to the old arcade games. Even though there isn’t much incentive to go back and play it after beating it, you can always compete for the highest score, globally or amongst your friends. There is also some sort of progression, in the sense that after unlocking an achievement you can go to this secret room in the mansion and activate some bonuses.\n\nOverall, My Night Job is a fun and casual beat ‘em up that falls in that category of games that are great for short play sessions, since it’s easy to pick up and play and offers no real storyline to delve through.","May 9","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's all the homages to 70's and 80's horror. From evil Dead to Little shop Of Horrors, to something that looks like Terminators on acid. There is a ton going on the the background to see as well. As fun to watch as it is to play.\n\nI could have used a bit more variety, because as it is it seems like it's just one identical level to play in so repetitiveness could become an issue  after enough play.\n\nStill, its quite fun. I def recommend.","April 24","true","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","10"

There are a variety of weapons in the game, all with different pros and cons. Some do great damage and hit multiple enemies, but have a low durability, and things like that. The game is not quite that simple though. While trying to rescue 100 people(for an idea of how long that takes, in about 17 minutes I saved 23 people), you also have to watchout for rooms that have too many monsters in them. If too many monsters get into a single room, they will start destroying the room. You can only let 3 rooms be destroyed, because you lose if 4 get destroyed. The house itself is kind of a maze to try to get around, which adds to the challenge of the game. There are also some power-ups that you can get by rescuing VIPs. For example, I rescued an old lady in a wheel chair, and she gave me a power-up that instantly killed all of the enemies on my screen. Besides the house getting destroyed, you can also lose by dying, but that was probably obvious. After you fail, or win if you happen to be good at the game, you get your score placed on the leaderboards, so it can be a fun game for trying to beat a friend's highscore or something like that. There is no real story to the game outside of what is shown in the opening cutscene when the game is opened. Overall, the game is a lot of fun. Keep in mind, this was sort of a first impressions for me, and this is what I gathered when I first played the game. There may be more that I have missed.

Today I have brought along a neat little gem known as My Night Job. My Night Job can best be described as an indie-action game, but there are some neat little surprises along the way.\n\n(Press Copy/Serial Key provided via Dev/Publisher of Title)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bmNYeVsrZjA\n\nMy takeaways are as follows:\n\nPositives-\n\n+ Not your average action game\n+ Beat 'em Up meets Strategizing/Survival (Which makes for a grand combination!)\n+ Very quickly paced, but easy to figure out what you're doing\n+ Fun, Pixely Graphics without being "cheap"\n\nNegatives-\n\n- Repetitive Gameplay befitting Arcade-Style\n\nI thought I was getting into your standard Beat 'Em Up, I ended up with a fun little action game that has elements of survival, horror an defense. Not only are you rescuing people from the house, but you are trying to save the floors of the house itself from being destroyed. Each room has health and everything. A lot of thought went into this and it shows. It ended up being more fun than I expected!\n\nVerdict:\n8/10\n\nHappy Gaming!","April 23","true","1.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The successful applicant needs to be able to use any items as a weapon to succeed!” WOW. . .  that sounds great, here comes my night job!\n\nMy night job is a survival side-scroller beat ’em-up game where you have to rescue a certain number of inhabitants and VIP guests from a mansion full of Zombies! At the start of the game, you will be told your objectives, which will include you saving 100 people and making sure that all the rooms (22 in total) are defended and not destroyed. Well, it seems to be a walk in the park when you start your night job, but you will quickly change your mind as the minutes past. Well, I surely did! As the minutes go by, as many zombies seems to find their way into the property and swamp the people as soon as they can.\n\nI forgot to mention a very small but important thing - you start the game without any weapons at all! Fortunately for you, the advertisement above did specify that any items you will find will be useful weapons. It’s true, and you will notice a little blue arrow above different pieces of furniture, crates, tools and more, which means you can find or take a particular object with which to smash the zombies. However, each object takes damage each time you hit a foe. So make sure you find another weapon as fast as possible.\n\nPeople will be all around the mansion with captions over their heads, “HELP!” Just move towards them and as soon as you past them they will follow you. Some will have weapons and can be very useful to you for a short period of time; after all, you have to lead them to safety before they die. How do you do that? Very simple, guide the survivors towards a helipad to be rescued. Don’t forget to look for the V.I.P’s, they usually hide behind furniture, the little buggers. It is very easy to identify where their might hide; a little coin with a head on one side and one of three power ups on the other side will be display above the furniture. If you manage to escort them safely to one of the five helipads available to you, you will get the power up. One to look for is the lovely nurse,; she has the revive ability at her disposal. You will need it.\n\nThe other aspect of the game is to get as many points as you can by hitting as many Zombies as possible without being touched, and to escort people and V.I.P’s to the helipad, surviving as long as you can.\n\nI really enjoyed the progressive difficulty in the game - it is just great!\n\nGreat pixel artworks and the game runs smoothly.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great pixel artworks\n-	Over 60 different weapons\n-	Progressive difficulty during game play\n-	Achievement and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Repetitive; it would be great to have a selection of mansions\n\nMy Night Job is a really fun game to play with cool pixel artwork. I reckon you should get My Night Job, as I need a break from this zombie-infected mansion!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/437100/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","April seems to have been in many ways a retro month here on Steamified. A number of the games that we’ve featured have been throw backs to gaming and culture’s past. Games such as Holodrive, IS Defense and many more. Today I am pleased to feature My Night Job that has been developed by Webcore Games and published by bitComposer Interactive. Webcore Games is a division of Webcore, interactive solutions agency, that has been operating since 1999. As such they have a large library of games with the overwhelming majority of them being developed for mobile devices. bitComposer Interactive is a growing publisher in the video game industry having published games including The Voice Germany, Galaxy on Fire 2 and Disciples 3: Reincarnation.\n\nMy Night Job, as mentioned, is a throwback to the horror movies and the arcade games of the 1980’s. This really is my era so the subject matter and the gameplay is right up my alley. I love that the game is very easy to pick up and play without you really having to think about it. Its great for those short fire sessions of less than an hour when you just want to relax after work or study before you pick yourself back up again to do something else. The game is very easy to learn, very quick to play and an enjoyable arcade smash. Don’t look for enormous depth to the gameplay as the depth isn’t really there and it doesn’t need to be. The depth is arguably in the large number of weapon variety – many of which do very similar things. I believe that Webcore games nailed the match up of survival horror and beat ’em up. As has been mentioned elsewhere the enemies tend to die in one hit so you’re going to want to find weapons that have a large splash/area of effect. These weapons will kill enemies almost as fast as you can see them and in some ways the game becomes an arcade version of wack a mole.\n\nThe one major negative that I have with the game is its lack of story which in my opinion gives me a lack of a reason to truly care about the game. Why am I trying to save these people? Why am I killing these monsters? What is really going on? A simplistic story would have been pretty easy to develop and would have added a lot to the game.\n\nThankfully the game has been Steamified with both achievements – which actually unlock perks within the game which is super cool – and trading cards.\n\nAt $7.99 you’re going to be getting your monies worth if you’re looking for a game that you can relax to mindlessly kill a bunch of monsters.","May 2","true","3.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

To that end you'll find yourself rushing from room to room to thin out the monster hordes and give you more time to civilian hunt.\n\nThe only real con I see with the game is that the combat can be considered a bit simple, but that might not necessarily be a bad thing considering a more complex system may interfere with the player's pacing.\n\nIf you'd like more of my opinion on this game, check out my gameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkQr7xaOy44","April 26","true","1.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
