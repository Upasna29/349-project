If you're not familiar with Isaac, it's essentially a strange hybrid of a roguelike and a multi-directional shoot-em-up (shmup). So, how does TSGO (as I'll be referring to it) compare?\n\nWell, it tries, I'll give it that. Drawing comparisons to Isaac is quite easy, but I'll try not to do that for now. To start with, TSGO bills itself as a randomly generated hack ‘n’ slash adventure game with rogue-like elements.\n\nAll of this is fairly true, especially the bit about hacking and slashing. It's pretty fun initially to explore and defeat enemies throughout the randomly-generated rooms the game provides you. The game differentiates itself from similar games by having players slash enemies in a direction around them, as opposed to shooting projectiles of some kind. However, by visiting the shop between levels or by finding items, players can increase the range of their attacks. So, what about the rest of that sentence I mentioned a while ago?\n\nWell....here's where things get a bit dicey. See, TSGO is randomly-generated to an extent, but the variety in environments, items, enemies, and secrets is pretty lacking to be honest. Sure, the game will place rocks and trees in different spaces for each room, but who cares really? The environments are the same 5 levels which is fine, but they could use some more variety in their theming. They're pretty basic as is - a desert, some snowy place, a dark "spooky" area, etc. I'd love to see more vibrant and creative ideas for environments, but the game just settles for the most basic of concepts. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier both the items and enemies aren't particularly interesting. The enemies have unique attack patterns which is nice, but they're constantly the same and I'd be interested in seeing some variety in them. Why not have different colored enemies with various attributes (stronger, slower, faster, etc.)? The items aren't much better either, as while some of them have neat uses, such as a hat that lets the player teleport, most are fairly uninteresting or just give a small stat boost. Oh, also there's secrets....but only a few, and they're not very cool or useful, besides the puzzles that unlock characters. Those are neat I will admit.\n\nSo, onto the bit about the game being an adventure game with rogue-like elements. Sure, it exemplifies some of the elements that are commonly found in the genre, like permadeath, various items, or whatnot, but the problem with The Story Goes On is that it just isn't difficult for someone of moderate gaming skill. Personally, I initially died 4 or so times and then "beat" (or rather, beat the 5 levels currently in the game) the game an additional 5 times after that. I didn't die at all between those 5 runs, and while I was initially amazed at my supposed skill with the game, I began to realize that it just wasn't challenging at all. The bosses (which by the way, are fairly creative in comparison to the enemies) are easy, the enemies are easy once you learn their attack patterns, and overall the game is just a walk in the park after an hour or two of playing. It didn't take long for me to get bored with TSGO, and that worries me because I enjoyed what I've played of it so far.\n\nYou see, the game is still fun. It's challenging initially. The art style is lovely, if a bit unpolished. The potential replay value is there, but the lack of any extended replayability in its current form beyond 5-10 runs or so is worrisome. Partially, this is due to the lack of stuff currently in the game, like levels, items, or enemies, but this is also because the game is just too easy in its current state. Now, however, the game is in Early Access, and while usually this is a curse for any interested potential customer on Steam, I can safely say that the developers are some of the most genuine and caring ones out there. They're all over the forums for the game, and they actively seek out community suggestions and any bug reports. Patches are constantly released for TSGO, and that's great! I love that the developers truly do care, and that's what convinced me to raise my recommendation from a no to a yes,\n\nThe game is fun as is, but it's definitely lacking in some areas. The developers seem to truly care about remedying the issues with the game though, and I appreciate that. They're constantly adding new content, such as enemies, items, bosses, or entire levels, in addition to fixing bugs all the time and taking in community suggestions or comments. This to me speaks miles compared to other Early Access developers who just put out a patch every 6 months or so. The commitment put into The Story Goes On makes me hopeful that the game will be pretty good, if not amazing eventually. In its current state though? Well, it's a bit rough around the edges, but if you're a fan of the genre or just looking to try out a new, cheap game, this isn't a bad option.","November 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

Nobody was hurt in the process. But here's the thread so you know.\n\nCheck TL;DR at bottom of review if this is too long for you.\n\nThe past few days have been spent milling around inside this squeaky clean indie game with a handful of baddies and critters, all of us sort of gliding from dungeon to dungeon in a place deemed a maze and called by the rather grandiose name of, The Odyssey. Having realised there must be some sort of lore, it felt essential to plop on my deerstalker cap and produce some yummy Googley searches. The results were thankfully plump lore of where we are introduced to our main protagonist, seven year old Aidan. Of our four diversly skilled characters (three of which you unlock through hidden puzzles), Aidan is the one you're stuck with in the beginning. A trifle "young" for my taste, I only played him a few times before moving onto my favourite and more recent addition to the team, Gambit the Void Slayer (flailing his ninja arms back in true Naruto fashion will confuse your sense of direction in the beginning, plenty of in-game references to many other delightful characters like this). But more on that later since the story goes on (couldn't resist the chance pun). On one fateful night Aidan's brother tells Aidan the tale of their grandfather, a man whose thirst for hidden riches takes him to a mystical place called the Odyssey where it is said treasure buried deep in the dungeon awaits those brave enough to search for it. It is a treacherous maze of the Scar, a gang of thieves operating under a dark leader Staz. Thirty years passed and to this day nobody knows what happened to their grandfather, seemingly lost forever in the depths of this strange world. In hindsight the current EA version of this game at the time of writing this review doesn't implement this lore much and stays bromidic in-game. Where there is a story if you want it, it doesn't suffice as a form of narrative within the game itself. Players are greeted by the trusty shopkeeper, Bob who offers hints and helpful in-game factoids to ease any progression difficulties for the newbie or aid unlocking secrets. This lessens the feeling of emptyness of hearing your own voice echo against the walls of the maze.\n\nFirst of its developer, this rougelike has been hauled a terrifically long way from the start of its development. Even with the art and music there are videos of how it looked before, the stark contrast hails the constant work the devs are putting in and it was a shame I couldn't find even earlier versions to form a timeline for it. It's wondrous and quite remarkable to be able to see a game progress within a sturdy community of gamers, and even as sorely overused wording, the term "community made" most certainly finds its proper use here as an indie title. Even as a person who hasn't had one awful experience with an EA title purchased before release (which is very rare) I understand and purchase these kinds of games with full knowledge that EA is a blind leap of faith however much content seems to be there or not. Yet this is still an early access game so that is what you get and the current price isn't too shabby at all.\n\nWith five levels so far (different theme for each world, very detailed for a first timer's indie offspring) it is difficult to call it a complete experience even though I gave it my all with repeated playthroughs totalling 15+ hours. The current game does not give you over fifteen hours of playtime. It gives you a couple of hours at the most. I spent a long time looking for secrets and mostly going through variations to unlock a certain character that seemed to be bugged so couldn't be found anyway (will probably be fixed soon). There are several secret hidden caves and dimensions to uncover using from the most obvious to the oddest methods. The biggest fun in this game was looking for the aforementioned locations, trying out all the characters you can unlock and unlocking them in the first place. Many of these increase in goodness when you use the guiding hand of achievements if you are interested in those at all. Characters can respectively throw roped hooks, dash, ninja leap around, place bombs and detonate them with good old sword swinging and teleport among other feats. Specific character introductions will be spared since getting to meet each of the characters adds to the lore of the game and should be experienced first-hand by the player.\n\nIt plays like Larva Mortus with a face lift and a brainOne of the first games I knowingly completed 100% achievements for on Steam was Larva Mortus. As a person who enjoys arcadey games that make you grind until your bum is sore, it was a happy experience that I never really got again since most games that simple tend to crash and burn because it cannot keep your attention long enough to be completed. The moment I booted up The Story Goes On, it reminded me of a new age Larva Mortus tripping on mushrooms. Indeed there are trippy items in this game such as the mushroom (JUST EAT IT...) and the technicoloured unicorn item that made me dash back and forth like a loopy person watching my rear end fart rainbow coloured dreams (that crush all bad guys crossing its path *insert diabolical fingertip tapping here*). Moving past the simplicity of hack and slash, there are many other things I enjoy about this game. The primary school style of colourful graphics that made me daydream about it becoming cut-out animated game with dimension (gameplay and visuals are very Zelda), satisfyingly fun sound effects (I got addicted to a certain "whip whoosh") as well as the secrets which push you to check everything you can karate chop with your weapon but not to the extent of dungeon crawlers that waste hours of your time pushing every stone on the wall. Plainly stated I had a lot of fun. But only after enduring about an hour of the actual game. It's currently short and I completed the game a few times but during that inital first hour I was worried about what I was going to write because it seemed boring. I was hacking and slashing in a game without an actual true ending as of yet (early access review), and without the end I felt lost. This will go away once the game actually reaches its finale with the narrative but the stable mechanics are smooth sailing and the relatively attentive developers are clearly working on this game with weekly updates where change is incontestably evident as you boot it up one week and then the next to compare.\n\nConclusion\nIt isn't all fun and games with bottles of Whey. If progression is your only joy in gaming this may not be the title for you (while in EA) since you can beat it in less than thirty minutes on your first try and move on from its current early five stage state. Difficulty isn't much of a problem and as basically everything is randomly generated you're not going through exactly the same sequence but as the game updates, currently the lack of difficulty is getting replaced more and more by tediousness. Some bosses are tedious to fight rather than difficult (most are plain easy), which is fine and a frequent factor in HnS games but it will not suit a lot of people who just want to be entertained right off the bat. The art looks like a children's pop-up book with fluffy stickers and scratch & sniff, but it is detailed and keeps growing into what I expect will probably be one adorable HnS adventure for Aidan and his friends.\n\nTL;DR -\nOnly recommended if you: want to see an EA game grow, find HnS/dungeon crawlers or shumps like Larva Mortus fun, find repetition soothing and/or enjoy supporting small indies.","November 17, 2015","true","20.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/369560/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Disclaimer- This preview was written during Early Access. The Story Goes On is subject to change.-\n\nOn first glance The Story Goes On is a game you might pass up, the graphics are not flashy, nothing spectacularly here to catch your eye and draw you in. On second glance, if you dig a little deeper you might find a challenging and enjoyable title, especially if you're a fan of roguelikes. The Story Goes On is a Hack & Slash, RPG, Roguelike, with randomized dungeons in the form of the Odyssey and perma-death. The title draws some obvious comparisons to the much beloved and revered gran-daddy of roguelikes, Binding of Isaac. The key difference of The Story Goes On being is that instead of poop demons and tears, we have some good old fashioned swords and magic. If I had to put The Story Goes On in a nutshell it would be a great game to introduce somebody younger or new to the roguelike genre. It has friendly, albeit simple, visuals and for the most part is simple to grasp and play.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple and along the lines of other roguelike titles such as A Wizards Lizard or The Weaponographist. You travel from square rooms to rectangle rooms slaughtering indiscriminately in search of loot, keys, and the boss key. There are all sorts of random powers and buffs that alter your characters basic statistics like range, dash, and weapon speed. The powers or loot can range from a mace you throw at enemies, a trusty parrot that pecks at foes, to a ice wand with limited charges. These items/buffs are all randomly placed including enemies, secrets, and randomized bosses.\n\nThe combat is the main draw here in The Story Goes On, and for the most part it works just fine. You mindlessly left click on your mouse until your enemies go poof and the rooms exits appear. Depending on which character you are using you will have some basic abilities. The main character you start with has a dash that makes him invulnerable, a hookshot, and his sword. I couldn't comment on the other characters as I had no indicator or hint whatsoever on how to unlock them. I can only assume it was by completing the first five sections of the game. Which I did not manage due to my issues with the combat.\n\nLike I said, the combat works for the most part and is acceptable and challenging at times, yet there is polish that needs to happen. As an example entering a room sometimes instantly rewards you with damage as enemies spawn on top of you, also the enemies have very strange attack animations that makes it hard to predict when they are going to strike. This lead to my death more then once and left me feeling cheated at times, this on top of the fact it's a perma-death game, as you can imagine, was very frustrating. The main hero's abilities of hookshot and dash, seemingly got me into more trouble then they were worth, hacking away was far more easy and safer. The game currently doesn't really reward you for trying different tactics. Finally the enemies seemingly died from random amounts of damage, one would die from a single swipe and others in two or three swipes. This could be due to buffs and stats changing although this randomness continued in most of my game sessions.\n\nAfter clearing many rooms and finding the boss key, you will face off against one of the games bosses. These are seemingly randomized but currently there are only about two maybe three per area. This is by far the area that needs the most balancing, as bosses are simply laughable and easy to defeat. Most of the time I felt the bosses were not even attacking me. I had more trouble with some of the mini-bosses that appear randomly while exploring the Odyssey. Speaking of the Odyssey, it was rather an enjoyable experience. The five sections of the game are rather unique in feel and design, despite the fact the game is completely in 4:3 resolution and doesn't support widescreen. You can put the game on fullscreen but end up with giant black bars on the side of your screen. Most of the problems with combat and UI design, I can forgive due to the game being in Early Access. Despite this, I just don't understand why the game doesn't support widescreen in this day and age.\n\nNonetheless, each of the areas does have a very unique tone, with monsters coming at you from all sides that suit the area and making each area feel unique. The areas come in different sizes and even contain some hazards that you must watch out for as you battle an onslaught of monsters. This I liked very much as it kept me on my toes. There are also some secrets littered about the game that can be discovered by hacking at everything, usually rewarding you with some sort of stat buff. This is again par for the course in roguelikes and works very well, rewarding exploration.\n\nThe game is surprisingly well put together for an Early Access title.(Former experiences with other EA games left me wanting) The base game right now is for the most part bug free and I never had any kind of hiccups. The UI is acceptable but does have the tiny issue of where the map that shows the Odyssey is placed. This map can cover up a portion of the map and hence an enemy might be hiding out of your sight. This is something that will hopefully be addressed by the time the game exits Early Access.\n\nOther areas need polish as well, including story, which The Story Goes On doesn't currently have ironically. The music I found was quite enjoyable and one of the areas I felt the game was nicely done, using a mix of fast paced electronica and old style chip tunes. The sound effects were acceptable as well, slashing, explosions, and magic all had a nice oomph to them and never grated on my ears. The enemies did fall quite silent though as all they did was go poof.\n\nSpeaking to the other accoutrements, such as options, I was not disappointed, offering motion blur, lighting effects, and fully rebindable keys. Replay value of the game is high of course as the dungeons are randomized, random items, and unlocking other characters. The overall games length lends itself to quick playthroughs lasting anywhere from 20 to 40 mins.\n\nThe game is fun and just difficult enough for newer and veteran players, at least for the first couple of playthroughs. I think eventually veterans will find the game a bit on the easy side. I can see myself playing the game a couple of times until all the characters are unlocked, however there really isn't anything I felt to keep the player locked into this game. There are some neat ideas here that need to polished but nothing that is really all that original. This could all be due to the game still being in Early Access, as more features and items make it into the game and add their own unique flair and keep me wanting to play more and more. It should also be noted that the game does come at an incredibly great price of $4.99, that price alone makes this game worth it. Like I mentioned, The Story Goes On a great way to introduce your friends or kids to roguelikes.\n\nSo if you are in the market for new and up coming roguelike that you can play with your kids and not worry about religious overtones(coughBindingofIsaaccough). The Story Goes On is a great choice.","July 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Everything down below I've written from a non-biased, early-access perspective and will remain unchanged.\n\nIf you like top-down hack'n'slash type games such as the original Zelda games or random maze generated gameplay like in the Binding of Isaac, then this may tickle your fancy.  The Story Goes on [Although Currently in Early Access] is a fun-fast paced game with hidden secrets and unique items.\nThe gameplay goes very quickly and dying is something I may call a feature to the game: it works like losing lives, but as a throwback to old retro Atari/NES era games, you start from the beginning upon game over.  This however doesn't depreciate gameplay in the slightest since the levels only get progressively harder and getting back to where you died takes mere minutes.\nRegardless of that apparent length, purchasing the game will have you playing it for countless hours (I've already racked up a dozen myself in the last week)!  Bugs do come up from time to time, but as an early access game this comes to be expected and I can't really say any have made the game unplayable.  The few bugs there are have come and gone very quickly since the team provides updates almost daily.\nPerhaps one of my favorite features about this game is that it's community-driven and community-made.  No, an entire community is not coding the game, but there are forum threads based in game discussion and Google Docs for players to post bug reports, recommendations, suggestions and sometimes supply their own art assets for the game.  The team creating The Story Goes On isn't working alone, and this is one of few Early Access games I feel I actual contribute to in the development process.  In fact, a few achievements, graphical changes and items I suggested have already made it in the game!\nThis game is certainly worth the minor change you need to shell out for it and it's one that you can pick up whenever you want; no save points, no getting stuck on a hard boss(bosses that spawn are completely random).\nYou'll never experience the same maze/dungeon twice!\nI'd give this game 7 lemons out of 2 rotten grapefruits.","June 11, 2015","true","50.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

While reviewing the game it’s still in early access so it’s not yet finished.\n\nIf you have played “The Binding of Isaac” then you probably know what kind of game this is, but I’ll explain in case you haven't. You are dropped into a dungeon with only a sword and 1 or 2 special abilities depending on which character you’re playing as. Your goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon by traversing random generated floors. Each floor has many rooms that work as small arenas that you can only leave after defeating all the enemies. And each floor also ends with a boss fight before you can move down to the next floor.\n\nMy thoughts on the game are that it’s lacking in many ways. The game works and plays as it should, but I feel that it doesn’t add anything new to mix in the roguelike genre. It does what every other game does but on a lower level and without anything new I don’t feel compelled to continue playing it. The items you get by progressing in the game all blend together because they all have so little effect on the game, even the active items. So each run feels the same. It doesn’t help either that I never find myself using the special abilities the characters have since I find them too hard to control or plain out bad. The bosses between each floor are not memorable at all. Most of the bosses I just ran straight into and whacked them with my sword until they died and then moved on. Some of them have special attack patterns and invulnerability periods, but they still feel mostly the same. Bosses should be one of the most important things in this kind of game so that disappointed me. I can’t help myself thinking that I want to play another roguelike instead while playing this game. Just because other games, like The Binding of Isaac, does everything this game does but better.\n\nHow the game looks also bothers me. It just looks so… basic. To someone else this can be something positive but I just think that it doesn’t stand out from other games, not eye catching at all.\n\nThe length and the difficulty level is also something I want to bring up. During my first first play session I did 3 runs. I died on my first run and beat the game on my second and third run. And at that point I felt that I had seen everything the game had to give, that I was already done with the game only after 1 hour of playtime. Other games in the same genre are much harder, takes longer to beat and has items that drastically changes your playstyle and makes every run unique. The developer however confirmed that the difficulty will be changed in the future.\n\nWhat I did like about the game was that each floor has different music and a different theme and I like the atmospheres on all of the floors. The floors themselves also has interactive environnements such as rocks and trees you can use to your advantage. You can also move and attack in all directions, I played this game with a gamepad and thought the controls were good and responsive.\n\nAt the moment I would not recommend this game if you’re not desperately looking for a new top down  roguelike. Even at this price tag of 5€ I feel that you don’t get your money’s worth in content from your purchase.","November 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The basic enemy units are predictable and the game becomes more about trying to find powerups and secret hidden items.\n\nThe bosses do have individual strategies that you learn on the fly to dodge their abilities.\n\nThis game can be very short, but its great for those short bursts of time where you might only have 5-10 minutes to play.

I am thoroughly enjoyed by this game and its design. I could ask for a greater rouge-like dungeon exploring game, and my response --for the time being-- would be fruitless. This game merges beautifully the dungeon crawling experience I have so assiduously obtained from a "Legend of Zelda" title, and the rogue-like arcade aspect I have cherished from a plethora of games. This game is worth your money, and will merger the enjoyment you can concieve from other games in its genre.","June 11, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Being that its early access, it already comes with a lot of features. The dungeons, also known as the Odyssey, are randomly generated so no playthrough will ever be the same. Move room to room and unlock keys for chests that will level up certain abilities of your character and find the boss keys to move to the next levels. The game will continue for as long as you can stay alive at which point you pretty much start over. Pretty basic but since each playthrough is different it opens up a lot more playability. I've noticed that there is more than one character to choose from but at the moment I'm unsure if they just aren't added yet or if you have to unlock them some how. If anyone knows please let me know :)\nAs far as the gameplay goes, Its really fun. The game lives up to the hack n slash genre so be ready for lots of different kinds of enemies and fast combat. You'll unlock upgrades and find secondary weapons as you progress through the rooms. The combat gets a lot more fun once you get your hands on those upgrades. If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers and hack n slash games. Be sure to check this one out!\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWFL6a5gUB0","June 13, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

And review it I shall.\n\nI enjoyed the game, although it is a tad short. You can only play as one character at the start, although you can unlock three other character through uncovering secrets in the game. The starting character has his sword and a hookshot, although I rarely used it (it is used to latch onto something to move you) but no other equipment.\n\nI was able to unlock Sprout, but I do not know what she is like to play, although her description said that she can plant bombs.\n\nThere is a definite Zelda-esque feel to the game, particularly with the background graphics and the monsters themselves. The graphics also remind me a little bit of Paper Mario with regards to the characters and background. I don't know if the graphics will change with the full release, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. The graphics are not jaw-dropping nor are they bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCombat is relatively straightforward, and there are not a lot of options when fighting. You basically swing your sword and dash (an ability to rush forward while gaining a very small window of invulnerability. Some monsters are harder to fight than others, and require a little thinking on how to defeat them.\n\nI found combat to be a lot easier when I found the item Mother P'kah. Basically, it flies around and if a monster runs into it, it will either die or be quite wounded. This was quite useful against certain tough opponents, particularly bosses. One boss, Cryos, I found to be a tad difficult with it due to its speed and the fact that I am using mouse and keyboard.\n\nAs mentioned above, the game is relatively short, and there are only 6 worlds so far. The levels for each world are random, and the worlds get larger as the game goes along. Each world has different kinds of foes to fight, and they each have a theme. World 1 is forest, World 2 is snow, etc. It gives the game a different feel each level, which is nice. Also, there is different music playing each world, and I feel like I am playing an NES game when I hear it. I like the music for games of the NES era, so the music is a good thing.\n\nI did experience two or three crashes, but they were never during gameplay. Twice it happened after I died, and it went to the Stats page. When I clicked on 'Back', it crashed. I also got the same crash when I exited the game once. Considering how I died numerous, numerous times, the amount of crashes I had is negligible.\n\nIn all my playthroughs, I never experienced any bugs, so it looks to be pretty stable for being in Early Access.\n\nI do enjoy this game, and I am glad that I played it. I am also looking forward to trying out the full version when it is released. I should also mention that this game has Achievements (a few are hidden, but I've found some of them), as well as Steam Cards. That is an added bonus as well. I like games that have Achievements, and it is fun trying to get all of them.\n\nMy final verdict is that while the game is fairly short, and feels a bit sparse at parts, it is a fun game and well worth playing.","November 12, 2015","true","5.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For those that have played The Binding of Isaac, you will be met with a very similar style of experience with the main exceptions being that your primary form of attack is melee and you aren’t so grossed out by every enemy you see. For those that haven’t managed to play BOI, you will essentially be placed inside of some sort of dungeon in a top-down view, traversing room by room, after defeating every enemy, utilizing many unique pick up weapons (one equipped at a time) to find the floor’s boss and move to the next dungeon. You have one melee attack, a dash, a unique character skill, and a unique pick up weapon. Another major attribute in all roguelites is permanent death. Every play-through is procedurally generated in order to provide a different experience each time. Being a roguelite, you will earn progress in the form of collectibles and new characters. Be aware that this review is based off of an early access product.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====The developer has explicitly stated above that there is no lore or motivation of the story as of yet in order to focus on polishing the gameplay mechanics (the story will be included in the full release). Focusing on only the gameplay until story content is released, below is a list of bugs and important suggestions.\n\nBugs: In the beginning tutorial using a controller, using the slingshot is incorrectly labeled as using the right-click mouse button and using the character’s unique skill is incorrectly labeled as using the left bumper\nSuggestions: In the controls menu, include and show the button mapping when using a controller\nAllow button mapping modifications when using a controller (or provide multiple controller schemes)\nProvide some sort of timer/meter for Dash cooldown/recharge\nMark which rooms you have left a heart in for easy backtracking\n==== Early Access ====For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing. With that in mind, I definitely recommend purchasing the game at this point in time as the price may increase, and fully polished roguelikes, although very enjoyable time sinks, can get expensive (to the point where it’s not worthwhile). If you do buy this game, you will be given a chance to help the developers shape the future of it, as they seem to be fairly welcoming to the community. To quote them from above: “This game is essentially built by the community. We allow them to submit their own translations of the game, as well as content they’d like to see in the game: items, bosses, enemies, artwork, etc. We respond and attend to bugs almost immediately, and are very active on our forums.” I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on The Story Goes On!","November 13, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is also playable with the keyboard but I didn't test the game with the keyboard.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a roguelike game - If you die, you are restarting the game.  You can unlock other characters in your playthroughs and each character has different stats and abilities.  The gameplay starts by dropping you in a room - Left took me to a control tutorial (which unfortuantly was for keyboard commands vs. controller commands).  Right took me to the game.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is you go from room to room, getting upgrades, killing monsters and ultimately searching for the boss key to unlock the boss door and fight the boss.  Levels are randomly generated and like any game of this nature might mean you are swimming through with tons of upgrades or struggling to survive underneath waves of enemies.  Between levels you are dropped into a shop and can use your hard earned points to purchase upgrades or take a gamble on a random effect.\n\nThe characters start with three hearts which when hit degrade by one half heart which effectively gives you six hit points.  Rarely, a heart will drop to refill two hps.  For the most part, enemies followed predictable patterns which made surviving not incredibly hard.\n\nOverall, it is a pretty fun roguelike game.\n\nAchievements:  I'm an achievement junkie and always like to point these out when in a game.  I haven't unlocked them all yet, but the ones I've gotten have unlocked without a problem.","November 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's very 'papercraft'.\n\nThere are a fair few enemies. Most of the enemies just walk towards you but the ranged enemies are more of a threat.\n\nThere are a few issues with the game. There isn't really a lot of information of items whilst you are ingame. It also feels like you are just going through the same few areas over and over again.

Not even close.\nThat being said it's still a pretty good game, and (unlike Isaac) the lack of dead babies/torture/satanic imagery/killing your mother from inside her womb/poop means that I can play it with my nephew without his mom getting all weird.

The game is actually getting regular updates and it's better than it was a few months ago.  It looks better, it sounds better, plays better and it makes me feel better... The Story Goes On is an issaclike, room by room, level up, clear the floor, beat the boss, get an upgrade sort of thing.  This is very solid.   Mechanics are good, enemies and bosses are unique, soundtrack is really great.  It's a no brainer at five bucks.  Word.

Peoples expectations and standards have clearly lowered as time goes by but not mine...  Maybe its the STEAM Cards which are a  bunch of poo piles...  No fun in collecting with this game but then this game is just another case of The Story Goes On...  And its not just this game, its a lot of these games that get in on the card thing...  I just think its ridiculous when you have to spend another 3 to who knows how much  to just get a Badge...  Sometimes I will turn a card or emoticon or background into gems that will fetch a $ just in hopes that it ends that item and I get the gems and STEAM and the Deveolper are good with the initial purchase of the game and their piece of the pie...

Sobald man einen der Ausgänge benutzt hat, kann man den folgenden\nRaum erst verlassen, wenn man die Aufgabe gelöst hat (sprich alle Gegner getötet).\nGegner hinterlassen Geld und ab und an Herzchen mit den Ihr eure Lebensenergie wieder auffüllt.\nIn den Räumen findet man ab und an Kisten....aber kaum Schlüssel um sie zu öffnen.\nZiel ist es, den Bossraum zu finden und ihn (den Boss) zu töten. Danach kann man mit dem gefundenen Geld (durch\ndas Töten der Gegner und öffnen von Kisten) einige Abgrades kaufen bevor es in den nächsten Level geht und .....\nnaja, es wiederholt sich alles.\nDas könnte ja noch halbwegs interessant sein. Könnte, ist es aber nicht.\nNicht nur hab ich in vielen Spielen, die es umsonst gibt, bessere Grafik gesehen.\nWas ja bei solch einem Spiel der Knackpunkt ist, ist die Steuerung.\nSowohl mit Gamepad (X-Box) als auch per Tastatur und Maus ist diese einfach lästig.\nEuer Character, muß jeweils in Richtung der Gegner gedreht werden um diese zu treffen.\nSchade nur, dass man bei der hässlichen von oben drauf Ansicht kaum sagen kann wohin er gerade schaut.\nWarum dieses? Es wäre einfacher gewesen ihn sich mit den Tasten jeweils in die entsprechende Richtung zu drehen.\nAls Tasten stehen WASD für oben/unten/rechts/links, die Maus zum drehen, die linke Maustaste zum kämpfen\nUND Shift für einen Dash-Angriff........WARUM? Warum nicht rechte Maustaste? So kann man nicht gleichzeitig\nlinks gehen und dorthin den Angriff starten, sondern muß umgreifen und mit der Maus die Richtung festlegen.\nNoch blöder wird es dadurch, dass sich die Figur natürlich nach einem solchen Angriff sofort in die Richtung des\nMauszeigers gedreht hat. Sollte man also vorhaben in eine Gruppe von Gegnern diesen Angriff zu starten, so\nverliert man  auf jeden Fall etwas Leben, da man sich erstmal wieder zu ihnen orientieren muß.\n\nNun, ich habe das Spiel im Bundle bekommen und nach kurzer Spielzeit festgestellt, das es doch einigen\nWert hat....indem man Shift/Tab drückt und nach einigen Stunden (dauert recht lange) die Sammelkarten\nverkaufen kann\n\nEmpfehlen kann ich es jedenfalls niemandem.","June 16, 2015","false","4.6"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","5","25","0","1"
