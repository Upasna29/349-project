Every decision made has put gameplay over realism and tradition in shooters, and they've got a masterpiece to show for it. It's as simple and elegant as chess with the same learning curve as you discover new combinations, strategies, and counter-strategies.\n\nIf you like hardcore shooters, do not miss this game, and do not pass judgment lightly. If you're looking for the Unreal Tournament or Call of Duty experience, this is not for you.\n\n\nEdit:\nIn response to 0.1 hours on record comment. I played alpha, both closed betas and their preceding technical tests, got a few rounds in during Siege Day in LA, and spent a week at Ubisoft Montreal playing the game and giving feedback on behalf of the community. To verify this, you're welcome to watch the "Road to Montreal" livestream footage on YouTube; I'm "geofurb" in those matches. I'm probably one of the most experienced players at the moment, though that's sure to change shortly!\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nIf you launched the game once, but on second launch Uplay prompted you to install:\n\n1. Quit Steam. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common and rename the folder "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" to "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege bak".\n\n2. Launch Steam. In your library, right-click on Siege and click "Delete Local Content"\n\n3. Change the name of the folder back to the original name, "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege". When you press "Install" in your library, it will find the existing installation instead of downloading the files all over again. You can now launch the game.

This game rose up from the ashes of what once was Rainbow Six Patriots.\n\nThe game is set in current times where the fight against terrorism is full blown out. Terrorist are conducting massive attacks around the world and you play as either the terrorists or the rainbow unit which consists of worldwide response units.\n\nAs stated before the game has no story whatsoever. The only thing you can do solo is a situation mode which teaches you the basics of the game and the incredibly fun Terrorist Hunt mode. The game has one story mission which is online only which tasks you to go to a US college and defuse a toxic bomb, the mission is notable because it obscures your vision with toxic gas and you need to work as a team to defuse the bombs, cause the mission is really difficult.\n\nThe AI for solo mode is not stupid so you won't be able to Rambo the entire map. You will have to be smart with your actions since the AI is pretty smart. They change up they're routes and will try to flank you and rush you any chance they get, they're aim is pretty good as well.\n\nNow for the reason you might want to buy the game, THE PVP.\n\nTrust me when I say this, the game is no joke. This game is incredibly difficult and doesn't hold your hand. You will need to work as a team if you want to win. A well placed shot will take you out and a well planned attack might earn you a sweet victory.\n\nThe game suits many play styles, from a support who helps out teammates in the field, to a pyromaniac who likes to blow up everything in sight. You will definitely find an operator that suits you the best.\n\nEven though there's not many maps, each map is very dynamic. It's big enough for you to defend, but no matter what remember, you are never safe. You can destroy almost every wall, ceiling or floor so you never feel safe no matter how good your defenses are.\n\nThe game has one major flaw and that's the horrible servers. The servers are way too unpredictable. At one moment they work fine, the other they won't give you any money or won't even load you to the game. Ubisoft stated that they are working on fixing this issue so I trust them to get it sorted out.\n\nThe game is optimised incredibly well. It runs at 60 fps maxed out. If you have a high end PC you will have no trouble running this game.\n\nIn the end do I recommend the game ? Yes I do. I do suggest at the very least waiting for the server issue to be fixed and you have one of the best squad based games ever made.

The special thing about this game is the strategi and the destruction of the maps.\n\nevery game can feel very different, because both teams has a fair amount of characters to choose from who all has one special abililty. The destruction is a very big factor why i think the game is great, it gives it a LOT of replayability. There are so many different ways to defend a point or even to attack one. the teamplay and strategi is also important, your team will have a WAY higher chance of winning if you all communicate and plan your attacks.\n\nThe singleplayer isnt as great as the other rainbow games, there are basically two ways of playing singleplayer, one is to play lonewolf in terrorist hunt, terrorist hunt is your team or your self agaisnt AI. The other way is to play situations which are premade lonewolf maps with AI. there is no campaign.\n\nThe design of the game is really MLG as i would call it, all the characters doesnt really look like counter-terrorist units. which isnt a bad thing it just kinda takes the imersion away. otherwise the map is just trying to simulate the real world, which it does nicely. The graphics runs well on my computer with the highest settings.\n\nThe gun play and gameplay is close to perfect (If you ask me). its nothing like arma 3 but it has a very good feel to it, and sometimes even so much that i feel like i'm a SWAT solider breaching into a building ;D. There are sometimes where its kinda unrealistic but its nothing close to a problem.\n\nThe commuinity i have played with is nice, they play toghter, work togther and most importantly they communicate (Have had some games with people that didnt work togther at all but it doesnt ruin it)\n\n(Nothing about the game it self) I just want to add that ubisoft have made a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff like AAC Unity, i'm very happy how this turned out since it was one of my childhood games. but that doesnt mean that ubisoft are the "good guys" they still use Uplay, and many of their games are overpriced (if you ask me). Thats mainly why i would say YOU SHOULDNT buy the game. BUT the game is still a ton of fun, and if you want it i truely recommend it.\n\nNow go read the top rated review insted of mine.","December 5, 2015","true","139.9"," 339 of 408 people (83%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","83","339","408","62","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ofth3night/recommended/359550/","ofth3night","Satanic Warmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ofth3night/","298 products in account","A tactical shooter centered around either attacking or defending a structure may not sound unique or new, but Rainbow Six: Siege really takes that idea and expands on it in amazing ways.\n\nRS:S is a continuation of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six saga and the story is much of the same you'd expect in a game like this, but it does the job: an international terror group is attempting to cause as much destruction as possible for reasons unknown and you're part of an elite counter-terror team tasked with stopping them. You can get your bearings with the tutorials and after that, there are a number of singleplayer missions that expand on the game's features. Both the tutorials and singleplayer missions are invaluable to learning the game and the various maps that you'll encounter in multiplayer. You can jump into multiplayer at anytime, but it's not advised to do that right off the bat.\n\nThe loadout available to you in multiplayer is based off of the Operator you choose to play as - unique characters unlocked with Renown, a form of game currency that you earn by completing the tutorials, singleplayer missions, or multiplayer matches and specific objectives and actions between the three of them. There is a microtransaction alternative to Renown points, but worry not: you earn more than enough Renown points through regular gameplay. Each individual Operator also has a special piece of equipment unique to them and there's enough variety to make them all useful in their own ways. You can also play as the generic Recruit character with access to default equipment.\n\nAs mentioned before, RS:S is centered around defending or attacking a structure with the aim to disarm bombs, rescue hostages, or simply kill the opposing team. However, what makes RS:S special is the means and methods the game provides to you in order to carry out these objectives. Nearly everything in the game's environment can be destroyed or damaged in some way, creating endless tactical scenarios: you can destroy the ceiling to swoop in on an enemy team, trade fire between destructable walls, breach doorways and destroy barricades obstructing your path, deploy ground-based drones to suss out enemy positions - the possibilities are endless. On the flip side, the defending team can set up a plethora of traps, barricades, and other obstructions to impede the other side, all the while having access to various surveillance methods to keep a close eye on the going-ons of their base. The unique Operator characters on either team make use of EMP grenades, sticky gas bombs, deployable manned turrets, heartbeat detectors and much more. But remember, slow and methodical is  not  how you want to play this game - reminiscent of real life breaching tactics, you're expected to be fast and decisive!\n\nThe environment is the true star of RS:S. It can mean either life or death depending on how a team decides to use it and can be shaped to each individual players' whims, and that is what makes RS:S special.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.","December 5, 2015","true","27.7"," 234 of 281 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","234","281","8","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aethereality-au/recommended/359550/","aethereality-au","AE.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aethereality-au/","36 products in account","Review for Australian and New Zealand regionsHere are my thoughts, after spending over 250 hours in Rainbow Six Siege, inclusive of both Closed and Open Beta as well as live. I will be focusing on my review primarily from my experiences playing in the Australian/New Zealand region, and much of the review will be focused around the month after initial launch as well as the three patches prior to launch, aimed at fixing some of the issues faced within the game. This review has been updated one week after the February patch to reflect the changes seen in the recent Black Ice DLC release.\n\nWhat is the gameplay like?I love strategy, and when you combine that in a first person shooter, it's even better. The gameplay is dynamic and unique, with each round within a match offering a wide variety of plays that can be moulded by your team to accommodate the situation. Being generally accustomed to the usual first person shooters like Battlefield and Counter-Strike, I found R6S to be refreshing and very entertaining. Combining the dynamic environments of Battlefield's Frostbite-like destruction and the slower paced, methodical strategy and tactics needed for competitive Counter-Strike makes for an awesome first person shooter experience.\n\nHow is the class balance?Each operator feels unique, balanced and appropriately lethal when used in the right situation and coordinated well with other teammates. Each operator fills a specific role on the team and there is generally an appropriate counter for each operator, both on the attacking and defending teams. This helps to contribute to the overall balance of each round. Strategising a team composition is the key to countering the opposing team. Combining the unique skillset that each operator provides as well as the fortification and destruction mechanics of R6S makes for some very entertaining and exhilarating gameplay. More operators, as well as maps will be added for free (yes, free!) in upcoming DLCs, adding more potential for amazing, dynamic gameplay.\n\nWhat state is the game currently in for Australian and New Zealand players?In my opinion, from experiences so far; the game is relatively more stable than it was in the past few months. Previously, there were many issues that would detract from the overall gameplay experience. There are still major issues that do need to be worked on by Ubisoft, but with the release of the recent DLC (Black Ice), my gameplay and experiences have been significantly smoother and more enjoyable as a whole. I will state any issues below and further elaborate:\nThere was a major issue with latency and hit registration that persisted from CB/OB all the way onto the live release. This continued on for two months with Ubisoft prioritising it as one of the major issues that needed to be resolved. They did this by pumping out a number of patches within a span of two months which helped to alleviate the problems players were experiencing. There was still an occasional situation where players were running around with 200+ ping, however this was due to them being from a region other than AU/NZ. This caused the usual peeker’s advantage issue that is prevalent in some FPS games to be more significant than it should have been. Poor latency and server connections also caused some situations where players would die behind cover or some other similar, yet unexplainable circumstances. I am glad to say that as of February 2016, the latency and rubber-banding has now been resolved in my eyes, and from my experiences playing prior to the Black Ice DLC release.\n\nPreviously AU/NZ players would have difficulty finding ranked games as the majority of the Oceanic community seemed to stray away from ranked matches. This was due to the previously poor latency and server connection issues. Ranked queues still take significantly longer than casual queues, however I think that this issue will be improved as more players re-join to try out the new DLC and discover that there are less latency/connection issues.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen playing in casual matches, there are still a significant amount of players randomly connecting from matches, or taking longer to load, which leaves them unable to choose an operator or not being able to connect at all. This issue is still causing unbalanced matches for 5v5, 4v3, 5v3, etc. and therefore giving their team a disadvantage against their opponents.\n\nI previously mentioned in my review that there were a decent amount of players that were not willing to communicate, whether through the team chat, or through voice communication. In a game such as R6:S, communication is paramount to coordinate effective strategies and tactics. Players are still running off solo and attempting to breach alone, and will more often than not get picked off and killed by the defenders. This is still an issue that I don’t think can really be resolved.\n\nIn my experience, there seems to be quite a bit of trolling/stubbornness coming from players who do decide to go off solo and not work together with the rest of the team. I can understand that some players just want to play a casual game of R6S and not really be fussed about communicating with the rest of their team, leaving the strategy to ranked games. However sometimes this can lead to miscommunication, or lack of communication, where players lack the appropriate intel to make informed decisions in a game that can be quite punishing. This can be disheartening for players that are less experienced in the game, be a huge turn-off and might push away some players.\n\nThere is also the odd occasion when a player will decide to team kill, or assassinate the hostage which is quite disappointing given the game's strong emphasis on teamwork and communication. This however might only apply to the AU/NZ player base as I have heard positive comments about strong communication and teamwork from players in other regions.\nIf you do decide to purchase this game, I strongly urge to you to have a working microphone ready to use as this game is so much more fun when players actively communicate together to win matches. Also, please be prepared to communicate, it really makes a difference!\n\nShould you buy Rainbow Six: Siege?Yes and no. Were it not for the issues highlighted above, this would be a glowing review and high recommendation for R6S. The release of the Black Ice DLC as well as the recent February patch has shone some positive light on the title, which may sway some readers to purchase this game. However, my initial verdict from my previous review still stands.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very addictive and rewarding if played correctly. I will not deny that some if not all of the issues will detract from the overall gaming experience such as the disconnections, latency issues, hit registration and the occasional uncooperative player(s). As it stands, I can only tentatively recommend this game to you.\n\nIf you are really interested in this game and the franchise, enticed by the unique gameplay and are willing to put up with some of these slight nuisances and wait till Ubisoft resolves them - then yes. The majority of games that are completed without any hiccups will be extremely exhilarating. The sense of accomplishment felt when collaborating with random players to win a match through strong teamwork and communication is unparalleled for a game of this genre.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not ready to put up with the issues mentioned, no. Hold out until the game improves in a few weeks/months after the latest DLC release and then please give it another shot.\n\n----------\n\n[Did you like/find my review informative?

Some operators can place a mounted LMG and has perfect armor. Another can place a barricade that can only be blown up, not shot or melee'd. All operators have very particular abilities, none are remotely the same.\n\nTHE TEAMS\n\nYou can play as either the terrorists or the counterterrorists with 5 on each team. The police, i'll call of counterterrorists, must breach and clear a selected building with the terrorists inside, either rescuing a hostage, securing some toxic ♥♥♥♥, or defusing a bomb. You can place charges that will detonate and destroy only designated destroyable areas. Other gadgets come with the operaters. The terrorists must fortify their position at once. Place heavy barriers on walls and/or floors to prevent breaching. Also place either a mounted shield or barbed wire (you select which one pre-game), Other gadgets will come with the operators.\n\nGAMEPLAY/GRAPHICS\n\nThe game is like no other (maybe a little bit Payday 2).

So I just had 5 games against different groups of cheaters on the enemy team, and they were even trolling the whole time not even tring to hide it and I couldn't really do anything to punish these kind of players, the whole thing just makes me feel hopeless, not just the fairfight banning cheaters, get some anti cheats for F sake!","May 8","false","538.4"," 82 of 97 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","82","97","3","2"

We would play with some guys he met online and usually had a full team of 5 players and it was loads of fun, sometimes even having 10 so we would do the custom 5 on 5. LOVED this game. One nice sunny day we woke up early to play and took a break around lunch, when we went back I just kept getting an error code ending in 48. If one of us is logged in, the other can't play at all, no situations, terrorist hunt, nothing. We both opened case files with Ubisoft support and did everything they asked us to do, we did port forwarding, called our ISP, traced packets and many other time consuming tasks. One rep told Youtoast, my bf that we would need a second network. I told this to my rep and he told me that was excessive just to play a game. Well today he told me that they honestly can't say why it was ever working before but not now, that it is not unheard of for multiplayer games to have these issues when 2 users are connecting from the same network, and that after investigating and looking through some things, a second network will MOST LIKELY fix the issue. Had I known this would happen I never would have purchased the game and season pass. I will not be getting a second network just for this game when other multiplayer games let us play together just fine.  If you have siblings, a spouse or roomates who you want to multiplayer with, I would not recommend getting this game.","May 22","false","136.9"," 139 of 183 people (76%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","76","139","183","16","22"

The community is great! Love all the team players playing the game.  Which makes it hard to down vote. BUT:\n\nCONS:\n\nThe final product is not much better than the beta. For a "BETA" the game was great, but as a triple A title and a price of $60, I expected a lot of the issues in the beta to be fixed- I was wrong.\n- The match making still has issues.\n- Players still get stuck in loading screens.\n- The menus for pretty much everything are not very well designed or intuitive at all.\n- The game has been out for 3 days and the Ubisoft servers have already been down/crashed multiple times rendering the game unplayable since even most of the (very limited) single player requires it to be online\n- Wall physcis, game physics can be a little... weird sometimes.\n- Game crashes randomly\n- TOO MANY PROBLEMS FOR $60\n\nPvP:\n-Assuming no one crashes, gets DCed or stuck in a loading screen, they are fun and intense.\n\nTerrorist Hunts:\n- The AI on 'Hard' is really not that 'hard' at all, but the AI on 'Realistic' is all-knowing and will headshot you through smoke, a wall and a barraicade with one bullet.\n- Spawning is horrible. You can clear an entire building only to have to go back and clear it again because the AI will spawn in rooms randomly- sometimes directly infront of you on screen, but most of the time it's directly behind you.\n\n----UPDATE FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMENTS----\n\nResponse for Mad Ninja - As stated at the beginning of my review, I said I was going to keep it short and simple- hints why I did not go into detail about the things you are requesting. If you want an indepth review, go read the curators reviews or some gaming websites review. Mine was just a simple snapshot of what stood out from the game to me.\n\nAs for your comment about spawning, I have seen [In game] [With my own eyes] enemy AI spawn directly infront of me inside rooms. I have also been 100% sure a room was clear (Only one way in) and while camping that room, have had enemy spawn directly behind me and kill me.\n\nThe aiming of bots in 'Realistic' is astrocious. I have watched multiple death cams of myself and end of round death cams, where the AI 'should' have had no idea where the player was located but was able to get off a headshot instantly. The difficulty 'hard' on terrorist hunt is not that hard at all, while the increase in difficulty to realistic makes it nearly impossible. The AI -HAS- changed since the Beta as it was no where near as difficult to complete on realsitc mode during the Beta.\n\nAs for the game physics and wall physics, I am referring mostly to the damage that is done by explosives. In many cases the damage of explosives seems to just completly ignore walls entirely and kill anything regardless of material of the wall or location. I have also on occasion had random things [Walls, barriers, barbed wire, equipment, etc] blow up for seemingly no reason or all. Or I have seen a single grenade blow up WAY too much in one room/multiple areas.\n\nCharacters also sometime clip through walls and get stuck in the maps. I can recall two occasions where other players have been downed, and upon revival they were stuck in the floor and unable to move. This broke the game as the player was not allowed to attack the enemy, resulting in having to wait 8 minutes for the round timer to expire.\n\nClipping through walls is a HORRIBLE problem for a game that allows players to shoot through so many surfaces. If players [Legs and weapon barrels] can be seen through walls, it gives the opponent an unfair advantage as they can just shoot through the wall without the other player having any idea he is there.\n\nAs for the matchmaking issues, I must repeatedly click to join both multiplayer and terrorist hunts. My game will 'act' as if it is trying to find a new game, tell me it is joining and then kick me out to the main screen for seemingly no reason. I have also had multiple games get stuck in loading screens, seen multiple other players get dropped from games and had games completly crash for no reason at all.\n\nPlus the way the servers update is way to slow for this type of game. The lagg can be absolutely horrible with people and enemies rubberbanding all over the place.\n\nAs for the menus, you are correct, that is a personal preferance- but if new players of the game have to ask older players how to upgrade their characters or how to get into the screen to kick inacctive players, there is a problem. Plus some of the menus require the player to use the arrow keys instead of just using the mouse which just doesn't make senes to me. You are right it is not 'game breaking' but definetly annoying and on top of all the other problems... You get my point.\n\nResponse to Bucie-B: How about you read the review before you comment. I clearly listed Pros first. If yet very short, they are there.\n\nI honestly hate having to down vote this game. It is incredible fun when it works. But with all the issues with the game and networking.. I cannot and will not recommend to anyone that they spend $60 on this game. It just simply is not worth it.","December 2, 2015","false","58.2"," 729 of 1,070 people (68%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","68","729","1","43","38"

I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:\n\nThe Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between "starter players" and "regular players" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else.\n\nTo explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are "free" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal.\n\nEverything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this "grinding" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like "grinding" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.\n\nIf there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an "on sale" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The "grinding" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator "on sale" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.\n\nThat should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.\n\nI want to address the issue of the "full price for only multiplayer" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a "campaign"; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 "situations", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a "lone wolf" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.\n\nWhy would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The "time to die" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.\n\nIt might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.\n\nThe port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.\n\nThis is also the first time that I've had to "deal with" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.\n\nSo that was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.","June 3","true","18.4"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","55","60","3","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scarps/recommended/359550/","Scarps","Scarps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scarps/","180 products in account","*Notes after Feb 11th 2016 2.1 patch below...*\n\n**Also updated on May 3rd 2016**\n\nI was an open beta player with the pre-purchase of this game. I have 178 hours played at this point in time, and have achieved Platinum rank in Ranked play with a 6.0 Win/Loss ratio. I'm also Level 83 and have everything unlocked for each character, with most top tier skins purchased with renown. These are my credentials in this game, just so you know I'm not speaking out of my behind.\n\nThis game is an excellent game, when it works. Key word, when. Tactically, there isn't anything that I know of out there that competes with this title. It's fun, can be high/low paced, and is always very intense. The number of ways to defend and attack are almost limitless and it shows during game play. When you mess up, you're usually punished for it and quickly. So one slip can make the tide of the game completely turn against/for your favour.\n\nHowever, I did give this a negative review because of the following... This game is terribly inconsistent, and often favours the high latency player. It also has a list horrible of bugs, which people like to exploit often. I have decided that I am uninstalling this game and will not play it until Ubisoft steps up to the plate and actually starts fixing their game. Here's a list of frustrations I have with this title.\n\nBeing killed by someone not on your screen. They're 150-200+ ping and have shot you but have not appeared yet, though I have experienced this with lower ping players.\n\nBeing unable to vault over a shield because the game doesn't show the [VAULT] on your screen, aka the game forgets to make things vault-able (if that's a word).\n\nBeing killed by players during drone phase, in which they're not allowed to escape the building but manage to anyways. They plant C4 on your spawn location, so when you come to life they blow it up.\n\nBeing blinded on a shield by random artifacts and patterns on the glass. Not just visible to the victim, but other players being able to see the obstruction on the shield glass.\n\nBeing killed by someone you've just shot 3-4x in the head, then notice their health is only down to 75% on the kill cam. Any character with any gun is a 1 shot head shot.\n\n*Fixed Feb 11th 2016, problem since Sept 2015 launch* Being killed by the infamous Kapkan "no laser no spike trap hidden inside the wall" glitch, which Ubi knows about and still has not fixed since beta.\n\nBeing shot through your shield as Montagne (or Blitz/Fuse/Recruit), in the head, with it on full extend, facing the enemy.\n\nBeing killed in a position that your character is not in, because the animations do not match the location of the hit boxes.\n\nBeing killed through a concrete wall by a C4 or grenade or other explosive.\n\nThe list goes on and on, this is a wonderful game that is being ruined by netcode problems and low tickrate servers. My final position on this game is this: Even if you're playing the perfect strategy, that means nothing when the game itself is working against you.\n\n/rant off\n\n\n\n/return Feb 12th 2016 after the big 2.1 patch\n\nKapkan is fixed, no more sideways hidden laser trap. Yay.\n\nWe've got dedicated servers now, oh wait, they're not dedicated servers. It's a spectator that hosts the match in game, which means it's still p2p and the computer is still busy rendering/playing the game. Not dedicated like an HLDS or other real console dedicated servers. *facepalm* It is not an openly joinable server that stays online 24/7 either, because it requires 10 players to launch and will close in 10 minutes if the 10th player doesn't join. If the host backs out, the server closes. *double+triple facepalm*\n\nOh, Blitz's head is actually behind his shield now? I wonder if they moved his point of view from his chin upto his actual eyes, as well. *slow clap*\n\nHere's the bug fixes posted on Ubi's forum, which is a strange place to begin with... I'll add my commentary after each point in * *'s:\n\nGameplay fixes\n\nHeadshot hits do not register properly. – FIXED (We will keep looking for additional improvement opportunities.) *Which means it is not fixed, it's actually only improved, not fixed.*\n\nExploit: Players able to clip inside walls using Deployable Shields. – FIXED *wait for it...*\n\nCollar collision on Frost and Buck, make headshots register as upper body damage. – FIXED *Actually it's a piece of clothing with no skin behind it? Shouldn't cause a hit IMO.*\n\nPlayer able to clip inside walls by using Deployable Shields. – FIXED *Didn't you already say that?*\n\nNitro Cells stick to the edges of tiny leaves on plants. – FIXED *But they still stick like glue to the large leaves... It should go through the plant and sit inside of it hidden. Wouldnt you want to hide a C4 inside of a bush? I would.*\n\nBlitz’s gadget blinds players who were not facing it. – FIXED *But still doesn't blind players who are facing it consistantly. So it's still a broken mechanic that causes his pistol to be unshootable for like 2 seconds.*\n\nYacht: when playing during daytime with Montagne, broken glass decals are completely dark. – TENTATIVE FIX (We will be tracking for it once Patch 2.1 goes live, currently cannot reproduce the bug anymore internally. Please reach out to customer support if you experience it after the patch is live, thank you!) *Which means they are not sure what caused it, and are attempting a live test on the public AKA Not fixed.*\n\nThere's a huge list of fixes, but match making is still broken as ever. A lot of exploits were addressed, but consistancy issues still exist with hit reg and sync. Many operators still have broken or strange mechanic issues. And the game still doesn't feel consistant. This is a joke Ubisoft.\n\n\n*******UPDATE******* May 3rd 2016\n\nSo here we are, months later...\n\nThis game's match making is still horrible. I had to boot the game 3 times to get it to the front menu. We had people with connection errors being dropped from games. We had to disband and reform our party many times, due to errors and other nonsense game glitches. And yes, we all have OPEN NAT with the proper port forwarding.\n\nThe hit reg is a joke still. I had put two double taps into a guys head, and watch him turn around and try to shoot me. The third double tap dropped him. There was two blood explosions on all 3 shots, and the target was twitch (not a tanky high armor character). His friend right next to him dropped with 1 double tap, in the same fashion.\n\nThe net code sync errors still exist. I had an enemy laying on his back, facing me, and when I went to shoot: Get this... He started shifting left and right by about 2 body widths at a time. Glitching left and right, I got the jump on him, and he popped me in the head.\n\nI played for about 3 hours tonight, and this madness ensued all evening. Stay far away from this game unless you want to end up frustrated with the trash listed above. This game has been out for nearly 6 months, or 9 months if you include the beta test. It's still broken as ever, and runs horribly.","February 3","false","197.9"," 719 of 1,074 people (67%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","67","719","1","86","56"

I'm sick and tired of getting dropped out of ranked matches exclusevily because of Ubisoft's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers and that automatically causing me to lose a rank. It's nearly impossible to find a match, ranked or casual, in which 1 or more players don't get dropped and, sometimes, 5 players or more will get dropped at once. Not to mention that it takes for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to find a ranked match, so when you get dropped on the 2nd round after waiting for 10 minutes to find a match, it's pretty frustrating.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, but connectivity issues are ruining the experience for me. I'll give it a negative review until Ubisoft can fix their servers.\n\nEDIT, January 12th, 2016:\nThe game has been out for well over a month at this point and the connectivity issues persist. Constant drops on casual and ranked games that cause you to get banned and make the rest of the match unfair, matches taking WAY too long to start after all players connect, matches taking way too long to be found and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The issues aren't as bad as they were on launch, but that's not saying much, since the game was bordering on being unplayable when it came out. To put it in perspective, I would say connectivity issues on this game, as of right now, are hardly acceptable for a Beta, much less for a AAA $60 game that already lacks content. Oh, and it crashes quite frequently, too.","December 11, 2015","false","145.1"," 241 of 351 people (69%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","69","241","351","20","7"

It must also be the amount of time they spent coding it.\n\nThere's 3 way to play this game, PVP Casual, PVP Ranked and PVE.\n\nPVE:\nTerrorist Hunt is fun with friends but gets really boring after a while (that's my opinion). Some people really dig it, but I don't anymore.\n\nI'll now talk about the PVP\n\nI played a total of 9 games today:\n- 3 of them were 3v5\n- 2 of them were with trolls (that killed us and got instakick by the game; too bad Ewplay doesn't give you substitute for them) So I played 1v5 for 2 rounds; the game then went for a 3v5 :)\n- 1 with 2 of my premades.\n- The other 3 went well.\n\nEDIT: The game i was in queue for was a 3v4.\n\nI used to play Casual and lot and wanted to experience the Ranked system. Turns out it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Played my game through the unranked to Bronze 2-1; with almost the same type of games as mentioned above. I got demoted 5 times in those 10 games.\n\nSo the pros:\n\n- The graphics are nice\n- the gameplay is fun.\n- Strategy and communications are great, too bad people won't use it.\n\nThe cons:\n- You have to farm the characters or buy them. Top value for the money you paid.\n- Customization through in game shop with an excessive amount of farming or money once again.\n- Used to have a lot of hackers\n- Ranked system sucks super hard.\n- You'll play with and against the same guys over and over and over again. For instance, right now, I cancelled my queue a good 10 times just to be matched, again, with the same guys. That trolled our team the previous game.\n- There's no AFK kick.\n- The netcode will kill you and it must be the only game ever where lagging gives you an advantage\n- You can see people through walls sometimes.\n- Long queues\n- No single player.\n- Ewplay\n- No point buying Season Pass it's a scam.\n\nThe casual mode is the same as ranked, although I find Ranked more challenging; they also make no sense at all. So I'll still play the game but I'm glad Overwatch is coming out later today.\n\nRainbow Six: Rogue Spear used to be my favorite FPS and one of my first one. I'd like to thank you Ubisoft for destroying everything you touch.","May 23","false","122.0"," 62 of 83 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","62","83","7","12"

I have had tons of fun with it and definately recieved my money's worth. Why the negative review you may ask? The game lacks any in engine anti-cheat. Fairfight is a data collection tool that catches players based on statistics. It does almost nothing to deter people from hacking, sure it might eventually catch them, but that is too little too late. I cannot reccomend this game in its current state. Within the past two months my team went from about 1 in 5 suspicious games to 2 in every 3. It is almost impossible to enjoy the game when you hit the platinum/diamond rank. Ubisoft claims they are "Discussing the cheating issue daily in meetings", but this means absolutely nothing to us (the game is 5 months old now...). I will update this review if Ubisoft makes a valid attempt to stop the cheating, but for now I cannot reccomend this game.\n\n5/14/16: Patch 3.0 is out and some of the new QoL improvements look great. I would like to clarify that changing the code of conduct to ban people quicker will accomplish abosulutely nothing if the anti-cheat is not picking them up to begin with. I have heard more people have been banned since the launch of 3.0, but Fairfight can only do so much and take time to detect each new hack.

With these problems and Ubisoft's asking price in mind, I can't recommend that anyone buy this game in its current state.\n\nAlso, is anyone else bothered by the fact that the "terrorists" in the multiplayer mode aren't actually terrorists?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, by "terrorists" I meant the "bad guys", or the defending team in the player-versus-player multiplayer mode. In the trailer played at the E3 reveal the defending team players were guys wearing ski masks, looking very much like some of the terrorist models in the Counter-Strike games, so I called them "terrorists" out of habit. I'm not saying that I want them to use those models specifically, but I feel that they should at least look different than the counter-terrorists, since it's kind of dumb to have counter-terrorists shooting each other or defending a bomb that they have supposedly planted. With that said, this is a pretty minor issue; the game has way bigger problems than a lack of appropriate "bad guy" skins.","December 6, 2015","false","10.3"," 417 of 675 people (62%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","62","417","675","28","24"

There are both good and bad things.  Here we go:\n\nPros+ Combat - there is a good variety of weapons! You can mod them with a few mods, and each one of them has different advantages.\n+ Devs - I like the way the game is going at this moment.  What I really care about is that the maps will be free.  I heard the operators will be available to buy with renown as well.  I bought the season pass anyway because I encourage that type of initiative from the devs.  I've never been a fan of microtransactions, but at least they did it only for aeshetic stuff, so I'm okay with that.\n+ Game modes - you can play pve and pvp.  Both have different modes.  While in pvp it doesn't make much of a difference because people end up killing each other anyway, in pve it does.\n+ Operators - they sound stupid at first, but it's cool to have different operators that do different things...just make sure you tell Fuze not to use the Cluster Charge during an extract hostage...\n+ Replayability - sure, there is not a crazy number of maps, but there are different modes and enemies and objectives spawn at different locations, making each time you play it different.\n+ Servers - I agree, they were not perfect, but I have seen games releasing much worse.  They also got better over time.\n\nCons- AI...or AU (Artificial unintelligence) - at times the AI is either incredibly smart (headshots you through walls) or incredibly stupid (walks right into the line of fire).  Could use some fixing.  Also Normal should be easier (for casuals).\n- Balancing - there is some balancing to do.  It's not terrible, but some operators don't have really good weapons.  Shotguns need to be buffed just a little bit.\n- Briefing screen - the game mode should stay in the briefing screen (where you select the operator and vote) because I choose operators according to the game mode and often times I miss that 1 second screen...disadvantages of having SSDs...\n- Kicking rules - add a required field that asks why somebody is getting voted to kick...apparently I got kicked for being...too good? 41 kills...at least I could take a screenshot and show it to my friends for a good laugh.\n- Mic?! - seems like half or more of the players that talk in game do not realize they are...lol make sure you put push to talk AND treshold to 0.  Not sure why push to talk by itself does not work.\n- No host migration - ...come on...I don't like getting kicked to the main menu because the host died at the end and ragequits...\n- No offline - cannot play without an internet connection.  You have to be connected to their servers even if you are playing solo (unless you are doing the situations, but no reward).\n- Servers/matchmaking - while it is in the pros, it is also in the cons because they can definitely be worked on.\n\nI know there is something I am forgetting.  I will add it as it comes to my mind.\n\nSummaryThe game is good!  I won't say worth it or not since $60 is worth one thing to me and another to you, but you can find it for cheaper if you search well.  Personally speaking, YES, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it.\nYou can play PVE or PVP, whatever you like!  Good graphics, good gameplay, lots of fun!\nDefinitely a game to pick up, especially if you like FPS and coops games.  Just be aware that it is slower than most shooters.  I wouldn't say it's tactical, but it's not a run and shoot.  You should give it a shot.  If you can play it with friends, it's even better! (even though I seem to play worse with them because I get distracted lel)\n\nLet me know what you think. :)","December 13, 2015","true","84.9"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","5"

The immersion is insane.\nGraphics are decent nothing mind blowing.\n\nOnce you see what can be done, your hunger to experiment snags you.\n\nThe game is also fairly intuitive and everything begins to make sense very quickly. However the ability to execute what is learned takes skill.\n\nNot really sure what network issues people were complaining about, I haven't encountered any. Nor any bugs except for one random crash.\n\nMore Thoughts\n\nUplay is really the only downside, however for most of my time during the game it was quickly forgotten.\nThere is no story...\nThe price of this game should go down to maybe 40 or 30.\nThe community so far seems nice however when the casual and more serious players mix the open mic can get obnoxious. Aka people ♥♥♥♥♥ing at others for sucking or not doing well.\nThe team play that I have experienced tends to be more on the non verbal side and people just stick together.\nThe class system is kinda nice, but sucks when the class you want is taken.\n\nTheres more that can be said but if you like insurgency, cs go, and many more titles YOU WILL LIKE THIS.","December 6, 2015","true","48.6"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","41","56","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RediT12/recommended/359550/","RediT12","RediT12","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RediT12/","319 products in account","So I have been playing this game now for about 230 hours and so far i can say that i love it. BUT there is a serious lack of content which is a shame because some new maps and weapons would be great. But that's not the reason why i get so mad at this game and my friend uninstalled it. This game has a serious problem and when i say serious i mean it's infested with hackers. I'd say that roughly 25% of the games i have played recently has been with or against a hacker. And it feels like it's only getting worse everyday, before the new season update this issue didnt seem nearly as occurring which seems very strange. And when you're not actually going up against a hacker this game can be very enjoyable but as soon as you or anyone else get's a lucky or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t kill because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ netcode that person get's called out as a hacker.\nTo me it feels like the community is on a verge of a breakdown where the legit people stop playing because of this problem and the hackers take over. So why is Ubisoft not doing anything about this? Why are they not changing out the crap anti cheat "Fairfight" against something that actually works? Why is the game not getting more negative reviews? Are people trying to ignore this?\nCurrently i wouldnt buy this game for 1$ because i cant enjoy it anymore. I go into a ranked game have fun and win next game i go into it all hyped to maybe rank up and so i do next game however i run into someone who has a strange ability of always knowing where people are, and so i loose and derank. And that's a big problem you have fun rank up then you run into some little ♥♥♥♥ who cant play the game so he does what alot of other people are doing. He does a quick search on google and buys something that will guarantee his success.And so you derank again and now you are stuck in a vicious circle of ranking up and immediately deranking.\nSo if you like getting ♥♥♥♥ed over by hackers and pretty limited content buy it. And if you dont, well dont buy it.\n\nEdit\n\nSo i love this game well i did before all theese cheaters appeared. I keep playing this game because sometimes you get a legit and enjoyable game but sometimes you dont. I was just in a game with blatant cheaters not even trying to hide that their hacking and why is that? Because Ubisoft doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ if people are hacking or not?. The anti cheat is pretty much non existant and there doesnt really seem to be any real consequences for being a little ♥♥♥♥ing cheater.\nAND WHY ARE PEOPLE IGNORING THIS?\nWHY are there not any big rant videos on youtube about this? This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed! I mean i love this game and i want to see it thrive, seemingly more than Ubisoft anyways.\nTHIS is a sinking ship and it seems like everyone aboard is just pretending that it isnt. I keep comming back to this game day after day and hoping that this issue will be resolved but my wish never seems to come true.","May 22","false","242.4"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","0"

I have more than 100 hours in this game, unlocked every operator, every attachment, and i own the season pass aswell. I really enjoy this game... WHEN and IF it works. What does that mean?\n\nAlmost three months after the launch, the servers are still ♥♥♥♥. Pings start around at 70, and the player with the bigger latency got the peeker's advantage. Which means he can kill you before you even see him.  Cool huh?\n\nHitreg is also broken most of the time. Even if you shoot the enemy, and he clearly bleeds ( like this[imgur.com]), it happens that you deal minimal, or no damage at all, even with a headshot.\n\nAlso, you have a shield? Sometimes it doesn't matter, because you can get shot through the shield, even if you face the enemy (even while crouching).\n\nRecent event (at least for me): Couldn't get through a PERFECTLY OPEN door, cause the moment i walked in, some rubberband tossed me out instatly. Same with the grenades, i threw them in, and they flew out...\n\nAnd the list goes on and on. Cheaters on higher ranked levels (plat and above), though every game got these scum, it looks like fairfight is not doing it's job properly. Good news that in casual there are hardly any cheater. Hurray!\n\nOtherwise, the game itself is fantastic. Very intense with interesting strategy opportunities, requires a good teamplay. Got a really good graphics, the level desing is cool, the sounds are great (they can also be "funny", like the sound is coming from the completely opposite of the enemy's location). It's been a long time since i loved a shooter game this much.\n\nBut it's just doesn't save the game, when you encounter bugs, low tickrate and server problems mentioned above. If it's on sale, give it a try, otherwise stay away until the game is fixed.\n\nI just hope it will get fixed, cause it totally deserves to be a really good multiplayer game...","February 16","false","149.1"," 85 of 134 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","85","134","4","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeptYouWaitingHuh/recommended/359550/","KeptYouWaitingHuh","戦FøxNull士","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KeptYouWaitingHuh/","517 products in account","OVERVIEWRainbow Six: Siege is the newest title in the long-running Tom Clancy Series. It focuses on intense, competitive multiplayer matches pitting attacking and defending teams against eachother in a battle of brains and skill. For newcomers, Seige is very similar to games like Counter-Strike with 5v5 round based gameplay. What make's it different from those games is a combination of highly destructible enviroments, unique gadgets and abilities for certain characters and a variety of options to attack and defend the objective such as rappeling from windows and roofs and using the environment against your enemies. For Veterans to the series the game is very different from the usual Single-Player Focused campaign where you can work with bots who obey your commands or real teammates who work with you to tactically clear buildings, save hostages and eliminate threats. Thankfully there is a "Terrorist Hunt" mode that offers you the option of doing just that. It's not entirely the same, but it's something at least. This particular game's main focus is the Multiplayer and i'm perfectly okay with that, i'm well aware there are some purists and skeptics that don't enjoy the concept of this game due to certain bias, be it "it's not the same" or "It's ripping off CSGO" but if you take those often misinformed assertions out of the picture you're left with a great game on it's own that offers rewarding  gameplay that encourages teamwork and thinking outside the box to defeat the opposing team in unique ways.\n\nGAMEPLAYIn Siege, the attacking and defending teams work differently. WIth one team boarding up windows and doors and taking defensive positions trying to keep the enemy out, and the other team using drones to find the objective and the best point of breaching into the building based on enemy positions and the location of the objective. You can breach walls, doors, windows, sometimes roofs, it depends on the map, but the freedom of choice makes each play unique for each round. Another thing that i enjoy about Siege is the audio design, when you're playing defense hearing every footstep from the roof or the sound of a rappel line next to a nearby window is crucial to anticipating where the enemy will strike, paying attention to audio cues adds to the intensity of every round as you listen and carefully plan what's around every corner. Failure is not an option as you will die very quickly should you not be keen to your surroundings, but thankfully you don't have to sit on the sidelines as you can still help by watching various security cameras placed throughout the building, but beware as the enemy will quickly catch on to this and destroy them, leaving your teammates to fend for themselves. Another great thing is that you can find a character that fits your playstyle with customizations to your weapons which give you a personlized feel to how you play.  Provided your team is varied and communicates often, it can be a very fun experience.\n\nCOMMUNITYFrom my experience, the community is actually quite friendly and helpful, probably given that the majority of the players seem to be 18+. I've encountered very few CSGO or COD kids yelling and insulting eachother, for the most part it tends to have more laid back and mature playerbase similar to the ARMA 3 community. Although recently there has become a rather annoying influx of chinese-speaking players with high pings hotmiccing constantly. I would bet good money if the game was $15 the community would probably be more toxic. Overall though, for the time being the community is definitely what you would expect from a Rainbow Six game, and i'm pretty satisfied with that.\n\nTHE GOOD+ Fantastic Graphics add to the immersion.\n+ Sound design is phenomenal and plays a big part in gameplay.\n+ Variety of characters, abilities, weapons, and gadgets to choose from.\n+ Destructable environments add to the strategy during a match.\n+ Feels pretty balanced and fine-tuned for competitive play.\n\nTHE BAD- There's currently a griefing/leaving problem that needs to be dealt with.\n- Community is a mixed bag of friendly/mature and toxic/troll.\n- Uses strictly matchmaking, no dedicated servers here.\n- Price point can be pretty steep for the type of game.\n- I don't mind Uplay, but it's still there for those who do.\n\nTHE UGLYx Red Storm Purists whining it's not the same as '98.\nx CSGO Fanboys whining it's ripping off their game.\nx Your team whining because they're losing the match.\n\nBOTTOM LINEIt's a great game if you're into hardcore team-based shooters. Make no mistake, while it takes some of the best elements from similar games, it really feels like it's trying to do it's own thing, with fairly successful results. Throw in free maps for life never having to pay for map packs and i'd say we have a winner. It's not a perfect game, but it's pretty fun if you enjoy the genre.\n\n*Thanks for reading and give me a thumbs up if you found my review helpful!*\n\n8/10 Recommended.","December 2, 2015","true","57.0"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","41","58","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yumethegoddess/recommended/359550/","yumethegoddess","Chaossealer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yumethegoddess/","1070 products in account","This is a case of wasted potential.\nAlright,\n\nI don't like putting up negative reviews, since most of the time it just comes down to personal preference when I don't like a game, but this is just hilarious.\n\nFirst off:\nThe game itself is not bad at all. In fact, i really enjoy playing it. The concept and gameplay elements are great and me and my friends already had a lot of fun playing this.\n\nBut I just can't deal with the bad things going on this game...\n\nFor starters:\nThe matchmaking is just plain bad, in casual and rankeds alike.\nIt's probably the worst I've ever seen since CS:GO Competitives.\n\nIt's neither fun nor helping me improving my game always having to play against people who have hundreds of hours more gametime than me. And while I may be able to overlook this in casuals, the Rankeds are almost impossible to win with the kind of players the matchmaking comes up with.\n\nBest example: Me and a friend, both on like Silver 3, had to play against a group with one Gold guy and even two Platinum guys, which was probably because the other two silverguys in the enemyteam got boosted by these guys.\nSo, my question is: Why is that even possible? Even CS:GO prevents boosting of that magnitude.\nAnd in every other ranked we played we always got matched against people who were of higher rank than us. Not even one time were they lower than us.\nAlso, the matchmaking in rankeds takes really long. I would understand that if it would match us with people of the same skilllevel. But thats not what it does, so why does it even take so long?\n\nSecond:\nThere is a kind of gamebreaking bug, where after you pick your operator and the time runs out, there comes a short loading screen, and then you get into the game. The bug simply wont let the loading finish and you are mostly stuck there forever. I think there was like one time where it finished loading after like 5 minutes, but in all other cases it wouldnt start even after 30 minutes.\nSo, this is a AAA-Game published by a pretty big company.\nThis bug existed since the beta, and they still havent been able to fix that?\nSo i basically paid money for not being able to play the damn game, because every 2 or 3 games that bug happens.\n\nMaybe it's just my bad luck, but that doesnt change the fact that it exists for months, and I haven't found any statement as to why this happens and if they are actually concerned about that or no.\n\n\nThird: The anti-cheat system (aka FairFight)\n\nAs far as I know, it consists of analyzing your keystrokes while playing to see, if you push any button which is not binded in the controls, a fair number of times for like hackmenus etc.\nAnd of course checking KDA with skilllevel, blablabla.\nSo, bascially its a math-based algorithm.\nWhat happens when you have a math-based algorithm and the possibility to report people ingame after you get owned by a player?\nYes: You get banned wether you actually cheated or not.\nWhich is actually what happened to a friend of mine after getting a few good flickshots on his enemies.\nSo he got suspended from the game for a few minutes, even though he just played normally.\nTwice.\n\nGreat stuff. Not like we don't have any experiences of bad completely automatic anti-cheatsystems.\nIt usually results in more work for the support.... oooh.... wait.\nThe support doesn't care. At least thats what I could see by seeing multiple threads regarding anti-cheat and other topics (like that little bug) where the people basically got no answer even after weeks of waiting.\n\nWell.... BEST ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM EVER!\n\n\nStill, that's not the worst problem since I'm not affected, because I'm bad at shooter anyway.\n\nAnyway.\n\n\nForth:\nThe netcode.\nOn console this might even work in favor of the players as they are playing with controllers so some delay will work in their favor as they need longer to aim at their target.\nBut we are playing this on a computer, we don't have that problem. But Ubisoft didn't account for that, just made a simple port, and now it just feels like another Call of Duty.\n\n\nThe last, but least important thing:\n\nThe community.\n\nJudging from all those reviews on Steam, the community is THE BEST OF EVERY GAME IN EXISTENCE.\nOkay, maybe thats overestimating it, but still, there are alot of those reviews.\n\nComparing it to like CS:GO, yes the community is by far better, but on the other hand, CS:GOs community is one of the worst things I've seen anyway...\nAny yes, mostly the people who actually did talk, were nice and easy to talk to.\n\nBut still, there were more than enough people I played with or against who though they were the best in the world, and being arrogant and all that stuff, which was kinda annoying, so I don't really get why people would go all over the "good" community like that, when it's actually like any other game, just a little tone better.\n\nHey, maybe thats just my experience again, because of bad luck or whatever, but still I can't help but think, that the majority of these reviews are bought, or just people who got caught in the hype train (which is never a good thing)\n\nAlso: Casuals + Community\n\nBasically a bunch of tryhards hardcorecamping as defenders AND attackers doing everything they can to win and not to have fun.

"\nHere's My Short And Honest Review About This Game :\n\nGood Things :\n5 Vs 5 , Very Comptetive : So take your chances to "ESL" , it has an ESL tournament.\nRequires Teamplay & Teamwork\nIt's An Optimized Game : Since it was a Ubisoft product, i really didn't expect it to be this good.  And I have to say, it wasn't this much optimized when it was released. Most of the problems and glitches were from AMD users ... now the game is better and more enjoyable.\nThe Graphics Are Good , Not awesome though : We really don't need this much graphic quality in the FPS games, because the players should focus on getting more Frame Rate (for some reasons) instead of having everything on ULTRA , Like AA, Vsync etc.\nTactical Game : You can actually have Defense/Offense plans and train with your Team/Clan. For the gamers who DO want to play a tactical game, these are some unique features ( not for those who prefer Run n Gun!)\nIf you have about a 10+ operator, you can actually choose what you want ... Since every operator has its main wep and abilites to Defend/Attack, choosing your main and learning with Him/Her whould be the best idea!\nYou Can't  Jump! : Yeah! It's very good, no more bunny sh*t! Now you can vault from the desks and everything else!\nIt's Comptetive , So Take your chance to "ESL" , this game have ESL tournament\nBad Things :\nUplay....?ha...please\nNetCode , Hit Registration ( They just said that they will TRY to fix it, i hope they do )\nYou can't spectate your friends during the game\nThe ranking system is not good now ... it will change with any matchmaking. Sometimes it takes years to find a game with 4 - 5 cheaters. It's obvious. You can see that in every FPS game. Anti-Cheat system's normal. It's was worse when the game was launched (Known Fact : You can see more cheaters in the games with high competitive potential )\nThe features which you can fell free to list as pros or cons :\n- It's Not Grind, But Micro-Transaction ... You know? Pay 50/40 $ For AAA game and you still gotta pay more for some other things!\nSkins ... it's neither good or bad\nSeason pass is kind of useless.  5% Renown Booster?   7 Day Early Access To New Operator ?!  and for 30/20$ ?\nCome On! ... Give me a break!\n\n** This part is good for those who want to know about the community in this game\n- Community : Ubisoft has a good Kick/Ban System of teamkillers\n- Normally in Casual games people don't use "Voice Messages", But in ranked people try to use that ...\n- Chat Rage is Normal , In Ranked is normal too\n\n\n\nRating :  7/10\nNOTE : It's very hard for me to recommend this game , it's like playing on edge of a sharp blade , but guys ... be paitent ... it will be fixed and become a very good game ... i'm looking forward to the future of this game ... it'll be huge, comptetive and cool!\n\nEnd .\n###\n\nIt's My First Review Since The Deleted Ones!","March 3","true","219.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","6"

For one thing, the amount of TeamKillers has increased dramatically, especially if you play on casual, One time I went into a match on Bank, on offensive and was imediatly killed by a guy, I waited for someone to kill him cause well he was an as@hole, but nobody did, and I realized they didn't because they were playing together, like they knew eachother, and aparrently they wanted to play alone, people like this ruin the game, and ubisoft needs to do something to properly punish players that do this. Also I have recently been encountering nice and friendly people less and less, just more as@holes. There are three kinds of people I play with in this game, mostly guys who dont have mics, don't coordinate and don't comunicate with their team and get themselves killed first, secondly there are asses who will coordinate with you, but insult and criticize you for every mistake you make, (you'll encounter these guys mainly on ranked they don't like inexperienced players) and lastly the friendly people, who are rare now. They will help you give the needed call outs and back you up in a match and those are the best people in this game. And even with everything I said, its still not enough to not recomend this game, just if you are gonna buy it, try to find a clan or just some friends to play it with if you can, cause the randomes are wild cards now, thank you for taking the time to read this review and I hoped it helped you make your decision because this is one of the most tactical and team based multiplayer fps's of this decade and its an amazing accomplishment by Ubisoft. And I hope they make changes to help make the comunity of players more apreciative.","May 29","true","91.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","4"

So here's my stance on the game right now: ♥♥♥♥ing Fantastic, for the most part anyway.\n\nThis game has everything it needs to grow a reliable and consistent playerbase. Rainbow Six Siege's asymmetric style of gameplay is unique, and it seems very fresh. This arena shooter pits two teams of 5 operators against each other in intense extremely close quarters combat. The environment could be either your biggest ally or your worst enemy, depending on which team you're on or how your team's been handling a situation. While I think this game is great I cannot argue that it has some issues. Here are simple pros and cons to wet your appetite for destruction.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Fantastic destruction based gameplay forces you to think and adapt to any situation.\n\n- Has serious competitive potential. Ranked mode is good, but obviously the people playing for keeps aren't so nice. Ever.\n\n- SO MANY OPERATORS!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Microphone communication is a must. Text chat is limited to less than 6 words, making communication difficult for those who are either afraid to talk to people, or don't have a microphone. Sometimes, people don't even talk. At all. This makes the game unwinnable a lot. (EDIT: UBISOFT HAS EXPANDED THE AMOUNT OF LETTERS IN TEXT CHAT SIGNIFICANTLY, DISREGARD)\n\n- The community is very hit or miss at best. One can play 10-12 games and only 2 out of those 10-12 would be good, fair, non ♥♥♥♥♥y teammates who take responsibility for their shortcomings instead of blaming the rest of the team. Blaming the rest of the team is only okay if the rest of the team is actually to blame, which is often not the case.\n\n- Matchmaking seems to enjoy hooking people up globally. Which means that damn language barrier strikes again.\n\n- Terrorist hunt. My darling Terrorist hunt what have they done to you... Classic Terrorist Hunt mode is a rarity at best when Ubisoft decided it would be a good idea to just shoehorn in other game modes. And they're terrible.\n\nOverall, Rainbow Six Siege is a great team based game if you have a mic, patience, and good sportsmanship. So grab a corner, make yourself comfortable, and pray to god the enemy team doesn't have Thermite.\n\n7/10\n\nP.S.: The reviews angelizing the community are incredibly situational and subjective. Those reviewers got lucky and got matched up with great players. I never do. Don't buy the game based on the community because you will be thoroughly disappointed.\n\nBLACK ICE UPDATE: Oh Ubisoft. You make me so happy but also so, so mad. Black Ice is the first official content update of R6 Siege and it looks promising. It adds a new map and two new operators. It was released on Feb 2nd, but I can't access the content until the 8th... what the hell Ubisoft. They are pushing this season pass HARD.\n\nI considered lowering the score and giving the game a thumbs down but hell. Every AAA company pushes their season passes so who cares. I can wait a tad longer. I am glad that I get access to the balance update at least. And boy what a hefty balance update it is. Also I found it hilarious to see that Ubisoft still has a sense of humor.\n\nThatcher finally got his shotgun. Thanks, Ubi.","November 30, 2015","true","130.3"," 62 of 98 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","62","98","5","0"

One will spend numerous hours, and more, addicted to high octane game mechanics.\n\nRainbow Six: Siege brings to the table new concepts: breaching, scaling buildings, drones and special abilities, are the primary four. Core to the game, they sum up to a great pandemonium that never ages.\n\n'Operators' – the twenty-four characters you can play as – each count to the game, and each have a special ability. These abilities range from sniper scopes to EMP grenades; all of which contribute to matches, and none of which overpower the others.\n\nContrary to other shooters, Rainbow Six: Siege does not allows you to pick up weapons; rather, you are stuck with starting primary and secondary weapons, gadgets and grenades. Therefore, each operator has a unique style and mode of game-play.\n\nMatches consist of rounds of offense and defence, and there are three modes: bomb, hostage and secure area. In a bomb game, you either defend the bombs, or you try to disarm them; the alternative is to slay the enemy team.\n\nThere are 12 maps, small, medium or large sized, and no map is boring to play. You may scale the sides of buildings if you're on offense; breach through floors, walls, windows or doors with charges, guns or explosives; and if you're on defence, you can fortify walls or floors so that they cannot be breached by normal means.\n\nYou may customize operators to an extent, with more options coming in 'Dust Line update'. You have a collection of skins for weapons that you can buy, earn or some combination of both – in 'Dust Line', the rumour is that you can change head gear. Custom games are simple to create; there aren't much settings you can change, so there is minimal customization.\n\nThe sound in Rainbow Six: Siege is incredible and precise; you'll use your ears more than your eyes, and pick up more kills through sound than sight. A headset is necessary to get the most out of multiplayer.\n\nThe graphics of Rainbow Six: Siege are streamlined. With a HD texture pack that you can download to tweak  the graphics to perfection, they will always catch your attention. Explosions, bullets and the physics are all realistic, as well as the characters.\n\nTerrorist Hunt and Situations are modes that can be played on your own. Terrorist Hunt is player(s) versus bots, with three difficulties and various scenarios; and Situations is player versus bots, generally used for start-out experience.\n\nYou earn renown each game you play, and it can be spent on weapon upgrades, skins and in the 'Dust Line update', more. You may buy R6 credits to bypass some needs of renown gain.\n\nPositive'Adrenaline rushy' multiplayer.\nFast-paced and technical gameplay.\nOriginal and unique mechanics.\nRealistic graphics.\nPrecision sound.\nFun operators and cool abilities.\nTactical opportunities.\nESL affiliated.\nMaps packed with content.NegativeCheaters in matchmaking.\nSome hit detection problems.\n“Overall K/D” and not “Recent K/D” ratio.Overall10/10\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group","May 11","true","201.0"," 45 of 68 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","45","68","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEngiGuy/recommended/359550/","TheEngiGuy","TheEngiGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheEngiGuy/","437 products in account","This is when I wish Steam would let me rate games with a "mixed" rating instead of just a thumbs up or thumbs down.\nRainbow Six Siege is, objectively speaking, a decent game. But not a Rainbow Six game. From the series that brought you pre-planning, realism, high customizability and heavy guns, Siege turned it into a (kinda generic) competitive game with arcadey character movement and removed SP experience at full-price.\n\n- Let's get the pros out of the way. Destructible environment is cool, rappel system, kamikaze terrorists, non-linear gameplay and operators with different abilities and gadgets. Great maps too. Controls are responsive and doesn't feel like an unoptimized console port. Hooray to Ubisoft Montreal for doing a good job this time!\n\n- Lack of a proper singleplayer mode (my biggest gripe). No friendly AI (either basic or AI to give orders to) like, you know, all Rainbow Six titles before this one. Forget about Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and milestones. You are all by yourself clearing entire buildings, and even succeed in that!\nTo enjoy this game and make it more realistic, you're forced to jump into multiplayer, where you gotta pray people play tactically and don't use cheats or troll around. You also hope this game will never die, since the playerbase might move into other games in the future, thus 60 beloved bucks wasted. As you can see, I'm not the MP-type of player. Obviously, every game is so much better when playing with friends, but SP is a different experience.\n\n- Realistic? Character movement is arcadey and guns don't have much recoil (or at least, no effort needed to shoot accurately). Ability to lean left and right very fast while shooting accurately with long bursts, 1 second insta-melee kills, aiming down sight while proning-and-moving, still 100% accurate while aiming and moving, no movement and accuracy limits when injured, ability to stop reloading by sprinting.\nAI terrorists, sometimes, are kinda incompetent, and other times they play like aimbots. Terrorist Hunt mode has great potential, with good AI you can bring good gameplay, so hopefully they will improve it in the future.\n\n- It's way too overpriced. Multiplayer-only games should NEVER cost 60 bucks, especially since the content in this game is not that huge (this is the main reason why I asked for a refund). Did I mention there's a 30 bucks season pass and microtransactions too? They are optional, but still...\nPeople are not realizing Siege was made to also be a cashgrab for Ubisoft. Such enourmous prices for a downgrade.\n\n- Lack of mod support. This game could be a lot better and varied with custom maps, otherwise it will not last long.\n\n- No quick-chat function (à la CSGO) for people who don't use mics/don't have time to write in text chat.\n\n- Hitmarkers and weapon skins. The cancer of today's FPS games (thank God you can disable hitmarkers along with other HUD elements, but people who have them enabled aren't they in an advantage?)\n\n- Port-forwarding in 2016? Great. To make a party and invite friends you need to either open some ports in your router, enable uPnP, or adding your static IP in the DMZ (unsafe) if you happen to have a "strict NAT" according to the game.\n\nWhat a famous italian game reviewer said is just true: R6 was popular because of its intense strategy; with Siege, Ubisoft took the destructible environment from Bad Company, added the tactical approach of Counter Strike, took the gameplay from Call of Duty, merged all these things together and called this pack "RAINBOW SIX", with no trace of a Rainbow Six feature in it, but they have to sell their product somehow...\n\nThe review says I've played 1 hr of this game, but I played the alpha, closed beta, open beta and the free weekend. The devs made some survey for us alpha testers to give feedback about the game, but from alpha to final release the game didn't change much. I gave this game 4 chances and I also tried to force myself to like it. It's not a bad game, but just disappointing. I couldn't get into it, I'm sorry.\nI will update my review if future updates will improve things, and will play again once its price drops. 60 bucks is too much for me.\n\nPS: the community is full of fanboys. Look in the comment sections, or even in the forums.\n"Blah blah SP games are old now, MP is what matters now you grandpa". Funny, because Counter Strike was born in 2000, and Rainbow Six only a year before. This doesn't mean developers should turn all franchises into competitive-multiplayer type of games. In fact, this game is only aimed at competitive online players with balanced equipment, yet as an old Rainbow Six fan, I should shut up because what I'm looking for is "outdated"? Meh, so many sheeps in the videogame community enjoying what is relevant until it goes out of fashion.\nI want to see your reaction if Valve decides to make a new Counter Strike but centered around realism, strategy, ordering AI squads and no weapon skins, then we'll talk.\n\nTL;DR - With no friendly AI, campaign, planning, customization and realistic gameplay, this is literally a downgrade from past games (sold at the same price + season pass and microtransactions). In fact, Siege mostly focuses on competitive PvP - which is sadly becoming a trend these days - and "good-enough" Terrorist Hunt mode.","December 14, 2015","false","6.5"," 110 of 183 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","110","183","4","28"

I was able to play for some time without disconnects or crashes, the matchmaking seems to be a little faster than before and I haven't experienced graphic glitches in the meantime.\n\nIt's not that I would totally recommend at this time, but it seems the game is being shaped to become playable as it should be at the start.\n\nLike I said before, maybe at the end of the year we can have a very different scenario, and I'm expecting that. Beside its limitations, there's a great game here that just needs some polishing and more content. But if you think of it as an early access title, go for it.\n\n---------\n\n1st week review:\n\nOk. Let's be short and honest. It can be a very fun game like other shoters, but it can be frustating sometimes, and I tell you why:\n\nPros:\n+ Fun arcade gameplay;\n+ Destructible environment;\n+ Very high focused in teamwork and tactics;\n+ Operators have unique habilities that can change the game and the way you play.\n\nCons:\n- The same problems of closed and open beta remains;\n- Matchmaking issues (you will be waiting way more than playing);\n- Menus and weapon customization feels clunky;\n- No campaign;\n- Very low content for the full price;\n- Microtransactions (for weapon skins and XP boosters) even with paid DLC;\n- Lots of bugs (like graphic glitches, falling below the ground, not able to walk through a random place for no reason, hack exploits and the list goes on...).\n- And last but no least: There is nothing that justifies the Rainbow Six title here. That's just marketing.\n\nMaybe a year on with more content, patches and bug fixes at half price it would be recommendable. But for now, there's no way to recommend it with games like CS:GO, Battlefield and others with a lot more content and the same fun factor.\n\nI like to play it, but I feel that I need to play to make that 80 bucks worth it. More of that than for the fun I'm having. And that's not a honorable feeling I like to have for a game.","December 13, 2015","false","100.3"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","0"

Short but informative:\nRainbow Six Siege is one of the best MP FPS of this year, and probably in last 4 years. It is a little bit slow paced and requires you to plan your actions. Except that it has destructile enviroment and a lot of different operators with unique gadgets for you to destroy walls, doors, ceilings and floors. Game has great technical aspect. It is well polished and has literally no bugs. Only problem for now is servers issue, however Ubisoft is working hard on it and probably this issue will be resolved shortly. Gameplay is tolerable, and shooting and eliminating your enemy will satisfy you like in no other game.\n\nEDIT: Servers are now stable and connectivity issues are solved. so I raise my rate for this game !\n\nTL;DR ?\n\nVerdict : 9.2/10\nPros:\n+Tactics\n+Destruction\n+Graphics\n+Sound\n+Gunplay\n+Gameplay\n+Teamplay\n\nCons:\n-Bad teamplay","December 1, 2015","true","152.5"," 254 of 447 people (57%) found this review helpful 165 people found this review funny","57","254","447","165","25"

It's a decent game don't get me wrong, it's just really not worth the money.\n\nEDIT: In the essence of it all it's my opinion. Someone else may love this game and think it's worth every penny. As I have stated, the game is good and I do like it, my only gripe is the value for money. The AI isn't the best during single player segments and I hate how you can't pick your map/side (attack or defence) when creating either a private or single player game.\n\nAll in all it's the little things, however I stand by my previous statement that it isn't worth the price. You have other AAA games like Fallout 4 and Just Cause 3 priced at £39.99 and there is no justification for the extra £10.00 in Siege's case.\n\nEDIT 2: Yes, I know that they have dropped the price to £39.99 now but my opinion still stands. It is good of them to realise that they were overcharging but it shouldn't be like that in the first place. If the game goes on sale and further reductions apply then it will definitely be worth the money as it is a brilliant game.","December 2, 2015","false","96.6"," 156 of 272 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","156","272","7","23"

A very good and fun idea let down by quite a lot of things.\n\nThis are my Rainbow Six siege impressions, I've never played R6 series before, so as it is.\n\n1) No campaign. For 60 dollars. Yeah, right, you get only 11 multiplayer maps, and that's it.\n\n2) The tutorials are god awful. There are three video tutorials one minute each on the very basics, and then\nyou get thrown into a series of games vs a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. For example, extracting the hostage from a house with 20 or so terrorists, all alone. Not only is AI almost brain dead, but once you get to the hostage, it spawns additional enemies, so the way to play the hostage missions is to get to the hostage, take him with you, immediately drop, clear out the spawned reinforcements, take the hostage and move to the exit location.\n\nAnd then you repeat this 11 times in a row, because these "missions" give you a lot of renown, which is needed for unlocks.\n\nAnd the biggest problem is that the tutorial never explains 90% of the operators! For example, did you know that the Bandit can electrify reinforced walls, so that they become unbreachable by Thermite? I fould it out from Youtube! The game should at least explain how each class works in a short video, but instead we get beautiful, but pointless cinematics "introducing" each class.\n\n3) Classes and counter-classes. On paper,it sounds great - each player picks a class, which is essentially a normal soldgier with some gadget, and some classes counter others (e.g. Kapkan can set booby traps, but IQ has a detector which can detect them, thus countering Kapkan's traps).\n\nBut in practice, Since all the classes (in casual, at least) are picked with no knowledge of what the enemy picked, it is almost entirely pointless - you are pretty much guessing every single time, so there is absolutely zero pick-and-counterpick play.\n\n4) Uplay\n\nYes, for $60, you get a ton of free content including server lags, disconnects, and so on. From my personal experience, around every fourth game something will happen to you. And, if you are leading 2-0, playing the final map, and got disconnected 5 seconds till the end - congrats, you get no points, and you can't reconnect either.\n\n5) No way to study maps\n\nUnless you play them again and again and again. But in a game like R6 map knowledge is crucial for effective team play. Which means that for the first 20 or so games on each map you will be utterly confused as to where everything is, what the best approaches are and so on, which will severly limit your experience and game enjoyment.\n\nThis also ties to the first part of each round, where you spend a minute scouting with small drones for the enemies/hostages/bombs. Expert players can do it no problem, but as a beginner I had huge problems finding any of those since I didn't know the maps.\n\n6) Modes are almost the same\n\nBecause (in all the games I've palyed) diffuse the bomb, save the hostages and kill all enemies 95% of the time turns into "kill all enemies" - and by the time you get to the diffusal/rescue part, you are usually winning anyway.\n\n7) FPS\n\nThe FPS is all over the place. For example, I was playing one mission with 60FPS, restarted it, and the very same mission was now playing at 30-40 FPS. The game is very badly optimized, so expect random FPS drops, especially in intense fights.\n\n8) No communication wheel\n\nAnd that is another ♥♥♥♥ problem - communicating with your partners is real hard! The voice chat is nice, don't get me wrong, but not everyone is using it, and organizing something like "cover we while I plant a charge on the door" is nigh impossible without it, even if the players have the best intensions in mind. It is such a simple feature, and yet the game that needs it most doesn't have it!\n\n9) Weapon unlocks (aka pointless progression system)\n\nAll weapon upgrades are the same (e.g. red dot for the sight crosshair), so you would expect to unlock them once and then use them. Right? WRONG! You have to unlock the red dot for every single weapon, the recoil reduction for every single weapon, the silencer for every single weapon, even though it's the same freain' upgrade for all the weapons! Instead of just giving players a larger weapon base to unlock, they took the lazy route of artifically inflating the game with pointless individual unlocks.\n\n10) Barebones muliplayer\n\nThere is no banning people, absolutely no punishment for leaving. If you are stuck 4v5 after round 1, the game will continue without fining an extra player for your team (c'mon, how easy it is?!). And, as already mentioned, no reconnect feature.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnd a bonus: an unskippable intro 1 minute long every time you load the game.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nSo, to sum it up - I wound't say I didn't have any fun with the game, cause I sure did, but at this price it's really hard to recommend it - BF4, for example, offers a ton more content, maps, weapons, unlocks and so on. So unless you are really into the R6 series, I suggest you skip it.\n\nOverall, I would give it 6/10 (including the price factor)","December 3, 2015","false","35.3"," 146 of 256 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","146","256","11","20"

Each team switches out at the end of the round and the best out of six wins the game.\nPlayers can shoot through certain materials, create holes in walls, rappel buildings, and use gadjets to accomplish this task.\n\nYou might wonder why this game is worth the price as an online only multiplayer gameplay. If you think about it the game has ten operators (Classes) on each team. Each is unique to itself and the fact that you'll be playing possibly one of the operators unless someone picks it.  The combinations of operators changes up the gameplay with thier unique gadjets. The players you play with will be diffierent everytime with thier strength and weakness. There are 10 decently sized map with multiple floors or buildings. You have randomized spawnings for both sides (Until ranked).  Every scenario and experience is completely different.\nThey come from above\nThey can come from the side\nThey come from the sewers\nthey busted the windows\nIt all comes down to the gameplay and the different scenarios everytime and that is what keeps it fresh and fun for days.\n\nPros + Communication and teamwork for success (Players actually work with each other)\n+ Great amount of work put into balance between the operators (Classes)\n+ The 10 maps are all nicely made and the fact that the bomb/hostage can end up anywhere depending on team adds variation to the scenario everytime\n+ The sound effects are very nice\n+ The graphics and effects from blowing up walls, breaching, light shaking when breaches are made and bodies hanging from rappels.\n+ The concept behind players death you can still help the team by taking over cameras and communicating with your teamates instead of fiddling your thumbs until the next match.\n+ It differs itself from the large amount of fps you have on the market today. Much more fresh than your typical run and gun. Try being one of those guys and you'll see.\n\n\nCons - Tickrate at 16-32 for servers. ( How fast server gets information between your client) Hopefully they fix this. Sometimes you'll notice it if you are a competitive fps player or in general understands how this works.\n- People hate microtransaction, but it isn't too bad in this game due to the fact that it only deals in boosting how much points you earn or skins.\n- server issues even though its on dedicated server but might be due to launch issues.\n- Lack of variety of game modes since the core concept is revolved around attackers vs defense. It does offer single player but serves more of a training. There is also a Player vs Terrorist mode (Pve) with others.\n- No single player campaign and online only, not even a offline gameplay of any sort. Some of you might be turned off because of this but it is a heavily focused online game.\n- Not as much customization in terms of weapons and each classes is limited to around 2-3 guns but they all use different weapons for each class.\n\nVideo Reiew https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0H8pxX3w5Y\n\nYou had one job bro gameplay footages https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytV6ss0IFtI","December 3, 2015","true","24.4"," 27 of 40 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","27","40","0","1"

If it worked consitanately.\n\nRainbow Six Siege has all the aspects to make it a great title such as, Voip, Good performance and, interesting gameplay. Unfortunately what hold this game back is the fact that the loading screens are seriously bugged meaning sometimes it loads in a matter of second while other times it takes up to 5 minutes (Sometimes not loading at all). Another problem that plaques this game is that when a match is completed occasionally (actually a lot) the game will "forget" to give you your points from the match making it extremely difficult to rank up meaning you can't play proper ranked games (as it is locked until level 20) and cannot progress your character.\n\nOther than this it is a great game and will deffinately to be one to buy once the game is actually fixed.","January 3","false","10.3"," 49 of 80 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","49","80","0","8"

Well this isn't the game for you.\n\nFirstly, the game's servers currently run on 15 tick. For people who know what it is that's enough to know its horrible. If you dont know, 15 tick means the server reads and sends out data for player movement, shots and other actions 15 times a second. The minimum for games that want to be competitive is 64, and for high skill competitive tournaments it is usually 128.\n\nSecondly, the game is plauged with bugs, body parts can clip through walls, your body is not correctly shown (you can see your legs are not in front of you, but to other people they are), The in-game sound can stop completely until the next round starts, you can get stuck in objects, and drones often fall through the map.\n\nThirdly, and this may be because of the 15 tick servers, but movement and combat feels extrememly floaty and CODlike, the hitboxes are terrible, and often you are being killed when you are already around a corner. The guns all feel like they are just the same gun with different skins.\n\nI've alerady requested a refund, if they fix most of the bugs and the terrible 15 tick servers, I may rebuy. But if you were interested in this as a competitive game, don't buy it.\n\nEdit: While the 15 tick rate is unconfirmed it is very obvious from playing the game it is not high enough and the claims it was 15 were believable for me, as in-game you hear 1 shot but in the kill cam's damage log it shows as 5. And as for refunds they are done on a case per case basis so there is not a 0% chance I won't get my money back.","December 6, 2015","false","18.5"," 226 of 402 people (56%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","56","226","402","23","21"

Makes it very frustrating when you are doing everything right.\n\nCHEATERS... omg, already and no provision for this?  But hey, when you unlock an operative, it looks good.  I would rather have anti-cheat software though.\n\nNo punishment for team killing rather then the clunky vote kick after your whole team has been wiped out.  Joy.\n\nCustomization of weapons is a joke.  I can't change a scope on a weapon between rounds?\n\nInterface... just sucks.  I feel like I was using that Easy Menu for DOS.\n\nMatching making in general seems to be a throw of the dice.  A bunch of single digits clearance levels against all +20's.  That works well.\n\nLack of hardcore mode (crosshairs on my screen? Shooting from the hip? Unlimited ammo?).  Lame.\n\nNo campaign... isn't this Rainbox Six?!?!?\n\n\nUpdate Patch 1.1:\n\n\nWell, not much to say here.  Still drop every few rounds with a large amount of profanity.\n\nThey penalize team killing at the beginning of the round.  This is a feature that should have shipped with the game.

The game is a solid effort comparable to it's peers.  If you enjoy Insurgency or CS:GO it's probably a no-brainer to pick up at some point.\n\nAside from the relatively enjoyable gameplay, I don't care for the console-friendly aspects of matchmaking (no server browser or custom servers, only Ubisoft's Opaque and clunky matchmaking service).  And the UI is not optimized for kb/m.  These issues are unfortunatley commonplace to virtually all cross-platform titles so not unexpected.\n\nDespite the solid gameplay however, I do regret my purchase.  For the AAA price tag, the content is simply not there.  Add in Ubisofts aggressive and persistent microtransaction system and I'm left feeling dirty -- like I've just been taken for a ride.  At the $60 price point, Ubisoft is bordering on exploitation with the current offering.\n\nBottom line:  Solid game but Developer's level of greed is excessive and feels insulting.

A lot of the complaints from people who have bought the game or are considering buying the game originate from the fact that the game has limited content. After playing the game for almost 50 hours now and seeing the plans for future dlc I think that this criticism is legitimate.\n\nContent:\n\nThe game has 20 operators able to be unlocked. By doing the 10 prologue missions and completing all the per-mission challenges you are able to unlock about 10 of these operators so within the first 10 hours or so of gameplay you have already unlocked half of the game's content. I'm not sure why ubisoft would make this possible as for a game that will not have paid dlc and is supposed to be a grind for in game content they've made it waaay to easy to quickly unlock everything within a very short time frame. It is for this reason that the game begins to feel stale after unlocking most of the operators.\n\nBalancing problems:\n\nThe next problem with siege's operators are that they aren't balanced very well. This is a very large issue because this game is intended to be an esport in the near future. If they want to compare themselves to games like league of legends, they have to do a better job of making each of the operators relevant. Anyone who has played the game for a little while will quickly realize that the best attackers are by far thermite and fuse, while the best defenders are arguably rook, and mute. These operators will be quickly taken by your teammates leaving inferior operators for you to take. Yes the others can be useful in certain situations but thats it, certain situations, instead of basically any situation for the OP ones.\n\nRanked:\nI was pretty excited to hit level 20 so that I could start playing competetively. Unfortunately even in ranked many people elect to not use a mic, which greatly limits the amount of coordination that you can have. This fact basically ruins the ranked system for me, since the whole point of this game is teamplay and communication. Maybe they will introduce a better system of communication for those without mics (like the pinging system in LOL, but until then its a pretty big issue. There are also issues with matchmaking which make finding a game take forever, but hopefully this will be fixed eventually. These issues will not help in building a bigger community for the game in the future.\n\nDLC plans:\nFor a game that allows you to unlock half of the ingame content through doing the prologue missions, the fact that they are planning on bringing out only 8 operators in the next year greatly concerns me. When you compare this game to LOL, another competitive teambased game, LOL began with about 17 different characters. Over the next year after its release, they brought out another 25 characters. Thats more than a 100% increase in in-game content, and was one of the main reasons why LOL is the most played game in the world now. Of course its not a great comparison because theyre two different games, but it should give people an understanding of the expected longetivity of this game.\n\nTLDR: Yes the game has limited content, which is unlocked all-to-quckly. Balancing problems make many of the game's characters feel unuseful. Ranked gameplay is underwhelming currently. And the future DLC plan will not be enough to keep the game's community growing.\n\nVerdict: I see a lot of people doing buy, wait for sale or don't buy in their reviews. My verdict is to wait for a sale. The game has a number of issues, which aren't helped by the game's release price. Getting this game at a better price will make the game's issues less annoying, and since all future dlc is free there's no reason to rush into getting the game. Wait and see if the game is dead in a few months before buying.","December 10, 2015","false","162.3"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","26","39","0","2"

Especially rainbow six vegas 1 and 2. And let me tell you... They did exactly what needed to be done to expand this franchise in the right direction.\n\nWhat is this game all about?\nIt is about tactical close quarter combat. May it be fast paced or slow paced. All up to you and your team. It is a 5v5 setup with the teams taking turns attacking and defending. The defenders prepare defenses and traps while the attackers send in small drones to locate either a bomb, hostage or biohazard inside the building. And simply gather information about the defensive setup.\n\nAfter this first stage of the battle the attackers try to break through the defenses and complete the objective however they see fit. The defenders hold them back until the time runs out or the attackers are dead.\n\nThis is the core game summed up.\n\nWhy is this game good? What is has been done right?\nWalls!\nMost walls inside the buildings can be destroyed one way or another. Many walls can be sprayed with bullets and leave bullet sized holes to peek through. Many roofs and floors can be shot through or breached through. You have to be super aware to be prepared. To be prepared from attackers raining fire from below, above, sides, front and back.\nNo room is safe.\n\nOperators!\nThe game has several different types of operators. The attackers and defenders each have a set of them to choose from.  They either give you and your team a tactical advantage or are just better at killing and absorbing bullets in different ways. It is up to you and your team to decide what will work best. What combinations of operators will give you the best advantage.\n\nA slight misstep can cost you your life while it still being fair.\nHaving people to play and communicate with gives you a massive tactical advantage. There's so much variation to what you can do.\nThe tension of hearing the attackers moving around the room you're defending, hearing ropes outside the windows, hearing charges being put on walls around you. Those few seconds before everything goes wild… magical!\n\nI once killed three enemies while being the last one alive and the enemy team congratulated me. (WHAT?!)\nI once accidentally shot a teammate in the head and he didn't yell at me. Instead he forgave me and kept on supporting me and the rest of my team.. (DOUBLE WHAT?!)\nI've yet to run into any salty or grumpy players. Which is hard to say about most games.\n\nCheaters? I’ve yet to run into a cheater of any kind. I think the people complaining about cheaters just don't know how to be aware of their surroundings.\n\nThe game looks amazing. Explosions are not overdone and looks perfect. The sound engineers of this game did a marvelous job.\n\nWhat's is missing? What could have been done better?\nNo proper storyline or campaign!\nThe rainbow six games have had decent stories with some pretty fun co-op gameplay. This is missing completely and i understand why paying a full price and not getting any of that is a disappointment. Many are. As am i! The mechanics and destruction would have made quite the intense story missions.\nThe menus are not well done at all. No thought given to custom game modes... and choosing what map you and your buddy want to play on is fiddly and confusing.\n\nWhile the current maps are good and fun to play on… I can see them getting old after a while. I hope they plan to make new ones.\n\nSummary\n\nThe game is fun, hard, tense, challenging, not to hard to learn… Though it is hard to be good at.\n\nBetter co-op gameplay would have been nice… While terrorist hunt is fun and is always welcome to any rainbow six game… It still doesn’t compare to what could have been done.","December 13, 2015","true","29.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Operator with shield is tough, that sometimes makes opponents sick over it.\n\nReview  I’ve been playing this game since 25 Sept 2015 on the closed beta which was officially begun on 24th Sept – 1st Oct 2015. Thank you to my friend, Lo Wang Zhung, for giving me the Beta key. Because of those tons of fun experiences, I pre-ordered the game on 29th Sept 2015, whereas in the end of the month is a tough time where your pocket is in the crisis most of the time. Lemme tell you why that was worth it!\nIt is because THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!\n\nMultiplayer shooters continue to thrive and diversify, offering everything from twitch-action old-school arenas like the reborn Unreal Tournament to asymmetrical hunt-fests like Evolve. But no matter what your preference, I’m not sure there’s another online shooter as intense as Rainbow Six Siege. Health bars are tiny, rounds are short, quarters confrontation are close, high lethally, thrilling voice of destructions and explosions, features with friendly-fire, every position took up is crucial, every bullet fired had to be accurate, margins for error are slim, and the added element of verticality – through the harrowing dangers of floor – windows breaches and ceiling breaches – only adds to the joyous stress.  Rainbow Six: Siege has brought the evolution of gang Squad some steps closer to the realistic terrorism situation feeling.\n\nFirst-person shooter skill, in this game, doesn't really matter that much. It’s really all about organisation, tactics and teamplay. Communication was a strong point in the team I was playing with. Had little hesitations in speaking orders and providing status updates over the microphones with palms tingled--a tell-tale sign of the sweat that was beginning to prickle in hands,  it was a feeling that I had not experienced since my early competitive match-making days in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  A well-coordinated team can practically go all Rhinoceros on the other squad, setting off breach charges in multiple places simultaneously in order to terrify the opposition out of their cozy hiding spot and into a more vulnerable area. Siege is a rush in the very best of ways.\n\nAttention:  Download Ultra HD Texture Pack DLC to improve the game graphic performance ! 1. Just go to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege store page\n2.

You and your team must plan and execute unique strategies in multiple different game modes ranging from Hostage Rescue, to Terrorist Hunt.  Although there isn't much of a single player, the tutorial missions play out in an oddly satisfying, campaign-like scenario!  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this game is the fact that all the operators are based are real-world counter terrorist units.

Einfach mal "Wallhacks Rainbow Six Siege" bei Google eingeben...Die Wallhacks sind for free und man braucht keine Angst vor einem Ban haben..einfach nur erbärmlich!! Das schönste ist Ubisoft macht NICHTS!\n\nAbgesehen von den paar Bugs ist Rainbow Six Siege ein richtig geiles Spiel. Leider ist das Anti-Cheat Tool das schlechteste überhaupt.

Die richtig dreisten Cheater (kein Rückstoß, keine Streuung und Aimbot) gibt es nicht mehr bzw. spielen diese nicht mehr so dreist, weil sie Angst haben.

Mal erst permanent gebannt wird. Einfach nur lächerlich..\n\nEdit 3: Inzwischen ist es soweit, dass sogar im Casual gecheated wird. Das Spiel ist unspielbar.\n\nEdit 4: Mit Patch 3.0 werden Cheater jetzt zuerst für 15 Tage gebannt und danach permanent!\nZwar meiner Meinung nach noch nicht perfekt aber besser als der Zustand zuvor.\n______________________________________________________________\nOnly casual games are playable. If you want to play a beautiful FPS with a lot of hackers play Rainbow Six Siege! Good luck! Just Google "Wallhack Rainbow Six Siege". The wallhacks are for free and you won't get banned..it's just ridiculous. And best of all Ubisoft is doing nothing!\n\nApart from a few bugs rainbow six siege is a nice game. Unfortunately the anti cheat tool is the worst. "Fairfight" doesn't examine the players device but rather evaluates the statistics of a player. Only if a Cheater overdo his cheat skills he will be banned.\n\n"FairFight® is a non-invasive, customizable, Server Side Anti-Cheat engine using agnostic technology that operates in real time.

The shameless cheater have stopped their obviously cheating (no recoil, no spread and aimbot)because they fear the report button. Nevertheless there are still too much Cheaters especially using free wallhacks.\n\nEdit 2: Patch 2.3 has changed the following:\n\nFairFight™ - You have been temporarily suspended for 5 mins - Level 1 Monitoring Active\nFairFight™ - You have been temporarily suspended for 1 hour - Level 2 Monitoring Active\nFairFight™ - You have been temporarily suspended for 24 hours - Level 3 Monitoring Active\nFairFight™ - You have been temporarily suspended for 48 hours - Level 4 Monitoring Active\nFairFight™ - You have been temporarily suspended for 1 week - Level 5 Monitoring Active\nFairFight™ - You have been permanently suspended\n\nthat means you can cheat 5 times before you will get a permanent ban.

So I feel I'm in a position to write a review about this game, as I've become familiar with it quite well.\n---------:\nLet's start with what this game does right:+It employs a fantastic strategy concept, basically a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 2.0 with many more angles, given the dynamics presented with a destroyable environment.\n\n+There are load-outs for each operator, allowing the user customization to almost everything they utilize in the game.\n\n+The concept is similar to Counter-Strike games, in that there are "Counter-Terrorists", and "Terrorists" - Equating to Attackers and Defenders, although it switches every round so it's not as stagnant as CS:GO.\n\n+Making players unlock operators, as well as attachments or weapon skins, gives players something to "work" for. It takes considerable renown to unlock these things, and that takes play time. ---------:\nNow, Let's talk about why I ended up writing this review to warn players:\nThis game isn't finished. It should be worth an acceptable amount of 15-30$ - just a mere fraction of the price, in it's current state. As someone who tried very hard to enjoy this game as it employs quality concepts, Ubisoft fails horribly in its delivery - similar to how it failed with one of the recent Assassin's Creed games, where it was also unfinished. Let's list the cons:\n-Objectives are there, but never used. It's always a deathmatch, but with one life. For instance, bomb defusal objectives offer two sites to defuse a bomb. But, in order to plant the defusal, everyone has to be dead in that area. And the more people you kill, the more show up. You can't really play the objectives with how this game is setup. Rescuing a hostage is the same situation.\n\n-The view model is in the neck. What this means, is if you peak a corner leaning for instance, and they see your head, you won't see them until your whole head is showing. It's an easy headshot for them, leaving you wondering how you couldn't see them and they could see you. There's ultimately no reason to have this, as there are few objects to even exploit "head" glitching with. This isn't CS:GO.\n\n-Nitro cells(C4) are throw and detonate. They should be primed, as people such as the Gas operator can spam both gas and c4 almost instantly. I've seen 4k's just from how fast you can detonate c4, and all other deployables except for the two things mentioned - have to be placed and primed before they can be used. This logic would eliminate abuse of this system.\n\n-Currently, if you lean, your hitbox isn't even remotely near what you will see shooting at it, rendering most players almost invincible. So, for example, you see a guy leaning around a doorway and try to shoot at him, don't aim for his head. It's not really there.\n\n-If it isn't poor coding, such as that or the lack of movement from rappelling, it's poor netcode. There are users all over Reddit who post videos and images of the continued failures in this game, such as the netcode. For example; A user took his mounted turret and sprayed into a guy for 60 +bullets. No damage from any of them, and the target had his back turned.\n\n-Hitboxes appear unique to every operator, down to the actual model. This means, if you wear earmuffs and get shot on the far side of the earmuff, you got headshotted.\n\n-Riot shielders are almost invincible, and are moving tanks with almost no way to stop them. And get this, Ubisoft thought it would be a great idea to let one of them have a mounted flash-banger.\n\n-Poor Netcode results in players dying from thin air, where on their screen they are shooting you, but in reality, it's the air they are shooting at and it somehow gets linked back to your player, and you'll see just a puff of blood in thin air.\n\n-Ranked is a cluster**** with all the glitches and bugs, intentional or not. Majority of players, I'd estimate 85%, are doing casual or terrorist hunt.\n\n-This game offers 3 modes of play, 1 of which is basically a tutorial. Under the category of Multiplayer, you are presented with the following choices. These are "Casual", "Ranked" (unlocked at level 20),  and "Custom" (Free play for you and your friends with limited custom settings). The next category is "Terrorist Hunt", and you basically just fight bots that aimbot you through walls without any indication as to why. The last category is "Situations", a way for new players to get acclimated to the game.\n\n-Guests can join casual servers, which means they get away with hacking. This wouldn't be a huge problem if that wasn't what everyone was playing, as ranked is too broken to be played at the moment due to the condition of the game.\n\n-The recruit operator has access to every load-out in the game, and this kinda defeats the purpose of having classes; Granted recruits don't have special abilities.\n\n-DLC. While "Free", there is a hefty price for any new operators made available. It's taken me 50 hours to earn the required amount to buy 1 of the 2 operators from the last DLC. (25000 renown) You're probably wondering, "so what?" Well, the money grab is simple. People who have the season pass get them for free, and a week early.\n\n-Renown. You get at most, 320 renown from one game. These games can last around 20 minutes, and while you can earn renown from another option, Terrorist Hunt, it's generally almost as slow. The typical player earns 160.\n\n-Trolls. Usually guests or just bored players, these people will either kill your team mates or eliminate the hostage you are tasked to defend. This is because there is  virtually no penalty for doing anything of the sort.\n\n-No actual custom servers, only official. There is a limited version of custom servers, but no way to find them unless you are invited to them.\n\n-Ubisoft has a horrible track record with games, and this is definitely one of those games. Giving them money, particularly 60$ in this case, only lets them get away with pushing unfinished games.\n\n-This uses Uplay, the worst attempt at steam ever devised. My game save was corrupted 2 days ago, and I had to go into actual game files and follow an extensive tutorial just to fix my uplay. You can't play it without it.\nPS: I can personally testify that shield operators are largely broken, namely, "Blitz". This operator gets a riot shield with a flash bang ability on the front, not blinding you but anyone in your line of sight(within a certain distance). I've 1v5'd atleast 10 times using this operator, and people usually call hacks. It's just poor game mechanics, and needs to be nerfed. Riot shields do not decay to bullets, and the glass never breaks. The only way to kill a riot shield is to either blow it up with the 1 c4 on your team if you're lucky, or take a chance and try running up to them and bashing it down. (Even this can be avoided if you tilt your riot shield as it goes down)\n\nI do not recommend this game in it's current state. Wait another year, and maybe the devs will care.","April 24","false","89.3"," 88 of 158 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","88","158","6","21"

Secondly the game has some cool and unique things to put it apart from other games such as counterstrike, with addtions in it such as repelling, using explosive charges to destroy walls/open up new routes on the map, infact the destructibility in the game should be very much noted. I do also enjoy the champion/hero style of play where you pick a character with unique skill sets and weapons to play as and the mix of them on your team can make or break a game like a match of say league or dota, so that aspect is cool and yet again while its not a new concept I like seeing it implimented in a tactical fps shooter.\n\n\nAlright so here are my gripes, first and foremost the game suffers quite a bit from more than questionable deaths you will no doubt run into while playing because of server latinence, secondly there is some problems partying up with friends and dropping in out of matches randomly losing all your progress and Xp which can be very frusturating. Thirdly there are most certainly some balancing issues with the title as well be it with some characters have weapons that seemingly one shot you or abilities that are a bit over powered and abused game after game, one that will stand out more than any other which was a problem in the beta and is still a problem in the full release is the characters whom wield shieds, with pistols being a 1-5 shot kill depending on where you hit the enemy and what pistol used it can be very annoying to dump your magazine in the shield players feet and or sides and they turn and pop you in a couple shots......\nOne more very particular annoyance in the game is you may be running a very respectable machine such as myself Amd Fx 8350, 32gb of ddr3 with a geforce gtx 780, a machine that can easily take on bf4, battlefront, titanfall, crisis 3 and other AAA titles on high or ultra settings and Rainboe Six is no exception....for the most part, you will find yourself playing several matches in a row and then your fps just for no real reason take a massive hit, the problem usually requires a game restart to fix, or if your lucky it will correct itself upon the start of the next match.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOkay so this is one cool freaken game, that I will say first and foremost but then again it has some glaring faults that having played many fps titles over the years I found very annoying and down right childish to be in a big of a game release like this, so all in all its a cool game, cool concept, thats a bit too unpolished for me to reccomend in its current state, I would say maybe pick it up when it hits around 30-40 dollars on steam or grab it cheap on a key website or something but the 60 dollar asking price from Ubisoft is too steep at this current time.","December 11, 2015","false","54.1"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pirate_Sam/recommended/359550/","Pirate_Sam","^Pirate ^Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pirate_Sam/","274 products in account","This game severely lacks content. It's singleplayer aspect is just a bunch of training missions or a lone wolf against the AI which I'll discuss the AI in a moment. All the modes revolve around one concept, attackers vs defenders. There isn't much of a balance issue between the two teams. However, unless you pair up with a pre-made team you will rarely find a team that will cooperate/communicate let alone speak the same language. The whole gameplay revolves around cooperating and working with teamates. There's nothing more fustrating than the lack of teamwork in a teamwork based game. Period.\n\nThe most fun I have does not come from the competitive play, but from terrorist hunt against the AI. That's because it requires the least ammount of communication of all the gamemodes. The AI, however, is too robotic. It's not realistic or lifelike. The AI seem to be set on a particular path based on what you do. It takes the immersion out of it.\n\nAlong with that, the sound is horrendous. It has a 2d/3d sound. To clarify, you can ear all around you in 3d on your 2d plane, but if something is above you, you won't be able to tell if it's above or below or on the same level. That's pretty important for a tactical, quick paced FPS like this. I'm also not the only one to have this problem as I've asked several people ingame while I was spectating them through the deathcam. I've had no other issues with my 7.1 surround sound with other games like Battlefront, Fallout 4, etc.\n\nA lot of people were saying that the game has bad netcode, which it does, but the matchmaking is so terrible that it pairs you up with people globally that it doesn't matter because everyone is lagging. It's near unplayable under certain conditions. The client does not match what the server is showing. You see this clearly from the deathcam's and from surveilance cameras.\n\nThe matchmaking is one of the worst features of this game. Teams will be imbalanced (I've played a 3v5 games many times) and individual skill doesn't matter paired up against any pre-made team. Ever. When you play a casual multiplayer match you have to put up with peer-to-peer hosting meaning 100+ ping for most matches. Along with that, there's no anti-cheat or anti-grief system in place. Last night 2-12-2015 I've had at least one hacker (seeing through walls and scoring headshots, YouTube it if you think I'm only "hackusations") every 3 matches. As far as griefers go, there is no way to punish them. You just have to leave the match or shoot them back. But if you have to kill a griefing teamate at the start of the match, odds are you aren't going to win or enjoy your game in general.\n\nI have to give this game in its current condition a 5/10. It's a below average game. For the price it's not even worth a quick fix. If you truely have an interest in the game, wait until price drops, watch streamers on Twitch or wait the developers fix most the issues that this game has.\n\nLevelCapGaming has a good video on YouTube about his first impressions on this game. He mirrors most of what I covered if you want a rantless, honest review of the game in video form.","December 2, 2015","false","44.9"," 152 of 279 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","152","279","6","8"

As someone with over 900hrs on CSGO and having played it since 1.6 I can say that depth is relevant. People play dust 2 all day long year in year out without becoming bored because\nit is the human adversary that adds depth and continual change to approach every round.\n\nThis game has a multitude of option on operators that arent merely skins but offer different ways to achieve victory that\nsuit your approach. EG wanna bust through the front door then take a meat shield and let your team walk in behind you. There are so many options on entry poitns that every match is significantly different.\n\nThis is a great game that deserves your attention if you enjoy team fps games that require a little bit of planning each round. The graphics are not mind blowing but serve to allow a large diversity of gamers access which is only going to give the game a longer shelf life.

This review may change but so far there is nothing like this game on the market.","December 1, 2015","true","60.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

This game has casual multiplayer and ranked. casual is often quite fun and people are friendly. On the other hand ranked is ♥♥♥♥. the only thing it does is give you a rank, toxic teammates and cancer. The rank itself means nothing at all since you'll see bronze players (lower ranks) play against platinum players (higher ranks) which means the ranks don't determine who you play with. The nerve Ubisoft even has to call ranked "matchmaking" is absurd.\n\nOverall I think this game is not worth full price so I would suggest buying it when it's around 40-50% off.\n\n- the season pass is a total ripoff.\n\nEdit: The game is still ♥♥♥♥. You randomly get kicked often due to some errors and ♥♥♥♥. when you try reconnecting it won't reconnect you and it'll give you a ban.The ranked "matchmaking" still puts coppers and diamonds in the same match.\n\nEdit2: Dust Line\n\nThe game has fixed some issues, but it's still not worth full price. One of the most annoying things I've noticed is that people will see your head way before you see them on stairs for example.

In which you can't reach the multiplayer part 9 times on 10 because of the netcode and servers issues. But buying the Season's Pass apparently works just fine.\nJanuary 2016.

But there will be nobody left to play with.\nUbisoft, if that's the way you're going, I'm not following and I want a refund.\n\nI can't recommend buying, at this price and in this state, Rainbow 6: Siege.\n\n====================================================\n\nPros: the game is everything a strategic, slow-paced FPS aims to be. The game may needs some tuning and adjustement, but really minor stuff (often loudly requested by the community).\n\nMid: your teammates (and/or yourself) can be phenomenal mindplayers and teamworkers or all the way down to basic rushers and campers. This game requires you to cooperate and communicate, a concept that is sometimes forgotten. You'll have to improve yourself and do what you can with what you'll get.\n\nCons: the servers are in cardboard and the matchmaking is in plastic. For a game that offers maybe two hours of solo content, you can tell it's bad. This baby's only a few months old, and Ubisoft is apparently trying to kill it even before it matures.

The mechanics are fresh (breaching, surprising enemy,…) and the game will look good if your PC can follow.\nFrom a technical point of view, the game is a disaster: matchmaking errors, game breaking error (connection error which can make you leave a ranked match, and no system will allow you to come back in your match), bullet tickrate insanely bad, map bugs, animation bug, no report system, no ANTI-CHEAT system (we are a few month after release). Ubisoft quality of service and delivering a finished product IS NOT their priority.\nFor me this game is far from the AAA and price tag coming along that it claims. It is more like a “end-of-beta” game which need a lot of patches to be played in decent condition. If you are patient enough and don’t bother bugs (and lots of it). Then you will enjoy Siege. If not, I advise you to wait for the price to go down and the game to reach a “decent” playable state.","February 9","false","395.7"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","24","41","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jsplive/recommended/359550/","jsplive","Jsp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jsplive/","60 products in account","Rainbow Six: Siege is a solid title and can provide a fair amount of entertainment. It's a breath of fresh air in an age where first person shooters are all fast-paced mainstream games, like Call of Duty. Despite all of this, I feel like the game is missing something that can "wow" me, something that makes it feel like a truly special game.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics are fairly pretty for the most part. They definitely had the tone done right, as the usually dark-ish lighting kept me on the edge of my seat during every round. However, for the most part, the graphics are fairly forgettable and definitely isn't Witcher 3 caliber graphics. That being said, though, why would you buy a multiplayer game for the graphics?\n\nGameplay\n\nI have a lot to say about the overall gameplay. While the combat is incredibly fun, it doesn't feel like it's a complete package. It's not one of those games that relies on DLC, and thank GOD for that, but it just doesn't feel like you could get enough fun out of the game with a $60 pricetag. The game starts off on a great note, with an overall decent community and a learning curve that feels enjoyable. However, as time goes on, the game feels more repetitive than anything. At least 95% of the time, you never even get to your objective. Instead, it's more team deathmatch with one team wiped out instead of a bomb being defused or a hostage being rescued. Plus, the progression is ridiculously slow. Getting the operators takes AGES, but it feels like that was intentionally done so the game doesn't immediately become boring. The icing on the cake, however, is the fact that this game's matchmaking is ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE. Not that I'm shocked, I mean, this IS a uPlay game we're talking about here. But the more friends you have in one party, the less likely you're going to get into a proper game to play with friends. On the bright side, though, this game is very intense. The pacing and tension has my heart racing as I look down a hallway to see if there are any enemies lurking about. The game is pretty balanced overall, and I do like the idea of the operators so you can play someone that fits your playstyle. The game also isn't pay-to-win, with all of the DLC out at the moment being cosmetic items, though there are other things supposed to come out in the future. Overall, the combat is solid and enjoyable, but it might not keep you entertained for hours and hours.\n\nStory\n\nThis will not be counted towards the overall review score, but I will say one thing. This game had a perfect opportunity to develop a story, and the lack of a singleplayer campaign really bums me. The character depth seems to build up to something interesting, and then they're just, well, there.\n\nAudio\n\nThis, alongside the gameplay, make the game feel truly exciting. The music is forgettable and I don't pay attention to the voice acting, but the explosions, footsteps, the gunfire, and everything like that fits perfectly and makes for some really exhilarating moments. The sound effects were AWESOME, I will give credit for that.\n\nReplayability\n\nEverything I've needed to say about the replayability has been stated in the gameplay section. However, I'll summarize it in case you didn't read or understand what I said before. While the game is fun at first, Siege will begin to feel repetitive, and it might discourage you from staying and playing in the long run with the slow progression and horrid matchmaking.\n\nVerdict\n\nOverall, Siege is a solid game. Is it worth $60? Not unless you absolutely love tactical shooters, It isn't as good as I thought it was at first, but the game is still very fun to play. With the breath of fresh air using awesome sound effects and awesome combat, you will probably like your experience with the game. Overall, I would recommend the game if you can manage to get it at a discounted price.\n\nGraphics - 9.5/10\nGameplay - 9.7/10\nStory - NONE (yet?)\nAudio - 9.0/10\nReplayability - 8.2/10\n\n.:9.3/10:.\n\n+Intense gameplay\n+Keeps you on the edge of your seat\n+Awesome sound effects\n+Operators give you a reason to keep playing\n\n-AWFUL MATCHMAKING\n-Gets repetitive after a while\n-The objectives are somewhat pointless\n-Slow progression","January 20","true","155.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","1"

When you buy the starter edition you get four characters right off the start. Its already better then the standard edition. The only difference is that to get additional characters it cost more in game currency. In the 60$ version of the game the characters start off at the price of 500 in game currency then go up in price from there. While in the 15$ version the characters start off at 12500 in game currency. The grind is not really that long as long as you are a good player. I just bought this game yesterday for the third time to really see if its a grind. The game is not a grind. Right now they have 4 characters on sale for half off. So if you play all of the situations in the game along with the one day free reknown boost from uplay you will have enough in game currency to buy 2 more characters. So in total you'll start off with 6 characters right from the start. When  you start off in the 60$ version you get no characters you have to play as a recruit. 6 characters are more then enough because in all honesty I only use about two characters myself. The only time you will have to use a different character is if someone is already using said character. So in short yes this game is worth it. some people are just salty that they had to pay 60$","June 3","true","30.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Finally someone made a step forward, something different, I thought. It looked like Counter-Strike Remastered. And developers actually surprised me with how well the game is done from a technical standpoint.\nHowever, it's nowhere near as fun as CS:GO or PAYDAY 2. The controls are clunky, the inability to select specific map to play is infuriating and the way Uplay is standing between me and the game is unacceptable. I've had some limited fun in tutorial but acknowledging that this cripple is a single-player mode is very depressing and disappointing.\nThat said I still like to watch good streams of this game.","April 3","false","65.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Starting June 2, a special Starter Edition of the game will be available for $15/€15 on PC for a period of two weeks. The Starter Edition offers the full Rainbow Six Siege experience, with all maps and Operators available, but unlocking new Operators works a little differently.\n\nThose who buy the Starter Edition will immediately get access to two Operators, along with 600 R6 Credits to spend on two more Operators (or other unlocks) of their choice. The two initially available Operators are randomly chosen from a pool of six – Rook, Sledge, Ash, Fuze, Mute, and Smoke –determined to be the most intuitive for entry-level players. Additional operators can be unlocked in the Starter Edition by earning 12,500 renown (compared to 500-2,000 renown in the Standard Edition).\n\nAside from that difference, however, the Starter Edition includes access to the same maps, modes, level progression, weapon options, post-launch content, servers, and matchmaking options as the standard version, with zero restrictions and no level cap. The Starter Edition also works with the Season Pass, which grants immediate access to the eight post-launch Operators being added throughout 2016 (who are also available for 25,000 Renown or 600 R6 Credits each, which applies to both editions). Additionally, those who want to earn Operators a little more quickly can take advantage of the same Renown-boosting Daily and Weekly Challenges and weekly Operators discounts available to other players, and can purchase instant access to all 16 remaining Operators with a $35/€35 R6 Credits Bundle.\n\nThe Rainbow Six Siege Starter Edition will be available on PC through Steam and Uplay beginning June 2. Those who buy it will retain full access to the Starter Edition and all its content after the two-week sale period is over, letting you stay in the game as long as you want.\n\nThanks,\nGreat Game","June 5","true","85.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I should have stopped 200 ago.\n\nThis game is so fun, yet is one of the most unfair, unbalanced, and horribly scrapped together games i've sunk so much time into in a long while. Easy to learn, hard to master, but can so very quickly be ruined by the hacking, terrible matchmaking, and poor server quality.\n\nTL:DR\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game. Don't. There is no matchmaking to speak of. You'll be placed with opponents that will be level 100+ while you are level 1. There is no single player. Unless you want to be dying over and over and over again to higher level players, stray away from this game.\n\n+Fun and interesting concept\n+Great character and map design\n\n-Poor quality servers\n-Hackers/hackusation galore\n-The worst damage model ever\n-Shoddy hitboxes\n-Obvious money grab\n\nFirst off the good sides of the game. Rainbow Six Siege is hands-down one of the most entertaining and exciting games I have ever played. The level design makes sure that as a defender, you generally have nowhere safe to hide without extra reinforcement with a few exceptions. Each operator has their own flavorful playstyle and personality and unique guns and gadgets for all. That's pretty much where the fun stops.\n\nNow time to slop on all the bad stuff like gravy. Each gun, regardless of damage, is a one-shot headshot. The lowest damage in the game possible is a P90 equipped with a silencer, which when shot at a level 3 armor with Rook plating, takes around 20 bullets in the legs. However, one shot in the head with it, you're dead. This adds a lot of skill (or luck, or hacks) to the game. Although this is "realistic" it's simply not balanced in a gameplay perspective. You could have a pistol headshot you from across the entire map (around the size of a commercial plane) and you'll be dead. Where's the realism now?\n\nThe hit-registration and the server lag is garbage. Some operators have headphones on, which adds some distinction between player models. However these headphones count as the head hitbox, and when combined with the statement above, is a recipe for disaster. One operator in particular, Blitz, has a large riot shield protecting his upper torso and head. Or so it's supposed to. His headphones essentially double his hitbox so even if your shield is right between you and your attacker, there's a chance that one bullet will stray to the side and clip your headphones which somehow result in a headshot.\n\nOn top of this is the servers which can be summarized in a steamy pile of crap. The servers run at 60 ticks, which is much better than the 30 or even 15 it had launch and beta. But it's still not enough when all it takes is a single bullet from ANY gun to kill you. All of this, compounded by the effects of the Peeker's Advantage. For the uninformed it basically means when you round a corner you have a fraction of a second advantage over the stationary opponent because of the way servers refresh. So the absolute worst thing to happen in this situation is if Blitz is waiting around a corner, a dude runs right around the corner, and gets a clip headshot on blitz through his headphones.\n\nAnd finally to sum it up we have the marketing for the game. It is so very obvious that this game is trying to be Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Everything they're trying to do screams CSGO. A tactical, team based military shooter with two 5 man teams with one life that swap attacking and defending the objective. They put out more R6 Credit (their form of premium currency) skin bundles than they have patches to the game. Think about that. They held their pro league mere months after launch. This proves that above else Ubi is only in this for the money. They don't care about the game, they have the Division (Mar 8th) which launched 4 months after Siege (Dec 1st).\n\nIn sum this game could be the breath of fresh air that the FPS genre needed. But it falls flat on its face so hard, I predict that this game will essentially be dead before the end of the year.","May 31","false","341.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I don't play Ranked, but I do play with a full team of friends.  I havnt bumped into any hackers, but not saying they are not there.\n\nSiege gives a nice approach to teamwork based shooter with 5v5 teams with each sides having different operators that have different skills and limited loadout customizations.  Certain environments are destructable and can also be reinforced to prevent destruction or limit it.  Different types of objective based matches and multileveled maps.\n\nThose are the pros.\n\nCons are what 'break' the game from me.  Such as:\nHowever the way the game is coded, leaves certain players with advantages or disadvantages.\n-Rubberbanding:  Can yank you around making infiltration impossible and even have C4 or grenades that you throw yank back to you and kill you.\n-Being killed when no one is on my screen and turns out THEY WERE, but the game didnt update the movment of the enemy to me and therefore I didnt see them but I was on theirs.\n-Similarly, while being shot at, running around the corner which is an indestructable wall and being HIT STILL BECAUSE THE GAME REGISTERS ME AS OUT IN THE OPEN.\n-Or the enemy is just plain not on my screen when they are still, partially exposed, and full sights on me the entire time.\n-Hit registration: Awful.  Empty half of my automatic assult rifle into an enemy that is crouched in front of me with his back turned, as I'm hitting him in his body and HEAD he casually turns around and kills me with his SMG in 2 shots.\n-Matchmaking\n-Inability to change loadouts or purchase items while in a lobby.\n-Lack of proper info based on your teams loadout in the match lobby so the team can coordinate which items to use (think Payday 2)\n-Another game where I suppose you cannot trust the Killcam to depict the other side of the story (it'll infuriate you)\n\nEssentially, what happens on my screen is not actuality of what happens in the game, and for a FPS based on cover and environment I don't need that.  Maybe the developers will fix that, but probably not anytime soon.\nI cannot see this game as being a serious competitive shooter.","March 20","false","129.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","5"

Nobody flipped out due to a one time accidental TK.  People actually work together in this instead of going 5 completely different directions.  The community so far has been positive and the game itself is solid.  Unlocked all operators and primary upgrades already and am working on gearing each operator up fully.  Can't wait for the new operator(s) and map(s) coming in Jan.  I bought the season pas since the game itself was a gift so a net spend of $30 was so worth it.  Get it on UPlay if you must to save money but this game is fun for those who are tired of the excessive repetition of other FPS run and shoot games.\n\nLove the specialist operators and their abilities instead of one-dimensional characters in CS/COD/BF.  The destructible environments neverending ways to approach each map/mode are what keeps the game unique and fresh.  In CS everyone always went one of 2 or 3 ways and it became so predictable that after nearly 20 years of it, I wanted to play something different and this was just what I wanted.\n\nOnce netplay issues are resolved this game will be even better.  That and a mod community are all that is needed to make this game have more longevity like said FPS franchises above so we could have custom maps and scenarios.","December 15, 2015","true","307.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Then a few days after, you unlock everything, and you start playing ranked match. The ranks make mean nothing, you can play vs a team of gold 3 players and your team is full of bronze and silver, literally, who give a ♥♥♥♥ about balance, also I saw people with less stats then mine have a higher rank and this is due that ubisoft don't balance the team with stats or ranks and the ELO ranking system.\n\nMost of map spawn are terrible and it easy for defender to track where the drone is coming from which giveaway where the attackers will spawn, your prepare to do massacre before they even come close to the building your defending.\n\nThen you notice all the bugs, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ C4(nitro) & drone physic is trash. C4 literally stick to anything that you don't want it to stick at. The ranked matchmaking, most of the time, take a ♥♥♥♥ load of time to find people to play with. The ubisoft servers goes down multiple time everyday, sometime you just get kick out by a ubisoft connection error and you get a ban penality. Ubisoft admit to this issue, not voluntary of course, by banning the mid match leavers for 8 minutes only (was 15 before but they reduce it even more).\n\nIf your spamming leaning keys (Q & E by default) from right to left all the time, it impossible to hs you. There allot of mis caculated bullet trajectory which make you beleive you hit the person but actually you never him even if you saw blood (client prediction is terrible and server hit calculation is not enough or it just bad)\n\nNo good player play the game as it was intended to be played, the best strategy for defenders is to spawn kill and roam all around the map, I don't blame them, that how I play too because it the best way to win.\n\nThe gun balance make no sense, pointless to play with semi-automatic rifles the accuracy is total ♥♥♥♥ and the dmg don't even worth it. The best guns in the game is the one that have a high firerate, only the hs matter and spray with small smgs at head level just pwn anything.\n\nThen you start noticing the HACKERS, in your and enemy teams. When you try to kick one in your team he just call out your IP to the public because ubisoft don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their customer privacy information and share it with everyone in-game and the hackers can easily get anyone IPs that they play with. But don't worry, you kick him anyway and boom your connection just crash, I just wonder why. (ddos)\n\nI paid 80$ cad for this game and I seriously regret it. Even if it was half the price I would have not buy it knowing all the issues above. The game is out of beta and it does not feel like a smooth experience. I bought this game because I expected it to be flawless at this price tag and it is years away from being flawless. I have allot more thing to say about this game but my review is already long enough like this and my engrish might give people cancer already.\n\nOn top of that they dare to sell a season pass for future DLC, ubisoft, never again, no trust, no pity, no love.","January 3","false","159.3"," 54 of 99 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","54","99","6","1"

Unfortunately, R6 Siege has been a rather downward turn for the series.\n\nThe gameplay is straight 10/10. The tactical feel and life or death situational choices really hit hard when you're in the zone  and making every second count. It's a first-of-it's-kind kind of game, in the sense of how the gameplay is executed. I can't exaggerate when I say the game is overtly addicting, every aspect of the gameplay is intense as well as encompassing.\n\nHowever, there are two fatal flaws in R6 Siege.\n\n1.) The lack of Campaign.\n\nI don't care who you are, everybody loves a good story, and for $60, I expect some kind of story, or atleast build-up campaign. The lack of any sort of campaign whatsoever gives this game, for me, an automatic 6/10 rating, simply because a $60 price tag should include a campaign.\n\n2.) The horrible netcode, and unreal waiting times for matches is utter bs.\n\nMultiplayer is fine, but terrorist hunt matchmaking is completely trashed atm. I have not been able to find a single game since mid December due to 20+ minute wait times for games, all of which last 10minutes max.\n\nThe netcode is poorly written, and apparently not a big deal to the devs. There are a plethora of videos on Youtube showing how people shoot INTO walls, and KILL people standing ADJACENT to, or simply NEAR the wall, not BEHIND or INFRONT of said wall. It's a bad joke. When a game is built off being a tactical shooter, and one of which bullets can kill in 1-2 shots on average, the netcode can not be sloppy, and that's exactly what it is: sloppy.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is amazing, but the lack of campaign, ridiculous wait times for matches, and poorly written netcode destroy the fun that is here to be had.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazvon/recommended/359550/","Kazvon","Kaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kazvon/","612 products in account","There are very serious issues with the way this game is put together.\n\nA new player is forced to grind 15 - 30 hours (depends on your luck of win/loss) of "casual" queue with probably the most hostile community I've ever dealt with. Casual queue features organized teams pub stomping your randomly thrown together team of racists and screaming children.\n\nThere is no balance to matchmaking in casual...rank 100+ and rank 1 are all together, it's possibly because of lack of players since matchmaking times can vary wildly between 5 minutes and HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE (Highest was 55 minutes on a saturday night). The matchmaking wait time is often longer than the match you eventually get into.\n\nThere's a good number of maps, and you better learn them fast because any mistake will get your teamates to kill you on your next spawn and rage at you for not having 200+ hours experience in "Casual" queue. You also can only mute voice, not the chat. And you can't turn chat off.\n\nYou also start with none of the characters unlocked.\nUnlocking all the different classes takes a long time, even with boosters.\nAfter 25 hours of play with a bonus xp weekend + a paid booster (a 100% XP boost total) I still have guys to unlock AND I'm only at rank 17...\nYou need rank 20 to get into ranked matches and out of Casual.\n\nPeople have been reporting serious technical and compatibility issues such as crashing on launch, crashing randomly, etc.\nThey've been reporting these issues since the game came out, and there's no  fixes on the horizon.\nThe main technical issue I have is THERE IS NO ANTI CHEAT.\nSo the already toxic playerbase is also rife with hackers.\n\nSPECULATION TIME:\nIt's worth noting the game is developed and produced by Ubisoft - who don't really do the 'games as a service' thing like Blizzard or Valve. So any serious changes or fixes that require significant dev time will probably be in a sequel rather than a patch.\n\nTLDR: Competitive shooter with unmutable toxic players and no anticheat. Features tons of grinding and microtransactions.","June 2","false","31.3"," 33 of 59 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","33","59","8","4"

Missions that are pretty much just tutorials to help newbies understand the game mechanics.\n2. The cancerous Terrorist Hunt Mode\n3. Multiplayer\n\nThe tutorial missions are fine as they are in my opinion, although some seem a bit too difficult especially since the majority of people that play those missions are people fairly new to the game.\n\nAnyways, on to the actual gameplay!\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nThis is basically what 99% of the game is, or at least what is focused on, so you would expect it to be flawless, right?\n\nHaha, yea...\n\nYou join the queue to get into a match. The recommended time is 30-50 seconds. That seems pretty amazing, but no..\n\nEveryone get's into the match and gets to pick the operator of their choice. Everything goes smoothly. But every single time.. there is always that one guy that is playing on a potato with bent paper clips sticking out of it trying to pick up the signal from his 1 KB/s internet plan. The game takes 5 minutes just to start. This gets super frustrating considering each round only lasts 2 minutes on average.\n\nPROS:\n\n+The multiplayer has lot's of content, fully destructive maps and intense fire fights.\n+Killing enemies is difficult and satisfying.\n+Literally no match is the same.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Uplay\n\n-Potato servers that make everyone lag and sometimes causes players to get disconnected\n\n-Godawful netcode (What's that? You shot that guy in the head 17 times and saw blood go everywhere!? He still has 67 health, even though 1 headshot counts as a death)\n\n-Cheaters everywhere. I shoot a guy 15 times and then it says he has full health.\n\n-Frost's shotgun\n\n-Lag is insane\n\nYou'll be eyeing a corner, making the best choke point the world has ever seen. You are so focused that even if someone appears for just 1 microsecond, you'll be able to get them.\nBAM, you're dead!\n\nYou're extremely confused on what just happened. Did someone get behind you? The killcam comes on and you see that the guy came around the corner and was standing right in the open for 5 seconds, and shot you. The lag caused you to not even see him appear! FANTASTIC!\n(And no, my internet is fine. Thanks for not asking)\n\n-The level 3 guy that has no idea what he's doing and ends up shooting the hostage point blank with a shotgun because logic.\n\n-Buck is severely underpowered. The skeleton key is weak, and his assualt rifle recoils so much you can barely shoot anything.\n\n-You'll be put in a match against fully cooridinated teams that are basically level 150 that will wreck you every single time.\n\n-When you spawn as the attackers, take 5 steps to the left, and get sniped from a window.\n\n-Defenders that jump out of the building and start shooting at you 15 seconds into the match.\n\n-Lack of customization. Each operator has around 2 guns they can pick from, and 9/10 times one gun is 100x times better than the other so there's really no point in choosing.\n\n-25,000 renown for the latest operators that you can get if you buy the season pass. What does this mean? Are the next operators going to be 50K, 100K? Don't force people to buy your season pass.\n(Keep in mind that even 25K is a bit high considering you only get like 200 renown a match).\n\n\nOkay, yea.. playing multiplayer on this game is just going to leave you feeling unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of epic moments that happen, but it's severely outweighed by the all the previously listen bad things.\n\nTime to review the.. ugh..\n\nTERRORIST HUNT\n\nChoose to play alone or with a team, with 3 different difficulties. The harder the difficulty, the smarter the AI.\n\nPROS:\n\n+It's fun.. I guess..\n+Good for warming up before going into multiplayer matches\n\nCONS:\n\n-It sucks\n\n-Suicide bombers\nIn a game where a couple well-placed shots means instant death, these bombers are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You'll be cautiously scoping a hallway, when a bomber appears and starts sprinting towards you. You put an entire magazine of ammo into his chest, but it doesn't do anything. He then goes boom-boom in your face, causing you to lose.\n\nThere are so many cons about it that I'm too lazy to list them all.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\n5/10 if you're a casual lonely player like me. Probably an 7 or 8/10 if you got an actual squad to play with.\n\nI'll update this as the new content slides in and more patches get released. I have faith considering they are aware the servers are crap and they are fixing bugs, like the invisible Kapkan laser exploit.","January 3","false","160.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

I have ♥♥♥♥ed up so many times, and believe me I am BAD at the game, but the teammates told me "It's fine." or alot of times "Our bad." (Except for one french guy which I sprayed down with an enemy by mistake, but eh thats a minority.)\n-Communication is super-important, makes the game  even funnier. Knowing the location of an enemy can change the WHOLE game, literally.\n-When you start playing, you have 10 simple situations who can help you get the hang of the game.\n-Getting money isn't hard, and you can buy OPS quickly. (When you have 50 hours, you should have every operator in the game)\n-The developers actually care about the game, and they update it alot and fix bugs. (Look at the difference from beta to now.)\n-Most of the maps are beautiful.\nAnd now, Cons:\n-The game isn't EXACTLY through steam, and the UPLAY launcher is TRASH. sometimes you need to open and close it to even see your friends updated.\n-Ranked takes a long time (Normal time 3~5 mins, if you are unlucky 9 mins) to find a game, yet the game is still quite new.\n-The first 10 hours can be really frustrating and confusing if you try to play Multiplayer.\n-HITREGGGGGGGGGG (thanks low)\n\nSIDENOTES:\n*People say there are a lot of hackers and LONG (30 minutes) wait time in ranked, no. that is just a /r/eddit circlejerk :<.\n*The better headset, the better skill you will have... not sure if its a con or a pro.\n*Nitro cells can be SUPER annoying, or SUPER useful.\n\nSome quality Siege youtube channels to check the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwrxS4HlY-ZQjR2eQOYFlxg - The guy is on a break but great content\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/RTommyT999 - Top 10 kills videos are really intresting and fun to watch ^^.\n\nComment if I forgot anything ^^.","April 19","true","39.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

At first, I figured that it was a problem on my end, so I took to the Ubisoft support forums to try to figure out what to do.  Ubisoft proceeded to do next to nothing.  I got one reply that asked me to do a clean install of the Microsoft .NET framework, which I did.  When that didn't work, I took to the same forum and explained that my problem persisted and never got another reply from any Ubisoft employees.  They just straight ignored my problem.  Too busy creating weapon skins for microtransactions I guess, but I digress.... Anyway, I tried a variety of other fixes on my own including doing a clean install of my graphics card drivers and disabling my SLI (my laptop runs two NVIDIA GeForce 750Ms in SLI configuration) but that still didn't work.  After awhile, I looked at the system requirements page and found out that, despite the fact that NVIDIA loudly and proudly displays their logo in the games opening sequence, they actually don't provide support for laptop video cards.  I'll own up to the fact that I did not check the fine print about exactly which cards are supposed to work, but when I looked at the minimum requirements for a game and found that my graphics cards are two generations newer than the minimum requirements and in SLI configuration?  You'd think you'd be able to at least run the game without crashing.  If you plan on running the game with a laptop, be very careful.  It'll work without a hitch for hours sometimes, but at other times you'll crash literally every single round of a match.\n\nAnother problem the game has is the matchmaking system.  It's always had it's quirks, but recently it has been ridiculous.  I'll admit that I am not a very good player. My kill/death ratio is around .6 and my win/loss ratio is about .8.  But that is exactly why I prefer to play ranked, believe it or not.  The reason I prefer to play ranked it because, when it does work, it works absolutely beautifully.  When you get two evenly ranked teams of players (even bad ones) this game turns into a pulse pounding thrill ride the likes of which leave your hands literally shaking from the excitement and drama of the down to wire, kill being traded for kill match.  What sucks though, is that, generally speaking, this simply doesn't happen.  The matchmaking system just plain doesn't work.  Usually (I'd say something like 60% of the time) the match is grossly one-sided with one team being composed entirely of gold-ranked superstars and the other one being composed entirely of bronze-ranked noobs like myself (and yes, there is an entire rank, silver, in between bronze and gold).  Of course, I don't have to tell you how this type of match ends, the noobs get absolutely stomped.  We're talking noob team gets zero kills and is eliminated every single round.  Furthermore, Ubisoft recently made a rule that players have to play 10 ranked matches in order to have their rank determined, regardless of kill/death or win/loss ratio.  What this leads to is ranked people like me playing alongside "unranked" people with kill/death and win/loss ratios of 2 or greater.  I'll admit, this is kind of fun when someone like that ends up on your team, but it's in no way fair to the good player who has to schlepp with we unworthy or to the enemy team who gets glacked with repeated headshots with no real good way to defend themselves.\n\nFinally, the game just plain lacks functionality in some areas.  This is stuff I really wouldn't expect if it hadn't been integrated into previous rainbow six games, but the fact that if you have a suppressor or laser on your weapon then they are stuck there, is annoying and immersion breaking at best and a deadly disadvantage at worst.  Enemy players can see your laser which makes it more of a liability than an asset in most situations and having a suppressor decreases your damage output so there is no reason to have it on when the enemy knows where you are.  Also, if you are playing terrorist hunt alone with some friends, the lobby is always on a timer.  This means that if you are trying to experiment with your loadout you only have 30 seconds to do it before the game will shove you out the door.  I understand why this was implemented in multiplayer, but when you're playing with your friends against AI, why put the players under that kind of stress?  Furthermore, until recently, it wasn't even possible to choose whether or not you wanted a laser or suppressor on your gun in the lobby.  You had to completely leave the match, go to the operators screen, navigate to the gun you wanted to change, and then decide what attachments you wanted your weapon to have, again, regardless of what situation you will be in while you're in the match.\n\nOverall, this game is excellent, truly excellent, when it works.  But realistically speaking?  Between the less than helpful support staff, the very bad matchmaking, and the plethora of poor game design choices? I think most people will find their money better spent elsewhere.","June 4","false","120.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercedesBenz/recommended/359550/","MercedesBenz","Syncroniam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercedesBenz/","359 products in account","I don't really do reviews, but I wanted to do this review like a few weeks ago, but was too lazy so here's the rundown I'm going be giving this game now.\n\nI might be pretty biased of my opinion of this game since I'm in love with tactical shooters and games with no respawns in general, but I have to say this game is pretty amazing...despite all the bad stuff.\n\nFirst off I'll start with the pros of this game...\n\n+ There are NO respawns whatsoever. This is a round based game; you die in a round, you STAY dead for the rest of the round. Which means any little mistakes you make are on you or your team. You have to THINK and PREDICT where the enemies are coming from. Everything matters and counts. You have to correct your mistakes for the upcoming rounds and think about what you did wrong and what you should NOT do the next time.\n\n+ Probably the best sounding game ever. The sounds are godlike in this game. No game has a sound and audio team like Six Siege's. The sound propagation is used so well in this game.  You can literally hear water leaking, walls crackling apart, gun sounds ricocheting through rooms, and stuff like debris falling onto the floor even if you're below one floor of it. Which obviously makes listening to footsteps NECESSARY to living in this game. Footsteps can either get you kills or get you KILLED. Seriously the sound design is so good and mindblowing in this game I cannot express how much I love it.\n\n+ Dynamic and well detailed maps. The map design of this game is amazing. Some maps easier and less stressful than others. They all correspond well into making your gameplay different everytime. Every map has a day or night side of it. Personally night maps are always better in general. Especially in this game since daytime can be a hindrance time to time especially with the bright ♥♥♥ sunrays blinding you in this game when you're a defender. Some maps are REALLY big. Bigger than you expect a game like this to have. I guarantee you won't love all the maps because some maps have really annoying areas you just won't like attacking or defending. That's just how it is. The maps are pretty detailed; there's radios you can shoot out to make less noise so you can listen better, well designed trap doors for attackers, beautiful textures on things like paintings and walls, you know stuff like that.\n\n+ Well designed operators with their own personality. Each operator are beautifully textured and well designed with their special abilities. No operator is overpowered and every operator has a counter for one another. It's how well you play with their abilities is how you prosper in this game. Every operator is voiced perfectly well and sound realistic to their character. Operators even have data like age and background story for you to read, which are actually pretty interesting and cool. Especially since we have no real story mode going on. It's always nice to have a little background info for little stuff like that.\n\n+ The community at its prime. Despite all the cheaters and idiots teamkilling for no reason sometimes, you can really find some good and quality teammates that will use as much teamwork as they can to win, which I really love. I swear at times when I wanna log off for the night and get some sleep I end up staying up 3-4 hours just because I found a good and competent team which makes the game REALLY fun. You really don't know how much teamwork makes this game fun. ESPECIALLY if you're on a long winning streak with your team, that just makes you wanna keep playing more; I mean come on, who doesn't love to win?\n\n+ Free future content. I think this may be one of Ubisoft's first games that featured the "YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR FUTURE CONTENT" thing. I think The Division is also doing something like that also. I'm really glad that Ubisoft is changing their ways for the future of there games sake. All future maps will be free, which is good and would of been stupid if it wasn't because there would've been a big community split and nobody wants to pay for maps in a game like this. All future operators will be able to be bought by in-game currency for a higher price than the original operators in the game. This is great because basically you don't NEED the season pass AT ALL. The season pass is basically a one-week early pass type of thing. Everything except for skins would be available to everyone to use after 1 week after the season pass content release.\n\n+ Ubisoft game support. The amount of work and bugs that Ubisoft has fixed to make the game better is extremely good. For example they recently put there foot down and are going all out against cheaters permabanning them and whatnot. The game was a MESS at launch and in closed/open beta. Most things like the matchmaking which was HORRID in the betas and around launch are fixed for the most part. They even do events that spice up the game a little like for example one of our recent events were called the "No Man Left Behind Event" where you have to keep as much teammates alive per round and if we got to a certain number milestone (which we did), they would give us a reknown boost for the whole weekend (which is currently going on right now.) So yeah the team behind this game definitely cares about this game and I don't see the heavy support this game is getting running out anytime soon.\n\nSo I think that's all I'll put for the strong points of this game. There are a little more than that, but really those are the only ones I can really expand upon (plus I don't wanna make this review long and boring.)\n\nNow onto the cons...\n\n- No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ customization of how you look whatsoever. This game isn't like your previous Rainbow Six games in terms of customization. Nope. Not a single cosmetic difference you can make of how your character looks. I REALLY hate that. Not only because I'm big into cusomization, but because we play with the same looking operators over and over. I have like what over 200 hours in total (betas included) of this game and sometimes I really do get tired of seeing the same faces over and over again. It's insanity man. The only cosmetic customization in this game are gun skins. That's it. They look really nice, but come on really? Just gun skins? Even Call of Duty nowadays have in-depth character customization. This is a $60 AAA game. They could of at least added more for customization other than gun skins.\n\n- You can't add other people... What kind of ♥♥♥♥ing game design is that? Why do I have to go through uPlay and manually type in someones name just to add them??? SO STUPID. I've never seen such terrible social interaction game design such as that. It makes me so mad because I've never seen a game that DOES NOT let you add another person. ESPECIALLY IN A TEAM-BASED GAME LIKE THIS. Remember this is a $60 AAA game. Not an indie game, yet they lack an adding function other than uPlay...like wow, seriously? One of the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ I've seen in a game.\n\n- You can't buy operators or anything during the planning phase. You have to backout even when you have a full team to the menu screen just to buy another operator/gun/skin. Who made that stupid design decision? Like why? That is another stupid ♥♥♥ design flaw I have ever seen. Literally there is NO reason to make the player unable to buy anything during the planning phase and. It's been asked several times on the Six Siege subreddit, but Ubisoft won't make it happen for some reason.\n\n- You also can't customize during the planning phase. So you're telling me I can't change anything like my gun sights or skins during the planning phase also? Who the ♥♥♥♥ is making all these terrible game design ideas. EVEN INSURGENCY lets you customize your gun mid-game. It's ridiculous.\n\nPersonal rating - 10/10.\nBut in reality it's a - 7/10.","January 31","true","403.9"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","19","33","3","7"

It has several server and matchmaking issues, like occasional lag, being shot around corners, glitched loading screens, etc. But I don't think it is game-breaking in any way.\n\nIf you are a destruction fanatic like myself, this game is the definition of a destructigasm. The gameplay is solid, from the different Operators, to the varied and destructible environments, to the constantly changing game scenario. No two rounds ever feel the same which is awesome, so good work to Ubisoft for implementing a way to make each round different.\n\nI also appreciate the way that Ubisoft are handling the DLC. There is no need to buy the Season Pass, because all future Operators and maps are for free for everybody! Wait, what? Is this THE Ubisoft we are talking about? Buying the Season Pass allows you to gain early access to this new content, as well as some XP boosts, skins, etc. But thank you to Ubisoft for not dividing the community through DLC. It's all free for everybody, which is exciting and will keep players coming back in the future.\n\nOverall, if you want a tactical, team-based, hardcore shooter with great graphics, solid gameplay, and no shortage of fun, this is the game you are looking for.

Nah you are sideways, looking at the floor and then randomly shoot 1 bullet at him.(A tad bit exaggerated but still accurate.)(Most of the time my ping is like 40-60 so yu kno.)\n\n3. The search times are very varied between servers (North eurup servers have like 5 players playing, west 9000000).If you find yourself in one of dem empty servers just change your default server.\n\nSearching for casual matches takes around 3-5 mins and the competitive mode is close to that sometimes longer.\n\n4.

The modelling is clean, the colors are vibrant, explosive effects and bullet trails are very well developed, and even add light smoke to the area for a second. It truly adds to the immersion and actually can hinder visibility enough to change the game, even though it barely lasts. The lighting is very nice, but I feel that it's not as good as advertised as above. The game simply doesn't have the level of bloom/Ambient Occlusion that the pictures do. However, shadows are processed very finely. I feel that a better bloom/AO and destructible lights would make this game much prettier, but not necessary at all.\n\nControls: 8/10 Keyboard controls are actually very fluid, much more than some other FPS games that mix up the crouch/prone/melee buttons. With character mobility, you can walk (ALT), run (W/S), strafe (A/D), sprint (shift+W), crouch (C), prone (V), and most importantly, lean (Q/E). The only thing you can't do is Jump, but you can vault over obstacles. Character mobility is very fluid, and characters even have varying speeds/armor based on their specialties. There are no wonky out-of-reach keys or weird hotkeys at all.\n\ngameplay: 7/10 [h4]general[/h4]\nR6S can have some very different gameplay between each round, but whether it's a rush in with guns blazing or a tactical synchronized C4 incursion, one thing is constant: teamwork is required. The health system is fairly realistic while still giving leeway for actual playability. A player can go from full health to dead in a matter of a second if they stay in the open and allow one person to fire on them, and it happens a lot. Where teams start at 5v5, if you have one person less than the other team, it could drastically change the outcome. Cover is required. Stealth is needed. Teamwork is mandatory.\n\ngame modesEach game starts as a 5v5 round-based game with an objective:\nHostage Retrieval\nBomb disposal\nSecure the AreaIn hostage retrieval, your goal is to either break in, get the hostage, and get them out alive, or to defend the hostage.\nIn bomb disposal, there are 2 bombs armed, and you either are to diffuse one or protect them.\nIn Secure the Area, a room is marked and you must gain control by being in the room, or keep the attackers out.\n\nEach game mode is an attack/defense style, and though they are interesting, usually a game will just end as a TDM. There are no respawns for a round, so if all 5 are killed on one team, the others win automatically. The first to win 3 rounds wins the match.\n\nEnvironment InteractionIn this game, walls and windows are (selectively) destructible. Defenders can reinforce them, but attackers have specialties to get around it (such as thermite charges or long-range wall explosives). Getting a drop on the enemy team can quickly lead to their death in a matter of seconds. The only thing is that sound plays a huge role in this game. Every footstep has a distinguishable sound, heard through floors and walls. Sometimes it's impossible to figure out where it is, sometimes its right by you and you know it. Walking/crouching stops sounds, but makes you a sitting duck. If a defender hears an attacker planting a charge on a wall, they can simply shoot through the wall, disable the bomb, and potentially kill the attacker.\n\nPlayable CharactersCurrently, there are 10 attackers and 10 defenders. Each team may have only one of each depending on their team. There are 3 kinds of broad classifications for the characters: Damage, Defense, and Support. Damage classes, such as Tachanka and Kapachka (Spetznaz) provide superior firepower and potential harm to enemies, using turrets, explosive door/window traps, explosives that shoot through walls, etc. Defense classes do one of two things: for defenders, they help, well, defend. Rook can provide body armor, and Castle can put up bulletproof barricades. For attackers, they focus on taking down the defenses, or support shields. Thermite can take down reinforced walls, Ash can take down walls/barricades from a distance, There are 3 shield classes as of now: Fuze, Blitz, and Montaigne. Shields are bulletproof and hard to shoot by, by easily flanked if left open, and only carry a pistol. However, they provide superior defenses for teammates. Support classes will do various things to help the team as a whole. For defenders, Doc can revive downed teammates from a range, or even revive himself.  For attackers, Twitch can remotely disable traps and hurt defenders with a shock drone. The variability in team composition creates unique gaming experiences in every match.\n\nIntelThis is a minute aspect, but important nonetheless. At the beginning of each game, each team knows nothing about the other team. But there is a brief time while defenders reinforce a room that attackers can send drones out to search the map for the enemies and objective. Alternatively, defenders can use surveillance cameras placed around the map to locate and identify attackers. Both drones and cameras are susceptible to damage though, and easily destroyed if found. Knowing the enemy team can greatly increase your chances if you know how to use that knowledge.\n\nNetworking/social  This is the only true drawback I see with this game. Ubisoft has slightly improved on networking, but it's still a ways to go. Every now and then when joining a game, you might get locked indefinitely finding a match, or indefinitely loading a game. Sometimes in the character selection screen, both teams are locked up because one person can't load. It truly does get aggravating sometimes, but it's easily manageable. The chat system, however, is horrendous. Each message you type may only have up to 32 total characters. For those unaware, that usually isn't enough for a sentence. However, the voice chat is decent quality, but maybe a little low volume in balancers. I had to drastically turn down other sounds and up my PC volume a lot to hear others, on two computers. Also, there is no direct way to invite your current teammates to a party, or even add them as friends because of Uplay's god-awful social menu. There's also no list for recent players, so if you want to add somebody, either commit their name to memory or add them in the middle of a game. If I had to rate it, networking: 6/10, social: 3/10.\n\nSummary With a largely varying gaming experience based on players and characters they choose, plus intel, maps, objectives, and defensive layouts, this game never ceases to keep you on edge. I strongly recommend a good surround sound headset for this game. It will keep you immersed and better hearing the enemies. With smooth controls, quick-paced combat and antagonizing silences before an attack, this game truly delivers a wonderful gaming experience. The social/networking, though aggravating, are not game-breaking at all.\n\nContent availability: 9/10 Honestly, Ubisoft really has outdone themselves here. They've announced that there will be no paywalls for year one (at least), and there is no pay-to-win. You can buy R6 currency, but it's only used for weapon skins I do believe. I've always been saddened by games like this that use paywalls. All characters are bought with renown, along with weapons, skins, and upgrades such as silencers, scopes, and handles. The only thing I would like to mention is the season pass. It's a little misleading, and feel free to check the reviews on it for more info. Generally, though, the SP is simply aesthetic besides 1-week beta on new operators. I'd rate the SP as a $10-15 offer, but definitely not $30.","December 10, 2015","true","60.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Great ambient sounds\n+ Looks great\n+ Destructable walls, dynamic enviroments\n+ Detailed maps, much attention to detail\n+ Decent weapon and loadout customization\n\n- Gun sounds could be better\n- UI may be slightly intrusive for some\n- Needs more variety in maps, basically all amount to cqc. Though this is probably intentional\n- Shields slightly OP\n- No singeplayer\n- Low tick\n\nBe cautious, unless you've been really craving for a comptetitive fps experience. As a semi-competitive player, this game easily trumps any other big name fps out right now . It can be intensely competitive, something you just don't really get from the typical twitch reflex triple A fps's(e.g COD, BF, Halo).\n\nAbout 10 hours of gameplay and every match seems to have a nice variety of intense moments. From the typical; last man standing scenario, to seeing a mortally wounded ally in an adjacent room, contemplating the the risky dash to treat him. I've yet to see if the repetitive cqc combat will ever really feel TOO repetitive.\n\nSounds are overall great. The ambient sounds, in particular, are very immersive; from static radios to the ambient sounds of a crumbling building- It really really adds to the experience. Though after playing SQUAD(get it, try it), every gun sound I hear is just underwhelming, lol. This game is no exception. But it's by no means bad.\n\nGraphics are great. Lens flare and bloom adds a visceral feel to the combat, though serious players may want to turn those off to optimize vision. Maps are VERY detailed, e.g graffiti, garbage laying around, porno magz, weathering on the walls, etc. The depth of field when aiming down the sights is a nice touch. In general, everything looks, and most important FEELS(optimization)... good/great.\n\nOverall the game is worth every penny if you're a competitive player. Think hard about the purchase  if you're a casual, since you will probably get your butt handed to you and there is no singleplayer for your to delude your skill level.\n\nSince I personally don't care about a singleplayer campaign, my only real complaint is the low tick rate, and server issues. Maybe 2 out of 10 games I get some rubber banding and the occasional d/c. This must be fixed. It's not so bad that it's a deal breaker, though.\n\n8/10, An addicting and visceral fps experience. And if played properly- with a competent team and opponent, it is hands down the best competitive big name fps out right now.\n\nPS. I say 'big name' because there are lesser known fps's out there  that are just simply the true unadulterated fps experience, e.g ShootMania Storm, Quake Live, Project Reality/SQUAD. Play those if you really want to test your skill. Stay away if you're a filthy casual(kidding)- you'd be up against players with over a decade of competitive experience.","December 2, 2015","true","111.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ilgoth/recommended/359550/","Ilgoth","Ilgoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ilgoth/","93 products in account","Are you wondering should you buy or not? Tempted, but feeling unsure? Then you are like me, so this review is MADE FOR YOU. Before I help you out, one pro tip from grand papa Il.\n"Wheather it's SIEGE or ♥♥♥♥♥HOUSE, don't put your mouth close to a hole in a wall." - Ilgoth\n\nPlease note that at this point I have finished all 10 singleplayer missions and played somewhat 10 multiplayer matches, so I try to review with a feel of "how it feels after first moments".\n\nSingleplayer experience - tutorial like\nThe singleplayer missions are great way to get into the game and its core mechanics. In each mission, you learn one or two new basics and thus, it steadily builds up your understanding to the game. Some missions weren't that great or fun, but there were some jewels for sure. 10 missions isn't much of a content, but I strongly advise to complete these before you go and join the multiplayer action. It also brings you great amount of Renowns (6000 to be exact, if you manage to complete all the objectives in each mission).\n\nAll in all, I think this system is good. Really helpful and enjoyable.\n\nCurrency system - it is good\nRenown is kind of the currency of R6: Siege, which you use to buy new operators (these divide into attacking and defending). We have soldiers from different forces (SAS, FBI, Spetznaz, GIGN and GSG9), and all of them have 4 operators. So we have 20 operators + we just got 2 new operators in the Black Ice expansion (with a new map as well). You get renowns enough, I think it is well balanced.\n\nLets say I wanted to buy all SAS operators:\n1st costs me 500 renowns\n2nd costs me 1000 renowns\n3rd costs me 1500 renowns\n4th costs me 2000 renowns\n\nPlease note that if I buy one SAS operator, the first operator from another force will cost 500. The price grows gradually INSIDE THE FORCE. So if you complete all the singleplayer missions and achieve most of the objectives, you should have 4000-5000 renowns very easily. So based on that, you will get a very good start in the game and can easily buy 6-8 operators, depending of course which ones you will choose to buy.\n\nMultiplayer experience - absolute beast\nWe're set to multiplayer. Now I must say that matchmaking isn't the best. For me, I find a match pretty much in 45 seconds, but one out of four will get me an error and it starts all over again. Well enough, don't let that discourage you from buying this game!\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize that Siege has a different feel. It stands out from the rest of the shooters and in a good way. 5v5 action, every match feels different. I have to say that at first, I was 100% handicapping my team as I had no clue how the game plays out. It takes a bit of time to get used to being delusional lunatic, who thinks the enemy is everywhere. Most of the floors, walls and roofs can be destroyed and you never know how the defending team has set up the defenses. The gameplay is great, absolutely.\n\n(The round might build up slowly. But when the action starts, it is as hectic as it is in other shooters. It is a good action game, but with lot deeper strategy than Call Of Duty could ever achieve.)\n\n>>The team moves in.\n>>Two friendlies breach the garage, as two guys accompany the bomb defuser to the roof.\n>>25 seconds in and no sight of the enemy, even though we are in the house.\n>>Sudden hell breaks loose the moment I break the doorway with my sledgehammer\n\nThat is how it plays most of the time. You move in, manouver and pick your method to breach in and when you do, the firefight starts or not. It's haunting to go in and see nobody. You literally keep your sights up all the time, as you clear up room after room. You watch for booby traps, leg traps, barbed wire, reinforced walls. Anything that could give you the right location of the objective.\n\nAnd have I told you about the community?!?! It is a shooter game! You are supposed to be mean to me! These guys are helpful and keep their heads low, no shouting or random rant. I ♥♥♥♥ed up my role in our breach and when I said I just bought the game, these four random guys kept playing with me for the next two matches to help me learn the game! IT IS THE INTERNET. RANT, RAGE, RAVAGE. STOP BEING SO NICE!\n\nI honestly am glad I gave this game a chance. It's expensive and if you are like me (who lives by a low income), I understand if the full price puts you off. I wouldn't pay 60€, but the -20% discount tipped the plates. Haven't played much during 24hours of ownership, but I will continue to play this game that I think deserves the attention. Give it a go.\n\nUnder a discount, it's a must buy.\n- Optimisation seems good, I have no issues running medium level graphics steady 60fps (which is what my hardware should give me).\n- Season Pass isn't worth it. You gain enough Renown to get operators fast enough. Buy if you want to support devs.\n- I haven't tried Terrorist Hunt gamemode, which is against AI (I think)\n- I have diabetes and I am unable to benefit from it in this game\n- Buy it already","February 7","true","136.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","1"

When I played it in the Open Beta I was pretty disappointed and decided it wasn't worth it at full price but after playing this game for almost 6 hours straight I have decided to buy because I have been enjoying myself too much and I think £26.79 is a decent price tag.\n\nPros: Weapon customization.\nPlenty of weapons.\nDestructible environment makes every round different.\nGood sound desgin.\nGreat graphics. (Turn of Post Processing)\nMatchmaking system seems to work fine. I've heard complaints but I've had zero problems with it.\nFast paced, adrenaline filled action.\nMultiple Special Forces, its not just all Americans.\nVery challenging gameplay, pretty much a one hit kill.\nActually requires a little bit of communication with other players.\nEverything seems to be balanced, I don't feel like anything is OP.\nI haven't noticed any major bugs.\nWell optimised\nRounds are short and usually epic.\nEasy to learn, hard to master.\nI haven't noticed any hackers, yet.\nIf you look down you can see your legs - 10/10 IGN\nThe Community\nI've been online gaming for about 9 years now and I've come across very few communities that are actually nice, Now I've heard some people say that this game has a "great" community and do you know what? I have to agree. More or less every match I've gone into had nice players in it, I once killed the hostage and my teammates politely told me to "Watch out for the hostage in the future.". Overall the community is pretty nice to each other, the worst I've been called is an "idiot".\n\nCons: Uplay? How about Uf***off\nAim assist...Its not too bad but its still dumb, we're not console peasants we can aim for ourselfs.\nDid I mention Uplay?\nLack of gamemodes...You have 3 PVP modes and they all feel identical.\nMicrotransactions for gun skins and DLC characters...Kinda bullsh!t.\nSerious Lack of Maps\nThis game only has 11 maps, (1 Map is Terrorist Hunt only so its pretty much 10 maps in total) a majority of them look the same! This game needs more maps and a more interesting setting, the only maps I find interesting to look at are "Presidential Plane" and "Yacht" (Real creative map names guys...)\n\nPaid DLC map packs are a terrible idea and will definitely stretch the community thin.\n\nTerrorist Hunt (PvE)\nTerrorist Hunt is an absolute joke. The AI is brain dead and will do nothing but bum rush you, sometimes they even kill themselfs with there own grenades. There is a small indie game called "Verdun" which is based in the First World War, they just added a PvE mode and even they managed to make better AI.\n\nDying Community?\nAfter looking at the Steam Charts (http://steamcharts.com/app/359550) I've noticed this game has been dropping players. Right now its at its peak because of the Free Weekend but before that it was at an average of 2000, I personally think this is because of a major lack of interesting maps and different gamemodes. Basically the game lacks variety and I know for a fact that this will go stale, even for me.\n\nOverallOverall Rainbow Six Siege is a good tactical FPS, its not amazing but its good! I think time will only tell with this game because the community does seem to be shrinking. I think Ubisoft can save this game from death but only if they try to improve it and not bleed the community dry of money.","April 15","true","26.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In R6S you must use tactics and skill together to outsmart and outplay the enemy team. R6S is a game where you will need a group of 5 friends in order to be successful. Be warned R6S is not a game you want to play like other shooters, no Call of Duty Rambo Killing. I suggest to be successful you sit down and learn each others playstyles in order to be most effective, but I digress. R6S opens a new pathway for shooters with the almost entirely destructable maps, and by making team planning a priority. R6S also has a Terrorist Hunt mode for those who dislike multi-player games. Terrorist Hunt is basically R6S with AI you can choose the difficulty and you can play alone or with others. Overall despite it lacking a campaign which I loved the R6 series for this game is truly amazing and is highly recommended for those who enjoy tactical and FPS games.","May 28","true","161.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wombsalad/recommended/359550/","wombsalad","Andy :D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wombsalad/","335 products in account","When i bought this game it was the first time I had paid full price for a game that - at full price -  was nearing on £50. I was wholeheartedly against this kind of pricing for videogames unless it's really worth it, this game was really worth it. It was worth every ♥♥♥♥ing penny.\n\nIf you were looking over your friends shoulder and he/she was playing this game, it would not appear to be anything but a normal FPS shooter deathmatch in the same vein of CSGO (without the cancerous community) But once you sit down, and start trying to progress in this game you realise how deep the mechanics go, again it's not a massively complicated game, you aim you shoot. Easy right? ♥♥♥♥ no. In this game you will die by recruits, you'll die by people who are barely trying, you'll die via people who are infinitely better at it than you, you will die by your own hand, you will die by your teammates hands, you will fall off the roof, you will accidently jump out of the top floor window. Believe me when i say this game has it all.\n\nThe actual combat itself is not too different from similair games just... Refined. You can lean, prone and crouch. You can switch fire modes on (I think) all the weapons. There are a bunch of different operators you can choose from, all with unique abilities and when i say unique they are actually unique, there is no cloaker sneaking class, none of that overdone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. We're talking riot shields, explosive charges that can break reinforced walls, cluster charges that launch a barrage of grenades into the adjacent room, a sledghammer, heartbeat sensor. You ♥♥♥♥in' name it.\n\nAs for content, it's sorta lacking but the content there is solid and has a ridiculous amount of replay value, I still find myself experiencing rad new things and turns of events (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJPhGePoB74&ab_channel=andy - If you're confused by this, i stood on a trap that incapacitated me, inside the objective room, you capture when there are no enemies there. Nobody came to finish me so we won the round because I laid there and continued to capture) I constantly meet awesome people who communicate well, are not total tactical invalids (like me!) and treat you with respect. It's always fun when your teammates are enjoying the ride too, as apposed to games like CS where 85% of the time you're listening to some ♥♥♥ vent about his daily life.\n\nYes I reccomend this game, are YOU CRAZY?! ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MOIND! if you like shooters, I say buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, because besides the fact it's ubisoft and their servers, netcode and matchmaking sucks, this is quite easily the best fps deathmatch shooter i have ever played, without question.\n\n(Oh! and the graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful, I don't meet the minimum specs so i don't run em at ultra or high, but even on low they look beautiful.)","March 11","true","368.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Playing with a full squad is always recommended. If you must SoloQ there is a 50/50 you're going to get a decent team or headache team. As long as ubi keep updating, balancing and hold this game tight it should last. Only worries are PC player bases, I've gotten $60 worth out of it, but honestly if I wants to compete with CSGO etc it needs to be cheaper.\n\nSeason pass is done well it gives access to new operaters a week early and doesn't require you to buy them. So if you want to play the ops early grab season pass, if you don't want to grab it there isn't a worry. Simply wait a week and unlock with R6 Credits or renown (Credits = paid currency, renown = ingame currency)\n\nThe R6 credit system is...strange? $8AUD for ~600 which is one decent skin and left over Credits.

Half of the time when I don't get the operator I want, I don't even care, that's how well/balanced out they all are, and just how exciting each one is to play.\n\nThe maps are excellently designed and well thought out, this game is definitely is aimed towards people who like strategic gameplay. However, I won't ramble on about all the pros of the game, which the game does have many of! With very little cons.. but the one MAIN con this game has, is its community.\n\nOh lord, it's amazing how a person even like me gets so turned off by what goes on in this game. My last game was the last straw.. I got teamkilled, insulted by everyone and then kicked... for saying... wait for it... "I don't like the European Union.", after being asked if I did or not after claiming to be from the UK like another player.\n\nWhen you die, oh yes. Oh yes oh yes oh yes, you can expect someone to run their mouth about how you got "rekt bro" and then throw a fit when you laugh at them. Which usually leads to a massive argument involving everyone. Then of course since the game has a "Search and destroy" feel to it, being the last man alive can sure put the pressure on, especially when you have some British or Arab (same thing), yelling down the mic insulting you.\n\nI honestly wish this was just me throwing a fit.. but honestly, over 50% of my time played has just been so unenjoyable due to the woeful community in this game. That's not saying it's all bad, it's just split between those who don't care (5%), those who are extremely nice (5%), and those who are just.. disgusting human beans (90%).\n\nGame = 9/10.\nCommunity = -9/10.","April 21","false","39.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

They both get old pretty quick as you'll eventually lose that "challenge" that human players offer.\n\nThe anti-cheat they have is mediocre to the point where people have handed out all forms of hacks for free simply because this game has ♥♥♥♥ poor anticheat. It's an Ubisoft game, so it will not be fixed, most likely.\nThe community isn't always horrible, but it really goes towards that. Elitists ahoy, but that comes with the territory of competitive games. Except, since Ranked is filled with hackers, the elitists and hypercompetent players and clans flock to Casual instead. The way matchmaking works, you as an early level can be matched with level 100s and all sorts of ranks from Bronze to Silver to Platinum Diamond, I don't know the ranks, I just know I hate them.You can run into hackers there as well.\n\nYou can get some good teammates and try to be a good teammate yourself socially. This is short lived and is prone to be replaced with "kek lmao fam you got ♥♥♥♥♥" and "vote for trump lol arnt i so ironic" whether on your team or the enemies. Community is, for the most part, terrible as any and all good players are the quiet ones, while the horrible players are the most loud and obnoxious and unlikeable sorts you'll meet.\nEdit: I don't want to make it sound like the community is completely and totally unlikeable. I've found plenty of friendly teammates who try to joke around and have fun, but they typically dissolve after a few rounds/few losses. Then your potential teammates are up in the air again and you're likely to find the horrid ones yet again.\n\nI think this game has a lot in common with MOBAs.\n5v5\nRequires impeccable teamwork to not screw over\nRequires meta knowledge (cameras, roaming as in where to roam how to roam effectively, what weapons and attachments are best and there are "bests", which operators are worthless, etc.)\nHorrible community that'd just the same flay you alive as work together with you\n\nIt also comes with horrible hit detection half the time and 20ms added to your ping because of how it is designed. Wouldn't recommend it if it were the last can of soup in an apocalypse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJk1EV9VKU\n\nEdit: Thought I'd make it clear if you're comparing this to other reviews, notably the older ones at December 2015. Those are from Beta-ish times. The community may have been different then, but right now it's like walking into a pool of tar and toxic waste because the sign in front of it had flowers and butterflies on it.\nAlso, if you take those short "I died 10/10" reviews seriously, please buy this game. You do not deserve your money.\n\nFurther Edit: Go to the forums and you may see people saying "Community is only bad because of free weekend." This is false. Things were like this before the free weekend (4/15-4/18, 2016). Do not be deceived.","April 15","false","45.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Although its quite different from the original RB6, in many ways its better. I think many of us who played the original back in the day, have forgotten how outdated the game is now (watch a video on youtube). Large parts of the core gameplay has been retained, while things like ai (frankly the ai in the 90's version is really stupid), inclusion of rappelling, destruction of quite a few surfaces etc. help bring the gameplay to the year 2015. I like how the gameplay is a bit slower than most fps'es out there, and even in a mp deathmatch setting you will experience a whole lot of tactics compared to many games. The rounds will usually not last very long though, which also is a good thing in my book.  I hope, and believe, that the devs will implement a healthy dosage of new content as time passes, as there is still room for more maps, characters, weapons and settings.\n\nGranted, the people who complain the game does no longer have a proper single player mode, does have a point. One of the good things about the original was the "Tom Clancy" storylike approach to a campaign, where managing and keeping your soldiers were an integral part of the game. However, lone wolf still is in here, which is the most important one imho. Be wary though. The "realistic" mode WILL kill you, at least as much as the Dark Souls games ever did.\n\nAll in all I think its worth the investment, and I can heartily recommend the game if you like tactical shooters. 8 out of 10 so far, but I think more content will easily bring it up to a 9.","December 9, 2015","true","16.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I suggest you buy it if you even vaguely enjoy thought-provoking tactics in a shooter.\n\nThe pros  -THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMMUNITY! The teammates (in my experience) have almost universally been willing to listen to sound reason, and have even changed tactics based on my, or somebody elses whim! It is absolutely crazy! When I say "stop moving, I need to listen for movement", or "somebody cover that roof breach", or "you breach left, I'll flank", THEY REALLY LISTEN! Even when I've tk'ed a teammate, if I have even a half-reasonable excuse, they would tend to forgive me! I think this is due in part to the solid lack of 12 year old kids playing this game, but whatever it is, it is EXTREMELY helpful.\n-The actual gameplay. The gameplay is extremely fast and intense. My heart has been pounding in my chest while I wait for an enemy to appear from one of 6 breached locations, and when you're attacking alone, the feeling is the same. The gunplay feels extremely well thought out, the guns feel heavy and powerful, while not feeling cumbersome, and the physics for the grenades are great. The gameplay objectives are admittedly not diverse, but the match-to-match experience is what makes this game. Two matches on the same map, attacking/defending the same place can feel wholly different, simply because of the tools you and your enemy have at hand for completing the objective.\n-The graphics. The graphics are extremely appealing, and the game runs at a buttery 120+ FPS consistently, I have heard of issues with AMD hardware, but this does not affect me.\n\nThe cons  -The netcode issues. These were somewhat prevalent in that in about 10% of my matches, I was always half a second behind everyone else, meaning I would peek around a corner, then un-peek and be killed out of the blue, because my ghost was still peeking. In less than 1% of my games I get rubber-banding so severe that the game becomes unplayable, but the fix to that for me is simply quitting, I've never had to abandon a great team because of it, so I see it as essentially a non-issue.\n-The bugs. There are very few actual bugs, most of the negative review centralize around these "prevalent, unstoppable, unavoidable bugs", when the reality is that they are so minor and inoffensive, that you'll probably miss them entirely. There are minor clipping issues, the fix to that being NOT magnetizing to walls, and I have literally, in over 150 games, NEVER fallen through the map as a drone. I've heard of a bug about not seeing your legs in front of you when they are, but ALT fixes that, so, again, it is a non-issue.\n\n\nOverall, this is a well put together game, but at it's price 79.99$ CAD, you better be ready to play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, or you just wasted 80 bucks.

There are a lot of mechanics to traverse around the environment, as well as destroy that environment. Impressive physics aside, the wide variety of guns feel satisfying to shoot, and there are a lot of gadgets/ gizmos to use to your advantage; whether that be attacking the defending team, or defending the objective in the main game mode.\n\nWith great graphics, comes great immersion, as the sound design is what amkes this game immersive. listening to the tiniest sounds could help save your team, or act as crucial support for identifying the whereabouts of the enemy. Strategic planning, good senses and quick reflexes are necessary for this game, so goodbye casual gamers, you probably won't last long.\n\nOnly problem is, I have such little play time because I ahve no friends to play with (for the weekend it is free for) and it is less fun because of that.

However with the connection issues, short rounds and lack in content, I find myself usually on the fence with judging this game as either a ton of fun or a giant pain in the d*ck.  Fans who enjoy tactical shooters like Insurgency or Squad will probably find it difficult to appreciate this title beyond a few hundred hours of gameplay where most players better acquainted with the arcade-style shooters like Call of Duty or Battlefield will most likely be responsible for keeping this game alive in the long-term.","January 15","true","370.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You can link your Uplay account on the R6 site and use the white boards to create new methods and tactics with your squad/friends;\nAnd even thought this game offers a lot and is a revitalizing new path for Rainbow Six and MP games it ofc has some downfalls, such as:\n- The short single player career, i know not the focus of the game, still could have at least a SP level for each operator no need to even change maps just new approaches and SP ways to train environments and tactics;\n\n- Sometimes i feel like this game still on development, right now we suffering with huge hit detection issues. The Ubi servers are also always kicking someone out of the match so if you have a party of five embrace for long lobby minutes and restarting searches because someone fell out;\n\n- The season pass as for now is just a title the 5% boost is exactly what it seems...5% no big deal there. The gold in store gave to us is just 600 in game currency, the equivalent to having a nickel in fancy store. The plus challenges are not two per day...and so goes on. Now waiting for the chance to have access to early operators before the ones without season pass but still will have to use game renown to unblock those;\n\n- THE OPEN MIC BUG!\n\n- The community still small and is understandable that not everyone is friendly but if you really want the game feel of team play you have to bring your own friends or have luck to find some in between random teammates;TL;DR: This game still has a lot to offer and i hope they deliver it, aside the bugs and the 'under construction' feel the game is genuinely one of the best experiences i ever had on the multiplayer/co-op genre.\n\nIf i have to bet on it's future i'll sure do.\n\n08/10 as good as the enemy cluster charge on the hostage;","December 13, 2015","true","209.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

(Mostly away until July)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oublaz/","137 products in account","I played the beta and my gaming experience was pretty lame. (crappy server, bugs, balance...)\nThanks to a free week-end I got the opportunity to make my mind again, and:\nThis game is good.\n\nThe gameplay is unique, require a good piece of teamwork, as you will hardly win a game alone and the level cap can be pretty competitive. That's a good point.\nThere's a lot of maps, each one giving lot of opportunity and different method to achieve your goal. Good point too.\nI could play the same map over and over as each time it will be different, because the opponent will adapt, and you will as well, to survive and win. In *Rainbow 6 Siege you feel the pressure of the siege, and it's always very cool to breach like a real badass task force.\n\nDamn, then why am I not endorsing this then?\nIt lacks of content. With 60€ I think you can get yourself far more fun by looking at the steam store.\nThe "solo" part is cleanable in 1 hour. The coop is boring. Except one (not that) hard mission (article 5) but you get only one of this kind. This could have been an addition (maybe like the special operation mode of CoD but with more possibilities?).\nOutside of this, you can have access to most operators very fast, and it's easy to end with nothing to buy, except those damn last updates operators which are damn expensive if you didn't bought the damn season pass.\n\nBy looking to the low populated community, it seems the game is dying, and I'm really sad, because it had so much potential, which will end wasted. Probably because it was released too fast, probably because they needed money. I don't really know but it's a shame. This game don't deserve to be left away.\n\n\nSo conclusion?\nI'm afraid it's not worth it to get into this game. But if you really like the gameplay, or if you look for a special operators simulator, this one is good and you won't find anything like that anywhere else.

Riot Shield Soldiers,Montague and Blitz, are not as over powered as i thought as you need to aim your pistol if you wanna kill but you wont have as much protection as before, giving the enemies a chance. A lot of people do point out how there is absolutely no customization and that is half true and have false. Most guns can have different Camos and attachments but shields don't. And your character has no customization. So its pretty bland. Gameplay is good but I wished there was no video memory limit.\n\nEither than that there is many errors but most and be fixed or at least worked around on. Most errors consists of joing friends with squads and one error doesnt allow you to go past the squad creation part on startup. Im forced to use a VPN for the squad part and sometimes I cant even play with a friend of mine since my NAT Type is strict and I havent found a way to change that as I attemped. Also the fact that my mic would go on out of nowhere was annoying and sometimes they dont even hear you. One thing I've notice is that everyone hate Uplay and I dont know why. In all honesty, I think its pretty good and it takes a minute to make an account and easy to friend your friends. Hit detection is also a problem as in I shot a body through a concrete pillar and killed a guy. Which made no sense.\n\nThere isnt many mic spammers or hackers as I played. Most people actaully listen to you when you say put a reinforced wall or put a shield there. In my opion the community isnt bad at all and I think most people who play this game are actaully kind.\n\nIf I had to rate this game, the highest I will go is a  7.5/10 With all the glitches and errors thats the only reason why I would rate is this high and I hope the devolepers fix these glitches and problems but anyways  Good job Ubisoft!","December 4, 2015","true","90.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I'm even playing it with the same best friend.\nMaybe it's the lack of a co-op story mode (There's a single story mission unlockable actually) and customization that I really wanted. I want to see revised versions of Calypso Casino (Every game mode is now Attack and Defend btw) and some of my favourite T-hunt maps. I also miss my M8, but I'm holding out hope that a DLC character will have it later.\n\nAs far as the game itself...It has amazing controller support that switches back to keyboard and mouse on the fly. Runs not that well for how it looks graphically (Typically Ubisoft I guess) and the environment destruction is really well done. I miss night vision and thermals, they weren't great in the old games but this was certainly a chance to make them better. The addition of leaning is appreciated. I don't like that you can't play a bunch of the same character, beyond it possibly breaking immersion I don't think it would really affect the gameplay much. (Even then just force it to be unique characters for ranked only? You have to hit level 25 to get there anyway.) I don't understand the leveling system. I'm level 33 and what does that even mean? You get challenges at certain levels, unlock ranked mode, but why is it going any higher? Seems pointless, unfinished, or a leftover from early design stages. The reknown system in this is well paced, and is BLAZINGLY FAST with boosters. I have 24 hours into this and have more than half the roster of characters with all their unlocks before getting someone new. The microtransaction system is reserved for weapons skins and boosters. It's not really intrusive and feels like it's tacked on just to please someone in corperate or fund the map packs (but the season pass should do that already). You won't notice it compared to other games systems. They give you one booster for free to tease your pallate, but you probably won't even need a second one.\nMicrotransactions are BAD for $60 titles don't get me wrong, but if you have to do them at all I guess this works.\n\nHowever, overall I feel like too much of the design changes are following MOBA mentalities, like Siege couldn't hold it's own without copying someones ideas for a major league gaming scene elsewhere. Too many sacrifices are made for this mindset, but it still remains enjoyable and very much a tactical game that requires thought and planning. Most of my issues are missing features...The game feels unfinished and lacking.\n\nCompare it to Rainbow 6 Vegas 1 and (Even with all the bugs in that game) this just isn't very full. I want more of this game, but it isn't here. If there's some sort of Siege add-on story mode that comes out for $30 I will buy it without a second thought. And instead of the "Recruit" option when you don't select a character you should get the option to make a character with whatever loadout you want...At the sacrifice that they have no special ability. That would be a nice addition. (Again disable this in ranked only?)\n\nI really want the nostalgia to kick in full force and for me to fall in love with this all over again, but really really wanting those custom characters and some really large maps with respawns. This feels too compact.\n\nBut honestly it's still a good game and worth a buy. I'm enjoying it now and I'm sure I'll be enjoying it later.","December 9, 2015","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These games have always kept me coming back after months and months of playing, the tactics are great, the gameplay is smooth and challenging, and the community is often solid.\n\nThis all goes the same for this wonderful game. Truly very addicting in its gameplay with some new takes on the old, classic Rainbow games. Tight, close quarters combat, tense, very tactical, high octane in its own special way. Rewarding when you win and kick ♥♥♥, crushing when you lose and get the crap kicked out of you, but you have determination to do it again and again, bettering yourself, its so captivating. This game does a great job with being easy on new players, and still challenging and fun for the more experienced ones.\n\nTechnically class based combat, its an offense and defense objective based game, though PvP tends to just be class based TDM around 1-2 rooms, and is a test to see who the better attackers and defenders are, but damn if it still isnt a blast to play all the time. This is the first game with PvP that I have been able to enjoy in YEARS. Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3, a bit of 4, Halo 3 and Reach for a time were the last to have me staying long term and just always enjoying myself, through good and bad. As strictly PvE as I am, the PvP in this game is just amazing. Games are usually always really close ones and players on both sides tend to be respectful all around (though that doesn't mean you won't see the bad apples every once in awhile, but it is rare in my experience).\nthe PvE itself is also a damn nice, fresh take on the old Terrorist Hunt gamemode. This time around, T-Hunt has several different game modes thrown in on top of the classic mode itself, including one defense mode where you protect your hostage in one room for 3-5 waves, giving you use for Defense Operators outside of the PvP, a wonderful idea. Some, myself included, find T-Hunt to be the far more tactical gamemode in the game.\nAnother plus is the graphics, which are incredible in this game, and the destruction seems and feels to be on par with Red Faction: Guerrilla. Yes, it is that good and that fun to blow ♥♥♥♥ up in this game, the trailers and all did it justice.\n\nThe downsides are very few at the time of writing. All I got are the servers can be very shoddy at times, typically resulting in very slow matchmaking where the game is searching for teams (this is especially bad on Ranked Multiplayer) and you or your teammates can suddenly be dropped from the game between loading a new session or new round in the current session. Extremely aggravating. and the ever-present microtransactions that plague gaming as we know it. Fortunately, all they are for now are very few weapon skins and XP/Renown boosts, which the game already gives a pretty decent enough of anyway, especially since everything currently unlockable with Renown is pretty damn cheap (save for a select weapon skins, not so bad at all). The last downside, there is no offline gamemode, even if you want to solo in Terrorist Hunt, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.\n\nAll in all, I have great hopes for the future updates to this game, including FREE MAPS FOR EVERYONE, and 8 new Operators which will have to be bought, sadly. Hopefully the prices on them wont be outrageous.\nI HIGHLY recommend this title to anyone curious about it, especially if you love team-based, tactical shooters with great players and very addicting gameplay, it is worth every penny of the $60. I give this one a 9/10. BUY IT! :D","December 11, 2015","true","254.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not sure why many of the features were removed and I'm not sure why the graphics was downgraded. I honestly expected a very realistic game where you had to be careful of you're surroundings or you're pretty much f**ked. But it is realistic compared to a lot of shooters out there today and it is a very good attempt by ubisoft and it was very well done.\n\nI love it, and hate it. Love/Hate relationship. This is probably due to the fact that so many glitches happen that are often game breaking or just utterly irritable. Take my word for it, this game has some game breaking glitches that are super annoying although many of them has been patched now there are still some.\n\nPros:\n-Fun\n- Pretty realistic compared to other shooters out there\n- Love the in-game currency (renown) which you earn at the end of matches that can assist you in buying new accessories for weapons or unlocking new operators\n-Addictive\n-Operators are refined and well done. Many of them are fun to play with and have great tools and special characteristics that make them an important asset\n-One of the most intense games i have played in a while.\n\nCons:\n-Uplay still has some issues with steam (this might only be me, but i don't know)\n- Graphics got downgraded from E3 trailer\n- Some bugs in game are still annoying\n- e3 gameplay and retail version has large differences. very vast.\n-Lack of a single player campaign even though the game is around 60 USD\n\nOverall Rating: 7.9/10\n","April 18","true","153.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It still has the classic "Eliminate X amount of enemies" but it also has three other modes thrown in the mix. Hostage extraction, Bomb Defusal and Hostage Protection. There are still the same three difficulties, Normal, Hard and Realistic. With hard and realistic giving more renown (The in-game currency to unlock operators/attachments. More on that later.)\n\nMultiplayer (PvP) 5v5 attack/defend scenarios. There are I believe three different modes, Hostage, Secure Area and Bomb Defusal. At the start of the game, you pick your operators. The defending team has time to barricade/reinforce the area around them while the attacking team sends in drones to identify the objective / enemies. The drones can be destroyed by the defenders and do get a few points for doing so. The same can be said about attackers identifying the objective and marking enemies. The marks aren't permanent however and fade after about 10 seconds. The rounds are slow to start but pick up really fast, making for intense firefights and standoffs.\n\nSituations Situations are singleplayer portions of the game designed to ease you into certain modes, help you get familiar with various mechanics as well as operators. You can score up to three stars, each star earning you extra renown. Think more rewarding tutorials.\n\nCurrency / Buying Equipment and Operators The currency you're going to earn is known as Renown. You get a decent amount of it if you win a game, I personally didn't find it to be too grindy. You can buy R6 Credits with real money with can be used to unlock skins/the two "new" JTF2 Operators, Buck and Frost. They are 25,000 renown normally. You can also buy renown boosters with real money, giving you a 50% boost to renown for the duration (it ticks down even if you're offline) and teammates a 10% boost. You buy everything except for the new operators, boosters and certain skins for renown. I think the operator pricing system is fine. The prices increase as you buy more Operators (each with their own ability and weapons) from a certain Counter Terrorist Unit. For example, Your first SAS Operator will be 500 renown. Your second will be 1,000. If you decide to buy your first GIGN Operator, they will only cost 500. It goes by 500 each time you buy an operator for that specific CTU. The attachments are pretty cheap. You can afford an attachment in a game or two. Not bad at all.\n\nClosing Overall, I recommend this game. I haven't had this much fun with a FPS in quite a while. PvE and PvP for everyone. Playing this with friends definitely enhances the experience.","April 18","true","73.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

There's an extremely surprising amount of depth in the interactions between the operators and all of the game's different systems (audio and controls are A++ IMO).\n\nThe biggest contributor to this depth is the destructible materials located throughout large portions of most maps. Almost every operator's special ability involves operating with these destructible object - whether it floors, walls, boarded up doorways (defenders can board up doorway in their spare time to slow the advance of the attackers), etc. Some of the depth is subtle like learning to properly use audio - both to locate the enemy (with the help of cameras/drones), and to play mind games with the enemy (by making lots of noise to the distract them - a good example of this is running far from the objective right at round start (when the attackers get 1 minute to use drones only to try and find the objective) and shoot a bunch, punch out windows, and board up doors to draw the enemy drones to you so you can kill them and prevent them from finding the objective (causing them to waste time when the round proper begins). It certainly has its flaws, but UBI has been doing fantastic in addressing them IMO.\n\nThe most recent update is great and fixes lots of big things, and adds lots of great new and unexpected features.","May 13","true","509.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have played GTA V - Online Heists, I find this as a counterpart of the heists. In GTA V, you were the terrorist, here you are the cop. The game is quite intense due to reality-like recoil and low health bar with no radars (unlike Counter strike series or GTA V). My friend and I joked around to beat the first mission in the terrorist attack at the hardest level. Results? we have failed miserably and passed an hour without completing a single mission. However we definitely had fun :D. We met some random people online who helped to guide us in the end, but we still have failed X(.

The C4 can also prime itself instantly meaning it doesn't have to even touch the ground before they can detonate it making it impossible to react....

I'm on defense. My teammates don't talk to each other and OH GREAT...one of them just backed out of the game. Now it's an unbalanced match. I begin barricading the walls and laying down traps. One of my teammates feels like a dbag and shoots me in the back. I call for help. No one comes. We lose and another teammate leaves the match.\n\nNext round and still no one talks to each other. We scout the area with our drones and fail to find the enemy site. The match begins. I breach a window. The moment the window is breached I spot an enemy that is prone in the corner. I unload my clip into his chest and much to my surprise he is still alive and not moving. At that moment, I know it's over. Two seconds later I get shot by a dude two rooms over that spams his gun through the walls and somehow gets a headshot. We lose again. In chat the enemy team calls us trash. I begin to cry.\n\nNext round on defense again. I Lay traps and wait for the enemies to come. No action for a long time. I begin to move around a little hoping to see something. A few moments later I get one tapped from an enemy shooting through a coin size hole in the wall. I pound my fist in the desk. Suicide seems like a reasonable option. I continue to play for another two hours until my head begins to throb from pound it against the keyboard on my desk.\n\n10 out of 10 would recommend. This game somehow is still fun to me.

After the ridiculous and unadressed problems I have encountered, I felt obligated to warn any potential buyers. I have 8 GB of RAM, a GTX 760, an Intel Core i5-4670, 3 full HD monitors, Windows 10 Home, and I have been gaming on with these specs for about 3-4 years. These specs aren't the best, but I can run every game at ease at at least 60fps on high settings. My internet has a download speed of about 105 MB/s and an upload speed of 12 MB/s. (Skip to 3rd paragraph to see how this is relevant)\n\nSo it all started when I my knife from CS:GO and i received about $130. I went on a buying spree and ended up buying Rainbow Six Siege. A few of my friends had it and they recommened it to me. I was craving for a tactical and modern shooter that supported competitive play. Rainbow Six Siege was the answer. I buy and launch the game and play with one of my friends. I pick up a control after finding the mouse to be outrageously too sensitive and begin to pretend to listen to my friend who is trying to tell me how to play as i begin shooting in random directions. This is when the problems arose.\n\nI began to repeatedly get an error after I tried to rejoin again and again that stated "error:0-0x00000204" It said that my ethernet connection was plugged in wrong or unplugged. I have had the exact same set up for 3-4 years. I have never received this problem. I reset my router and made sure my WiFi was working by loading Google.com and youtube.com. I tried to join another game and within a minute, I received the error again. I tried this for 15 minutes and I was shutdown by the error every single time. I left the game in my library unplayed until the next patch came out a few days later releasing the new operators. I played the game again and had 0 problems whatsoever and even spent 7 hours until 5 in the morning playing Rainbow Six Siege. At this point I was in love with the game and was going to ignore every other game I was currently playing in order to play more Rainbow Six Siege. I was busy with school, unfortunately. I came back one day, about a week or two later, to play the game. It had another patch to be downloaded. I downloaded the patch and began playing.  Before I could finish a single round i received the same error code I have received at least 20 times before. I tried to play again with little success and I began to be able to play 2 rounds instead of half of 1. On top of the errors, every time I played, frames were skipping. This made the game completely  unplayable . The latest patch, at this point, was supposed to smooth gameplay on top of fix glitches. In the patch notes it directly states "Fix of various disconnect issues". The new patch completely broke my game. I had skipping frames on a decent gaming computer and internet problems on fast internet.\n\nOverall, beware of buying this extremely unreliable game. You may either buy the game and have upwards of 1000 hours on it, or you could be cursed with bugs and problems that may never get attention by lazy Ubisoft.","February 27","false","19.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

After the ridiculous and unadressed problems I have encountered, I felt obligated to warn any potential buyers. I have 8 GB of RAM, a GTX 760, an Intel Core i5-4670, 3 full HD monitors, Windows 10 Home, and I have been gaming on with these specs for about 3-4 years. These specs aren't the best, but I can run every game at ease at at least 60fps on high settings. My internet has a download speed of about 105 MB/s and an upload speed of 12 MB/s. (Skip to 3rd paragraph to see how this is relevant)\n\nSo it all started when I my knife from CS:GO and i received about $130. I went on a buying spree and ended up buying Rainbow Six Siege. A few of my friends had it and they recommened it to me. I was craving for a tactical and modern shooter that supported competitive play. Rainbow Six Siege was the answer. I buy and launch the game and play with one of my friends. I pick up a control after finding the mouse to be outrageously too sensitive and begin to pretend to listen to my friend who is trying to tell me how to play as i begin shooting in random directions. This is when the problems arose.\n\nI began to repeatedly get an error after I tried to rejoin again and again that stated "error:0-0x00000204" It said that my ethernet connection was plugged in wrong or unplugged. I have had the exact same set up for 3-4 years. I have never received this problem. I reset my router and made sure my WiFi was working by loading Google.com and youtube.com. I tried to join another game and within a minute, I received the error again. I tried this for 15 minutes and I was shutdown by the error every single time. I left the game in my library unplayed until the next patch came out a few days later releasing the new operators. I played the game again and had 0 problems whatsoever and even spent 7 hours until 5 in the morning playing Rainbow Six Siege. At this point I was in love with the game and was going to ignore every other game I was currently playing in order to play more Rainbow Six Siege. I was busy with school, unfortunately. I came back one day, about a week or two later, to play the game. It had another patch to be downloaded. I downloaded the patch and began playing.

Don't be! Launching from Steam still works perfectly well, you will not need to log in to a separate launcher.\n\nUbisoft's servers are actually fairly stable (the majority of the time). Matchmaking can be almost instantaneous or it can take a few minutes. Fortunately, the matches themselves don't even last half an hour, and sticking around from one match to another can be quick as you have more people in your squad. Matchmaking errors can happen from time to time, but there is very little hassle to throw yourself and your squad right back in.\n\nThe community is like most: The loud, obnoxious sorts will be obvious, though there are many that enjoy the communications and tactical aspect over your rush-and-teabag sorts.\n\nThe game *is* balanced, you just have to learn how to deal with specific Operators, learn your weapons, positions, and devices, and most importantly, listen! The game has many audio and visual clues for intruders or campers. Hackers have a very small presence, but the new implementation of a report system is actually a testament to the evolution of the programmers' decisions that improve the game.","March 22","true","327.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have persoanlly spent up to 25 minuets waiting to find a match, and ever since the Launch of The Devision this has only become worse.\n\nThe game itself would be a 9/10 in my book, but just cant reccomend it for the server issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn responce to; Your Average Joe\nGranted my origonal review was a little over the top but I feel my point still stands, my servers, (Australia) just has so many server issues. As for your second point, while yes, the game isnt fully multiplayer, the game stands on its multipayer aspect, there would be vastly more people who play for the team play then just solo Thunt, so Ubisoft needs to focous on this isues. As for oyur point about my personal issues, no only have I had to face extereme load times my NAT type is also STRCIT, it has been since I got the game, this makes me unable to join squads with friends and I also can't host and create custom games.

The dynamic nature of the maps where you're able to open new avenues of attack to gain a tactical advantage means you'll always be kept on your toes. Intelligence is key but so is co-operating with teammates since unlike other FPSs where you can be a jack-of-all-trades, in Siege each of the operators are meant to serve a certain purpose, and if you squander that special ability, it's game over for your squad. It's a very addictive game and definitely my favourite multiplayer game for the past couple of months.\n\nhttp://www.choicestgames.com/2016/05/rainbow-six-siege-review.html","May 24","true","61.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are many positive and negative aspects of the game which will be addressed appropriately. The positives, oks and negatives will be discussed below.\n\nPOSITIVE\n-ENGAGING MAPS AND ENVIRONMENTS: Tom Clancy games have always had tactical and immersive maps ranging from office buildings to yachts. Siege is not an exception; the maps have all been designed to be destroyed and to have planned insertions of areas and buildings. Maps such as banks, embassy’s, club houses and ports all enhance the gaming experience.\n\n-GUN FIGHTS AND FACTIONS: There are a lot of weapons in siege and each character(s) have different weapons and skills designated to their class. Factions such as the SAS or GIGN have two different classes within their faction designed for defending and attacking. The gunplay is interesting and has a wide range of snipers, automatic rifles and shotguns to choose from. The variation of classes and weapons deters each match from being like each other.\n\nMEDIOCRES\n-MATCH DESIGN, GAMEMODES AND TACTIC PLANNING: Siege has done ok with this aspect. However in matchmaking there is very little time or chance to play or communicate with other team members. This is partially the communities fault as there is a chance to explore the map and make defenses before each round however the community never responds to any commands or any tactical output. Terror hunt is intriguing however the AI responsiveness and lack of imagination is relevant.\n\nNEGATIVES\n-ROUND TIME, PACE AND CONTINUABILITY: Between each round of siege teams are required to observe the map and make defenses. This is necessary in a tactical planning game however this can take away from the aspect that this is actually a video game. Switching from a fast paced firefight to a boring drone sequence in seconds is painful. I really believe that this aspect will deter players from finding the game ‘fun’ in the long term (once the hype has calmed).\n\nEND NOTES\nTo summarise the game is defiantely playable if you enjoy tactical battles and have a solid team lined up to play with. If you think going solo is more your thing i wouldn't suggest thing game however if you are still eager to play there is VOIP and text chat if you get lucky and get a team that communicates. In my situation I have actually found it enjoyable and worthy of my money spent. The graphics and weapon mechanics are enough for me to suggest this game to my friends and colleagues.","March 17","true","73.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like this game\n\nPeople are moaning about net coding and match making errors and such but that problem is being dealt with the patches they have indroduced are rebalancing and working on these issues and I am confident that they will keep updating and sorting them.\n\nAlso people talking about hacking and "oh he shot me through a wall". There are some cheaters on this game hense why I will not play ranked until I belive fair fight is actualy doing its job. In 2 games i saw 3 people banned for cheating. Other than that it is good team communication and drones that spot you, just beacuse you dont see "you have been spotted" duznt mean a drone cant see you.\n\nThere is a couple of issues i would like changed.\n\n1. map and mission on the operator selecation page if i had a penny for everytime somesone said "what map and mode is it" I would be able to buy the rights to this game and ♥♥♥♥ing sort it myself.\n2.C4 bleeping should be removed when its been placed not thrown & Kapkan traps actually invisible to make IQ any worthwhile because she is useless.\n3. Pickable spawns for attackers on casual as drone spotting is common and a good player can spawn kill you easily if you dont spot them first.\n4. I would love to see attacked taking over cameras and deffenders being able to place 3 additional cameras in locations around the map. I think it would make for great team play and more tactical use from both sides\n5. Fix the glitches which im sure will be sorted, few legs peeking through walls, unvaultable shields ect.\n\nHonest buy this game best game i think they have released in a long time with the improvemtns coming im sure it will do well.

The dynamic nature of the maps where you're able to open new avenues of attack to gain a tactical advantage means you'll always be kept on your toes. Intelligence is key but so is co-operating with teammates since unlike other FPSs where you can be a jack-of-all-trades, in Siege each of the operators are meant to serve a certain purpose, and if you squander that special ability, it's game over for your squad. It's a very addictive game and definitely my favourite multiplayer game for the past couple of months.\n\nhttp://www.choicestgames.com/2016/05/rainbow-six-siege-review.html","May 24","true","61.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are many positive and negative aspects of the game which will be addressed appropriately. The positives, oks and negatives will be discussed below.\n\nPOSITIVE\n-ENGAGING MAPS AND ENVIRONMENTS: Tom Clancy games have always had tactical and immersive maps ranging from office buildings to yachts. Siege is not an exception; the maps have all been designed to be destroyed and to have planned insertions of areas and buildings. Maps such as banks, embassy’s, club houses and ports all enhance the gaming experience.\n\n-GUN FIGHTS AND FACTIONS: There are a lot of weapons in siege and each character(s) have different weapons and skills designated to their class. Factions such as the SAS or GIGN have two different classes within their faction designed for defending and attacking. The gunplay is interesting and has a wide range of snipers, automatic rifles and shotguns to choose from. The variation of classes and weapons deters each match from being like each other.\n\nMEDIOCRES\n-MATCH DESIGN, GAMEMODES AND TACTIC PLANNING: Siege has done ok with this aspect. However in matchmaking there is very little time or chance to play or communicate with other team members. This is partially the communities fault as there is a chance to explore the map and make defenses before each round however the community never responds to any commands or any tactical output. Terror hunt is intriguing however the AI responsiveness and lack of imagination is relevant.\n\nNEGATIVES\n-ROUND TIME, PACE AND CONTINUABILITY: Between each round of siege teams are required to observe the map and make defenses. This is necessary in a tactical planning game however this can take away from the aspect that this is actually a video game. Switching from a fast paced firefight to a boring drone sequence in seconds is painful. I really believe that this aspect will deter players from finding the game ‘fun’ in the long term (once the hype has calmed).\n\nEND NOTES\nTo summarise the game is defiantely playable if you enjoy tactical battles and have a solid team lined up to play with. If you think going solo is more your thing i wouldn't suggest thing game however if you are still eager to play there is VOIP and text chat if you get lucky and get a team that communicates. In my situation I have actually found it enjoyable and worthy of my money spent. The graphics and weapon mechanics are enough for me to suggest this game to my friends and colleagues.","March 17","true","73.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Absolutely, but is it for everyone? Absolutely not, let's start with a simple pros and cons list.\n\nPros:\nThe gameplay is really fun.\nThe variety in characters allows you to try out different playstyles.\nNo character is more overpowered than the other, every character is meant to cater to different playstyles.\nEach character has a choice between at least two weapons, usually an assault rifle and a shotgun.\nThe weapon customization is limited enough that you should never be at a disadvantage against any enemies because of their weapon.\nThe destruction is very well done, and is very fun, it requires focus to shoot people through walls or windows.\nThe two teams either attack or defend, and neither one is dull.\nThe combat is really good, usually both teams have an advantage over the other.\nA lot of other stuff that wouldn't fit in there.\n\nCons:\nThe gameplay can be a bit repitive for some people.\nTeam killers are not that common, but they can completely ruin a game.\nLack of teamwork, everyone usually goes their own ways, but when there is teamwork, it's really well done.\nMatchmaking can be a bit unfair, I've been in a team full of level 10s against a team full of level 60s.\nThe ubisoft servers can be slow at times, I've never experienced lag spikes, but I have experienced rubber-banding and long loading times.\nI can't really think of that many bad things about the game, so I'll leave it off here.\n\nSo, if you're still not sure whether this game is for you or not, I'm going to analyze the game a bit deeper.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nThere are two teams in the game, blue and orange, the blue team always starts off attacking, and the orange team always starts off defending, they then alternate between the two in a repeating manner, attack/defense/attack/defense.\nThe team that attacks has access to tiny 2-wheeled drones that can go in tight spots and under doorways to try and spot the enemies, the team that defends has access to cameras placed all around the map, usually 2-3 outside and everything else on the inside, they can be controlled by dead people, so that dying doesn't bore you.\nYou can see your teammates through walls with white outlines, and their nametags, that's how you know if someone is on your team or not.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nLet's start off with the basics, there are two teams as explained above, each have 5 players, the defense team must defend an area that either contains two bombs, a hostage, or a container, each of these objectives count as a gamemode. From the point of view of the attack team, the two bombs must be stopped by using a defuser, the hostage must be saved, and the container is like area control, stand in the room, and control the area.\n\nDefense Team:\n\nThe defense team can secure the area using an unlimited amount of door/window barricades, and each player has two individual wall reinforcers that can only be broken by the character thermite, each character has its own individual ability that only they can use, for the defense they are mostly support abilities, or traps, for the attack team, it is usually something that allows you to breach through walls more easily, or a different way of attacking.\n\nAttack Team:\n\nNow, those are the basics of the defense, the attack team is different though.\nWhen you attack you start off with 45 seconds using the two-wheeled drones to try and find your objective and identify your enemies to see what character they have, once you have either located the objective, or failed to locate it, you enter the map and try to finish your objective, either save the hostage, defuse the bombs, or secure an area, if all members from either team die, the team left standing wins by default.\n\nThe Combat:\n\nThe combat in the game is pretty straightforward, you point and shoot, though if you stand out in the open you'll be easily killed, so covers are often used, if you're not careful though, a wall you use as a cover might end up being your death once someone shoots through it, so while covers are important, you need to make sure that the cover is safe and reinforced, unlike another Ubisoft game, you don't go in cover by pressing a button, you have complete freedom of where you stand, no locking on.\nThe different weapon types change the combat up a bit, you can be a close range fighter with the shotgun, or a medium to long range fighter with the assault rifles, I prefer the assault rifles, but I've been murdered by shotguns many times, while shotguns are quicker kills, they require close proximity to an enemy for it to be at its most efficient, and while assault rifles are a bit slower, they allow longer range and can allow you to shoot through tiny spots more easily.\nWhile weapon choice is important, how efficient it is is also decided by what kind of person you are, do you like shotguns better, or assault rifles? But even if you choose weapons that you prefer, it still requires a bit of skill to be able to anticipate the movements of people, you have to listen and look carefully to give yourself an approximation of your enemie's location.\n\nNow I would write more about the game, but I don't really know what to write about next, so I guess that's all I really have to say about Rainbow Six: Siege, if anyone has any idea what I could add to this review I'll try and add it.\n\n","April 17","true","108.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are reading this a few years after the launch of this game, stay away.\n\nRainbow Six Siege is unlike any of the previous R6 games in the way that it is extremely multiplayer focused.  The bare selection of single player options are just multiplayer with bots scenarios that are underwhelming and very short.  Therefore, this game is entirely dependant on its multiplayer.\n\nFortunately the multiplayer is quite good.  And I dont mean that based on "well I had fun with it", I mean that in a more objectively balanced view.  The game has alot of depth to it and lots of different strategies flesh out the fun of this game.  Nothing in the multiplayer is overly dominant (though some of the accuracy and range of certain guns could be nerfed) and many of the characters and their special abilities counter each other out, so  picking certain operators can actually be very important on certain maps. Operator picks  and general coordination are important factors in games, which is great.\n\nIf you have friends who play this game or are interested in playing, I would recommend this game.  The multiplayer is really fun and balanced, and rewards cooperation.  If you are an offline only type of guy or would be going into multiplayer as a lone wolf though, I would say stay away.  The unfortunate lack of single player kills alot of the value for this game.","April 17","true","59.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lots of checking corners, breaching doors, listening for footsteps, etc. It's super satisfying when you breach a window and take out a defender as you're repelling down with 3 of your teammates and then the 4 of your proceed to split into teams of 2 to sweep & clear rooms.\n\n10/10","April 16","true","139.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I set it, then saw "PRESS" written on it, and I assumed you'd start it up by pressing and it would go off after a while. So, I pressed the same button, got a kill, and blew myself up. I heard a "man, you're too good" over the mic, which I assume was a bit of sarcasm, but I was proud as hell of that kill.\n\nMore seriously: the game is methodical, but not slow.

I'm not that into first person shooters, so I'm a mediocre player at best, but the way one can approach each level in this game is staggering to say the least.\n\nOptimization has been handled pretty well: game runs fine on my onboard Intel HD5500 even!\n\nGame is a LOT of fun if you have your own squad of friends to play with - communication is key, as is farting about.\n\nIt's not without it's faults though: there are plenty of times where I got kills thanks to their bodies clipping through the walls, the various physics glitches, and worst of all the squads function being broken on our end. They claim to have it fixed by mid-may so we'll see how that goes.\n\nSpeaking of, support for this game is pretty good: they plan on adding new operators and maps for this year (have no clue about the next year).\n\ntl;dr - would recommend!","April 21","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really depends on what kind of FPS you like. R6S is a very tactical game with its unique gameplay. It may seem hard at the start with all of the things you need to do and look out for on both teams, but once you get the hang of it, fun times for days.\n\nHowever, do beware of several bugs, glitches and expliots that have arised in the game.

So if you're about that life, you'll enjoy thoroughly wearing your keyboard down talking trash since that's the key pivoting point around this game.\n\nThe guns and such are just too strong for the size and shape of the players. Every kill is a headshot because it's the only way to deliver more than 20 damage, but it's about 100 more, always a kill.  And that's with all the guns!  In CS:GO, if you get shot in the head you'll be cripplingly wounded, and getting a shot out to someone's domepiece is a respectable deal, the heads are pretty little.  The heads in Siege though vary in size, almost the size of a nice plump watermelon.  Combine the awful netcode you'll see referenced in the next 10 reviews with the lack of variety in the weapons with the hitbox balancing they chose and it's not a fun shooting game.\n\nPeople said that Rainbow Six: 3 was the "thinking man's shooter" because you had to plan your attack and actually think to play.  Siege didn't end up being a thinking game.  It's ultimately boiled down to a memorization game, where you need to memorize the maps before you can start winning.  You have to pick out the right wall to hit the right spot in the floor to hope to god that you trick someone into not looking at you and then you shoot them four times, the last hit of course being a headshot.  You just repeat that whole procedure through and through until someone finally catches you and you find another hole.\n\nAnother thing I'm unhappy about is the premise.  Look at the art at the top, where it shows the logo behind a counter-terrorist team busting through a wall.  The enemies are most definitely terrorists right?  They've got that whole black ski mask thing going on with the hoodies and the pouches on the vest! They're most definitely terrorists!  Then how come the game is actually police killing police?  The defending team is Rainbow Six, and the attacking team is also Rainbow Six!  I, for one, was looking forward to being a crooked terrorist.\n\nThe most awful part of this game is the fact that it's ended up as a class based game divided between nations.  Rainbow Six is of course international, so there's enough nations here in the game to not offend anyone important.  The dumbest thing though, is that the game is split into classes.  Every country gets two guys per half, those being the classes.  The classes are then forced to use their "country specific weapons", like the Russians using an AK rifle and the Americans having to use the UMP-45.  For historical reasons and whatnot.  If Rainbow Six was so international, I would've totally liked to see the whole roster of weapons available to the whole roster of these soldiers named after your username.  Instead of picking a main like this is a MOBA game, you'd pick your clothes and guns.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were a big budget company like Ubisoft and I just managed to own Siege for some ungodly reason:\nReplace the class select screen with Rainbow Six: 3's customization page.  Make characters logically able to survive a weak headshot.  Make light-medium-heavy armor selections based on the player's choice, not the country.  Add another few dozen weapons, if they all use the same damage model then what's the difference from weapon to weapon?  Scratch that last one, change the damage model.  Add a single dozen weapons.  Make equipment and abilities based on a tokens system, where you get so many tokens to deal with and craft your class from.  Make all the defender and attacker abilities and equipments go into one big pool, and give that big pool to every single player.  Change the defending team to be terrorists, they were terrorists in the early stages of the game.  Add a whole lot of ammo and weapon customization that draws from the token bin.  Patch up the netcode or bully the coders until they do.  Press out map randomization to some degree, press out another ten or eleven maps.  All that time they spent balancing operators could have gone towards making thirty unique maps and forty unique weapons for sure.  Get rid of those ungodly splash screens and "PRESS ANY BUTTON" screens by default instead of by deleting a folder.  Change the menu fonts and add more pictures to the menu.  Make the soundtrack not blow.  Recreate the thing where you hold to interact to open the list of things of commands for the team, like Rainbow Six: 3.

I think a lot of people are negative and overcritical about the game. There are some large issues but they have simple solutions. The game is highly competitive and fun to play. I have put over 600 hours into it and still find it fun to play. The only issue is cheating. Hackers are extremely common due to the fact that FairFight anticheat is plain horrible. This issue created a very toxic community. There is no trust in a ranked match that someone is not cheating because of the (non-existent) anticheat. I am a good player (platinum 3) and also get very lucky time to time. I’ve had to change my name multiple times due to people 'counter-hacking' because they have heard that I cheat. I believe that Ubisoft is aware that the issue NEEDS to be fixed or the game will die soon. I would recommend this game but it plainly cannot be enjoyed fully as it is. The game itself is wonderful, minus cheating. I would 100% recommend it once a competent anticheat is implemented. Until then, the casual game mode is still worth $50 as nothing happens if you lose.","May 30","true","693.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is amazing, but challenging enough to the point where you want to play to get better. The Operators are well balanced, as well as the weapons. The tower defence aspect in the game makes it even better. It is similar to CS:GO, but very different at the same time. Personally, I enjoy this more than CS:GO. Now for the few downsides. Teams will make or break the game, and sometimes they aren't put into your favor. The community, however, is friendly and helpful. I have yet to see a negative person or an insult. The Ubisoft servers need a bit of a touch-up, but it is  still fine to play with.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend you play this under its current state. Here's a list of all the things the game does succeeds in and fails.\n\nPro's:\n\n1. Unique gameplay, Rainbow Six takes the concept of attack and defend games and pushes it to a whole new level, there are many ways to attack and objective and defend it. Combined with all of the unique operators and varied maps, I almost never found myself getting bored.\n\n2. Very well balanced, every operator has they're strengths and weaknesses. Most of the time the game feels fair and the only time someone has the advantage is when they're in a superior position. Unfortunately there are a few exceptions to this such as the secondary SMG with an acog scope. This gives defenders essentially a pocket sniper and is very abused in this game.\n\nCon's:\n\n1. Awful servers, Sometimes it takes several minutes to find enough players for a game, and at very inoportune times I've found myself or teamates disconnecting from the game due to poor server connection.\n\n2. Terrible hit detection/Netcode, more often than not I've found myself being killed by a guy who wasn't or when I've moved to cover. This happens way more than it should in a competetive shooter and Ubisoft hasn't done much to address it. The hit detection is very bad too, I've seen way to many kill cams where the guy has shot me and hit reticle wasn't anywhere near my body, this is unbelievably frustrating to be killed by poor game mechanics and not the skill of the other players.\n\n3. Damage model, in this game a headshot is a one hit kill, this causes a lot of problems in firefights where one person is hitting their marks but get shot by another who is just wildly spraying and manages to land a lucky headshot, this means that SMG's can out shoot assault rifles in this game if the SMG wielder somehow manages to land a headshot on an attacker at distances that shouldn't be acceptable.\n\nI really hope Ubisoft will patch these current issues and make this game great, I still love it even though it's not at the level it could be at.","May 8","false","246.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a pull no punches approach to a genre that has left its roots in realism for something to science fiction as of late. The matches are tight and intense and at any moment can shift from winning to losing if you are careful. The maps are fully interactive with security cameras to get the drop on your opponents to breachable walls to create your own path.

You can no longer run and gun lone wolf as you will get killed eather by traps, or by enemy. Neather you can camp, since enemy will blow a hole right behind you, and killing you. You have to do 2 things:\n\n1. Adapt to different situations and tactics. Except enemy from where you'd expect them the least\n2. Coordinate with your team. You are dead alone\n3. Stick to cover. Depending on your armor (light 2 shots, medium 4 shots, or heavy 6 shots) you can get killed even if you prone (what in this game you do more often than ever). Not to mention, higher armor = slower speed. Choose carefully.\n\nThere are 20 operators, and they are all well matched. You can't choose the "right" one. They all have their unique abilities you have to find advantage off, or counter them. If your enem is a thermite, you should know he will destroy your reinforced walls.\n\nGame is greatly optimised with great graphics. I run medium graphics with 40FPS and the game looks great (never tried high ones).\n\nBUT, price is still too high. Not to mention DLC (that doesn't give you anything) for a price of 30€.

Honestly playing this game with a party of friends is a highlight. You typically will dominate and everything is preformed with a better outcome.\n\nBest Parts of this Game\nCombat. Its the best I've seen, its heart pounding around every corner, and every round fired just gives off a suspenseful feel. Watching your bullets shatter drywall and hit your target just gives off satisfication, the simplest things give the best feelings for this title.\nDiversity. Its not  Amazing per say, but everyone has a very different play style that gives each match, round, and game its own flavour. Well thought out combinations will pave the way to victory, and the chemistry of certain operators can really bring out a team\nOptimization. The game is gorgeous, and I'm below its standards. I have a 660GTX ASUS Laptop and my game look beautiful. I can't believe how smooth it runs.

First off, I'd like to acknowledge that I have played well over 500 hours of this game. I started playing this game a week after it came out. I was insanely addicted and enjoyed the unique/great qualities that I thought made it stand out among the current FPS genre. However, I am not here to tell you not to buy the game or vice versa. I would just like to point out how I feel this far into the game. Obviously I wouldn't have invested 500 hours into the game if I didn't enjoy it, right? So I am wanting to just make you consider what you might be investing your time and money into.\n\nSo let me begin by saying the price is insane for what you get. I would argue it is at most worth $20-$30 dollars USD. Especially considering the game is primarely set in multiplayer (there really isn't a singleplayer campaign).\n\nI'd like to mention that I expected bugs in this game when I bought it, I knew that there where known issues because I waited a bit to see the gameplay and reactions to the official release of the game. I always knew that they where going to address these issues and hopefully fix them. However, this game has been out for about 5 months now and I can't see much differences from what I first saw when I started. Infact I would say the netcode has been beaten down to a dull and unreliable state as they updated it to the current 2.2 patch. I would just need to mention the state of headshots and people who have already played would understand that they don't register as they should. Just go to YouTube and you will find dozens of videos showing off this netcode and it's trash progression to the current state it is in. I could write a page full of bugs and other issues-though they actually already do have a list on their reddit (lol)-but I will make it short and sweet. Some of these problems are as follows: wonderful Uplay problems that also sprinkle in it's own fun, the servers are unreliable, and the hackers can ruin your fun (not as often anymore but it still happens occasionally).\n\nBut I mean despite all of these issues I have enjoyed this game a lot. It just seems recently I have met my patience and tolerance for these issues. In my opinion, this game game is split dead even in what I can and cannot enjoy abou this game. So if you are ready to deal with these issues and make the best of it, enjoy. Otherwise, seek a more reliable FPS than this, you won't be pleased if you buy this.\n\nI wanted to show my support for this unique game when I purchased it. What are the chances we will ever see another game like this in the near future? I was willing at the time to deal with these issues and attempt to enjoy this game. I suggest you look into this game and consider these things before you buy.\n\nI know I didn't really give any feedback on what is good about the game, but I was assuming that you had already done some research and watched some gameplay. Most people avoid cracking down on ALL of the CURRENT issues facing the game when they make an "impressions" video. Generally when they cover the "overall impressions" they do so when they first start playing. Since this game has been updated things have severely changed and it is hard to tell what has actually been fixed.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading and good luck making your choice!","March 5","true","623.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuckTheDuck/recommended/359550/","SuckTheDuck","☢☠TheCodingDuck☠☢","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuckTheDuck/","76 products in account","Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege:\n\nLet me give you a quick scenario; two Tom Clancy games come out within a year of each other, the second one is always garbage, as is evidenced by the pair of Tom Clancy games that have come out onto the market. This article is dedicated to looking on the bright side, and admiring Rainbow Six Siege.\n\n\nThe game is based on teamwork and good tactics, neither of which are even remotely possible in the setting of a casual match of the game, let alone a ranked one, when it actually counts.\nThis is why squads dominate, and that's a good thing. To stay true to the core of the game they need to allow those who have trained, those with cooperation, and understanding of the game to stay in the lead.  Joining a clan is the most satisfying thing you can do in this game, because you will see an immediate improvement in your performance.\n\nRainbow Six Siege has a very simple way of keeping the game fresh; every few months they add two new operators. As new operators pop up our defenses against the old ones are thrown out the window, and the game's community takes a month to come out of its shellshock. This month provides extra challenge to the game, and extremely engaging combat opportunities.\nA few months after the release Kapkan's trap became nearly useless because everyone had learned to avoid it. When Frost was brought in we got another trap to master, and it was exciting! Nowadays the Frost trap is nearly as bad as an EDD, but her guns keep her useful. This constant evolution keeps the community from losing interest in a game that deserves as much as it can get.\n\nMy favourite thing to do is flank. I love to roam around on defense and rely on callouts to locate the enemies. I then swoop in from behind and decimate them with the m1014, AKA, the Flank-Mo-Bomb. It seems like people haven’t grown eyes in the backs of their heads yet, even months after the game’s release. It s also apparent  that the more I focus on my maneuvers, and the less I focus on my firefights, the more I succeed.\n\nConservation of resources plays an important role in this game: Shields don't have many bullets, Thermite doesn't have many brimstones, Kapkan and Frost don't have many traps, and Smoke doesn't have many grenades. This adds to the importance of tactics; if we won’t have many, we will make them count.  Our weapons are precious, so we value them more than anything else. This creates tension throughout a match while you attempt to utilize your arsenal as well as you can.\n\nThe game took the standard Tom Clancy mechanics, and added destruction. Nearly everything is the same as the second last installment, RSV2, except for the destructible terrain. This game revolves around the false assumption that walls are bulletproof; not a single place is safe from the other team’s bullets, and this manufactures constant excitement.\n\nBreach charges open new lines of fire, and reinforcements prevent them. The preparation phase is mostly spent on insuring the objective room is sealed off from the other side, and it’s always a lost cause. Even reinforcements can become doors with a little help from our friend Thermite, but at the end of the day destruction is the last thing we’re worrying about because-\nGrenades are killer! They are feared by the defensive team on Secure Area, and feared by the offensive on hostage. It’s easy to fumble them, but once you get a feel for cooking one like a five star meal you know nothing can go wrong.\n\nThe guns are amazing. The recoil is done perfectly, and the sound is bang-on! (I had that pun in my sights) kicked up when you fire a round, and you have to reload twice to chamber a round when you empty your gun. They give extreme attention to detail. The game is about tactics, not firefights, but that doesn’t mean the firefights can’t be Just as good too!\n\nThe game spares no expense: every month or so a new game-changing update is released, they buff and nerf when it’s required,  they released 4k textures a month after release, and they even bother to release new operators and maps! If there was any game that deserved your attention, it would be Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege; throw your money at it!","January 14","true","621.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gameplay wise, it's amazing with little bugs (that I've seen). The main problem with this game isn't the game itself, it's the servers over at Ubisoft.

You can no longer run and gun lone wolf as you will get killed eather by traps, or by enemy. Neather you can camp, since enemy will blow a hole right behind you, and killing you. You have to do 2 things:\n\n1. Adapt to different situations and tactics. Except enemy from where you'd expect them the least\n2. Coordinate with your team. You are dead alone\n3. Stick to cover. Depending on your armor (light 2 shots, medium 4 shots, or heavy 6 shots) you can get killed even if you prone (what in this game you do more often than ever). Not to mention, higher armor = slower speed. Choose carefully.\n\nThere are 20 operators, and they are all well matched. You can't choose the "right" one. They all have their unique abilities you have to find advantage off, or counter them. If your enem is a thermite, you should know he will destroy your reinforced walls.\n\nGame is greatly optimised with great graphics. I run medium graphics with 40FPS and the game looks great (never tried high ones).\n\nBUT, price is still too high. Not to mention DLC (that doesn't give you anything) for a price of 30€. I bought the game on sale for 20€ off, so I recommend you do the same.","January 13","true","58.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game can be a load of fun with 4 other friends that you're able to commincate with and actually know what they're doing! Unfortunately, running solo encounters a few problems. A lot of people tend not to use their mic so you never know whats going on. Anyways like I said this game is a lot of fun, especially in those intense moments when it's only you, 1v4 and you get chills. This game definitely nailed it with the atmosphere of actually being in a dangerous situation, not knowing where the enemy is. Will they breach through the ceiling? Will they breach through the floor? The windows? You just never know what will happen because there are so many possibilities. Every great game comes with a few downsides. This game of course has a few. Some include the netcode, when you had sworn that the enemy never saw you and that you shot first. Also the shields are not as effective as they should be. Sometimes you believe you're fully covered in the front, but for some odd reason you get shot and killed(except for your head). But I have faith in Ubisoft, they say that they'll have updates monthly, which also adds to the faith. Overall I must say this is a decent game. There are plenty of class options and guns and the season pass holders only get access to the new 8 characters one week in advance. This game offers many things that were not seen in many titles before(indestructibility) and many other things. Overall I give this game a 9/10.","December 12, 2015","true","68.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Its fun, its tactical and its hard. However it's also a spawn of ubisoft which makes it a bit of a flawed gem.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent Gameplay: its hard, your character is not a bullet sponge. Cooperating with your team mates is the key to success. In addition, each operator has unique interesting skills/abilities which adds variety to the game.\n\nNice Graphics: not only this game looks good but it also runs good,\n\nDestructible environments: battlefield does them as well but it adds no strategy element to the game other than nice effects. On the contrary, in Rainbox Six Siege, the destruction of the environment plays a major role in tactics and strategy.\n\nInteresting Levels: well designed and realistic looking, with a lot of variety between them (plus night and day variations of the same maps).\n\nCons:\n\nUplay integration, i hate it. I don't need another steam clone, one is enough.\n\nUBISOFT SERVERS, literally the biggest issue with this game are the servers. They are literally rubbish, many issues with them.\n\nBad matchmaking system\n\nVerdict:\n\nIts fun, its interesting and its hard. However, its PLAGUED by the bad servers and constant network errors. I am optimistic that these are issues that can and will be resolved, however i can not obviously testify for that.

It's extremely satisfying winning a match or making a significant contribution to your team. There not much variety in the amount of maps and game modes, however each match offers unique gameplay experiences that can keep the game fresh after hours of playthrough. There are many different operators, or classes, that you can choose to purchase yourself with the in-game money. Each class is very unique, and by changing classes the whole way you play can completely change.\n\nThis game also has a great community. The most fundamental part of this game is teamwork, and a strong majority of the players are very cooperative with each other. You can also create a squad with your friends to ensure that you will be on the same team every match. I have never experienced such a feeling of reliance and cooperation in any other game before.\n\nOverall, though there is not as much maps or game modes as hoped for, Rainbow Six Siege's unique experience has kept me coming back. If you are someone who enjoys teamwork and loves to cooperate with your team, and who is ready for a bit more intense matches, I recommend this to you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudoo/recommended/359550/","pseudoo","soodoh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudoo/","22 products in account","TL;DR Rainbow Six Seige is a great game that is definitely worth its sale price, but at its full price there are other options that may be better.\nThis game, at $60 CAD (on sale), is priced similarly to many other "AAA" titles out there. So what does this game offer that other FPS games like Black Ops 3 and CS:GO don't have?\n\nPros:\n\nThe "Seige" aspect of the game. It's different than every other game out there, one of the only FPS games where positioning and tactics are much more important than raw aim.\nThe community is one of the nicest multiplayer communities i've had the pleasure of being a part of. I haven't met a bad apple in a game once so far, and here's to hoping it stays that way.\nThe time it takes to find a match is extremely fast. My personal record is six seconds, for a game not in progress. I've found a game in progress in two, however.\nHow hard it is. This game is extremely hard for a player who has not experienced an FPS before. Even for players like me (Supreme in CS:GO, 4 years FPS experience), learning the basics of this game took 7-10 games. It's got a learning curve to it, but its one that can be overcame quickly, and that makes it much more fun.\nNeutrals:\n\nThe maps are decent at best. This may just be personal opinion, but I feel the maps could be improved, but in their current state they are not too much of a hassle.\nUnlock system could be tweaked. It's fun, and it's easy to unlock new operators, but there's just something about it that makes it feel too similar, yet not good enough to a Call Of Duty unlock system.\nCons:\nLack of versatile movement. Coming from CS:GO, this was the most apparent to me, right away, even in my first game. There is no hint of skill based movement in this game, and that's because your jumping is limited to only surfaces you can climb/vault on. Even adding the ability to jump with a cooldown for 5+ seconds would bump this up to a neutral in my book.\nUbisoft Servers. This may not be a problem with the core game itself, but I feel like I have to include it in. The servers may get better as the year progresses, but on the first month of its release, Rainbow Six servers were constantly going down and not awarding "Renown" (the XP for this game) after a match. Therefore, you could not level up or unlock any characters. This was the kicker, as this game is multiplayer only. It breaks the game, so until I know that the servers are going to be up 99.9% of the time, this is staying in my review.\n\n\n\n","December 30, 2015","true","388.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm not much for competition usually, preferring PVE in almost every case, but Siege brings a nuanced gameplay of cat and mouse, bouncing back between attack and defend that keeps me coming back. Yes, I started Terrorist Hunt, almost exclusively upon release. However, once my friends and I squadded up and went multi for the first time, we haven't looked back. This is a team based game that builds solid synergy between friends and forms you into a squad where everyone knows their roles and what to expect from one another. My coworkers/friends and I have come back for hours upon hours of team based gameplay. The destructable environments really set the game apart, making the possibility to experience a different round every time, constantly requiring you to adapt and overcome. Intel is the name of the game, and knowing where your enemy is is a gamechanger.\n\nSiege is my GO TO shooter. There are bugs sometimes, there are exploits occasionally, but credit where it's due to ubisoft patching what the community asks for 9 times out of 10.\n\nSiege is a solid 9.5/10 for me, and offers fun in a way that no other squad on squad shooter, to date, has.","March 8","true","302.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let me tell you what i am talking about.\n• New content and patches frequently\n• Replayability\n• A ton of operators (or "Classes")\n• Dynamic world\n• Gunplay\n• Movement\nand so on and so forth.\n\nThe game is not CoD, Battlefield or Counter-Strike, even though it may look like it to some.\nThere's different operators, having different tools and weapons and jobs.\n\nI cannot go through them all one by one, because that would literally take an hour, so i will just give you the standard things, like weapons and stuff.\n\nThere's some operators that can use shields, there's the Recruit, Blitz, Montagne, Fuze and Blackbeard.\nMontagne has an extendable shield, covering his front body from damage.\nRecruit and Fuze has a standard shield, must crouch for feet protection.\nBlitz has a standard shield that can flash people, must crouch for feet protection.\nBlackbeard has a rifle shield, way smaller than all other shields and only cover your head. It slows you down by alot.\nALL THESE OPERATORS ARE ATTACK ONLY.\n\nNow, to counter a shield you might want a shotgun, an SMG can be viable too if the person with the shield is in close quarters, just have to get around him.\nTo counter blackbeard, use a shotgun. 3 shots in the head should kill him (while his shield is up)\n\nNow, let's talk about movement and breaching.\nYou can lean by pressing Q and E by default, giving you another angle to look at.\nYou can rappel buildings from the outside, go upside down as well to minimise exposure, if you want to be badass however, go in front of a window that's barricaded, place a breaching charge and jump. Mid air, detonate it and you will get in before a second has passed. This is not a viable tactic alone, however with teammates doing it at the same time with you from different windows can lead to some amazing kills.\n\nDefenders can barricade doorways and windows, but 3 melee hits from an attacker will break it.\nThe operator "Castle" however, can place down a few bullet-proof barricades. Rather take those out with a grenade, or ash's grenade launcher, or with a breaching charge.\n\nThe gunplay is very interesting,\none shot in the head from ANY gun will insta-kill you no matter armor and any hp from 1-100.\n\nAfter all i would rate this game 9/10.\nIt lost a point because of "Clans" or "Teams" or whatever you kids call it these days.\nAlso lost a point because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s "Accidentally" shoot you. (teammates).\n","May 13","true","37.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolferx/recommended/359550/","wolferx","MaverickBXV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolferx/","78 products in account","Reinbow Six Seige is a decent game overall i would give it a 5/10. I love the aspect of killing terrorist making me feel like the navy seals assassinating that Osma Bin laden guy. It is a real gud expericene of painting weapons of destruction when you buy camos with dog tags that you unlock for killing the bad guys. Actually i'll give it a 8/10. I like it more than i thought. I remember one time i was killed by getting shot through the wall, i was really mad. But i got over it win we won the match and i got 500 dog tags. Oh by the way with the dog tags you can get characters that you kill terrorist or policemen with. They call them operators, but i call them people. My favorite is Rook. When the round starts all you have to do is press middle mouse  button and drop some armor packs. They're great. Heh. That reminds me of frosted flakes, they are amazing with some sugar and milk.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome of the main features we have in this game is situations, multiplayer and um terrorist hunter. My favorite is multiplayer, but let me tell you about situations. This gamemode is a single player option. The government pays you like 1000 dog tags to take out 20+ highly trained teenaged muslims, by yourself to save ONE person that doesnt even run away when the terrorist are no where near you. I'd say that is a awesome deal! Let's go on to the multiplayer. This is where your counter strike skills come into play. You become the good guys or the bad guys. I hate being the bad guys cuz it reminds me of ISIS. I hate ISIS. But multiplayer is fun when you have a full team with microphones and they know how to vault into windows. The last gamemode is terrorist hunt. This is when you are paid 1000 dog tags to killed highly trained teenage muslim terrorist holding ONE person as hostage, but with human people! I'd say i'll rather take my chances alone.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe overall game is a 8.5/10 I like it because i like counter strike and good graphics. If you think my review was helpful then i feel sorry for you.

It was meant to change the way we played games and to show us that we don't have to have bigger battlefields to have the most fun. It was supposed to be skill based and very competitive. They even decided to team up with ESL to try and create a competitive eSports atmosphere. Sadly though, Ubisoft's final product falls short of their aim. It is true, the gameplay is fantastic and diverse, it is extremely realistic and fun to play most days, but, it is in no way a competitive game.\n\nThe idea of competition is to create a setting that puts each player on an equal playing field, so that a person's skill is what makes the difference between winning and losing. Since this is an online game it can be difficult to create a truly  "perfect" setting given things outside of developers control like ping and the location of its players in the world, but when it comes to connecting all its players together, it seems like Ubisoft either just doesn't care, or did not put any real effort into it. R6 siege’s networking is quite simply, a joke. It is not an equal playing field by far. Half the time in this game I will die before even seeing the enemy, but the killcam showing my demise shows that I was staring at them for seconds. It is absolutely enraging. It doesn't help either that since this is a realistic game, it only takes one bullet to end you. Games like battlefield or Call of Duty can get away with networking problems because it takes more to end someone, but sadly for ubisoft they do not have this pleasure. As of now, Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical, realistic and completely uncompetitive game.","February 27","false","40.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolferx/recommended/359550/","wolferx","MaverickBXV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolferx/","78 products in account","Reinbow Six Seige is a decent game overall i would give it a 5/10. I love the aspect of killing terrorist making me feel like the navy seals assassinating that Osma Bin laden guy. It is a real gud expericene of painting weapons of destruction when you buy camos with dog tags that you unlock for killing the bad guys. Actually i'll give it a 8/10. I like it more than i thought. I remember one time i was killed by getting shot through the wall, i was really mad. But i got over it win we won the match and i got 500 dog tags. Oh by the way with the dog tags you can get characters that you kill terrorist or policemen with. They call them operators, but i call them people. My favorite is Rook. When the round starts all you have to do is press middle mouse  button and drop some armor packs. They're great. Heh. That reminds me of frosted flakes, they are amazing with some sugar and milk.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome of the main features we have in this game is situations, multiplayer and um terrorist hunter. My favorite is multiplayer, but let me tell you about situations. This gamemode is a single player option. The government pays you like 1000 dog tags to take out 20+ highly trained teenaged muslims, by yourself to save ONE person that doesnt even run away when the terrorist are no where near you. I'd say that is a awesome deal! Let's go on to the multiplayer. This is where your counter strike skills come into play. You become the good guys or the bad guys. I hate being the bad guys cuz it reminds me of ISIS. I hate ISIS. But multiplayer is fun when you have a full team with microphones and they know how to vault into windows. The last gamemode is terrorist hunt. This is when you are paid 1000 dog tags to killed highly trained teenage muslim terrorist holding ONE person as hostage, but with human people! I'd say i'll rather take my chances alone.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe overall game is a 8.5/10 I like it because i like counter strike and good graphics. If you think my review was helpful then i feel sorry for you.

There is literally no other point to this game but just to see a nice screen cap of Jäger's beautiful helmet. Jäger is also a pilot and even though he doesn't have the flying helicoptor to help him, he's pretty much the only one that could fly one IF and WHEN they add the "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege - Jäger's Uprising" DLC in 4Q of 2016: Set on a dystopian path where you take control of our hero, Jäger, and fight Glaz and his evil army of IQs and Docs. It'll add new variations to Jäger such as 4 different Street Fighter like colour pallets to his clothing, a new and awesomer helmet, 5 new weapons exclusive to Jäger, and a new totally original class: Shadow Jäger; where you have a gun that shoots out shadow-drench blood thirsty doom skulls that heat sink on to any enemy within 15 metres.

Game itself is pretty fun. Still had a lot of fun even tho there's limited number of maps and operaters (extension about to release).\n\nHOWEVER, such a good game is totally ruined by: horrible servers, tons of unfixed clitches and lack of anti-hacking systems. Imagine this, you are camping a window barricaded by wooden panels which has 0 visibility from outside to inside; you're not making a single move so you're totally silent. Suddenly, a 30.cal bullet shoot through the panel and head shot you, and the guy took the shot all the way on roof of the building cross the alley. Or, when you are attacking, your team poped some smoke to cover your advance and all three of you get head shot when you're walking through the smoke by a guy with a pistol on the other side of the hallway.\n\nYou're ♥♥♥♥♥♥, yet you didn't give up. You start another game with a new team. Yet, probably due to your poor performance in the last round, Ubisoft give you a punishment by not showing you the loadout page, and the system force you to pick the "recruit" soldier. More than that, the server decided to **** you guys up. It loads for decades even if it shows every single player in the game has completed loading.\n\nAnd now your anger bursts and you want to destroy something. Don't worry, Ubisoft implanted their best AI system in the game. Once it detects that you're so angry that you're attempting to smash your computer with a wrench, it will automatically disconnect you from the server and tells you that your connection is lost again and again. Doesn't matter what you do to your network or how many times you restart your computer, the game will remain in a "dormant" stage before you calm down for more S**T.\n\nCome on UBI, don't kill your own community.","January 29","false","182.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/repeating/recommended/359550/","repeating","Aud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/repeating/","111 products in account","I've been playing since release and I have yet to hear more than one little kid. 11/10 buy pls\n\nYou want a genuine review? Here we go.\nThe singleplayer is tacked-on at best. It's a linear 10 or so missions with a "secret" eleventh mission. All are pretty dull and uninteresting, and really only served the purpose of warming up for multiplayer. Terrorist Hunt with friends can be very fun. Solo, it's boring.\n\nNow the multiplayer, this is what you looked at the review for. Well....\n\nIt's damn fun. Playing solo sucks, but it can be done. Although don't solo-queue ranked matches, please. This game is best experienced with at least two other friends, preferably four. Nothing is more fun in this game than playing with a full squad of your buddies, doing your best to outplay the other team.\n\nThe operators. The selection of "characters" you have to choose from. Let's get right to it: There are NO BROKEN OPERATORS. Although, there are a few pretty useless ones. Now when I say useless, I mean when you see their ability actually come through, you don't have the reaction of "Cool." You react more along the lines of "Holy f**k, FINALLY." Those operators would be Tachanka and Doc. Tachanka has great weapons, but his turret just feels... kinda useless. When you get it right, it's both hilarious and epic. But that's just not how it pans out most of the time. His turret runs out of ammo very quickly, and while it will kill quickly, a single shield player completely negates you. Now Doc, I love him. He's one of my favorites. But I just have to admit that my teammates, as well as myself, get killed far too quickly for me to ever be truly useful when playing him. In Siege, you die in one headshot, period. And considering a lot of people just spray until they get the lucky headshot, that tends to happen more often than someone going down. When it works, it's great and I feel like I saved the day. When they die instantly, I don't even notice. I'd mention Bandit as underpowered, but his weapons more than make up for it. The MP7 and the M870 are both ridiculous.\n\nAs for all the other operators, they all serve their purpose. Although some (Thatcher, Thermite, Rook, Mute) are more necessary than others (Glaz, Blitz, Smoke, Tachanka), they all do their part in one way or another. As for me? My favorite attacker is Blitz, and my favorite defender is tied between Kapkan (oh my god those traps are so funny when they actually work) and Bandit.\n\nThe gunplay feels good; not great, but definitely good. Although I do wish they had more accurate damage models for headshots, and that seems like a pretty big problem to me. the point of the gunplay in this game is "realism", or as much realism as you could want in a competitive 5v5 FPS. This means that a headshot from any gun will one-hit kill ANY player, heavy armored or not. I can understand the light-armored characters going down in one hit, but the heavy ones? They can shrug off five or six shots to the body, but a single bullet from a .45 caliber pistol penetrates their riot helmet? That just doesn't seem right, and it definitely shows in gameplay. You will die countless times to BS-feeling headshots, and you will get plenty of BS-feeling headshots. It's not a fun experience, and adds a variable of luck to guns like SMGs, where one lucky shot from a 50-round magazine will kill just as well as a perfectly placed Glaz sniper shot. Luck should not be a factor when it comes to aiming, and the one-shot kill from SMGs and pistols? That needs to be addressed.\n\nDon't let me steer you off course though. Other than that issue, the guns all feel useful in their own right, save for the GIGN's shotgun. Recoil seems fair for all weapons, and shotguns are actually relevant due to their great ability to destroy walls.\n\nShields are not OP. They really just aren't. Sure, facing one head-on is stupid, but it's not the end of the world if you're stuck in a 1v1 against one. Pistol hip-fire accuracy was reduced, so you have a lot of options to deal with them.\n\nThe destruction is amazing. Absolutely gorgeous and well-implemented. It's not just a gimmick, either. There have been plenty of times each match where someone will blow a hole in a wall to get an unexpected angle on an entrance. It adds a whole new layer of depth to the maps, and allows for some pretty crazy crossfires. This also means that nearly every wall is a door. It's a great feeling when you're pinned behind a door and you use your shotgun to blow through the wall behind you and escape. It also doesn't seem to impact framerate a whole lot. A have an i5-3570k and a GTX660, and my frames only drop by about 3 during wall explosions. Never dropping below 60-70. Not bad.\n\nThe netcode? Ehhhh.... It's better, but it's still not the best in the world. In the first significant patch, they fixed a ton of issues people had been asking about. One of those was to improve the tickrate, which they did. They bumped it up from 30 to 60. This is a big difference, and made the game feel a lot more legit, for lack of a better word. You die around corners a lot less frequently, and you no longer get shot by people who weren't even there on your screen. There are still some latency and connection issues, but surprisingly, Ubisoft is actually WORKING TO FIX SOMETHING. I know, right?\n\nMicrotransactions? Not really. It's just for skins and renown boosters, which boost your team's renown gain as well. Most of the skins can eventually be bought with renown, and they've already started giving people free skins. Plus, CSGO goes crazy with skins and people love it. Are you surprised R6S has something like that in ti?\n\nThis, though, is the main point: THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN BUY THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN ADVANTAGE. Nothing. Nothing can be bought with real money to give you an edge versus people who aren't spending real money, and Ubisoft "says" it's going to stay that way. I hope so.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game with a ton of potential if Ubisoft actually gives a sh*t and does things properly. It has some significant flaws, such as 1-hit pistol headshot to heavy armored characters. It also has some weak spots in the operator lineup, such as Tachanka's mediocre turret and Doc's lifesaving syringe that's hardly ever used. Despite this, it's one of the most fun games I've played, and I will continue to update this review as new information becomes available, and things are changed. I highly recommend this game, but do wait for it to go on sale, as $60 is silly for a multiplayer-only game.","December 24, 2015","true","284.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

Graphics look nice, Breaching and Specialties are a good gimmick, Terrorist Hunt is a nice timewaster (albeit a little boring after going through all the maps and modes), "Story" is short. But a lot of this game is based on Mulitplayer, which kind of sucks. (Extra comment at the end of the longer version).\n\nLonger version of the points I made above:\n\n-Matchmaking: Even though 1.3 fixed a decent amount of issues for me personally, a lot of the people are still getting Error Codes and disconnects (even though they SAID they fixed a certain error in 1.2, turns out they were wrong...and are still wrong). Solo Queue is pretty quick, but once you Squad with even one or two friends, the wait time turns to 5-10 minutes....TO FIND TEAM MATES, and then ANOTHER 10 minutes to find Opponents to play with. Ranked, is even worse, so I can't even bother trying anymore\n\n-Hitboxes: So since when does shooting someone's earmuffs kill them instantly? Because apparently they're part of the head hitbox, and guess what, headshots are a one hit kill yaaaaay. I cannot tell you how many times I've been a shield and wondered how someone killed me when they were aiming for the top-middle half of my shield. While I'm at it, someone please explain the explosion radius of a grenade through a wall, because Fuze has to worry about standing too close to the wall he just used his device on, Yada yada lots of explains I could go all day, but the most pressing issue is..\n\n-Camera Angles: Everyone, and I mean quite literally EVERYONE who's played this game enough will spin you the tale of how much bs camera angles are in this game. How what they see on their screen and what you see on your screen are clearly not synced, at all. How you didn't even see them but apparently the better half of them had enough vision to pop you a good one. Cup this with an extra heaping helping of lag and you've got yourself a ragequit worthy game of the damn century.\n\nTL;DR It's like Ubisoft intended this game to merely be a test and miff players so they can focus on figuring out how not to mess up The Division (Which I'm looking forward to, to make up for this game hopefully. It'd had honestly better be worth $120 because now I regret R6 Siege and can't return it because STEAM RETURN POLICY [Extra Jab at Steam for bonus points])\n\nAlso, I have 100+ hours into this so....","January 21","false","289.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Constant crashes, audio issues, mulitplayer issues, and a plethera of others. Load times can be up to 30 minutes for a round, and terrorist hunt multiplayer is currently completly broken. When this game works, it is great fun, sadly, it does not work often. For some people, this game has no to few noticeable issues, though the majority of people i know have had some large issues. Me and many of my friends have had to port forward just to be able to join a multiplayer game, and sometimes even that doesnt work.\nThe audio issues are another major issue for me. Only one of my friends has experianced this, but it seems to be common on the support forums. The audio gets really quiet, and gets crackely and cuts out every once and a while. There is a temporary fix to this, though sometimes it will force you to restart rather than fixing the audio issue.\nCrashes are; in my opinion, the biggest issue with this game. And they always seem to happen at the absolute worst times. 80% of my crashes happen when trying to get into a ranked game, and this is a huge issue for me and my teammates. Every time this happens my ranked stats take a huge hit, and the team i was placed on is left without a player for a round or two. When i got my first rank, i was in silver 2, now after dozens of crashes, I am in bronze 3, my k/d has been reduced by almost half, and my win/loss is abysmal. You may think I am making this up, and i am really just mad cuz bad. But anyone who has experianced this issue knows my pain.\n\nThanks Ubisoft, yet another rushed, trashy PC port, I has thought you had learned after Watch_dogs. I am not entirely sure why I had high expectations for this game, once they plastered that Ubisoft logo on it, It was doomed.","January 22","false","35.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

They are pretty decent still to say, but that's about it. I do not expect much because of this, the graphics are just a modern game at that....\n\nAudio: The audio I find to be louder than what it is, when shooting a gun it sounds like a rocket is going BANG in your ear, no matter inside or out and feels rushed together just to make it sound like something is happening, rather than the game actually sounding like a firing weapon in a small space, outside or in a large room... Slightly annoying or confusing at times.\n\nControls: The controlling of the character is very easy to get ahold and kinda more arcade style movement than originally thought... It feels more of a slowed down Counter Strike movement, not quiet the arcade CS controls but a slower version to make it seem more realistic. The buttons and stuff are easy to do and get used too..\n\nGame: The game itself right now on release as I write this article (I will update after the first year so people better understand how it has moved along) is that it has 3 modes, multiplayer/ Terrorist Hunt and kinda like scenario situations, where there are about 8 missions, you must gain 3 stars in each mission to basically pass, each mission is a different thing BUT it feels like a tutorial for each class and how to use and play as them, mixed in the 3 star system from the old Modern Warfare 2 coop system, where you had to defend for X amount of time for 3 stars etc (If you played MW2 coop, you will know about the star coop system)\n\nTerrorist Hunt has 3 difficulties, Normal, Hard and Realistic... Basically realistic is hacking bots, this I seen being stupid... I watched my death cam, a bot instantly stepped into a room looking right and did not see my team, then INSTANTLY span directly to the left almost a 360 degree spin pin point accuracy, fired and killed 2 people... Stupid.\nBasically you hunt the map to kill how ever many bots... That is terrorist hunt.\n\nThe games you play as multiplayer are fast at times but thankfully the loading is almost instant, so you are in and out without any massive waiting so games are always on the go, which is a plus when you have a stupid team and the other being pro's.\n\nMy annoyance and many feel the same: The game has a kinda cash system, where you give Ubisoft MORE money than they already recieve, in return you buy ingame cash and use that cash to pay for items in the game like more operators, gun attachments, skins and so on... The game itself is built around this and you earn VERY VERY little ingame gold stuff to actually buy stuff, this I noticed to be a lot of playing (farming) to get the gold you need to upgrade, when you could just spend more money on a game with limited gameplay and get the stuff you want straight away.\n\nThe game was delayed once or twice, I cannot remember.. It might have been more but I played the closed beta, open beta and so on and between those times I cannot see why the game took so long to make. It barely has any content to keep someone playing for hours and barely has anything to warrant the huge price tag they want for it... Ubisoft for you I guess.\n\nThe game on release has barely any content I found... The maps, modes and whatever else is barely anything for what I would expect a bran new game to have.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Yes and no, sadly Steam does not allow this option for limo.\n\nYes, if you enjoy the Rainbow Six Series and like team work, small maps, quick games, weird shooting to rescue a hostage, or defuse a bomb and secure the area (Basically a bomb but no defuser) (Seriously that's the only three options.....)\n\nNo, if you do not like barely any content, cash ingame microtransactions system and medicore experience.\n\nUbisoft needs to do some major work on this game and release a hell load of free stuff and stuff for gold edition to make this game something that it was supposed to be, the game had so much hype on what it was going to be but utterly it falls short by quiet a bit which is sad. I wanted to love thie game but ended up more frustrated than anything else.\nUbisoft also seems to be turning into a company which throws anything together with a slapping big price tag and thinks it's justified with their name, it's worth it all and it's amazing...","December 2, 2015","true","181.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It looks pretty and the coop mode is super duper fun! Playing on Realistic difficulty is a serious challenge :P. Multiplayer is super fun, too! It requires coordinated teamwork and strategies! Tho I'm not really into competetive games this def shines among them!  However, if you just wanna play coop this is well worth it just for that imo!","December 4, 2015","true","83.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/recommended/359550/","aps97","[ARX]AnthonyPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/","140 products in account","Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege is the current newest game for Tom Clancy's series. There is already another upcoming Tom Clancy's game but it is an entirely different genre. Rainbow Six: Siege (RS: S) is a MMOFPS, 10 people, 2-team PvP/PvE game. It gained a lot of attention when it was released since a number of youtuber were all interested to do a game or two since Beta. But it is run by Ubisoft's Uplay. Yes, Uplay and their infamous potato server and complicated client design runs this game, so you'll just have to adapt with it.\n\nYou will play as offensive/defensive team, each consists of operators from famous Counter-Terrorism Unit from all over the world. Offensive team will deploy remote controlled mini drones (not the ones that fly) to search for the main objective's location before the round start, while defensive team will use that time to set up the defense around the perimeter to protect the main objective (can be bomb/hostage). You have a lot of choices both to capture the objective or to defend the objective. Offensive teams are given choice of multiple breaching point with different offensive gadgets and defensive teams are given the choice of wall/door/trap door blockades and a lot of different defensive gadgets.\n\nThe gameplay is very slow-paced even though it's only 5v5, just like CS: GO's competitive matchmaking. Players (at least current players, maybe it'll change in the future) are ALWAYS very careful in playing this game. Offensive teams rarely rush blindly even if they have the exact location of the objective. The planning part of the game is going to be the part you're going to spend most of your time. It doesn't mean it's boring, it's the exact opposite. It's very fun to plan with your teammates on how to breach the room and how to set up a good perimeter defense and positioning. Unlike CoD & Battlefield, run and gun doesn't work at all. So if you're looking for a fast-paced, zero teamwork, zero strategy, and casual run and gun, go back to CoD. RS: S, just like CS: GO, is not the typical MMOFPS. Even though RS: S doesn't have the crazy recoil pattern, its tactical side is very difficult to master and not easy at all to learn. While for the technical game thingies, you don't need to worry about it at all. The graphics are epic, soundtrack isn't great but adequate, performance is very stable and bugs rarely interfere with your games. But since it's a Uplay game, you may experience massive lag/disconnection/connection failures in random occasions since Uplay is infamous for it's 'potato' server, or crappy server. It is uncommon (not rare) for that to happen, though.\n\nThe community is definitely much better compared to other MMOFPS like CS: GO, CoD (duh), or Battlefield. As expected from a 60 bucks game, kids under 17 rarely play this game and most of them are adults who tend to be cooperative and communicative. Since most of the players are still new, it's very enjoyable to support each other and become better together. From my 11 hours gameplay, I only met 1 kid that's raging when his team is losing. I guess rich kids will be able to go through the high-price filter and pollute the community. It's impossible for an online game to completely prevent this kind of thing. But still, the minimum number of trollers, immature adults, and kids makes the game very enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: In response to a 12 year old who got offended by my previous paragraph and some others who voted down by review, note that I do not imply all kids under 17 years old are immature, but most of them are. I do not hate kids, we were all one back then and it's unreasonable and unfair to hate people just because of their age. I personally think it is important to inform people about the good non-toxic community since it is one of the most important element in a team-based online game. It's a fact that kids tend to be the main source of various problems in online gaming and you can't change it. If you disagree, I am sorry but you're either a narcissistic kid or new to the online gaming world. I have been playing online games for a long time and that fact is already a common sense. That's the reason I focused on talking about kids in my previous paragraph. I apologize if I offended you in any way, you will understand once you have earned enough experience and mature enough.\n\nDon't worry about getting bored of the tactical things too. The execution of your plan is going to be fun too since events move extremely quickly and most of the time, you'll have to improvise. Especially with new discoveries like trap doors/breachable floors, etc. Most of my multiplayer PvP games teammates also didn't bother to plan anything. Most of us just strolled around the room and inform the team about the possible way to breach. This game is definitely not as serious as CS: GO but it does require the same level of creating a strategy. While for the shooting part, you can rely on your casual FPS games skill. You don't need to spend a lot of time studying recoil patterns like in CS: GO but you also can't right click and spray with almost 0 recoil like in CoD. It's well balanced. From the shooting perspective, it's easy to learn and moderately difficult to master, while from the tactical perspective, it' moderately difficult to learn and very hard to master. Planning a good breaching strategy requires a lot of experience and it's not easy to memorize all of the different spots on every single map. It requires a lot of playtime experience, cooperative teammate, and a lot of other elements that will affect your success.\n\nIt may be a bit pricy but it's a good filter for those kids. I don't think parents will easily give their children $60 to purchase video games today. The price is totally worth the fun. I heavily recommend this game despite the fact that it runs on Ubisoft's potato server.","January 10","true","14.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"
