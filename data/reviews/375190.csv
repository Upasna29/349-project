This isn't GTA.  What it is, however, is a game that puts you into a nice virtual experience and gives you many things to do.  It delivers exactly what it says it will; immersion in a luxury apartment full of things to explore.  If you don't own a VR headset, don't buy this game.  It has nothing for you.","August 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","0"

It has become my go-to for showing new people what VR can do.\n\nI especially like the little surprises.  (The fruit basket is my favorite!)\n\nSo many gamers don't realize that good VR has nothing to do with running around maps and down corridors with a gun: it's all about hanging-out in cool settings like this one.\n\nI can't wait to try it out on a Vive!  I may watch all my TV shows here.\n\nI also look forward to the Galleon you guys are working on.","July 1, 2015","true","18.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","4"

It’s different and smaller, but I guess that’s why it’s cheaper.  There’s just a lot of fun stuff to do.  My favorite is the dancing girl.  I haven’t added tried my own videos yet on the TV, but it plays so smoothly I plan to soon.","December 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

I love this luxury condo. The little secrets are funny and fun to play. Please don't take anything away. However, why is the Master bedroom nonfunctional? Open it up, and add a luxury bath. The lady behind the door can be added as a shadow in the bedroom shower. (wink) Also, add a cute puppy and a hot maid.","June 3","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I see loads of potential for easter eggs and expansions.  I love the mood changing effects when you alter time, or choose a colored glass, or see what happens when you play with Godzilla dolls! I found myself trying to test the boundaries of the helicopter by flying it outside on the balcony and was pleasantly surprised that I could! It's all the details that went into this apartment that make it such a fun place to spend some time, the music choices and sound effects were great. Bravo on this experience, I can't help but feel I missed something which is why I will explore it again..right now!","May 24","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not something that's going to keep you coming back for hours, but for 6 bucks its an interesting 45 mintues or so. There is enough content to tinker with and I had a few chuckles. The atmosphere is nice (wish my apartment was that awesome!) and I like that you can mess with just about everything short of the actual walls. I'm also glad that I caught this after the little add on that lets you turn the lights off. I really like the look of the place in the day light from the huge windows. It makes me want to actually crash on one of the couches and grab a book or something. The little vehicle's are fun. The head tracking in the apache was brilliant. I flew the little sopwith out of the apartment and bounced off the roof and I was pretty surprised I didn't run into any invisible walls.  It's apperent that there was effort put into making a finite space as interesting as possible.\n\nFor some contructive criticism; I will say that the little R/C vehicle are fun, however, for some reason they made me a little bit queasy (and I've played a few games that are far more intense without having that problem). I'd recommend having a seat while trying to use them. Also the the model for the dancing lady with fruit on her head is VERY narfed. Or at least it was when I found her. Her arms where bent way above the elbow and her hips and legs where doing some strange things. It looked like the animation didn't quite line up with the model.\n\nA suggestion; This app or something similar would be neat to have as a media player option. Like if you could park on the couch and watch Netflix, another media streaming service, or play local content. Imagine that with a multiplayer function too! Sit and watch a movie with a friend or even a group!\n\nOverall, worth what I paid for it and a nice VR demo.\n\nTo the folks who where negative about the price; If you can afford a VR head set and the cpu to run it, then you can afford 6 dollars (less then the cost of a movie out of a bargain bin) Someone put effort into this. They deserve to be paid for it.\n\n","May 27","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like reproduction of mundane life in games. Although i don't have a VR, i wanted to give it a shot and bought it, but...\nWhen you push "Play" on Steam you spawn in a elevator with a Warning message for Oculus users and that's it. No controls instructions, no menu, no game options, no nothing. I don't know if it's like this because i don't have VR, but ok. My review is not based on this matter.\n\nThe graphics and modeling are good. But the apartment is very, very small (My GTA Online Apartment is bigger). As far as i explored it has only one room (living room/kitchen). The other door is locked and other has a Shark (!).\nAlmost all the objects has some interation, but most of them just make sounds.\nWhen you go to the balcony theres no ambient sound (the game doesn't have ambient sound at all). The city below you is silent.\n\nThe "small as a ant or 10 feet tall" feature is just a button you press to go "no clip" style, floating.\n\nBecause it's not stated it's early access or beta in the store page, i'm assuming this is the final version. So, no... Don't buy it.","June 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 32 of 190 people (17%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","17","32","190","14","19"
