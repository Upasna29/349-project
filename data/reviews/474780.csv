Once you get in a working game the controlls are nuts. my screen was stuck in rotation for about 2 minnuets i had to close the game before i got sick.  I would wait on this one.  This needs some support for sure.","June 3","false","0.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

Vive for a few seconds was able to get to the start hallway and select screen, then flashed out.  On second reboot it auto-pulled up theater mode and wouldn't start.  On Oculus the start menu was upside down and inverted.  The controls moved opposite as expected.  On neither my XBOX controller was able to provide any input.  Requested refund.","June 4","false","0.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Should be free, but devs gotta eat i guess?\n\nGot it to work on the Vive, but it's a bit buggy.  I used a Xbox One as the controller, Vive controllers did nothing despite tinkering.  To make matters worse, for whatever reason, the simple controls were a bit scrambled.  Theres a stick, that controls rotation (both the right and left sticks on the controller seems to work for this), but the thrust button which by the brief instuctions should be the RB (right bumper) button, but didnt work at all.  Pushing my right stick forward activated thrust, very weird.  Same for the 'fire' command (LB button by instructions), only used once at the end, and I just pressed everything and something worked.\n\nWhen I say "short", I mean 3-5 minutes short. Zero replayablity.\n\nAnd as a first for me, got a bit queezy in that short time ( the pod your flying around in, is constantly moving in weird ways at the start in which you have no control-- Probaby and awsome feature for the Moveo pod this game was designed for, but not so great for home VR).\n\nHold out for it to turn free?","June 4","false","0.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This experience should not have been released in it current state. I couldn't finish it.","June 6","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
