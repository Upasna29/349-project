"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/321560/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","The Sun and Moon begins as what feels like your ordinary indie platformer, a crisp and clean minimalistic aesthetic accompanied by the nostalgic blips of an 8-bit soundtrack set the background for the seemingly straightforward gameplay involving moving and jumping your way to the exit. This familiar and direct-to-the point platformer feeling quickly and gradually transforms itself into something deeper, more complex and thought provoking as you are given the ability to slingshot yourself through solid walls to reach the previously unreachable orbs needed to exit the stage.\n\nThe action and the speed with which you break through each surface leading to your next goal are set to a pace that is addictive and constant, keeping you moving and diving through each cleverly placed obstacle at increasingly speedy times. Even when not rushing at full force for the objectives or trying to collect the little orbs The Sun and Moon is just a blast to relax and experiment with, watching the momentum change as you arc between solid obstacles at different angles.\n\nThe name The Sun and Moon itself seems to me like a metaphor for the opposing colors in the back and foreground, and the way your small round character transcends these two different realms as you bounce between jumping in the open air and sliding through the solid material of the ground as you phase into it. The visuals have a very simple and effective yet pleasantly abstract quality to them, the backgrounds in particular starting off looking like continents on some kind of extraterrestrial world map or more-so the dreamlike clusters of clouds amongst a green sky.\n\nThe Sun and Moon has a very progressive and rewarding structure to it. It lulls you into a false sense of safety, starting out in the most basic of ways with a challenge that is easy and all-too obvious. The music at first bears a strikingly repetitive yet charming 8-bit tone and the map seems to be nothing more than a series of boxes connected by a line. These simplicities don't last long, though;\n\nAs you move on this all changes, the levels become large sprawling towers that you weave in and out of, carefully timing your momentum in order to land on a faraway platform. The music from the always incredible Dubmood grows and evolves as more adventurous compositions are layered into the mix and draw you into the expanding challenge. The map twists and conforms into complex shapes as it progresses, branching off into multiple paths of varying difficulty.\n\nWith loads of alternate stages locked behind hidden pathways on a huge almost metroidvania-like map, insane par times to challenge yourself with for each stage, and leaderboards to check your skills against the rest of the world the content here is enormous with 150 stages and plenty of replayability keeping you coming back to each one long after you've completed a basic run.\n\nRising from its roots as a Ludum Dare 29 gamejam under the fitting theme "Beneath the Surface", The Sun and Moon has come a long way and developer Daniel Linssen has turned what was a fantastic and simple concept with suprisingly deep mechanics into a content-rich package that is much sleeker, shinier, and polished than before. With its unique brand of platforming, progressively intensifying audiovisuals, and addictive map system this is must-buy status for anyone who enjoys the likes of The Floor is Jelly or VVVVVV.","November 14, 2014","true","9.9"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","4"

Basically you have the ability to dive into solid blocks and it's like a diving into water with something that can't drown so you are immediately pushed back up. To dive deeper you need more momentum, so falling from greater distance will do the trick. The goal is to collect 3 orbs and get to the wormhole. There are 150 levels and several boss encounters.

If you just want to complete the game, it may take you a while. If you want to try and get a great time on each level, or compete on the leaderboards, it will definitely take you a while.\n\nThe graphics are simple and appealing, and fit the game perfectly.\n\nThe controls are responsive, and it should not take long to get used to the physics of the game. Getting really good at the game is an entirely different matter. There are many, many opportunities to flex your skills if precision and speed are your focus.\n\nThe music by Dubmood is amazing, and likely won't get old for a while.\n\nFinally, the developer is involved with the playerbase, and I definitely appreciate that. It would appear that most (if not all) of the feedback given during development was heard and either implemented or discussed. I'd say I'm looking forward to Daniel's next game, but I don't know if I'll be ready to put The Sun and Moon down before it's out. :^)","November 15, 2014","true","6.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

If the dev reads this, just want to make you know that you're a god at designing levels *clap*. Many devs should play and learn from this game.\n\nI really think this game deserves way more love. I totally recommend it to everyone who likes platform/time trial challenges.

For its unique twist on the traditional style alone, gamers should consider adding it to their collection, with the simplicity of control and great audio sealing the deal.\n\nInstead of being limited to the traditional gameplay directions (up, left, right), players can defy gravity and propel themselves downward into the ground in their ongoing quest to collect three shiny orbs and advance to the next level.\n\nThis unique mechanic is the definitive highlight of the game as a whole. Forcing players to rethink classic strategies of beating platform puzzles is no easy feat, but The Sun & Moon does so in a way that is simple to pick up, yet challenging to master. With over 150 levels of gameplay (ranging in difficulty from easy to what the developer describes as “brutally hard”), players will likely enjoy the fun dynamics this feature of the game creates.\n\nThe only objection casual players might have is the price, but if it is on sale, it's definitely worth the purchase!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nFull Review at Metal Arcade: http://metalarcade.net/2014/11/the-sun-and-moon-review/","November 15, 2014","true","18.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/321560/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","It seems that, nowadays, there’s a new gamejam almost every month. And why the hell not? They’re a great opportunity for developers, amateur and professional alike, to flex their creative muscles within the confines of each jam’s chosen theme and time constraint. Ideas thought up in the heat of a gamejam can even make it to a full retail product, and join the likes of Surgeon simulator or Receiver. For Ludum Dare 29 all competitors created games to fit the theme “beneath the surface”, and now its winning game, The Sun and Moon, has graduated to a full Steam release.\n\nFirst impressions are key, so you could be forgiven for thinking that The Sun and Moon‘s visual simplicity belies an even simpler game. You play as a small worm creature with the ability to dig underground, but in order to dig deep down you’ll need to leverage the power of gravity and your own weight. Whilst the game is mechanically simple, it’s the ways in which you’ll utilise them, to overcome the game’s puzzles, that provides variety.\n\nEach quick-fire level has you collecting a number of gems, and you can make your way to the exit once you’ve picked them all up. Levels don’t last very long, with some being as brief as 8 seconds or less, but you’ll need to be quick and have some serious finger dexterity to become that masterful. A three-tier grading system is included to encourage/taunt you, and you’ll face a real challenge to even gain the lowest grade in some levels.\n\nThe game drops you in the shallow end to begin with, tasking you with only picking up gems, but the difficulty ramps up very quickly. Pretty soon you’ll be throwing yourself off platforms and stairs, trying to gain enough momentum to fire yourself to other, higher platforms. Each level has an ideal solution, and its up to you to figure it out. But even if you do manage to decode a level, you’ll still need to seamlessly weave every movment, dive and dodge together to get to the exit quickly enough for that top ranking.\n\nThe control scheme is, at least, on your side, and you’ll only need to use the directional keys alongside the shift button if you want to dive underground. Some levels may prove too difficult or demand some time to fully understand, luckily the overworld map has a branching structure that allows you to visit multiple different areas at once. Each new area brings its own challenges, but also a refreshing change of scenery, as well as an extra layer for the game’s chiptune soundtrack.\n\nAnd about that soundtrack, it’s pleasant enough to keep your head bopping and feet tapping, whilst not breaking your concentration as you fail for the 20th time. It’ll even extend itself as you unlock new areas, adding new layers to the beat, making it more complex and diverse.\n\nYou probably already know if you’ll enjoy The Sun and Moon. Its excruciating difficulty and intense gameplay make it an acquired taste, only fit for those who can pick themselves up after repeated failure, only to continue playing.\n\nIt’s the very epitome of videogame masochism and punishes far more than it rewards – unless you can give it the ample time required to master its 150+ levels. It’s one of those games that really makes you work for your gratification, even if  only a fleeting sense of achievement. As much as we wish we were any good at The Sun and Moon, we just aren’t – as our ground teeth, pounded keyboard, and flipped desk will attest to. So if you don’t mind, we’ll be backseat gamers and watch someone else play it instead\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to the the developer and publisher for the review code.

A fresh take on the platformer genre thanks to its unique, physics-based diving mechanic.\n\nThe start is simple and straightforward but the game gradually becomes complex and challenging. Level design and pacing here are fantastic, testing a player's skill and problem solving while never feeling that a failed attempt is because of unfair or broken game mechanics. Completed levels unlock multiple new ones, allowing for a non-linear progression through the game, and each new quadrant unlocked adds a new color scheme, a new layer of music, and a new platforming mechanic for that area. For the 150 or so levels there are also record times for high score lovers and speedrunners alike.\n\nThis game will take a while to finish and even longer to beat the times.

The theme was Beneath the Surface, and the way the developer interpreted that theme was to implement a simple movement mechanic: the player can dive INTO the platforms, retaining momentum but with reversed gravity. The level designs really force the player to think and move in different ways, and they grow more challenging fairly quickly.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who likes platformers with unique movement mechanics and anyone who likes short, skill-based challenges (the game keeps track of the player's best time for each level).","November 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

As you can see the game won a Ludum Dare and was created by a single person - so huge props for that!\nThe goal of the game is pretty simple and straightforward : you play as a sun, that needs to gather 3 moons to orbit it and get enough mass to enter the wormhole and complete the level. It's not as simple as it sounds and needless to say - the game is unforgivable and you die instantly! The main game mechanic is pretty interesting - you can penetrate the "ground" and move inside it. Once you do that, your impulse remain, but the "ground" wants you out of it and creates a sort of anti-gravity to push you out. The mechanic is tricky and mastering it is of utmost importance in order to succeed. Not all levels are static with only spikes and endless drops, there are levels, where you are being chased by an unknown entity, that follows you around and destroys you on impact - so you need to be swift and decisive in your movements to kite it around.\nThere are highscores for each individual level, as the position is determined by the time you needed to complete it - the faster the better. Important the point out is, that the timer starts not when the level loads, but when you move for the first time - so you have time to look around and plan ahead.\nThe controls are really tight, there is a full controller support, but I personally did prefer my keyboard. The levels are not always straightforward and you need to plan and think about the optimal route, or try and test to see what is even possible and what not. The music is "ok"-ish, might get a little repetitive in the long run, but you can always disable it. The levels appear in the form similar to a graph tree leafs, so you can navigate around the level map and not necessary complete the levels in order, with the occasional block, requiring you to have a certain number of levels completed, before progressing.\nThe huge amount of levels and the challenging nature of the game, paired with per level leaderboards make this an easy recommendation!\n\nTL:DR you can check out my overview video and watch me fail ;)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341695258","November 14, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It uses sharp contrasts and certain color schemes to create a very unique aesthetic. This is minimalism at its finest\n- Main gameplay mechanic involves shifting into the floor and building momentum (the floor naturally accelerates you upwards when you shift into it). Very simple, but it's very fun to ramp up speed and try to hit the little dots.\n- Solid level design and a good amount of content: There's quite a few levels (~160), and they vary in interesting ways. Most of them revolve around the main gameplay mechanic of shifting and speeding at the right moment.\n- Challenging yet not overly difficult. There are some frustrating levels, but for the most part it stays reasonable. If you wanna really push yourself though, there be medals. Those are much tougher to get, and it can be fun yet frustrating trying to shave seconds off your time\n\nCons:\n\n- The soundtrack is minimal, and this is less fun. It is a very simple track that repeats and sometimes changes around as far as I can tell. It doesn't get annoying, but it lacks variety.\n- There's not much to the game beyond the challenge of shifting through the ground and collecting the little dots.

The mechanics are creative and unique; you can turn the island/platforms into permeable objects through which you can move through (given enough momentum). Sort of reminiscent of Portal, but there aren't portals, just permeable membranes (?).\n\nThere's plenty of content. Runs fullscreen in 1080 at 60fps well. It gets addictively mesmerizing at times.

At first it looked very innocious, but after first 10-20 levels the difficulty started ramping up real hard.\n\nThe platorming is very precise, once you get used to the inertia and the gravity, inversions and tunneling you will be amazed what you can accomplish.\n\nThere are 160 levels, split into 10 worlds, where each introduces a different mechanic to defeat. In particular some levels stand out in difficulty from the world. I felt 54 was way too difficult for where it was, and anything past 120+ is really really challanging but not impossible. 141 can get you stuck unable to proceed (fortunately the forums here have a pointer if you need help).\n\nIt can be very frustrating at times, but once you finish the level it will be that much more satisfying.\n\nIf you like difficult platformers give this a go. I would buy this again even without the discount. Worth it!\n\n9/10","February 21","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having the basic explained let me tell you something right now: This game is a newborn legend that rests atop with with the other beasts of platforming that are Super Meat Boy and Dustforce. I was amazed with how well polished is the level design, one of the bests I've seen in awhile, and it shows from the beginning to the end.\n\nYou start simple with the first world, some spikes a ground, platforms, you get feeling of diving into the ground and of momentum. But as levels come there is always something new and refreshing, you may face yourself with fireballs that race through the screen, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by a set time, appearing-disappearing platforms ruled by if you are pressing the button that lets you through solid material, flying spikes that patrol a certain area, and even in every world there is a homing boss that will chase you until you collect all the beads, that in this case are 5 instead of the regular 3, and reach the portal but, the boss is different with every world. He may leave some spikes as he goes or instead of going at a regular peace, it will fling itself into your direction from time to time, so yeah lot of variety and of the good one.\n\nEven though you may simply describe this game as a platformer, the best way to describe it would be a puzzle platformer, or that's at least how I perceived it, having in mind I was always aiming in obtaining a Sun Medal (The best grade out of the 3 that are included in the game). Why the puzzle part you ask? Because of multiple reasons actually but mostly because of the scattered 3 beads in the stage, it makes you really think and ponder: Which is really the optimal path? Which bead should be the first I collect? And after that? Not every time the beads are set in a simple path, maybe they are too far apart or maybe some momentum may be of help in shaving those milliseconds to achieve that so grossly incandescent Sun Medal. And things keep stacking up. Should I jump from platform to platform? Or dive into the ground continuously? When should I start moving before the clock sets on? I need that platform to be on, or that fireball at that distance at least, or that flying spike to be at least in the right instead of the left.\n\nAnd that is why so brilliant the level design, it makes you stop and watch the stage and think, but I really mean it when I say think. I even at times just took a walk through the stage (If it was big enough) and watch carefully everything I should be aware of to just start planning, yeah you read correctly, planning. And after that, your regular Dustforce or Super Meat Boy: Try, try, try, try, try until you succeed.\n\nAnother huge plus is the music, it's so relaxing and soothing it will make it will hinder the possibility of becoming angry. It's somewhat similar to Dustforce´s music, ambient electronic. And it gets better, The Sun and the Moon´s OST is like an evolving album, as you progress through worlds you start unlocking new tracks and every track feels like an upgrade from the last one, like an evolving experience. Good stuff, I've never seen any game doing that with its own soundtrack.\n\nI liked this one more than Super Meat Boy but less than Dustforce. What can I say, Dustforce has an astounding skill ceiling that probably no platformer ever will be able to beat. But, still it's tons of fun and with that price tag of $6.99 USD it's pretty damn hard to say no. I spent 30 hours, getting the most Sun Medals I could, on it with zero idle time so the price is extremely fair for the 150+levels the game has but if you play it just for completing stages I guess the game could be beaten in 16-ish hours. If you are a platform lover, please don´t lose the opportunity to play it.","March 31","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/321560/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","So. This game. Is... I would put it in the "meh" category if Steam had that one, so this is a very light recommendation, but I think its main mechanic is interesting enough and it does enough with it to justify a recommendation, I did have a good bit of fun with this game after all.\n\nThat being said, I kinda wish this was a shorter $5 game. Instead of the 160 levels, give us 80 of them, pick out the better ones and give a more consistently enjoyable experience. This game really feels stretched out for content, in the end. There are some levels that toy with a few extra mechanics (time shifting blocks, blocks that pop in and out of existence when you hold the shift button, a few autoscroller-type things, basic stuff mostly) but the majority of the game is confined to making use of the main mechanic in a static environment. And there's only so much that can be done with that, I felt the game getting repetitive pretty early on and it didn't get more varied down the road.\n\nThere's also an uneven difficulty curve, I feel. Outside of the bonus world, I didn't find myself challenged too much by any particular world... but each world had a few levels way harder than anything around it. A lot of the boss levels also felt a bit unfair, having to pray that the boss would end up in around the same spot every time so that you could learn the level and complete it, and the final boss especially felt too long. There's a fair few levels requiring precision beyond what the game gives you, too. I feel like focusing on really precise movements in a physics-heavy game may not have been the best of ideas. But that's just me.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is pretty interesting though and makes for some enjoyable platforming challenges. There's some levels about getting enough height via flying through blocks, other levels about trying to get down below via gravity and clever use of the main mechanic, and some just straight-up platformy levels. The extra mechanics occasionally thrown in also make things a bit more interesting; there's a few levels where you basically fly using the user-controlled blocks, and the boss of the 8th world has this very clever proximity thing going on, I really enjoyed that one especially. There's also plenty of replay value here; every level has three time challenges to meet. Personally I couldn't be bothered to even go for time challenges most of the time, ending up with very few sun medals and only a few dozen of the full-moon medals, though usually the half-moon medals aren't too hard to get. I spent around 7-8 hours just playing through all the levels once, so there's no shortage of content here, certainly, though honestly I would have preferred a bit less in the end xD\n\nOverall it's a solid precision platformer, definitely unlike any other game I've played, but I feel the focus should've been on making a more compact and enjoyable experience rather than just throwing every level the developer made into the game and calling it done. I think it would've made this "okay" a pretty "great" one if there was a bit more polish to it.","July 18, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
