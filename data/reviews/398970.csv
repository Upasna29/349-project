"http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/recommended/398970/","combatwars","CombatWars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/combatwars/","2033 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA few things I want to make clear first. First, this isn't a MMO. According to their own player count ingame, there has been a max of 15 unique players online today, of which the highest concurrent number I've seen in the 3 hours I've been playing is 3 with me included. Infact, in the top 50 players list, only 20 of them are above level 1. That's saying something when it took 3 hours for me to get to level 7 while idling at least 1 hour away. It's not a Massive Multiplayer Online game, but just a regular Multiplayer Online game. Second thing I want to say is that this is very similar to mobile games like Clash of Clans. If you've enjoyed that, you'll more than likely enjoy this game.\n\nNow, onto my review. This is a full-on browser game. When you install the game on Steam and launch it, a launcher comes up with options to run their chess game, or Fasaria World Online. Clicking on FWO launches Internet Explorer and the website itself.\n\nI have a quick list of grievances with this game that I first want to air out.\n\nWhen you first play the game, you start off with 10K money, food, and iron. These are the resources in this game that you must acquire. The only problem with this system is that gathering resources is way too simple. In the three hours I've been playing, I've probably gained over 15M of each resource and used/sold most of them. First off, you can hire workers to generate a steady source of income every tick/month/15 minutes but that isn't needed because you make a lot more money by grinding on mobs. Like a million in less than a minute.\n\nSecond, the engineering lab. If you're trying to understand why a health pack requires compressors, generators, and micro parts, well you're not alone there. Everything in the engineering lab requires those three sub resources for some strange reason. Be it the health pack, energy pack, strength upgrade, defense upgrade, health upgrade, or even energy upgrade, all of them require differing amounts of generators, compressors, and micro parts to my utter bewilderment.\n\nThe third grievance of mine is with the Assembly Factory. In the AF, you create factories to produce generators, micro parts, and compressors. Sound good? Well, not exactly. Even if you have two of each factories, you're only allowed to collect from one factory each tick. It's as if you paid a restaurant for three meals but they only allowed you to pick one meal every fifteen minute. Utterly frustrating and it feels as if the game is trying to hard to be a grind fest.\n\nNow a few good things that I do like about this game.\n\nFirst, the combat is very simple to pick up on. In fact, this reminds me of Adventure Quest, except without all the animation. Is it the best combat out there? Of course not, but it's damn well good enough considering you can also play it on mobile browsers according to the devs.\n\nSecond, I have to say that the community(although the playerbase is quite lacking) is very nice and helpful. I'd had more than a dozen questions about this game and the veteran players patiently answered all of them.\n\nLast, it has a very high potential to be addicting. This is one of those games where you check back every 15 minutes to upgrade your base, add more troops to your army and create new factories in the Assembly Factory while collecting all your idle resources. The fact that you can log into your steam account directly on your phone's browser also adds to the fact that you can play it anywhere and at anytime.\n\nUltimately, I'm giving this game a thumbs up. A lot of the problems I think this game has is more or less a balancing issue with resources. Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game though lacking in the graphics department.","October 14, 2015","true","6.6"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","1"

Good game so far, I'm still learning but it's pretty easy to learn although it's a lot in the game to master. It is a grind fest for sure but quite rewarding. The people in the game seem very nice so far although I'm not very talkative.\n\nI believe that the success of this sort of game weighs heavy on community but someone like me just likes to build, farm and character build so it looks like you can just solo if you like.","October 6, 2015","true","10.8"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","0"

I wanted to support the developer and the extra resources did come in handy. I'm not sure how much of this changes the over all experience of the game as you can earn vip and everything in the shop without having to use real money. The extra boost was ok but I'm earning everything I need in the game just fine. Not to say it is a waste of money but I don't think I needed it. As it stands, it seems fair and a nice addition to have mainly for nubs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0M6-XsFSeM&feature=youtu.be\n\nI made a video showing the game play. It's kind of hard knowing what to expect from a turn based browser game but look at it and see if it's what you're into.\n\n*I got music track from ancients of fasaria music file. I make no claims. Just borrowed it.\n\n\nGreat game so far and quite addictive. I never got into browser based games but this one got me hooked for now. Not sure if this is going to be a sugar rush, crash and burn experience where the good times start to become bland and so, so but we will see.\n\nI started a clan already. It was too early in the game for me to start one, I think this should change as I'm still new to the game and would probably not be the best person leading a clan at this point. The score requirement needs to be higher for starting a clan and the change should be made now when the game is new and young. The worst thing is having a bunch of nubs ruining the game with poorly run clans.\n\nI don't want to speak too early as the worst thing is for a good game to get too repetitive or the community boring due to lack of activity but so far it doesn't look that way and seems to be a great buy. There is a lot to do in the game but it's easy to learn. I can't see myself getting bored anytime soon but I've said that before so we'll see.","October 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","29","41","0","0"

It's early access and cheap to buy so that's a plus. VIP sucks and should be removed as I'm being tempted to buy a package already and although I can earn it, I don't want the option for me to p2w. Fasaria World Online is pretty legit otherwise. The VIP Shop doesn't take away from the game but please consider removing the option for real cash.\n\nCommunity does seem cool but I would suggest waiting for them to release the game before buying as the community is still small. Don't EVER make this game F2P! F2P games like this suffer from players making multiple accounts to max their resources not to mention the community quality also suffers. I like it the way things seem to be going, just need more players.\n\nNOTE: That download client doesn't remove from your screen on windows 10. I know you don't need to load the game from the client but you should fix that.","October 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","25","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingguard77/recommended/398970/","wingguard77","ice cube","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingguard77/","25 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKEEP IN MIND: This is a browser based, strategy, building mmo. I believe the description of the game is given in the video and text. If anyone is confused about what type of game this is, I advise that you read a little bit about it before getting the game.\n\nI've been playing this game since the legacy server when Fasaria World Online was under another title. I was a little upset when they decided to clear the database and start the game all over but now that I'm back on, I see why it was done. This version also has a lot of updates that the old version did not have that I've taken notice and like, but enough about that. I'll talk about the game in it's current state.\n\nFasaria World Online has a lot a features to it so I'll try to break down the basic ones but keep in mind that I won't scratch the surface of what this game has to offer as there are so many things to do that you will learn over time. This game was in development for over 2 years before they got it on steam so I've seen a lot of updates till now.\n\nJRPG turn based fighting - You get to select a class/race that will determine the type of character you have in the game. The turn based rpg fighting portion of the game helps you level up and earn resources but the major aspect of the game will be how you build your colony, your armies and defend your investments. There is one major world and 3 moons to explore. As you level up, each new area opens up with new weapons/armor to purchase and new mobs to fight. You can also craft items and build factories to gain more parts needed for character upgrades. Very detailed system.\n\nBuilding your colony - Your colony can be built over time by purchasing buildings with the resources you gain. As your colony grows, the more resources you gain with every tick (15 minutes). There is also research and construction you can do that will open up new features to the game.\n\nBuilding Your Army - This is where the game shines and requires strategy and wit. You can unlock multiple troops overtime and build 3 armies. You can send your troops out to attack other players earning pvp points. As you earn pvp points your pvp medal increases and bonuses stats are added to your troops. You can make your troops a lot more powerful this way. You can only attack players around your same score level or higher so you will never be attacked by a higher level player just looking to decimate the noobs.\n\nClan System - I had a clan on the legacy server but haven't tested it on this one yet but it looks to have the same features. You can have up to 15 players in your clan, you can give each player ranks where they receive a badge of a sort, clan chat, email and forum etc. The best feature is the collective clan experience all members earn for their clan that ranks them against other clans. Also their is a clan achievement that once the clan level reaches, can earn crystonian crystals for all clan members just for being a member. You can use crystonion crystals to purchase stuff in the VIP Shop, no real cash needed.\n\nScore System - The score system seems to have been updated. It seems to include all activities in the game. I noticed my score go up after performing multiple tasks. Your score updates every tick. I am assuming this as I could be wrong.\n\nAchievements - This is an awesome addition to the game. As you earn achievements, you earn shards each day that you can craft into crystals. These crystals can be used to purchase anything in the VIP shop without having to use cash. It takes a little patience but on the legacy server I was cashing in on enough crystals every other day to purchase mega packages worth $40.00 in the shop. Like I said, no real cash is ever needed.\n\nThe VIP Shop - Speaking of the VIP Shop, I think it should remove the option to spend real money. There is no need to as you can earn more crystals, I mean a LOT more crystals just by playing the game. This is my only dislike but it's just an opinion as some players seemed to have purchased crystals so far so it serves it's purpose for some I guess.\n\nPolitics, Country and Maps - There are too many things to discuss about that so I'll just not for now. You'll learn about all of that as you play.\n\nChat system and community - The chat system is great and shows your user progress and even the weapons/armor you have equipped which keeps things fresh. There are a few issues with the censorship but nothing major.\n\nOver all - Like I said, I played this game before and I mean A LOT before it reached steam. There were some good players on the old server that I hope they come back because players are what makes this game shine and without a community well, this is just "Civilizations" solo mode. Clan wars and such are what makes a game like this awesome so I do hope it finally builds a strong community.","October 3, 2015","true","2.1"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","26","38","2","0"

Since I didn't used the web browser linked to Steam, I had played something like 45-55 hours more) .\n\nIn this game, there is NO WAY that a player who decide to start playing and level-up could survive : because at any moment of his progress, he could have a chance to defend his colony against a player who started to play just a few days before (belonging to a clan or not). He could never a threat to a player who is a member of the 2 active clans, NEVER !\n\nThe worst mistake a new player may be able to do is to really start to play !!! And I'm not kidding or mad, I'm am perfectly unbiaised as I write this sentence. In the current state of this game, a new player get not a chance to reach the same level of development of an already active member. He could never stand a chance to beat players above level 40 who started to play only 2 weeks before him. That's just impossible.\n\nThe reason is simple : in a single attack, a player destroyed all the buildings and all my troops of my colony, I managed to get (more than 7,000,000 buildings (your main income in resources when your level-up them) and a lots of troops to try to defend myself, for my level I was pretty well developed, but a third of the most powerful troops I could recruit where in queue production) so what's the point to construct buildings and recruit troops ? I reached level 56 and I understood that I could have my colony destroyed each tick, and that's I could never defend again against that player. The only things worth it to do in my situation was : PvE, upgrade "the factory", completed the first of the hourly quest to get crystal shards, wait to forge enought crystals using crystal shards I farm in the VIP shop to buy resources in order to buy resources, just to be able to completed the first hourly quest and wait again to have enought resources to buy a better stuff for my character. Boring, no ? For me, it means GAME OVER.\n\nEven if a new player join one the 2 active clans, my situation could be hims. It just a matter of time.\n\nconclusion : don't play this game and waste your time, as long as a player could destroyed all yours buildings of your colony in an unique attack. if you get this game with a bundle, unlock Steam cards, in case you created a character for testing, delete it after you get the 3 cards, then uninstall it and forget it. it's too bad since the developpers didn't wanted to create a Pay-to-Win. Play Rogue-Like, Hack'n'Slash in hardcore mode or start Speedrun, you will have more fun than playing this game.\n\ncon :\n- hard begining because lack of resources and no usefull guide for beginers\n- useless "tutorial" on gameplay, the help menu is very basic and lacks of some essential precisions (like how to unlock the fourth building you could construct)\n- imprecise interface (timers have no cooldown, i.e. display "5 minutes before new building" is possible and that's all), input are most of time annoying and inaccurate\n- an older player can wipeout your entire colony (armies + buildings) at will and put you in a situation where you are unable to rebuild your colony, because he have strongers armies than you when he attacks\n- very long time to produce your armies/buildings + limit to numbers of units/buildings you can produce by "tick" / especially the defense buildings are way too long to contruct. once you lost your very first stronger armies and that's the buildings of your colony are wipe out, you can't retrieve your progression (especially if you managed to build more than 7,000,000 buildings)\n- PvP System is the worst feature of this game, only because you could lose all your armies and buildings when you are attacked one time by an older player then it's game over for you because even if you have tons of resources, the production is too slow and now you become a snack.\n- 10 or less players a day on steam server 1  (yes it's reality : 10 players a day login to the only steam server and unique server except mistaking or that this register reset each hour) , 2 active clans only. Those players seems happy to play together and seems to see new players who reached a certain level as a threat.\n- there are no players who got a level between 60 and 79, not one, the active players got a level 80 to 138, less than 12 and some of them are either inactive, either very casual.\n- so politics system is useless with so few active players\n- this game needs more features in order to be interesting for high level (the highest level complains about that)\n- countless bugs in-game and with web browser\n- this game is way too unbalanced between a new player and an player who began to play before, this is aggraveted for players who belongs to 2 active clans. I have never played such a web browser which was so unbalanced.\n- no precision in a player's statut of his last login or if he's really active or not. Yet something very common in this kind of game.\n\npro :\n- lifetime VIP as soon as you begin the game (very cool) and is a must have, without the game is way too much limited\n- the VIP shop who allows you to get ressources without paying with real money so it a real Free-to-Play\n\nSorry for my bad English, I'm French and not used to write in the Nelson's language","April 23","false","10.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","11"

You have to register an account and give your email in order to play.\nThis developer has only awful games with fake reviews and after it downvoted my reviews with from two accounts i will not give my email i'm actively using and i don't want to bother creating a fake one. i'm afraid they will post my email to spam lists, you can expect everything from them, if you don't like their games.\nThis stillborn was just released in bundle, so i'm expect more negative reviews. I've already ordered some popcorn to watch this fall down into mixed zone.","January 22","false","0.1"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","38","8","21","6","1"
