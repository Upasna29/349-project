It's a bit hard to read at first and it definitely helps to have knowledge of the Warhammer Universe because in the first 15 minutes of the game, you're introduced to Terminators, Space Hulks, Strike Cruisers, Epistolaries, Tech-Adepts, the Warp, teleportariums, genestealers, gretchinz, lightning claws and all manner of various Warhammery things.  The basis of the game is you are Brother Nabor of the Imperial Fists Chapter and you are a Space Marine. More specifically, you're part of a squad of Space Marines tasked with exploring a Space Hulk that has just been "vomited" out of the warp. Be careful though, the wrong choice can lead to you dying very quickly as the Warhammer Universe is rather unforgiving. There is combat in the game but from what I've experienced so far, it's rather shallow. You can choose a target, attack, and focus but seemingly not much else. You have wounds which indicate your health, honour which can be built up to unleash a powerful attack, sort of like a rage meter or something and everything is done on a pretty simple green grid. The models are actually pretty good looking but it all looks like simple telemetry. This game could've done well to have just a bit more art in it, I would think. The music, despite being only one track, is nice and creepy, just as a game involving a Space Hulk should be!\n\nBeing a mobile port, I can already tell there are a few issues when attempting to select things, like the difficulty for example but hopefully that'll be ironed out in time.  As I discover more, I'll be sure to update this review. As it stands, this reads very interestingly and I find myself wanting to know what happens next. If you like text-based adventures then this is definitely a worthwhile game, otherwise keep waiting for Dawn of War III.\n\nGameplay Footage (me getting way too into the narration and also explaining somethings about Warhammer as I go):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LII7Q9Qtsmw","December 2, 2015","true","8.1"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","73","81","10","0"

And much like any Dreadnought, we don't want it to die but we don't want it to be pained any further. Legacy of Dorn: Herald of Oblivion isn't the blessing of the Emperor that it needs to soothe its exploitation from the warp-addled minds of Games Worskhop, but it's certainly greased the intellectual property's joints.\n\nInfusing themselves with the Terminator armour of an Imperial Fist, players join their battle-brothers to cleanse the ancient space hulk "Herald of Oblivion" of xeno filth, be they necron, dark eldar, ork or tyrannid, it all depends on which paths you choose and when you walk them. Because Legacy of Dorn is a choose-your-own-adventure game, your interface with the game is minimal - you'll read blocks of very descriptive text, and then choose one of multiple actions. The limited number of save states, and needing have a certain amount of purity for some actions makes things all the more interesting, and encourages replay value so you can see what you'd missed in previous playthroughs. From the start you'll be seperated from your crew, so you'll notice how differently each playthrough is from the get-go by choosing a different path. It also helps that randomness is kept only to 'wheel of fate' rounds and fights (the former particularly rare), so the more you play the better you can plan. Eventually you'll know who to rescue in which order, and what wargear will be necessary to get better results. However you can expect that to take a fair few hours and at least one playthrough where you reach one of the multiple endings.\n\nThe game's combat is as simple as it gets, bearing similarity to Enchanted Arms and Phantasy Star games in that how close/far away from a target determines your chance to hit and be hit. Both ranged and melee combat function in similar ways, where you have a percentage to hit and can use focus to increase your chance to hit, as well as reduce an enemy's damage done to you for that turn.  It's primitive to say the least, especially when on medium difficulty you can Focus-Attack-Focus (a move that costs 3 action points, and makes you virtually invulnerable), but with some tweaks to weapons so that they *feel* different to one-another I'd find it rather enjoyable.\n\nLegacy of Dorn's visuals are..... interesting, despite being almost nonexistent. It's a text game that has the retro-futuristic look of the Imperium technology; the game's dominated by emerald-green screens and lime text, and the battles take place on a black and green grid. And yet this is one of the best visual styles I've seen for Warhammer, because the game's writing paints a much more evocative image of what it must be like to be on a Space Hulk than.... well, even Space Hulk. As for its music, it's nothing special - bleak chimes and horns make up most of the soundtrack, and I fail to be inspired by the battle music. There's also no audio options to have the game read the text back to you, and given how good Warhammer voice acting's been in the past, it's a shame not to have it here where the lines are superb.\n\nIn conclusion, Legacy of Dorn: Herald of Oblivion's a damned fine game, but it makes the same mistakes as other Warhammer 40k games that may cause you to roll your eyes and look elsewhere. The Space Marines (albeit a different chapter) are the protagonists, and as per usual other armies are given little room in the spotlight. It's unfortunate given how well it describes the lore, and makes you feel proud to have purchased codexes entirely for the fluff material (or am I the only one who does that?).\n\nI rate this game a Teleportarium out of a Your Adventure has come to an End.\n\nNeed a second opinion?

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045943749/recommended/389850/","76561198045943749","Mr More Dakka","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045943749/","150 products in account","A relatively simple- but ultimately fun choose-your-own-adventure style game book set on a massive Space Hulk that conveniently holds about 5 of Warhammer 40,000's races within its corridors. Due to the setting and style of writing, this game is definitely meant for existing fans of 40k- be it just the game itself, or the lore as well. Though it's also not a horrible starting point for someone new to the franchise as well, since it does explain a good amount of the 40k terms and entities that pop up. Its not perfect, but it definitely tries in that regard.\n\nHerald of Oblivion has two modes of play that you go through as you explore the space hulk- the standard choose-your-own adventure style choices, and RPG-style turn-based combat. The choose-your-own-adventure segments are the meat of the game, and are lined up quite well. Their structure encourages both experimentation and at least 1-2 full repeat playthroughs, since doing things in different orders can sometimes make completely different events pop up later on, or resolve differently based on whatever different pieces of equipment you have retrieved beforehand. It's well designed for the most part, since not that many of these alternative paths are outright 'wrong' or lead to guaranteed deaths. Plenty of them make your death more likely though nonetheless.\n\nThere are also times where the game's adventure segment will have a random chance element, the 'Wheels of Fate' as the game calls it. These events aren't too bad for the most part- as the majority of them just make the game harder when failed, or easier and quicker if passed.\n\nThere is one MAJOR exception to the good design though, as just before the start of the endgame there is a choice followed by a wheel of fate roll that can lock you off from 2 of the game's 3 achievement-linked endings if you either choose incorrectly, or the roll doesn't go in your favor (And that roll in and of itself is linked to an achievement as well!). That one event is easily the worst point of the game's whole design.\n\nAs for the RPG combat, its very simplistic and generally goes by pretty quickly- allowing it not to interfere too much with the adventure segments. The player has access to ranged and melee attacks, and can use his 'focus' ability to either buff his own attacks or lessen the potency of the enemy's strikes. There is a good amount of equipment you'll find over the course of the game as well that will make you slightly stronger by the game's later segments. On the normal 'Astartes' dificulty, the combat never really gets too difficult as long as you time your out-of-combat healing well, as you'll have enough wounds to just tank past most enemies. There is the harder 'Veteran' difficulty available though for those who want a more tense experience with the combat.\n\nDo be careful with the 'Withdraw' command though- if you trigger the game's 'you're cornered!' message, it will sometimes glitch and give your enemies infinite attacks- guaranteeing your death. Admittedly, this glitch was the only way I ever died to the combat on the normal difficulty.\n\nAs for the graphics, the combat has holographic 3D models of all the enemies you can face in the game, most of which are pretty much directly based off of 40k's models. 40k fans will recognize them instantly, with maybe one or two exceptions depending on how far back their familiarity with 40k goes. The races covered by the game include Orks, Tyranids, Necrons, Dark Eldar, and even a sprinkling of Chaos Space Marines and the Adepta Sororitas/Witch Hunters.\n\nMuch of the game as such has an unsurprisingly static look to it- that may or may not feed into the eerie atmosphere the game's soundtrack tries to establish. The game only really seems to have two music tracks though, one for the adventure segments and menus, and one for the combat.\n\nOverall, Herald of Oblivion is an enjoyable experience. 40k Fans will undoubtedly appreciate it the most, though those unfamiliar wtih the franchise should do OK with this title as well. The game is a bit on the short side though- with it being possible to see almost all that the game has to offer in about 4 hours- possibly less if you abuse the game's save-state feature, but give or take 1-2 additional hours for a veteran difficulty playthrough or 100% achievements.\n\nThat said, the short length isn't too big of a blow against the game with its low price.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Simple but effective combat system.\n\n- Well designed adventure with a decent number of paths and variations, encouraging at least 1-2 full playthroughs.\n\n- Decent take on the 40k characterization.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- There is one choice and an accompanying Wheels of Fate roll that can lock you out from two of the three achievement-linked endings. Thankfully- if you are able to recognize which choice/roll it is that causes this, you can abuse a save-state to bypass it. Still annoying though.\n\n- The Necron segment is lousy.\n\n- The withdraw command can cause a glitch that gives your enemies infinite attacks if it is used too much.","January 28","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It certainly gave me some nostalgic flashbacks to the good old Sword and Sorcery series.\n\nThis game should be purchased purely for the text, as it is nothing to write home about in the departments of sound, graphics and gameplay. The sound design consists of a handful of different sounds reused ad nauseum with some nice ambience to keep it from being too offputting. The combat is almost laughably simple and could have done well to incorporate some light choices in the making of your character's stats.\n\nRegardless, the main meat of this game lies on the story and the way it is written and the writing is effective for the most part. Your choices are many and it is always absolutely clear that your choices have affected the story, for better or worse. I have only two gripes with the writing:\n\n1: The changes of mood and tone are sometimes very sudden and sometimes that can feel jarring.\n2: Sometimes a sound tactical decision that you could reasonably assume a veteran space marine to make will result in a purity (A simple morality stat which affect some decisions) loss, which can hamper your progress later on. It is nothing too major, but I have always disliked poorly thought out moral choices in games.\n\nAll in all: If you like space marines and reading about space marines doing space marine things then you can't go too wrong with this title. I will for sure be hoping to see more 40k stories out of this developer.
