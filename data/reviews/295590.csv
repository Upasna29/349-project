I liked the concept and I was hooked by the write up.  But it just doesn't deliver a fun and engaging experience.  The real and true fault to the game is that it doesn't do what the main hook of the game is delivered as.  The legacy system is really no different than a game reset in the long run.  In most roguelikes, you get a game over and maybe you've made some progress towards your next game.  In this one you have a limited number of turns, usually around 40 or so, and then the game forces you into and end scenario.  Often times you spend the last quarter of your life just trying to FIND a mate so that you can continue your legacy of mediocrity.\n\nSo, it's billed as a "roguelike/4X strategy game about life, legacy & love"\n\n4X ?  Maybe only in the very loosest of definitions.\n\nDo you 'explore' yes, you explore a bland and ultimately uninteresting proceedurarly generated world.  But once you explore the area, it doesn't change in future legacy characters.  HOWEVER the fog of war DOES reset.  So either hope you have a really good memory or ask yourself why the fog of war reset.\n\nDo you 'expand' ?  I would say no.  You don't really have any classic base or sphere of influence that you expand.  Oh you can upgrade other towns, but since they 'rot' over a generation or two, there's no sense of actual building or accomplishment.\n\nDo you 'exploit' resources?  Yes, ok, this is one of the 4 "x"es that you actually do.  You kill monsters, loot mines, find artifacts, etc.\n\nDo you exterminate?  Kinda.  You fight monsters and other 'heroes' like yourself, but there's no sense of accomplishment because they are constantly respawning every generation.  So it's more like whack a mole, not exterminating any enemy.\n\n\nHave you found the common thread in everything that I've written yet?  It's that the legacy system is basically broken in my opinion.  There's really no sense of accomplishment or forward progression.  You spend 20-25% of your turns looking for a mate to try to continue your legacy instead of trying to do quests or explore, and then you start all over with a new hero.  After playing for 90 minutes, I felt like I'd accomplished absolutely nothing upon my new hero.\n\nI might give this game another go if they do a signifigant update to the legacy system, but otherwise it's getting banished to the 'never to be played again' list of steam games.  On the off chance that Heart Shaped Games LLC reads this:\n\nGet rid of building decay, have coins automatically carry over on each legacy, and maybe a percentage of the previous hero's strength and / or fame.  Otherwise the whole legacy system in it's current incarnation is nothing more than a soft reset.\n\n\n\n\n--updated review Oct 13, 2015--\n\nSometimes it's a shame that you can only 'reccomend' or 'not recomend' a game when you write a review.  Because with the recent update, I really don't know if I feel like a  "YES" or "NO" is exactly how I feel any longer.\n\nScott a dev from heartshapedgames was kind enough to take the time and write a feedback response to my original review.  Let me say first of all any dev who takes the time to listen to feedback and reviews and then try to make their game better is already leaps and bounds ahead of others in the industry.  That point alone scores major points in my book.\n\nBut lets get to the game and the changes.  I will try not to rehash my original review too much and focus on the changes that I noticed in my play time.\n\nPro:\n-Building decay, this is a NOTICIBLE difference from when I played last time and a very much needed change.  The buildings still decay, but picking up a hammer or the right trait, and you can really make your buildings last forever.  Ignore them and they will rot away in a little while.  That's fine.  It's not like you have to rebuild every year.\n\n-Items: I don't know if this is just my memory, but it seems like there was a slew of new items dropping from the last time I played it many months before.  Training swords, hammers, rafts... these items were in the game but I only ever saw them in shops before.  It's entirely possible that I just missed them somehow during the first few hours of my play, I don't know.  But it does have a positive effect.\n\nCon:\n-I was really hoping the legacy system would be boosted just a little.  Everything I said in my original review still holds true.  Gold doesn't carry over, nor does strength.  Fame does to an extent, in that your legacy once built up starts to build, but it's very small.  It's a bit disheartening to have someone with an epic legacy and their child is a no body.  Really the son of Grokthak isn't even at ALL famous?\n\n- Fog of war.  I really don't understand why this exists at all on each new playthrough.  I could almost understand if there was a 'semi' fog of war, a see through fog of war on each generation that obscured the monsters, but let you see terrain previous generations had explored.  But since the world doesn't change between generations, resetting the fog of war just makes the game feel tedious when I'm thinking "now which town had the strength forts, and which had the farms?"\n\n- Age, I've actually changed my mind on the whole 'looking for a mate' at the end of your life.  Since your strength goes down in old age, that's when you should be retiring from adventuring and settling down to find a mate.  So my gripe about that has been removed.... unfortunately it's been replaced by something else.  The 'age' that you become an adult and gain a strength boost is fine.  But middle age, and old age, shouldn't be 'set in stone' they should be a portion of your maximum life.  Far too often I found myself effectively being forced into 'late game' by age for a hero because he hit a magical wall of age and lost a chunk of strength.  Now I understand that any game has to have a 'game over' situation, and in this it's not finding a mate before you die.  But I feel like pushing that old age penalty back a bit would be a bit better.  Let me have the choice for one last epic battle with the dragon thing before seeking out a mate if I want to risk the loss.  By making me lose 10 or more strength, I know I'm going to have next to no shot.\n\nANYWAYS, wrapping up, I DIDN't change my review from a 'no' I would not recommend this game.  However, it comes with a caveat.\n\n\n--THE CAVEAT--\n\nNow, for the average player, based just on the description in the store page, NO, I would not recommend this game.  However, that being said, I WOULD RECOMMEND this game, BUT with a caveat;\nI would recommend this game as long as people know what they are getting into first.\n\nDespite what it says on the store page, this game ISN'T a 4x strategy game.\nThis game ISN'T really a roguelike.\nThis game ISN'T really about life, legacy and love.\nThis game ISN'T really anything like Civilization or legend of zelda.\n\nBut what this game is, is a unique and interesting twist on tactical rpg-lite gaming.  It's more akin to a board game than anything else in my opinion.  But it can be very engaging and quite fun at times.  Especially for the price, it's not a bad way to while away a few hours.\n\nI feel like this is a pretty solid game, though it could be better, and hope that heartshapedgames continues to improve upon it.","June 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 346 of 362 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","346","362","6","10"

Don't expect to get much more out of the game, the game brings some fresh elements, and the whole generations thing is pretty cool.\nThe game is a bit repetitive and short, and from what I can tell there is no real end to it. You can figure out exploitive strategies pretty easily then explore and kill everything. Once you have done that there is nothing left to do. No proper end for you either. Gives you a very empty feeling.\n\nGame is a bit buggy, and could have better flow; it feels a bit slow.\n\nOverall it's a bit hard to just say YES or NO to the game because is not bad though neither is it great. It's just an OK game.

But this one bored me to tears.\n\nThis game is very simple, which is good. It isn't challenging at all, which is a problem for me since challenging gameplay should be the hallmark of a good roguelike. The game also lacks depth. Hero Generations is a game about grinding that goes nowhere. Each generation sets up the future success of the next generation - but to what end? If I wanted pointless grinding I'd continue my life as a software developer. It's pretty fun to play, but nothing about my brief playthrough makes me want to come back and continue playing.\n\nThe combat is extremely tedious - actions that should take less than half a second (or be instant) like dice rolls end up taking longer.\n\nI guess it comes down to this:\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but for the price I would have expected much more.

You have to within your heroes lifespan develop the kingdom around you by building structures within cities that wil boost your stats. This is all good but in a certain amount of years those buildings will collapse and the city will decline. So you find yourself constantly runing back and forth building, upgrading and reparing buildings.\n\n-Your inventory is very limited (only 2 spots) which makes questing a hinderence since you can't carry a weapon and shield while picking up an ancient statue.......\n\n-Again Random combat is always a negative, if you get your hero up to 40 str your hero has a 0-40 chance to inflict combat damage, meaning your char with 40 str can lose to a minon with only 1-2 strg. (ANNOYING)\n\n-Lifespan is to short, by the time you get your hero strong enough to adventure and build up cities he/she is middleaged. Since each turn your hero takes counts as 1 year, 80 footseps comes sooner than you think. I am only glad that my 80 year old female hero can still reporduce.\n\nIf you want a quick mindless strategy game, pick this up on sale, if you want something more polished pass on this","April 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 93 of 119 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","93","119","4","0"

Still not quite there yet. It's a fun little game, but there are a few things I would change.\n\nSome things I would like to see in the game:\n1. Options to set how long each character lives. 1=1 life, 2=1 life, 3=1 life. Kinda like Civ has quick, standard, and marathon. I don't feel attached to any of the heroes, because I know they're going to die off in a few minutes anyway. I'd rather spend an hour or two on a single character, then be sad to see them go, yet excited to play someone else. (Fire Emblem style character attachment.)\n\n2. More inventory space. Two items is great. But... Why don't these adventurers carry backpacks, or have pockets? My family's trusty sword and shield have gotten me through many generations, but.... I can't actually pick anything up without leaving one behind, and coming back for it.\n\n3. Fighting is pretty much pointless. You can get more money completely safely by just walking town to town, and more renown by picking up the totems, and delierying it. My suggested fix would be to apply change number 1. Make the standard life loss about 4 or 5 squares, then instead of a town offering gold every few years, have them offer a quest instead to kill some bad guys.\n\n4. More trait slots! And a higher chance to pass them on! This is a single player game. Balance isn't as important as a multiplayer game. I think we're all playing this game to make a stupid atomic nuclear powered super baby.","October 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","36","41","4","1"

Loading screens get stuck/crash, and tiles can become impassable at random. Needs a lot more QA.\n\nResolutions are very broken. 1080p Max, windowed mode only; which often displays a 720p window. Causes the small text used in-game to appear blurry, and difficult to read.\n\nSome graphical anomalies, such as backgrounds/textures vanishing, requiring a restart.\n\nInfo pane sometimes gets "cut off" at the bottom of the screen, letting you only read half of an instruction/info text.\nGameplay/logic criticisms:\nLives feel far too short, and stats are dictated almost entirely by dice rolls and random number generators. Subsequent generations of heroes lack any real feeling of progress as a result.\n\nBattles are fully dictated by dice roll/RNG mechanics; a lost battle feels far too punishing, taking away from an already short lifespan.\n\nTown/Structure building feels far too much like farmville/mobile tap-gaming. Re-visit tile for reward, re-visit tile to upgrade, re-visit tile to prevent building degredation.. with so few moves afforded per lifecycle, it feels like a forced grind to make your actual "play" session even shorter.\n\nUnless I'm missing out on a deeper meaning in the game's message, I'm quite sure two males cannot produce an offspring as of yet - or at least, not in a time period where train stations are a new invention. Name/appearance generation doesn't appear to pay any attention to supposed gender.\nWhile the idea is good, the execution unfortunately, is not. With some minor amounts of polish, and more QA, this title could have fared a whole lot better. If this were a beta/early access game, I'd feel it has promise.. but as a completed title, I would not recommend it.","April 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

However, there is no way to create interesting stories in it at all.\n\nYou can marry to have children (in fact: you always only have one child and after that you die, and play on with the child). Besides the marriage itself, there is never any interaction between your character and the one you marry. There is never an interesting interaction between parent and child and friendship is non-existent.\n\nIn fact it's just some simple economics: building, harvesting, killing, gaining loot. Marrying is also entirely an economical decision.

I can't recommend this game in it's current state, however, because there is a major glitch that makes one of the core features frustratingly punishing: buildings, once erected, only last X amount of turns before they degrade and vanish unless you keep coming back periodically to repair them before this turn timer runs out. The glitch is that sometimes these buildings will deteriorate away whether the turn timer is over or not, which makes planning your buildings for future generations a dicey proposition as you never know if the buildings will last as long as they are supposed to or not. This is not a new glitch judging from the forums, Unless and until the glitch is taken care of, as the planning of buildings for future generations is a MAJOR part of the game, I can only recommend picking this one up if there is a really good sale going on.\n","March 20","false","5.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

A good game if you're looking for an adventure-fusion game that's fast to pick up, but has challenge, and if you like experimental games.\n\nHero Generations starts with a hero, who goes into the world, gains fame and gold and equipment, builds towns, and then dies.  Sure, the monsters may get you, but your real enemy is age.  Heros age and die, each turn is a year of their life, and that can burn away quickly.\n\nTo build a legacy you can construct buildings, win fame, discover equipment, and find mates to parent the next generation of heroes.  As generations progress new buildings are unlocked, and as you build towns change and grow, and you can explore different worlds, each with something unique.  Quests are given in each world to give you something to strive for, but you'll probably have plenty of your own goals, from making specialized towns to getting to a particuarly inacessible area.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple:\n* Move around the map.\n* Age and gain (or loose) abilities.\n* Find assorted treasures, monsters, items, and features.\n* Interact with those things in simple ways - combats, for instant, are decided by a single die roll.\n* Build around towns or upgrade buildings - which provide many benefits and can change the nature of towns.\n* Find a mate is impressed with your stats and parent the next generation.\n* Choose the traits of your child.\n* Lead the child on their adventure.\n\nThough simple on many levels, the game's strength is how elements interact.  Towns change their nature (and the mates available) depending on what's near them.  Different items afford different advantages.  Different buildings provide different bonuses or tributes.  As you play, you find more and more ways to benefit from the elements of the game and adventure deeper - there's always something new to explore.\n\nIts the kind of game to appeal to people who like to make long-term plans - literally generational in this case.\n\nVisually, the game has a very charming, cartoony style; bright colors, amusing characters with lots of variance, vibrant backgrounds.  It's got its own look which really makes it memorable and enhances the enjoyment.\n\nThe greatest strength of the game is how it manages to be both simple to play and offer a lot of complexity at the same time.  Gameplay is very easy, almost casual, and fast to pick up - but the depth of the game requires thought.  Yes, you're controlling a cartoony adventurer, but when you experiment with creating specialized towns, or plotting how to build roadways all over the world, you realize just how complex the game can get - and yet it's still easy to play.\n\nIf there's an issue with the game it's that some people might find it boring after awhile.  It yields its secrets to experimentation, exploration, luck, and persistence - and you may not exactly be up for spending three generations getting a town just right.  If that's your thing, good, but it may not be for everyone - the game's unusual fusion really is it's own thing.\n\nThe game seems to have good support, and even after release the author is integrating feedback and improving it.  The game's definitely finished, but the author is open minded about improving it - or reversing a bad choice or two.\n\nI consider it a buy for fans of rogeulike, adventure, and planning/4x games who want something easy to play but with some depth.

However, as the updates rolled in, the game only got better. Content-wise it still has a little ways to go, but technically, Hero Generations improved; it got fullscreen, combat was quickened, gameplay in general became smoother.\n\nI really appreciate the developer for being dedicated to improving the game. A score of 65% positive? Unacceptable, this game is very decent, and that's being said with the fact that it can still be better! If you like a simple RPG with 4x elements, try this game out. It's really a labor of love.\n\n\nOriginal Review: I fell in love with this game the moment I saw it hit Steam on the front page. There's something magical about it - it's clearly the labor of love.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, yet strategic. The graphics are simple, yet charming. The combat is simple, and yet again, tense with every roll.\n\nThat isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's faults. With the simple traits, a lot is left to be desired in terms of content variety itself. Although you have quests, it seems that most of them are pretty much the same thing with different names. Inventory is too small for quest items, and overall, it's clearly under-developed at this point, so much that it would seem reasonable to put it under Alpha (not in a negative sense, but in a realistic sense).\n\nHowever, the developer replies to almost every concern brought up, and has already fixed one game-breaking issue with saves. If this trend of correcting bugs and adding future content updates, I have no trouble believing that he will continue to updating the game and making it the next smash hit on Steam.\n\nAs of now, it's a 7.5/10, but with the future, I have no troubles beliving it could be a 9.5/10","April 13, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

I do like the fact that some of your traits carry over from previous generations and that your mate does influence the type you can potentially have, though there is a random luck of the draw factor involved as you'll be choosing from multiple face-down (sometimes face-up) cards that determine the stats of your new character.  The concept reminds me a smidge of "Rogue Legacy", though the gameplay is obviously different (platformer vs 4x).  As repetitive as it is, I still find myself enjoying it.  Every move you make takes a year off your life, so there's a lot of time management involved and hard decisions to be made with every generation.  Love the idea personally, though I'm not crazy about the luck factor involved with combat (both characters roll a die, the range values determined by their maximum strength).  All in all, I had a good experience with this one...though you may want to watch a few let's plays to see if it suits your fancy since it is rather different than most games on the market.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so2c1IQZH9I","April 22, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Unlike other rogue-likes I've played, this one seems to have much more on an adventuring aspect to it.  There are six world areas to explore with various quests to complete in each world.  You start with a character, and each step you take reduces your life.  Before you die, you must find a partner, so that your child can continue your legacy.\n\nYour children inherit some of the traits / abilities of your character, so as time goes along, your lineage will generally grow more and more powerful.\n\nDuring each lifetime, it takes time for your character to get into decent fighting shape.  There is always a push-pull tension in wanting to complete more in this lifetime, and making sure you have time to find a mate and spend time with your child.\n\nThere were a number of design decisions that will make or break this game based on personal preference.\n1)  The battle system is simplistic.\n2)  The character can only carry two items.\n3)  There is a limited lifetime on a per character basis.\n4)  Buildings degenerate over time.\n\nNone of them were game breakers for me and they made for some interesting decisions that needed to be made throughout the game.\n\nI have put together an example playthrough for those who are interested:  World 1 Playthrough [slggames.com]\n\nGameplay aside, there do seem to be a few technical issues that need to be resolved.  Like other reviewers have noted, I would have liked to have a full-screen mode.  I have also experienced some of the save game issues.  While not a big deal with shorter games, a late game character being lost to a save bug is a sure recipe for moving on.  There is also some lag after some battles that you hope the game will recover from.

A lot of the poor reviews are from tech issues of old; just today fullscreen was added. The game is actively being developed even after release.\n\nYou start as a nobody Hero, building farms and strongholds, trying to impress a good mate or two. Soon you're exploring new biomes, slaying bosses for Honor, and uncovering secrets. The biomes feel distinct. You will genuinely care about your cute little heroes and their legacies. You will find the perfect mate and make demigods with them. You'll delve into the heart of a volcano and ride airships.\n\nThe game's fairly fast-paced. A generation could go by in five minutes, ten minutes if you're really going for something special. (30k honor) Even with a poor mate, it's hard to get a useless offspring. If you do get lackluster child, you can use that generation to build your towns up. You're always progressing because of this, there's always a way to improve yourself somehow.\n\nThe game offers a fair challenge: it took me about 5.5 hours to beat over three separate game files, and I didn't truly "beat" it. You will certainly need to employ strategy and forward-thinking.\n\nSome weaknesses.\n- Two items can be stressful to manage. You want to maintain your buildings with a hammer while also building your hero's legacy. At least because of this, the game has you making hard decisions between two traits and two item slots.\n- Combat needs some kind of minimum damage formula. It is possible to have 120 strength and lose to someone with 20 strength if they roll a 20 and you roll a 19, as improbable as that is. While it thereby offers lucky shots to the player, you will only take lucky shots in the most dire of moments.\n- Needs just a bit more polish. The screens will transition to a mostly-white combat screen, where the combat really should just pop up in a separate view.","June 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

It's what it says on the label: A fun strategy roguelike. It has a solid tutorial and the core gameplay is easy to learn hard to master. Traits randomly passing down from both parents is an interesting mechanic and forces you to try and woo the best mate each generation. Also, buildings are named after their builder and age which gives the feeling that time is actually passing.\nUnfortunately though once you do master it you will quickly find that it isnt balanced particularly well. By the 3 hour mark I had found a way to cheese the game and become a 1000s of years old vampire living off the drained lifeforce of other adventurers. Kinda arguable who the real villian is in the game at that point. There are also a few glitches that still remain in the game that at this point I'm assuming are there to stay, they are not game breaking though so not a huge deal. Despite these negatives it was still quite a bit of fun for around 5 hours, but once you've killed and done everything there really doesn't feel like any reason to start again.\nTLDR: A simple but deep strategy roguelike that despite a few balance issues and glitches still managed to keep me entertained for around 5 hours, definitely recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games and roguelikes.","March 31","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I do not know why the reviews are positive overall, since I can't imagine enjoying this game past about an hour. The concept is incredible, and they have the framework for it, but it's terribly executed beyond that. There just isn't enough content, and some of the systems, like the item and trait system, feel rushed and don't make very much sense. It's like they had these huge ambitions, made the world system, which is very well-done, realized they didn't have time/money to do what they wanted to, and haphazardly put together the rest of the game.\n\nI don't ever write reviews, and don't care to explain in detail, but I think a thought I had repeatedly while trying to play Hero Generations sums it up quite well: "Why did I just pay $10 for a crappy Facebook game?"\n\nEDIT 4/18/15: I still do not recommend this game for the time being, but the developer appears to be paying genuine attention to reviews like this, and it seems like they intend to address many of the issues that negative reviews like this brought up. This is very interesting, so I will stay tuned and update the review if my opinion changes.\n\nEDIT 7/1/15: The developer seems to be devoting continued honest effort to improving the game based on community opinions. I have not played it in quite some time due to a lack of free time for games in general, but I will be clearing out a couple hours in the near future to update the review based on recent patches.","April 12, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Every decision must take the hero's remaining years and potential legacy into account. Is it worth fighting anything as a teenager, when the hero's strength is low? Should I repair that building so it will be there for the next hero at the expense of losing a card flip to get them another bonus?\n\nEven though I don't really buy into Hero Generations being a roguelike/4X hybrid, the 4X elements that have been woven into the game make it play differently from other roguelikes. It's turn- and grid-based in traditional roguelike fashion, but deviates far enough from the traditional mold that I'm tempted to call it a roguelite instead. I'm not sure how well die-hard fans of old-school roguelikes will like it. As a fan of both roguelikes and roguelites, I like it quite a bit.\n\nRead my full review at  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com] .","April 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

And I like it, I think it's a lot of fun, it's sort of like a lite Roguelike and a Civilization game rolled up into a bite sized game.\n\nThere are issues that kind of make you feel like you aren't making progress. For starters, there's a "world disaster" event in the game and the count down to it is far too short, you've barely just started playing when it makes itself known.\n\nFurther, any upgrades you make around other towns degrade slowly over time, even with the black smith utility. What makes this frustrating is, there's not really a point to upgrading each "world" unless you intend to spend any extended amount of time there. It feels like wasted resources and can be aggravating.\n\nThe random element of the combat can be frustrating; it's all based on simple dice rolls. And even if you have a ability of 200 and are fighting a enemy with an ability of 30, there's still a chance they'll beat you. There's gear and buffs you can get later on, that add on bonuses to your ability and strength, which helps a lot, but early on, it's a problem.\n\nThe game isn't really polished all that much either. There's been a few glitches I've run into that is really frustrating. The first is that the game is supposed to save after every move, but several times now my save files decided to just delete themselves or become something entirely different. Another issue I've been running into is, suddenly the game just won't let me move or skip any turns. The game is still running, I can open the quest menu, I just can't move.\n\nThe game needs a little more polishing, there's some mechanics that could really stand to be changed and there's a few bugs to squash, but besides that, the game is fairly fun and the price tag isn't bad. Even with the issues I have had, I still can recommend it to like minded players.","April 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

Like the namesake you are guiding your character through multiple generations of questing, monster slaying and loot gathering.\n\nThere's a lot to understand so I'd suggest playing the tutorial. It's a good primer for what you need to do to get started.\n\nHere's a video of the tutorial - (It's probably still loading)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/34i3U4gGKgs\n\nThe way Hero Generations works is you start as a young adult. Each step you take in the world is 1 year and you have a number of years you are expected to live (shown on the right side of the screen). During that time you must build around towns to earn wealth, go fight monsters to gain fame, and ultimately woo some potential mates that have good genetics you can carry over to your children.\n\nAs you age you'll hit a few milestones in your life (Adult, Middle Age, Elder, Sage) ideally you want to mate earlier to get more picks at the gene pool so to speak.\n\nThe mechanics of starting a new generation are one of the unique features of this game that I find enjoyable. Depending on what traits you acquire along the way and those of your mate you'll be presented with a grid of cards, imo these cards represent genes. You pick a certain number of them to design your successor. It's a random mix that is influenced by yourself and the mate you choose and the number of picks are decided by certain traits, what town you're in and the age you are when you settle down.\n\nOnce picked you start over again and continue the legacy to to stop some evil. I didn't find the evil so I don't know what it is exactly. Your goal is to continue building up cities and earning power and wealth over time to eventually make your way to the end game (My first game I needed to get 30k fame in one life and go talk to some guy in the volcano world, I didn't make it =(\n\nI found this game incredibly enjoyable. Trying to min/max the steps I was taking to figure out the best way to collect items. Figuring out that building 3 of the same building around a town changes the town into a special building. There's so much to find (I found a cave the appeared once I had a certain amount of fame).\n\nHere's a video of my first playthrough from start to my untimely demise. (It's Still Loading It's about 90 minutes)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/34i3U4gGKgs\n\nA couple things did bug me though.\n\nThe ability to only carry 2 items hinders the experience of actual exploration considering each step is precious life. It forces you to move to an empty space to drop the item then go back and pick up the other one.\nThis also creates a problem where you'll have multiple items on the ground in the same tile space with no real control over which item to pick up.\nA simple mouse over menu on the right hand side to allow you to select what you want to interact with would be perfect.\nThe RNG with attacking is frustrating as well, when you reach a certain point you will find your self with 100+ strength, so when attacking you roll your strength  against your enemies and it does this from 0. So rolling super low against a monster you should easily beat becomes a bit aggravating.\n\nOverall Hero Generations delivers a different kind of rougelike open world experience. One that I find charming, unique and overall enjoyable.\n\n-Angelo @EAP\n\nFor more Early Access and Indie reviews and bi-weekly podcast check out EarlyAccessPodcast.com and youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","April 12, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get six worlds with a limited amount of towns in such a way that at some point (2 hours into a playthrough, less if you're good) the world will be fully explored with nothing else to do. That was kind of a dissapointment.\n\nThat said, the game would massively improve if it introduced a way to increase the length of the game.

The idea of a year of your life per move is lovely, till you realize you never have time to do anything if you want to gain any kind of bonus's for your next generation. You can spend an entire generation just maintaining towns (as unless you have a late-game building you and your kin are the only people who see the need to invest in towns and maintain them).\n\nThough with active creators trying their best to continually improve it I'd still recommend it with a warning, it's not for everyone. It still has room to grow and it has some downsides (like the combat, I enjoy me some good RNG but I prefer risk to reward rather than just pure risk).","April 17, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I actually really like this game a lot. My advice is to wait 6 or more months down the line when it is really finished.  Please take caution in purchasing this as the save file corrupts which will force you to delete your save and start over again.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QprZ7B6ONwc\n\nUpdate:\n\nTo the developer: I respect what you as a 1 man team has done. I being someone who knows a lot about computer software/engineering know the amount of work that is required.\n\nHowever, I must let my (bad) review stand because of the misjudgement of the timing of the release of the game which was still buggy and clearly a "Beta" version of the game.  It's absolutely inexcusable to buy something that doesn't quite work correctly but then be told that it will later on. Bugs I can live with and updates that better the game are fine but not crashes and freezes.\n\nI will give a deeper review below for those still interested in reading it.\n\nAfter reinstalling the game I tried Hero Generations and found myself again liking the game.  Surely many of the bugs I had pointed out in my review are seemingly gone which is the good news.  The bad news seems to be the "end game".  Around the 15th generation you realize that you have explored all 6 areas and have killed just about all of the "bosses".  Then you ask yourself the question, "Now what?" I went and built up everything after all of the generations and...I feel as if there's nothing left to do once I get there.\n\nThe most frustrating part of the game are the items inventory system.  EVERYTHING requires an item and you can only ever hold 2 at one time.  How can I bear to put down my sword of awesome for a baby when I am about to walk into the volcano of death so that I may place a baby onto an altar?  Now you might say that I can replace said "attack power" by picking up more strength potions and damage potions for my character but that requires my hero to age.  Of course within a certain period of time my character only has a finite amount of years in his/her lifetime and it only becomes a chore to get the "right" combination for hopefully one of my future generations to achieve the goal of simply placing a baby on an altar.\n\nAgain I will say that the game is fun.  I like trying to build up my hero to a certain degree and I love randomly choosing cards at the end of each life to hopefully have a better shot than dear old dad.  The only problem lies in what you do once you receive said thoroughbred?\n\nHopefully this will help future players out there in deciding whether or not to purchase this game.\n\nTLDR: Heroes Generations is a delightful game marred by its lack of end game flair.","April 17, 2015","false","31.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It’s easy to pick up and put back down on whim - sometimes one just wants to vege-out and click, explore a world, and have battles resolved by a quick random number generator (RNG).\n\nEarly in the game you are intentionally exposed to a little fear and anxiety, and a part of that is avoiding battles until you're stronger. Later you get the satisfying feeling of stomping creatures that you earlier feared.\n\nThe game achieves all this in a quick and streamlined way that is dead-easy to pick up and play without an extensive tutorial, and without having to memorise 16 thousand different spells and item combinations.\n\nRNG is only a small part of the game, as a lot of the decision making is based around deciding how much risk to take in combat - do you push your luck and take on a 50/50 chance of success with an evenly matched opponent, or do you avoid those battles until you are powerful enough to ensure that the odds of an unlucky RNG roll are minimal.\n\nIf you're fighting units two thirds your strength you can fairly expect to lose, on average, one in three battles. If you don't like those odds you will need to level your strength up further before taking on those battles.\n\nConsequently, the bulk of gameplay is about boosting your hero's base strength, which is primarily achieved by collecting gold through light questing, and by constructing buildings to generate either more gold, or that provide strength and damage boosts. The buildings you construct mostly accumulate over generations, so eventually you will have put together a small strength and gold generating machine around your core villages.\n\nLoss in combat is a minor annoyance (slightly reducing your lifespan by around 5 'years' (turns) until you need to retire), and the law of averages evens out the occasional unlucky die roll over time.\n\nIt is possible for your lineage to end if you push your luck too far and get caught out in the wilds with only a few years left to get back to a town and find a potential mate. Your lineage can also end in the rare instance that you haven't built up enough fame or wealth to impress a potential suitor before needing to retire.\n\nThe generations system is neatly done, in that you have a choice about whether to do a big rush of exploration and combat with the current hero, or do you retire early and aim to do better next time. The incentive to retire early is that, the earlier you retire the more boosts your son or daughter start with next time. (For what it's worth, the game is pleasantly gender neutral.)\n\nLike many rogue-lites, there is no formal save system as such. Progress is autosaved at the end of each turn and you return to where you left off next time you start the game (select "load game" in the main menu).\n\nIn terms of pacing, the game can hit a dead spot mid-game, where you’ve beefed as much as you’re going to and there is little to do other than random exploring and monster clearing while you wait for building upgrades to unlock (upgrades unlock after a fixed number of generations have passed).\n\nI have had a lot of fun with the game so far, and can see myself dipping in and out off and on in the future. Maps re only semi-random, however, so there might not be quite enough variety here to justify repeated play throughs after the game has been ‘beaten’.\n\nedit: updated review to reflect improvements from recent patches.","April 13, 2015","true","6.3"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","17","35","0","0"

Which makes the bottom portion of the game unviewable and unable to progress after a certain part in the tutorial when I have to click buttons I cannot access.  Secondly, when I try to load a save game it just freezes on the loading screen.  I deleted the save game, started a new game, saved and once again the save was corrupted.

It's an interesting mechanic when applied against average human life expectancy.  There is always an urgency regarding your movement and what you set out to accomplish before going to the nearest town to have your next offspring.\n\nThe end goal of the game centers around how much fame (any particular generation) you've attained during their particular life-cycle.  More or less, fame is your score and you're trying to get a high score, which are reflected against a leaderboard on the main menu.\n\nThese are the basics to the game, which fosters a very tight play-cycle on any particular generation lasting around three (3) minutes on average.  There are methods to increase your life expectancy (which requires either time or luck) but the steady beat of time and unlucky battles widdles away what little life you have.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and learn with only a (optional) five minute tutorial to get you up to speed.  Animations are crude but get the job done.  Scaling up the game window to accommodate your display actually works against the game, especially during the battle sequences which can make the game (visually) seem not fully baked.\n\nAll told, Hero Generations is like witnessing a machine in action.  All of the cogs and pieces have a purpose and fit together perfectly.  But, at least for me, it never went further than a cold, calculated strategy machine and never really addressed the powerful metaphor of how our short our lives can be.\n\nHaving said that, it's still a fun game and I enjoyed it.\n","April 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","8","27","2","2"

Oh! My english is not that good, so it's possible you see some mistakes.\n\nThat said, let's get into the subject. The game has an interesting concept. The mix of "5 Minutes Civilization" as the dev said and the "Rogue-Like" genre, with the mechanic of mating so you can build a legacy make the whole idea interesting. The devs wanted the game to be accessible to everyone, so the game may be a bit simplistic.\n\nWhat is the result?\n\nWell... they managed to do something good, but i'll be honest, it's not the indie game of the month. You start in your village, and go fight monsters, build improvements to nearby towns so when you move on these tiles you get bonus (like more Strength, more Lifespan, Gold, etc.)\n\nYou get quests as you go to other worlds, and you have a main quest too. So, you have your objectives, now it is up to you to find how you are going to accomplish them.\n\nThe fact that they made the game accessible to everyone makes the game way too easy for harcore gamers, or some devoted gamers in general. The casual gamer type will find some fun, or even our kids or just new gamers.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything because there isn't much to discover in the game and it will destroy "the magic" if I tell you everything right now. Let me do a quick Pros/Cons list, so you'll have a better idea about the game.\n\nPros\n___\n\n-Beautifull art-style. Simplistic, but still nice.\n-Nice music. Yeah... it's good.\nNow the real stuff\n-Good mix of genres (Simplistic 4x + Rogue-Like)\n-Friendly game that anyone can play\n-Interesting RPG system with the gear limit (2) , the traits you pass down, etc\n\nNeutral\n---\n\n-Simplistic (i think i said that word a couple times now)\n-Easy\n-The art style, depends on your tastes\n\nCons\n---\n\n-Too easy for the more dedicated gamers (way too easy for hardcores)\n-Doesn't have much content (not enough gear, traits, worlds, monster types)\n-Feel sometimes like a pocket game you would play on a phone or tablet\n-A girl named Bob, a boy named Josephine... -.- Seriously Heart Shaped Games LLC please fix your name generator (sorry for all Female Bob and Male Josephine out there)\n-Only 1 save slot\n-A "Main Menu" button would be nice by the way\n-More screen resolutions needed\n-Fullscreen and Borderless FullScreen is missing\n-What is this volume setting? It's like my phone. Make a slider or something please.\n-Fights are ful RNG based (My hero have 40 Str, my oponent 10, I roll a 6 he roll 8, he wins the fight and hit me with 5 damage, so i lose 5 years of my life)\n-Somehow overpriced (here it's 16,99 CAD$ full price, so i think $14,99 USD. Maybe if it was $9,99 USD (around 11 or 12 CAD), it would be more worth the money.\n\nAnd there is more i'm pretty sure, but i'll stop here because the rest is my personnal opinion, and it doesn't count right now.\n\nI heard this somewhere and I can't find who said that, but it's a very good way to think about games. Each dollar spent on a game should be worth one hour of fun. So in this case, the game must give you at least 15h of good time. Well, even if I found the game to be very easy, I still think  I spent some good time on it, because it was a relaxing experience. Sometimes, easy games are fun, even for more hardcore gamers.\n\nSo, overall, I still recommend this game. But keep in mind that it's a small game for the public. So don't buy it if you want intense combats, deep strategy and complexity. This is really what the devs call it. a "5 Minutes Civilization" with Rogue-Like elements.\n\nThis was Hero Generations.\n\nMy personnal rating: 7/10\n\nWorth buying at: $11.25 USD or less.","April 13, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a cute little rogue-like. My problems with the game revolve around pacing and balance. It is so easy to start a new hero and have 10 turns of "run like a chicken" because you have 1 strength in the early game and are just biding time till the +10 str at adult. Meanwhile by generation 8, I've ended up with my start world having an infinite life-strength-damage-money loop I can run through until I'm bored of it. Said gen8 hero is currently 5000+ years old with 250+ years remaining, 2600+ strength and 100+ damage.\n\nIf the developer does some balance passes, I think I could go to thumbs up with no hesitation.\n\nI haven't seen the balance passes and have had to change my rating to thumbs down.","April 18, 2015","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only play for short stretches of time so in that respect and at it's £5.50 price it's pretty good value and certainly worth a play. I would suggest you watch some Gameplay videos though as I was not expecting the Gameplay to be like it is.\n\nAdded Plus judging from the other Reviews the Devs seem to be pretty good at taking players opinions on board.","November 30, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the time I played, I was frustrated that there didn't seem to be any functionality with the volcano torches, but other than that would recommend for sure.","April 12, 2015","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I found the the main mechanic (aging, 1 turn = 1 year) annoying.\nOnly started to enjoy the game once I rolled a vampire character who was immortal (but required fighting NPCs all the time to sustain life).\n\nHero Generations isn't that bad, just not good enough to recommend.","June 5","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
