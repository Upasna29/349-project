Well... Out of the 10 people who play on the euro servers (we'll get too that)\n-Brilliant for practicing hand eye co-ordination and improving reflexes\n-Unlockables (Basically like hats and weapons in TF2 and CSGO)\n-Good clean maps\n-Very open\n\nCons;\n-The SMALL community, This game needs more players, Many people will be put off with the fact, You'll spend 5 minutes looking for 1 game of deathmatch.\n-The game puts you into games with higher skill groups if there is not enough players\n-If you're coming from source games, The sensitivty is NOT the same, Be careful took me 1 hour just to find the perfect sensitivity, If you're stuck trying to find it if you play source games, Just half what you normally play on, Should work.\n-Needs more maps, Once you play all the maps, It gets repetative\n-The colours are very vibrant, Personally lots of bright red hurts my eyes, So the RED level is really hard for me to play\n-Depending on what colour you put your enemies too, You might not be able to tell them appart from the background\n-Too little unlockables\n-Needs more customization (I'll come back to this later)\n-There should be a counter on the side of each country which say how many people are playing and what gamemodes they are playing, Since I was waiting for a freezetag game for 10 minutes and didn't find one.\n\nMY IDEAS;\n-Add a couter to show how many people are playing on which gamemodes\n-Add a unlockable which lets you design  a laser design (Though make a reporting system aswell, Since people with draw unmature things with it)\n-Like CS;S/TF2 has sprays, I think this game should have a custom logo you can put on your gun which you could draw ingame\n-More gamemodes would be nice, Since everyone just play deathmatch\n-A way too lower graphics for people who don't have good computers, I have a half decent computer and still get 50 fps.\n-A way too make custom maps, Which could be voted on to be made into offcial maps, The more highly rated will appear higher on the page, And a dev can either accept or decline it.\n\nIDEAS FOR NEW GAMEMODES;\nBoss mode - 1v10, Boss can take lots of hits and you can only play boss at a rating higher than a certain amount\nJump mode - Jump maps, Get from point A too B with only rocket jumps.\nMini game maps - Custom maps which have been accepted into the game with devs approval\n\nThese were just my ideas, Hope I was helpful, First time typing something this long. :-D\n","January 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","38","48","5","0"

You can map all of the controls including toggle/hold zooming. You have two separate FOV sliders for general and while zooming (up to 160 degrees) and separate mouse sensitivities for each and separate x/y axis adjustment, and y invert. You can toggle almost all of the visual effects like bloom/vignette, as well as outlines for players and objects. You can control the the color/style of everything from the crosshair, to your in-game name, the enemy and team colors, two level saturation sliders, etc. It has auto contract color picking, and the only thing better I'd like would be per-level enemy color selection. I use a red-pink, and I have to manually switch them to a green or cyan for the red/black level. You can turn off hit decals, force the default beam and death animation for enemies, hide/move the weapon model. It's a ridiculous amount of customization, and it runs great too. It doesn't have a dedicated fullscreen mode, and while that sucks, it's an issue that all Unity devs have to deal with. It starts up, loads, and closes very quickly, and the menus work very well, making mid-match changes very doable.\n\nGameplay\nIt's by far the fastest game I've ever played, and it feels extremely good. I found the zoom function unusable at first because of the static sensitivity, but then I found the sensitivity scaling slider, and it works great. The players are pretty small objects in the environment, so extremely long ranges happen frequently, but the movement is extremely fast and close range engagements happen often so you need a higher sensitivity to do well. So having the zoom and essentially two separate sensitivities, really helps. The sliders are numerical, so you should be able to keep the mouse to screen distance ratio the same at both FOV values, with a little math. I do wish you could disable the death animations of your own player, as certain ones can shoot the camera across the map and I don't find it very appealing.\n\nThe game is rather limited in terms of modes and maps, though a map editor was just announced and one would assume that comes with workshop support. That's good for the future, but at the moment it feels limited. The gameplay is so satisfying if you have a knack for it, but I did have a problem. I played for 2 days without issue, nothing feeling unfair at all, but all of a sudden on the third day, it because quite inconsistent. The player count was at 1600+, vs the ~700 of the two days prior. It could be my connection, and though my ping was only ~30, the game got drastically less fun. The boost (rocket jump) function is essential for quick acceleration which makes you a hard target, but if it outright fails to activate 15% of the time, you die because you stay in place when you should have shot off in another direction. It was much harder to see this, but there were also instances of shots missing randomly at all sorts of ranges. The game was updated without patch notes before I played the 3rd day. I had zero issues in this respect for about 4 hours of play across the two days prior. It could be my connection, it could be the update, it could be the servers, but whatever it is made me not want to play when I loved it the days before. It's so dependent on that speed and responsiveness, that if anything takes it away, the fun is gone.\n\nThere are two things to unlock in the game. One I'm fine with, while the other is problematic. The beam shape and death animations are unlocked via by getting achievements tied to killstreaks, the highest being 3 Monsterkills, which I believe is 6 in a row (not just without dying, but in very quick succession as well). Some of the others are tied to winning x number of the various match types. I mean I'd strive for zero unlocks at all, but these are harmless. Next is customization items for your character, that are given via a random drop system. Thankfully there are no microtransactions tied to it, but I still really do not see the point of it. It limits player choice and expression right out of the gate, and it just gets stupid people to blow $80 on some half-♥♥♥♥♥ textureless 3D model on the steam marketplace. The game is so old-school and consumer oriented in every other aspect, that this one system contrasts immensely in what is a paid title. Better this than microtransactions, but it's needless regardless.\n\nPresentation\nI think the rats are unappealing, and I'd like to toggle off the death animations and gore effects, but the levels and overall visuals are nice. The menus are very basic but work without issue. The levels almost all look straight out of Mirror's Edge and I really like them. I'd love to view them in full color, but the advantages of having the level saturation <~30% are too much to give up when really trying to do well. I will say though that if per-level enemy color and saturation settings were an option, that would be amazing. If you want the most advantage the way it is now, the best option is to go with low saturation, unless you want to manually adjust it before every round.\n\nTLDR - Summary\nAt it's best, I love this game. It feels amazing and nailing awesome shots or streaking is hugely satisfying. That said I would be wary for multiple reasons. If connection problems occur, the fun goes out the window because of the insane skill requirement. I also play on a 120Hz display with ultra-low motion blur enabled, and I'm not sure how well it would really fare without that, again because of the insane speed of everything. Finally, player count could be a real issue at some point. For months before the Free Weekend that's occurring as I write this, the game had less than 20 players. And because of the price it's offered at, I'm not sure how many players will actually buy the game and continue playing after the promotion. It has no single-player content, so unless you have a friend to 1v1 against, you're boned if no one else is online. The game has a 1v1 mode vs a random player, but a tiny pool of players means the ranking system can't really do it's job well and you'll be matched with the same insane player endlessly. I'd more than recommend it on a very cheap sale or bundle because that's sure to bring in some players for a while and the low price means even if you can only play for that week, it's not as much of a let-down as it could be at a more substantial price point. But that's up to the buyer, as some expect an hour of fun for their dollar, while others might want five to ten which is very achievable in the current market. It could use some small tweaks, but most of all I just think it needs a consistent playerbase. It's still early access, so an official release plus an even more substantial sale could very well make that happen. Because of the intensity and limited maps/modes for now it's not really something suited to binge-play, but it's something I could easily see hopping on every day or two for 30 mins to an hour if that was an option.","September 12, 2015","true","7.1"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","1"

Well it is a railgun, instagib multiplayer shooter which incorporates the rocket-jumping mechanic familiar to Quake and Team Fortress 2.\nThe game is surprisingly simplistic; move around and shoot, however a combination of rocket-jumping and the 1-hit-kill railgun create an intense, competitive environment where timing and precision is your key to success.\n\nNot only does Ratz bring back great memories of Quake II railgun battles and Unreal Tournament's instagib mode, it has its own merits—primarily the level of customization which creates a very level playing field and a very personal experience—you are free to individualise almost all aspects of the game from the colour of your railgun beam to the colour of your name, team mates and enemies.\n\nThe newly introduced item drop system is purely based around cosmetics which maintains the balance and integrity of the game.\n\nGame-modes include Team/One man army Deathmatch, Freeze Tag, CTF mode and most likely more to be introduced in future updates.\n\nUpdates seem to be introduced on a relatively frequent basis but at this point, the game looks very much like a finished product:\nClean and colourful UI,\nEcletic map design,\nA plethora of customisation options,\nFluid player movement and extremely stable latency/servers.\nHatz   :B1:These features successfully disguise the fact that it is an early access game and are the reasons why I highly recommend Ratz Instagib!!\n\nSide note: This game truly is a hidden gem and desperately needs more love and publicity from the community and devs, it would be a shame for such a beautiful game to be neglected and go to waste.\n\n*Edit* Don't believe a single thing about this negative review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/btR_/recommended/338170/\n\nEverything he has stated is a lie, there is NO lag, NO hackers, the graphics in the game are so colourful and smooth; it really is beautiful as you can see from the screenshots.\n\nHe was banned for writing a script to pervert the item system of the game and is currently deleting all comments that expose his lies so don't believe a single thing he says. He also downvoted almost all positive reviews for Ratz so that alone tells you how flawed this guy is.","May 16, 2015","true","42.4"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","28","32","4","1"

The first time I played it, I knew it had potential.\n\nThe game is exactly what it says - you're a bunch of rats hopping around playing instagib. There's free-for-all, Team deathmatch, freeze tag, capture the flag, duel and even a little survival mode to mess around on, all using only railguns. The movement feels very smooth. There's railjumping, and bunny hopping is a lot of fun (and the key to success).\n\nAnother thing I feel compelled to mention is the customization in this game. You can almost edit everything from simple graphics options like toggling Bloom and cell-shading on/off, to wall and/or prop saturation, FOV, HUD, enemy colors, your rail color, death animation/fx, and your rat itself with cosmetics. The music plays like a little radio in the corner and you can hit pause to change it at any time you want. The music kind of has that late 90's feel, reminds me of the Dreamcast days. It's awesome.\n\nThe game has a lot of maps for an Early Access game and is getting great support from it's lone developer who is active on the forums listening to suggestions and squashing new bugs rather fast, which is always great. I'm impressed with how far this game has gone and I can definitely suggest this game, especially to those who loved playing instagib mods back in the day.","May 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

I haven't tried freeze tag yet, but everything else is nice, fun, and competitive, the most competitive an FPS can be actually, and it's not just doing matches and winning, there's a skill progression in which the game monitors your skill and ranks you accordingly. There's also unlockables that you can set a goal for to unlock, these unlockables are only cosmetic and will not change the games simple fair and competitive nature.\n\nThe one thing I have an issue with is the same issue I have with any multiplayer game only, and that is it doesn't have bots to sustain the game if there are no players to play it at any given time, so keep that in mind, but it has a game mode in which you can play the game and shoot at things, and that is the survival game mode, it's a solo or coop game made where you (your self or with your friends) go up against a horde of unique (land and flying) enemies where you have to dodge their slow orb-like projectiles, and shoot their core at the center of their bodies, so it's not normal bots of the same type as you with the same weapons, but it's good, requires more precision, and good to play solo or with your friends as coop. It's better than nothing one would say.\n\nFor the asking price, for the fan that I am for Instagib, and for the content that it has and future content that it will have, it's worth it, even more so if they add normal insta-gibbing bots to play with.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","January 21, 2015","true","11.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","23","28","5","5"

The experience was satisfying and great.\n\nIf you enjoy instagib (one hit kill) gameplay, boosting (shooting the ground to shoot yourself upwards), twitch shooting, and an intense, fast-paced FPS experience, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I always try to avoid mentioning the price of a game if I feel that its mechanics make up for any monetary value, however, for the current price ($9.99), the game is more than a finished product for an early-access game. Believe me, you will get your money's worth for this price if you are looking for a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t instagib experience.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good - the levels are nice and bright and colorful. You can customize everything from the color/type of your laser beam, to the type of explosions when you kill an opponent, to the color of your character model (and your opponents'). Personally, I prefer to have the environment in greyscale and the enemy in a bright, pop-out color (red). You can even change the color of your name in-game. When you shoot, it will leave a paintball-style mark in the color of your laser - by the end of the match, the area will look like a paintball battlefield. The music and sounds are very good, especially if you like electronic music.\n\nThe controls are typical of a traditional FPS, however, you will need to get used to the instagib style if you are a newcomer - boosting (shooting the ground to propel yourself) and constantly moving is a necessity to survival. Being able to shoot from a far is also essential (you can play around with the FOV, however, I feel that the max setting is a bit disorienting). Be warned, the instagib community for most games is relentless and unforgiving, so don't be surprised or disheartened if you have a hard time getting kills. From the servers I've played, the community seems very friendly. There is no tutorial, and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games - in particular, with the instagib game mode.\n\nGameplay is extremely fast-paced - you must constantly remain on the move. There are a variety of game modes, like deathmatch and team deathmatch. The online community is fairly small, but still decent - you might not always have a full server. Everyone dies with one hit, and you can shoot across the entire map. Staying mobile, timing your boost jumps, and maintaining battlefield awareness (this is where the high DPI players will get to flex their skills) is critical to doing well in this game.\n\nOverall, the instagib game mode is represented very, very well in Ratz, and anyone interested in that style of FPS should definitely check this out.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","February 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/painis45/recommended/338170/","painis45","Pain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/painis45/","230 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is constructive criticism ONLY. I suggest that everyone try the game for themselves and form their own opinions.\n\n-PROS-\nRatz maps\nInstagib\nSoundtrack\nMultiple Gamemodes\nClear effort was put into this game\nThe devs have actively updated this game and I definetly see them completing it, which can't be said for many early access titles.\n\n-CONS-\nMovement feels absolutely terrible\nCharacters feel weightless (personal con, may not bother you)\nRails inconsistent with objects\nInconsistent boosts\nNo auto team balancing (in Team Deathmatch at least)\nNo way to see pings on players\nSoundtrack (It becomes repetitive and annoying after hearing it for the 20th time)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI bought this game as a veteran of FPS games, growing up with the likes of Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, and Counter Strike when I saw this game I was instantly excited. From the videos here on steam and the reviews it appears to be a great nostalgia stimulating experience which will have you thinking back to "the old days" once again.\n\nAfter watching the steam trailers and looking at the reviews I had somewhat expected it to be a standalone railgun type game on ratz maps.\n\nWhat I got was a game where the movement feels awful, to the point where I'm not even sure if I'll ever touch it again for that main reason. Maybe I've become accustomed to other games styles of movement but something about Ratz Instagib's style of movement rubs me the wrong way. This is something that every player will have a difference in opinion on and has to experience it firsthand to fully understand what I truly mean when I describe it as awful.\n\nYou use your gun to boost in a similar manner to rocket jumping in Quake/UT, that's another huge mechanic that just feels really badly done and would benefit if it was made into a simple double jump/boost maneuver instead. Often times after boosting at an angle to propel myself forward and increase velocity I found myself slowing down instead, that's a huge problem in a game where it only takes 1 shot to kill you. I also at times found myself pressing the boost button only for it not to respond and end with me dead. Boosting is also the main way to get around the map, however there is a jump feature but after many attempts to string together more than a few jumps to gain speed and move around the map I found that it was largely ineffective.\n\nAnother issue would be the fact that rails are inconsistent with objects, quite a few times I was killed by rails that just seemed to magically go right through the object I was dodging my opponent around. I'm not sure if this an intended feature but I'm going to assume not since it couldn't be repeated on a consistent basis.\n\nLooking past these HUGE issues there's tons of little ones that stuck out to me almost instantly. The lack of auto balancing teams in TDM leads to 2v1 situations on a consistent basis which honestly just amazes me that the developers didn't include a key feature like this before putting this up for early access. There is also no way to view current players pings to tell if someone is truly lagging or not, once again something that should be in the game before putting it up for early access.\n\nAnother small issue would be that players just generally feel weightless, this is something that may not bother everyone but I found it to be extremely disorienting after many years of enjoying other similar games.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe entire game needs some real changes so that it will feel solid enough before this game comes out of early access. The boosting feature should also be re-evaluated to see if it can be made more consistent as well as experimenting with the possibility of removing it all together in favor of a better alternative. Adding additional music to cut down on the repetitiveness would be highly advised as well. Overall, the game would be fun to play if they could tighten up the movement and that's the real deal breaker as of right now for me.\n\nI really want to like Ratz Instagib and I intend to try and continue to play it and keep up with the development but I cannot recommend that people purchase this game in it's current state. However that does not mean this game is bad what-so-ever, I'm finding myself enjoying the game a lot even with what I mentioned above. You need to play the game and try it for yourself, cause it's blast. It is currently on sale for $6.02 USD and usually sells for $8.99 USD, I feel that at this discounted price that I have gotten my full moneys worth and honestly would of purchased it at full retail.","May 22, 2015","false","6.0"," 59 of 98 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","59","98","6","2"

Old school insta-gib action. Start the game and and start playing, no long load times, no BS.\n\nPositives:\n-Gameplay is awesome, lag free smooth as hell action. Quick movements like in the old school shooters and if you're a fan of those you will love this game. You can sort of "rocket jump" too with the booster thingy of the gun.\n-Bright and colorful cartoony graphics, which are decent. You can spot enemies easily. The default enemy color works best against almost all the maps but if it doesn't work you can always change the enemy colors from the options menu.\n-Music is EPIC, like one of my favorite tracks in any game.\n-Lots of options to adjust, you can even take your FOV upto 180. You can adjust your beam color, the enemy ratz's colors. Hell you can even customize colors in your name.\n-Ratz fortress 2, introducing hats will please hat lovers like myself. You get random drops like in TF2 but if you don't like them just sell em on the market. Literally free money.\n\n\nNegatives:\n-Despite having lots of game modes like FFA ,TDM, CTF, DUEL etc you will only find players on FFA. The other games are mostly abandoned and no one plays them.\n-Servers are mostly empty. You get some traffic at evenings but i couldn't find a match whenever i tried playing in the day time.\n-Some technical fault with hit registration, i noticed a lot of times i hit the enemy and i hear the hit sound even before they (or someone else) kill me but my kill doesn't count. I am gonna assume that has to do with lag compensation or something like that.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nGet it if you're a fan of old school shooters such as Unreal tournament and Quake. Loving this game these days. I would highly recommend this game.","May 21, 2015","true","22.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

At the same time, Ratz Instagib is almost completely skill-based and your aiming and movement skills (which take months to master, especially the aim) directly determine the outcome of the game.\nThe game mechanics are as simple as it can get: you only have one weapon, the railgun, which is a one hit kill and you can boost in any direction (kind of like a rocket jump) by right clicking. The enemy hitboxes are extremely small and movement is extremely fast, which means that you have to be extremely good at aiming to hit your enemies.\n\nPros:\n+ Very fast paced gameplay\n+ Balanced, competitive gameplay\n+ Partially skill-based movement (you need to get good at keeping your momentum to maintain your speed)\n+ Responsive and smooth controls\n+ Lots of customizations in the options menu (enemy colors, beam color, nickname color, X and Y mouse velocity, and a ton of other graphical options).\n+ Performance is pretty good even though the game is made in Unity. I'm getting ~250fps on a i7-4790k and Sapphire r9 270x running at 1920x1080@120hz.\n+ Multiple gamemodes\n\nCons:\n- Could've used a proprietary engine with better optimization than Unity\n- Could've included non-instagib gamemodes with the standard arena fps weapons and pickups\n- No ability to host a dedicated server\n- No map editor / custom maps\n\nI highly recommend this as it's a lot of fun and also a great aim warm-up for games like Quake.","June 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

I know almost every player's name in this game because they're so limited and I see them everyday.\n\n\nTL;DR\nGet this game on sale or a bundle of some sort, you're lucky if you see any online matches and there isn't enough content to go with so far.\n\nI know this review had a lot of negativity but the game could be fun for you if you got it on a price that wont keep you up at night and if you're lucky enough you'll get drops that gives you back the game's price and more.","October 17, 2015","true","7.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to sit down and have a blast with friends. It's worth full price but if you can pick it up on sale.\n\nOkay, before I talk about the gameplay let me address a few things. First, you play as a colored childish rat that looks like they are trying to take over the world. Second, prepare to either feel like a god or rage more then sith lords that don't get their way. And third, don't play this game without friends, because it's just not nearly as fun w/o a rage buddy.\n\nAlright, first pros:\n- Fast paced\n- Fun movement\n- Lots of items to customize your rat\n- One shot kills\n- Special kills (Head shots, crouch shots, both having different animations)\n- Unlockable beam and frag types\n- Unique game mode Freeze Tag\n- Fun ranking system\n- Ranked play\n- Can customize your name to anything with a rainbow of colors, You can even use " "\n- More that I can't think of atm because this game is just too awesome\n\nCons:\n- Getting stuck in a game with really high skilled players can kill it\n- There are blatent hackers in some games\n- Movement sometimes bugs out\n- No invisible walls to keep you in the map\n- Lava pools suck\n- This game can result in massive amounts of slurs and profanity\n\nOverall:\nThis game is amazing, with only a few friends in a game you can have more fun than most other shooters. The movement is very momentum based and is super fun and fast. Each map feels like it's telling some form of story, and the coloring is amazingly done. This game does a great job of being original and fun, It really does have a good style that not a lot of shooters can pull off now-n-days. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to sit down and have a blast with friends.

I just got done playing my first game...\n\nI started up a random team deathmatch game and as it began it was 1v1 which was surprisingly fun. Maybe because I was winning, but a couple minutes after that was 2v2 and it became a little more competetive and the pace started to pick up. Then before I knew it the room was a madhouse of colors and sounds as it became a 4 vs 4.\n\nPeople (Rats) flying all over the place, tracer rounds streaking across random distant areas then flying across your face, trying to pick out a target in crowd of enemies and allies only to be unexpectedly blown up by someone you didn't know was targetting you the whole time.\n\nI thought this game was going to be fun but I was plesantly surprised as to how much fun. The beauty is in its simplicity. With 1 shot kills and equipment being equal for all players the battlefield stays fair enough to maintain the fun. This game proves that you don't need much to have a blast in an online shooter, which is by far my favorite genere of games. That being said, I expect a certain amount of fun in my FPS and this game delivers.\n\nThe rooms are common place areas however you're the size of a rat so they're huge and with the boost feature (a big jump) you can fly nearly halfway across the map as well as get to all areas of the map. Boost up to the book shelf to shoot the guy on the living room table. Soar over the sofa to snipe the guy under the TV. Never a dull moment.\n\nMultiple game types; Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Freeze Tag (thats a new one), and several others.\nStatistics to keep track of you're K/D ratio as well as double, triple, quadruple kill and 2 more above that.\nSome unlockables like tracer effects and frag type/color.\nChoose the color of multiple items including your gametag.\nAnd there's a decient amount of other ways to customize your gaming experience.\n\nBottom line, it's fun and a great way to kill some time... and rats.","January 21, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

The mechanics are basic but rock solid, can't be faulted in any way, the hitbox is on point meaning no bs, the speed is crazy and the secondary fire on your railgun thrusts you high into the air allowing for fun maneuvering, the maps are well designed, allowing for great flow, it's aesthetically pleasing consisting of a diverse and warm colour palette and gives you a lot of options to customize your game such as changing the field of view, crosshair colour/size/type, character model colours etc. It must also be added that this game has solid netcode, I can play on UK servers from South Africa with hardly feeling any lag.\n\nThe asking price is 8.99$ which is pretty fair in my opinion, especially if you're a massive fan of instagib. This game is currently in Early Access so will be interesting to see the additions they add to this already awesomely fun game.","April 7, 2015","true","10.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","3"

And when I say jumping into games, I mean literally jumping in, once you're in a game, you don't have to wait for any pesky loading screens between level switches, it provides time for voting after a match, and after ~45 seconds has passed for voting you get tossed into another round of great DM instantly.

It's fast-paced but very fair - each player has the same loadout: a perfectly accurate railgun and boost jumps. This is what makes the game so skill-based and competitive: you have to put your training to the test because you won't be getting lucky with any of Counter-Strike or Call of Duty's spray RNG. It's a great way to practice aiming, even if you're not in it for the cosmetics, rating, or high scores.\n\nPositives    Skill and aim-based\nCompletely fair, no RNG\nSix different modes\nCosmetics you can sell for Steam credit\nGreat way to practice prediction, flickshots, reaction\nNo hackers! (yet)\nMouse precision and movement feels very accurate\n\nNegatives    Very little traffic\nHuge variation in skill between players often (as a result of the previous point)\nIf you're new or need help with learning some aspects of this game, I am creating videos at my YouTube channel to help you improve.","October 27, 2015","true","100.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The movement is familiar enough to games like quake while still retaining its own unique style and feel making it seem like it is its own game.\n\nThe customization options are extensive whether it be lowering the saturation of the maps or changing the color of other players models to better contrast against the map to fully modifying your crosshair and removing the weapon model from your screen if need be. The lack of players as of yet means that there is a certain skill gap in most games that coupled with the server latency that can sometimes cause a delay between when you hit someone to when they die although even if just by half a second. This can be excepted when playing on any online game and the developer is very active in the community patching many issues within days of their discovery.\n\nI have enjoyed every moment of my short time in this game so far and will continue to do so. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good instagib feel/challenge and just likes to chill in that instagib zone.\n","February 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itisdare/recommended/338170/","itisdare","Good bye friends.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itisdare/","427 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, listen up. You will either like this game or hate this game. If you enjoy trying to kill people at high speeds while jumping around a map while your enemies do the same YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME! Otherwise, you will probably hate it.\n\nLets talk about the movement. It's fast and it's all over the place, tapping spacebar as you hit the ground will let you bunny hop and if you do that enough times in a row you will be going pretty fast. Add to that a rocket jump like boost by right clicking while looking at a wall or the ground and you will be a 2fast2quick machine. Think of the scout from tf2 and then just give him the rocket jumper. It's that amazing.\n\nSecondly lets talk about the gunplay. You get one gun, a lazer, you can customize it to be whatever color you want and then you just shoot people, it's a one shot kill. This game will beat you up with it too. There are people who are really good at aiming that thing. But for the 100s of times you will die, that one kill you get will give you the best damn feeling ever.\n\nLastly lets talk about maps, there aren't a lot right now, but they are all very unique, my favorite currently being the office map and least favorite being the pool map. They all have ways to gain speed and things that will get in your way and stop you. With that being said though, I would like to see some kind of map creator or something in the future, could be fun.\n\nFinal thoughts: Just get the damn game. If you loved quake and other arena shooters like it, jthis brings in the best parts and just makes it its own game. Seriously though, once you get a taste of the speed and adrenaline of getting that first kill, it will be hard to switch back to games like Call of duty or Counter strike.","January 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

JUST SUGGESTIONS, NOT A FULL REVIEW!\n\nHey, first off love the game! Lots of good things, love the beam and frag types and the aesthetic is awesome, but I've noticed a few things that could be improved upon.\n\n1. In the arena mode 8 players is just too much, I've asked around in 8 player matches and the concensus seems to be 6 players is best. I know it's subjective, but the difference in games between 6 and 8 people is REALLY noticable, spawns become pretty B.S., it's way less feasable to just have a short shootout with 1 (or 2) people, etc.\n\n2. The game needs to let you join an empty server instead of sending you on an empty loop, if you let people sit in that room and jump around (like when you host a server by yourself) and let people join into that matches would happen MUCH quicker, people tend to just leave the infinite qeue after awhile. If we can just spawn onto the map (and maybe eventually get bots in) that would be great. (I realize this was probably done to prevent everyone from getting put into an empty match when there's partially full ones available, but since the games pop is currently so low it should join you into a match after it's gone through the full server list.)\n\n3. The rank system needs to account for people who joined the match late, if you join in the last half of the match you still get rank points based on your position as if you'd been there the whole time.\n\n3. The red map with the big pool just doesn't seem to play that well in my experience, the map doesn't really feel cohesive, the area in the middle is ok (if a little crowded and chaotic) but the outer area has a lot of wasted space that means you have people sniping from a far distance, and if they try to get closer they're kindof penalized cus they have to go pretty straight to get back to the middle, giving the people in the middle a slight advantage.\n\nTechnically I haven't noticed much wrong, in a few hours of play there was one instance where the server stuttered for a second or so, but nothing since or previously, probably just a one off thing. It would be nice though if clicking onto another monitor accidentally didn't automatically minimize the game. Capturing the mouse would be another way to fix this.\n\nThanks again for the great game! Loving it so far.","January 26, 2015","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am now a 36 year old shooter, shooting at rats capturing rats and putting them in my own bag of rats. Don't believe any of the reviews they are just trolls, this review is NO troll. Play this game it will inspire you also to make you do whatever you wanted to do in your life. Thank you Eat Create Sleep. You really made me a real shooter, shooting at rats, I have captured over 300 small rats and 100 medium rats and only 35 large rats. I have roughly 1,000 rats in my bag of rats and I feel like I can sell them and become a millionaire. I'm now a millioniare and I'm still a shooter, shooting at rats. More to this game is that it's a real motion game that you can play day and night 24/7 everyday. I feel like writing a story now about my life and how Ratz Instagib made me a real shooter, shooting at rats and how I became a millionaire. I also like how you have to shoot the rats and their gibs are just insanely violent. I used to play World of Warcraft every single day but once I saw this game and I instantly played it for days and days. My hours on this game isn't real I have over 1000 hours in this game.

There isn't much more to it, as it states in the name you are a rat and you have a gun that instantly gibs them when you hit them. it takes place in regular human buildings like offices, trains, living rooms, pools, etc. but the catch is that you are the size of a rat! it takes a level that would be way to small for people to battle it out in, but is huge to a rat. this is truely a great game just to kill some time if you are into blowing ratz up with an instagib railgun the can boost you up into the air to completely anihilate them. i love this game. if u got a few spare bucks. would recommend","February 18, 2015","true","24.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But now Ratz Instagib is here!\nIt is well.. Instagib at its finest. Meaning one shot kills with fast paced action and aerial controls.\n\nThe Controls are very responsive, which is absolutely necessary for arena shooters.\nAnd it feels really good if you frag someone..\n\nEspecially with customisable frag types, beam types and colors.\nAnd boy is this game colorful. Every map has its own color scheme which can also be costumized.\n\nRatz has a insane skill ceiling, unlike most modern shooters. If playing on an insane level against opponents of your caliber is something for you, then you'll like the anked mode.\n\nThe gamemodes include: duel (1vs1) deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, freeze tag and survival where you and your team shoot your way through waves of different monsters for a global highscore.\n\ntl:dr\nIt's is THE fast paste Arena shooter to look out for now, revitalising the instagib genre.","January 21, 2015","true","50.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ratz Instagib is a potent little game about you controlling rats and fragging other rats with your insta-kill railgun. Awesome drum and bass soundtrack curated by Jazzsticks, even though I'm a metal aficionado and don't normally prefer the genre - it gives both a frantic and relaxing feeling at the same time.\n\nMatches are incredibly fun and fast-paced. A dedicated rocket jump feature adds another dimension to it - jump and make crazy moves dodging your opponent's shots while shooting them back. One of the most recent implementations are tradeable and marketable cosmetic equips that can be used to customise your rat.\n\nWhile the basic game mechanics are great, Ratz however needs more players and more servers though. At times it can be hard to find a match, and when one is found, I've lost quite a few kills due to high ping, living on the wrong side of the world. (Incidentally, I'm not using that as an excuse for my poor play - I do suck. This ping issue just makes it worse for me.) The Japan server is practically barren - Australia would probably be a good choice for adding more servers for Asian people.\n\nStill, this is an infinitely better game than another Rats game on Steam which I shall not name here.\n\nGame Status: Early Access as of 18/05/2015. This review will be subject to changes should there be anything significant.\n\nRecommended: YES/No\nAnother game best with friends - buy a four-pack, share the spare copies.\n\nLike indie games?

You have given me many fits of bashing my keyboard, throwing my mouse and shouting ♥♥♥♥ at my computer friends. Yet somehow you are still one of the most enjoyable and overall fun games I have played in years. Despite this game being in early access, it is a more solid concept than nearly any game out there. You simply point at enemy and shoot. its so frustratingly simple and hard. I have ended up buying this game for many friends, and will probably buy it for many more.

The gameplay is very smooth, and I love the feel of the high movement speed given to all players. It goes very well with the maps which are just rooms that the player sees in a larger perspective because they're playing as a rat. I feel that it's a brilliant idea, actually. Something that I get annoyed with in most first-person-shooters is registry. The railguns in this game (which are the only guns) always kill with one shot, and I feel like I can fairly except that when I did not hit an enemy I missed and the registry isn't absolute ♥♥♥♥ (*cough cough* CS:GO). The game is easy to run with graphics that aren't ugly but aren't outstanding. The game looks very clean, but it just doesn't have enough detail. The game also lacks content, and by content I mean gamemodes, maps, weapons, customization, etc. Another thing that it lacks is player count. There unfortunately aren't many people that play Ratz Instagib at the moment, and many of the few that do are insanely skilled. Sometimes I will hop on and see that there are literally zero players currently playing on the NA servers, and then when there are those players are most of the time gods. If the developers added more content and if more people played this game, it would be a masterpiece in my eyes. Currently it's not worth the money though. Anyway, I still enjoy it.\n\nI give this game a rating of 7/10.","December 14, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

The map looks like a normal room but super-sized, so the players seem like tiny rats in comparison.  The admins would turn gravity super low, and everyone would frantically bounce around and shoot each other.\n\nThis game is basically that, but with the "frantic" dial turned up to 11:\nThere are no places to hide (and also you're bright neon so you're easy to spot)\nEveryone dies in one hit\nYou get an 'air-puff' gun allowing you to shoot yourself into the air, or shoot it at the wall behind you and bunny-hop (which is also much easier in this game) crazy fast.\nIf you're not playing with friends, this will probably be mediocre fun unless you're crazy good at FPS games or don't mind being completely destroyed by godlike players.  But if you are playing with friends, this is a fantastic competitive game.

Of course the 1000 ranking people are going to dominate the game. This will also turn new players away from the game.\n*Map design: Current maps are way too open. You can basically pixelclick anyone from anywhere.\n*Spawnpoints: They're horrible. You'll often find yourself spawning on top of another player in the beginning of matches. Throughout the match you will spawn in, take two steps forward and get shot in the back by the player that just spawned behind you.\n*Spawnprotection: Why does this game have this?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanith/recommended/338170/","stanith","Stanith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanith/","152 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo begin with I'd like to start with saying that I'm giving this game an overall positive review, however I do think it could do with some improvements (that's what  Early Access is all about, right?) and polish.  I'm a huge fan of instagib (from Quake 2/3/Live, UT etc) and really want games like this to succeed!\n\n- Colour scheme/art style/visuals:  I think it could really do with some work in this area.  Sometimes it's hard to pick out players amongst the various colourful effects, decals etc.  I don't think it's an impossible problem to solve, just some minor changes to the colour palette used for players versus what's used for effects could help, or possibly the use of a different outline shader (edit: I'll admit I haven't played around with the graphics options available here which might solve this, but if that's the case then perhaps the defaults could be improved).  In regards to the overall visuals, I think it could do with some polish... while I appreciate the oldschool style of the frontend/HUD some of it clashes quite badly and makes my head hurt!  The characters themselves also look quite rigid at the moment, again just polish needed there with the animations.\n\n- Hit registration:  There appears to be a bug here, sometimes you'll hit someone, get the ding noise and they'll flash white but they won't die.  It isn't because their hit registered first, because you don't die either... it's simply some weird inconsistency between the client and the server it seems.  Upon mentioning it on the server chat other people all said they experienced the same thing in the same game.  I'm sure this will get fixed, but for the time being it's a little annoying when it happens as you feel robbed of a kill (though it's possible you simply didn't hit them on the server).\n\n- Movement mechanics:  I'm in two minds about this one, to be honest I find it a little too floaty for my liking... though the boost mechanic (rocket-jumping with your gun essentially) is interesting and adds some depth to the movement (I'm terrible at using it though).\n\n- Matchmaking/Servers:  Currently there isn't proper matchmaking, undoubtedly due to the small playerbase right now (as the game isn't Free to Play this isn't surprising).  That said, I've not had a problem finding a regular deathmatch game yet.  An issue this does introduce though is that you can get stomped by the players that have played the game for a while, however they all appear to be very friendly and happy to sit out of matches so others can have fun.  Don't let this put you off buying or playing this game, as there are plenty of noobs just like you and I.\n\nOverall it's a nice idea, a game dedicated to instagib is definitely something I'm happy to back!  Whether it's worth the price of admission depends on how much of an instagib enthusiast you are and whether you're happy to support a developer making a game in a genre you love.  I look forward to seeing how this game evolves and I'm happy to update this review as it does.","March 1, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The result is a simple yet highly effective end product that's fun because of the core gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is a variation of instagib deathmatch where your rail gun has a secondary rocket jump fire mode, & you have full air control ala Painkiller/CPMA. Despite being in early access, the game already has enough content to be considered as a full game. There are 6 modes: DM, TDM, CTF, Freezetag, Duel & a co-op wave based survival mode which isn't very good unfortunately, as well as over 10 maps.\n\nFor $5, I highly recommend this game, 7/10.","September 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're highly mobile, and you must go face to face against your enemies. The beams in this game are instankill, and they travel incredibly fast. They WILL hit you, unless you keep moving. It's simple, yet effective. Sadly, this game REALLY needs more players, I am lucky if I find a server with 5 players in it.","December 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a very smooth, simple concept and easy to pick up and start playing. However, you do need to have good aim, if you want to really get into it and become better. You point at guy, shoot guy, and guy die. Easy as that. I picked it up while it was on sale for $2.24, but it is definitely worth $9.00. Although it is still in early access, it has a TON of potential, and is great with all of the content it already has right now.","February 6","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/338170/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRatz Instagib is a very fast-paced, FPS Arena game, where the object is to kill the opposing team as quickly as possible. Visually you play from the perspective of a rat or mouse, so the levels look like rooms of buildings or houses, but everything is jumbo sized. I think the appeal of this game is it's simplicity: One shot, One kill. Currently there are 13 different Maps, but from what I've read they do have a map editor so people may actually be able to create their own maps. The game does a good job of balancing the PVP, if someone leaves or joins, each round the game auto-rebalances, which makes it better than some high end FPS games, which allow unbalanced teams. I thought it was fun, though I only played it for a short time, just enough to get a feel for it. If you like FPS Arena styled PVP games and want something fast-paced, Ratz Instagib has that in abundance.","September 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","4"

And the ranking system is a bit f#*ked up. I get matched against players with 500 and more points. Even players with 150+ points are way better than I am so it's not really a "skillbased matchmaking". :(\n\nBut I do recommend the game.

Or should I say physics? Actually, in this case I'll go with both at the same time, because it seems like this time around the physics and controls got together and decided to get drunk off their ♥♥♥ because neither of them act quite right and they become kind of unbearable to be around.\nIf you manage to jump high enough, or wall climb, it can take a rediculous amount of time to finally get your feet back on the ground.\nNow this could be argued back with the point that you have tons of air control, but this is also an issue.\nYou shouldn't be able to make sharp 180 degree turns while catapulting yourself at breakneck speeds through the air.\nAt that point, the game essentially becomes a competition to see who can get highest in the air, get the best vantage point, and use the walls to consistently levetate at said altitude.\nIt breaks the flow and destroys one of the biggest factors of an "ARENA SHOOTER".\nI feel like the game should be urging me to thrust myself through the air and be bunny jumping through courses, but I've only found that to lead to death in this game.\nIn a good arena shooter like Quake, movement is key, and you need it to survive.\nBut this game taunts you by dangling the gameplay in front of your face, then slapping you when you finally reach to do it.\nOverall this game is a good effort, and a good concept, but it's executed so poorly that I feel that it isn't worth the money. Not now, not ever, because this game has sailed so far from the original concept that the search teams went missing.","August 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

But if you're looking for a chicken and mushroom puff pie recipe YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE :D\n\nLet's get started!\nIngredients:\n-1 tbsp vegetable oil\n-8 skinless boneless chicken thighs\n-8 rashers smoked streaky bacon, cut into large pieces\n-1 onion, halved and sliced\n-250g pack baby button mushrooms\nhandful thyme sprigs\n-2 tbsp plain flour\n-400ml chicken stock\n-200ml milk\n-500g pack fresh puff pastry, or frozen and defrosted\n-1 egg, beaten\n\nMethod:\n1. Heat the oil in a large, non-stick frying pan. Season the chicken to taste and fry for 5-8 mins until golden brown, turning occasionally. You may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Lift the chicken onto a plate and tip the bacon into the pan. Fry for 5 mins until crisp. Add the onion, mushrooms and thyme, then fry on a high heat for another 3 mins until the onions start to colour.\n2. Tip the flour into the pan and cook, stirring, for 1 min. With the pan off the heat, gradually stir or whisk in the stock, followed by the milk, then add the chicken back to the pan. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins. Spoon the filling into a large pie or baking dish (approx 20 x 30cm) with a lip and leave to cool.\n3. Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. On a floured surface, roll the pastry to the thickness of two £1 coins. Cut a long strip as wide as the rim of the pie dish and, using a little of the egg, fix to the edge of the pie dish. Brush with egg, then lift the rest of the pastry over the pie, using the rolling pin to help. Gently press the edges with your fingers and trim with a sharp knife. Brush lightly with egg to glaze, then bake for 30 mins or until the pastry is risen and dark golden brown.\n\nThis recipe was brought to you by Good Food magazine","November 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","2"

Think UT2004 Instagib, but with more Quake like movement that has lots of air control. I sucked horribly at first, but this is one of those games I try to get better at. I started changing my mouse grip and sensitivity (lowering it) and googling what the pros do. The more I play this game, and better I get at other shooters! I just get into a mode with this game. The drum and bass soundtrack really soothes the nerves! It can be zen like sometimes.\n\nYes people do still play. There's a range of skills and I often finish in the top 3. If you are getting recked hang in there and ask for advice. People are pretty friendly. Feel free to add me.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game runs on Unity, which doesn't have the most responsive mouse control (compared to Unreal 2.5 or idtech 2), but other than that it's silky smooth. It's stripped down and pure, but still in an artistic sense.

You are unlikely to find an open lobby on off-times, and B.) You are going to get matched up with people way above your skill level. And before you say "you just gotta learn the game/its a high skill ceiling" No. Just no. Granted there is a lot of skill involved in this point and click adventure but 90% of the games you will play are free for all, I never saw an open duel lobby.

Simple & addictive. Great jazzy soundtrack. You just have to give it an hour or maybe two, then you start racking those frags.

Its a one hit wonder battle. You get hit, you die, you respawn, hit the jerk that hit you, they die, they respawn, do it again.\n\nWith plenty of options for game modes, current and future, this game has peaked my interest and has me looking toward the future. With how fun Freeze tag is, I can't wait to see what game modes are next.\n\nNot to mention the soon to be Map Editor, The number of maps is only limited to the player's creativity and whether it will have a community work shop page or not.\n\nPersonally my favorite is the items. This is where you say "But wait, you said there are no unbalanced BS items!" I did. Doesn't mean their aren't items at all! These items are just to personalize your character and make them look cool. I currently am rocking the plunger hat myself. The customizability doesn't stop there. You get to pick your laser color, laser pattern (when you unlock achievements), death animations (also when you unlock achievements) what your enemy's color is, and your teams color. Everyone will see the game differently, but you'll always know who your team is because you picked it!\n\nAs an early access game, I most certainly have high hopes for what Ratz Instagib will bring to the table. Nice job!","September 14, 2015","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really nice price however not worth it when free games (not free to play) like Unreal Tournament are well, free, have tons more content, have better instagib and look far prettier.\n\nPros:\n+Highly customizable\n+Simple graphics suit gameplay\n+Fair price\n+Nice amount of game modes\n\nCons:\n-Very low player count means finding a game is hard enough, but finding one without lag is impossible\n-Not worth it when there's better, free games with instagib included out there\n-Low map count\n-Maps are all extremely similar. Huge room, small players. At least the title didn't lie\n-Gibs aren't at all satisfying\n-Bots aren't great and you can't earn stuff by playing against them\n\nSound: 4/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nContent/Replayability: 3/10\nOverall: 4/10\n\nDon't bother getting it. It may be good, but with such little content and better options for free it just isn't really worth it.\nDo yourself a favour. Download Unreal Tournament or even buy one of the older ones on Steam if you want.

The game is a pile of nothing at the moment. The mechanics are that of a generic fps with a glossy filter applied over everything. You shoot people, thats it. The music is that of someone dicking around in FL Studio. Not Impressed.

This is essentially a slick shareware knockoff that might be suitable if you didn't want to expose your kids to terms like, "frag."\n\nIt's pretty novel, but that wears off pretty quickly. This is literally just a distilled generic 90s arena shooter with weird plasticky mice and rats. Might work well on tablets? Oh, one difference: there seem to be cosmetic unlocks, like sombreros and clown noses, for the Ratz characters.\n\nIt looks like they may already need to consider investing in anti-cheat software as well -- or at least open up a spectator mode, as the game breeds a lot of questionable hits by it's incredibly twitchy nature.\n\nEdit: A couple more things worth nothing: There is no collision detection between players -- you're bunny hopping through ghosts.

The game also comes with a cosmetic system so as you play you earn cosmetic items to customize your character with.

Would be great to play with friends. With a large playerbase I'm sure it would do great.\n\nBut,\nI would not say its worth 9 dollars.\nIn my complete opinion, it should just be a free to play game.\nThis could of had the potential to be a really great game with a decent player base, but since you do have to pay for it, it's not going to last long. Without a good enough size playerbase there won't be as much enjoyment unless you are insanely great at the game dominating every round.\n\nI had a great experience playing the game on the free weekend.\nI had to get off after getting stomped by someone who was REALLY good, and honestly it just killed the fun a bit.\nThis has nothing to do with the game being bad.\nBut, soon this game will have their amount of players who was like this one person, getting 50 kills in a single game with a 50 percent accuracy rating. And it will not be fun for new players trying to get into the game and they will want to refund the game.\n\nIf the game was free then the playerbase would be more saturated and you wouldn't have this problem as much, and even if it did happen for some new players, they can just try again another time or join another match.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't try to make money. Yes it is a great game and everyone wants to get their share of money now-a-days, but paying for the game itself doesn't need to happen. You could have microtransactions in the game - and this does not mean making it pay to win, that is the worst possible thing. Add things that will make players stand out, make their names colorful or something, idc. Small things like that that doesnt change the gameplay but for the players enjoyment. If the game is good enough, it will get the microtransactions from the fans. But you will be missing out on a lot of those fans with an initial buying cost.\n\nYes, it is ONLY $9. But that still causes people to not want to look at it.\nAnd from a developer standpoint or a fanboy standpoint you should never look at it as "Oh well it is ONLY 9 dollars. Everyone has that." Some people don't. A lot of the target demographic for this game that you will get are kids, and kids don't have credit cards to put in. Yeah they can ask their parents but, come on, are they really going to go through the hassel for this game? I admit looking at it, I thought it wouldn't be that great. It is a game that you have to experience first hand to realize the enjoyment.\n\nBut this is all from my personal standpoint, and I'm just fairly disappointed that it won't be a free to play title, cause I think it could have done fairly well. I wish you the best in the future of the game.\n\nTL;DR - I like this game, I really do. But it should be a free to play game.","September 12, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

First off.\n\n-No tutorial\nYou can spend your first ten minutes figuring out how to boost jump, bunny hop and air strafe in a deathmatch because the devs can't be bothered to tell you.\n\n-No "beginner" games\nCompletely inaccessible to people who want to learn the game. Every deathmatch game has three xXx_Mlg_Noscopers_xXx and a bunch of other semi decent or complete noob players. Those three people proceed to topscore the match, ending it in around 4 minutes because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Score limit" that allows them to do so. Because nobody plays competitive mode and these people can't be bothered to wait the five or so minutes it takes to find a match, they ruin games for newer players.\n\n-Poor level design\nThe maps in this game don't fit the game. Everything is very low to the ground, so breaking line of sight is almost impossible because of boost jumping. Giant firing ranges where you can get sniped from the other side of the map.\n\n-Terrible afk system\nAfter every match, the game asks you to type in three chosen letters to make sure you're not afk. This sounds good at first, but the problem is that sometimes it glitches out, not allowing you to type in letters and then you get kicked from the game. It's very frustrating.\n\nTL;DR Do not buy this game unless you are already extremely good at games that are exactly this game.","December 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","4"

Why cant the game just be a skilled based shooter?//???/...... BOOST JUMP.... It completely ruins this game... The majority of people you see are just flying around the maps. In gamemodes like Capture the Flag, boost jumping shouldnt even be allowed because these people who have mastered the boost jump will end a game in LESS THAN A MINUTE... Its broken and shouldnt be in the game.. Why couldnt you have just added sprint?.. The boost jump mechanic is dumb and completely ruins this game. Even though the boost jumpers 98% of the time are bottom fraggers its still annoying as hell when all theyre doing is flying around... Game would be MUCH more enjoyable with a sprint mechanic OR just fast movement over this cheesy boost jump.. Its sad because I probably would spend a good portion of my life playing this game as it IS A SKILLED BASED SHOOTER, but the boost jump completely kills it for me. I hope the devs will be happy with their 16 players that will stay with this game. Could have really been something but, you ruined it. If you want to keep the boost jump mechanic atleast make it to where youre not going Mach 15 when youre in the air for ♥♥♥♥s sake -_-\nAnd before you think that "im just bad", ive only played like 4 matches and have already got 30 double kill achievement, 10 triple kill achievement and I think 100 kills achievement. The boost jumping is just annoying as hell and really serves no purpose other than getting quick flag caps in CTF (which shouldnt even be allowed and again is completely BROKE for that gamemode) or getting around a map quickly which serves no purpose at all in TDM as the maps are small.. It takes 5 seconds to WALK from 1 teams spawn to the enemies team spawn so why is boost Mach 36 speed jumping even needed????? This game should be renamed to BOOST SURF because thats what 80% of the players are doing in the game. It has nothing to do with getting kills.","September 11, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

Of course a $5 game is expected to be kinda bad but this has no point in my judgement, you have mice fighting ratz with lazer beams?

The game is "not" worth it unless you're ok with children spamming chat and also there is no way to use a mic in the game so most of the time you have teamates that are running around thinking they are doing something when they should be focusing on teamwork since most of it is team based games like "Freezetag and capture the flag".

But, with that being said there are several issues I have encountered while playing it that can prove very annoying overtime.\n\nThe first thing that I have encountered is very unbalanced games that being first timers will be thrown into games with guys who play almost every day. This although, maybe a result of a low player population.\n\nThis leads to me second issue; there is a low player population which means that the game is unplayable at certain times of the day.\n\nNow you can join foreign servers, which leads me to my next point, the lag compensation is terrible in this game. Basically, what I mean it the more you lag the more impossible it is to hit. This is because instead of normal games where the lagger sees everyone else jumping around the game compensates it and causes everyone to appear to be standing still while the lagger can take numerous hits without being killed.\n\nThe processing of hits is another issue I encountered while playing this game, that being sometimes you can shot someone and it will not process. That being the person will have the normal white outline/flash around them when hit, but then instead of exploding they turn around and shot you.\n\nThe final issue I have encountered within the game itself is the item reward system is completely broken. For example, I have had several times where I landed on a epic item, and instead get a common. When telling others about, I find out they landed on a common item and got an epic instead.\n","May 26, 2015","false","22.7"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

Fans of Quake and the like need to get this. There is only one gun in the game, which is essentially a railgun that can rocket jump, and you die in one hit. Variety might be a problem in the future, but for now, I'm having a blast. (1v1ing friends is hilarious.)","February 7, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quichie/recommended/338170/","quichie","Quiche Robbery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quichie/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing. If you're a hardened FPS veteran, or even a newbie, you will definitely enjoy this game.\n\nFirst off, I have never played any Quake or Unreal games so I'm very new to the FPS sub-genre that Ratz occupies, so this game was completely new to me. But boy, what a breath of fresh air it was!\n\nFirstly, the graphics. Never have I seen a game with such simple, but at the same time, elegant graphics. Having such simplistic graphics not only makes the game look nice and modern, it also helps you spot the enemy rats that could be lurking around the corner, just waiting to shoot you.\n\nSecondly, the level of customisation in this game is astounding. You can customise your FOV so you can either be like a Quake pro or have a Call of Duty-esque FOV (like me). But that's not all: you can also customise your laser colour, type, enemy colour, gibs, crosshair and team colour. You can also disable the ingame music, so you can add your own heart-pumping music to suit your playstyle.\n\nAlso, the gunplay is very barebones, but at the same time very fun and enjoyable. Everyone gets the same, beamshooter gun, which means that no one is every at an advantage over another player and therefore who gets the kills is determined purely by player skill rather than a weapon advantage. Also, if you're familiar with TF2 or other games where shooting rockets at your own feet is beneficial, you'll LOVE this game. The beam jumping in this game is so fluid (even at a high ping) that you'll be impressed by the mobility you can achieve with your beamshooter. WIth the jumping, you can constantly strafe around the map, but you can also reach strategic map positions that can help you gain an advantage over your enemies.\n\nThe maps in this game all have their own unique style and I've also noticed that they all seem to have a different colour palette. For example, one map may be predominantly green coloured, while another could have mostly red tones. All maps which I've played seem to have a good balance between stratergy and fun. Although some maps are definitely more enjoyable than others, in the end, no matter what map is chosen, you should have a blast playing.\n\nFinally, the gamemodes. Due to a lack of players :(, I've only been able to play deathmatch so far, which is enjoyable even in its own right. The other gamemodes are classic staples: you have duel, capture the flag and survival. I can't really talk about these modes since I've never played them, but according to other people they are great fun to play.\n\nOverall, this is an excellently-made game that excels in all aspects of its design. From the gunplay, to the customisation, you should have an excellent time playing Ratz!\n\n","February 7, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it's basically Quake Instagib with simplified movement, it actually works very well. The amount of speed combined with twitch reaction and accuracy gives this game a slight learning curve and a competitive atmosphere. The game comes with its title fitting maps, super big levels designed after bedrooms, classrooms, pools, and more. The game also features a few different game modes, but they're a bit pointless since there aren't many players playing this game. That's why you should buy this game; Help build its player base, I'm certain there will be more maps and game modes to play in the future.

(there are three servers, US, EU, and Japan, each server has multiple games within it). If you don't live near the servers, you will have to play with a higher ping, I live in the western US and I have a ping of 100 to the US server.\n*occasionally, especially if you have a higher ping, shots will hit client side and give you a "ding" hitsound, but you won't get the kill because the server didn't recognize your shot as a hit.\n*you will get destroyed for the first few hours of playing, but you will improve quickly.\n*lack of variety, 1 shot 1 kill railgun gameplay only, you will not have any other weapons.

Mouse movements are responsive, with enemies getting killed in ways you know for sure they did. The boosting mechanic allows for great wall-hopping which can make for some spectacular air-shots on enemy players who prefer the ground. Customization options for players, the HUD and maps are nice as well.\n\nRatz Instagib's soundtrack is a bit too soft for this game in my opinion, but it can suit the game well in several moments. If you want a game soundtrack that fits this game more I'd try out Cube 2: Sauerbraten's songs as they're in the metal category. The game runs solid with over 190+ FPS on my setup and I've never experienced any lag issues on my own end.\n\nRatz Instagib is exactly what I want from a rail-gun arena shooter and more. Give it a try even if you're not too sure about the name and looks as I'm sure you'll have fun. There's even a survival mode against robots if you don't want to fight against enemy players.\n","September 10, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing that can really be done about this, and that's a real shame. Basically, if you wanna play this game, stick to Non-Ranked, or Deathmatch.

In addition to being well-balanced and fast-paced, enemies are easy to see, the maps are skillfully created, and the gameplay is so much fun.\n\nDon't let the "Early Access" label fool you - the core gameplay is absolutely solid. The Early Access label only refers to parts of the game such as the Map Editor not being done yet.\n\nSomething I really love about this game is the customization. You can customize everything from FOV to player model colors to crosshair style/size/transparency/color to name color. You unlock accessories for your players as you play, too.\n\nIt has different game types - FFA, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Duel, and even (to my surprise and enjoyment) Freeze Tag are all here.\n\nIf the very word "instagib" makes you recall fond memories of past arena shooters, play this game.  If you like fast-paced movement and gameplay, play this game. If you've never played instagib and don't understand why I'm so excited about this game, do yourself a favor and play this game.\n\nI highly recommend it.","September 11, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is one of the most played game modes in those games and Ratz takes that uber popular game mode and turns it into its own game! Ratz reminds me of an old game in particular called world of padman. You basically fight as a very small character in a huge house/ building themed arena. This game looks great and is a very good idea but it has one major issue that really really bothers me as an arena shooter lover and that would be the mouse... It is horrible. The mouse seems to be network dependent and also smoothed by default. I can only describe it as feeling laggy and sluggish or un-responsive. It makes you feel like your mouse is made out of Jello or something like that. In a game of Quake I can hit anything with a railgun but in Ratz I always manage to overshoot the enemy. The experimental mouse controls help well but it still can become laggy. If they fix the mouse I would give this game a thumbs up but other than that this game is golden.","February 6","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I agree this is very much like Quake, maybe a little too much. Firstoff, if you have played any other arena FPS don't play. I miss all of my shots because of gravity. Players float and do weird aeronautic tricks, somehow defying gravity. Thats right, you fall slower by twisting and turning like a deathrun game.\n\nThere is no ping monitor. So I don't know if I bad because lag, or because someone is hosting and has 0 ping, which is very very helpful.\n\nCharacter movement is very messed up. Its like a flying game but you have 3D landing gear. Most high jumps are made off of your gun blast. And Gravity like I said earlier is different than any other game I have played. In most games gravity is a Parabola, which is a U or n shaped graph well, in this game it is a line. You don't compinsate for falling distance or time, it's just falling at the same rate.\n\noverall, I feel like this game is Free-to-Play material.\n6.5/10","September 10, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mouse movements are responsive, with enemies getting killed in ways you know for sure they did. The boosting mechanic allows for great wall-hopping which can make for some spectacular air-shots on enemy players who prefer the ground. Customization options for players, the HUD and maps are nice as well.\n\nRatz Instagib's soundtrack is a bit too soft for this game in my opinion, but it can suit the game well in several moments. If you want a game soundtrack that fits this game more I'd try out Cube 2: Sauerbraten's songs as they're in the metal category. The game runs solid with over 190+ FPS on my setup and I've never experienced any lag issues on my own end.\n\nRatz Instagib is exactly what I want from a rail-gun arena shooter and more. Give it a try even if you're not too sure about the name and looks as I'm sure you'll have fun. There's even a survival mode against robots if you don't want to fight against enemy players.\n","September 10, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(there are three servers, US, EU, and Japan, each server has multiple games within it). If you don't live near the servers, you will have to play with a higher ping, I live in the western US and I have a ping of 100 to the US server.\n*occasionally, especially if you have a higher ping, shots will hit client side and give you a "ding" hitsound, but you won't get the kill because the server didn't recognize your shot as a hit.\n*you will get destroyed for the first few hours of playing, but you will improve quickly.\n*lack of variety, 1 shot 1 kill railgun gameplay only, you will not have any other weapons. It's just instagib.\n\nOverall 9/10\nEspecially for early access, this game has excellent gameplay and almost no big problems to speak of.

I am in the LA area, and every game I had between 300-400 ping. Already exceedingly high, it makes a fast twitch game like this close to unplayable. I understand this is in early access, so hopefully something will be done about that.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy the game, here comes the review:\n\nWell now I feel stupid. I have 80 ping now. I forgot that I was trying to download Witcher 2 at the same time. GGm8. 80 ping. West coast servers are fine.\n\nPros:\n\nCasual or Competitive\nUnlockable features(skins, etc.)\nThey have an elo system, which in my book, makes every multiplayer game 1.5x better.\nFast-Paced action+plenty of maps+lots of mobility= great game with a high skill ceiling\n\nCons:\n\nBare;  not alot more than the 3 multiplayer modes its has. Still very fun, and defiently not boring, but you shouldn't pay $8 for it, the sale price($5, is however worth it).\n\n\nDefinitely worth the $5 it is on sale for now.

The things I would like to see in the future are more maps (possibly from the workshop) and the ability to create a group so that multiple people can join the same server. It might also bring more people to this game if there are more things to advance through such as different skins for your gun, different rat models rather than just cosmetics, and more gamemodes.\nAnyway, this game is amazing right now (as long as you aren't trying to get multiple people playing together) and can become even more amazing in the future.","September 12, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The things I would like to see in the future are more maps (possibly from the workshop) and the ability to create a group so that multiple people can join the same server. It might also bring more people to this game if there are more things to advance through such as different skins for your gun, different rat models rather than just cosmetics, and more gamemodes.\nAnyway, this game is amazing right now (as long as you aren't trying to get multiple people playing together) and can become even more amazing in the future.","September 12, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was clearly built by people who love the classics and the attention to detail to ensure the game is as accessible as possible while still catering for the highest skilled players is stunning.\n\nA must buy for anybody who wants to train their aim for another competitive FPS (*cough* CS:GO players *cough*), anybody who wants a fast paced shooter that can rival Splatoon in terms of ease of entry and addictiveness or anybody who just loves twitch shooters.","June 21, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
