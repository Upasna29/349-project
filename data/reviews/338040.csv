Single Race which, as you would expect, pits you against up to 7 other racers, time trial which does as it says on the tin and a picnic basket mode where you must be the first to collect picnic baskets that keep spawning around the track.\n\nGraphically the game looks lovely running on the Unreal 4 engine and so far the developer has put in some different looking tracks. A little bit more “stuff” on each track would be nice but I am sure this will come as the game continues through early access.\n\nThat’s not to say each track does not have shortcuts as there are some great ones on show here both of the official through a hollow log type and unofficial take a sharp turn over the edge and few a through trees type.\n\nCurrently going offtrack does not seem to slow you down and I actually really like this mechanic as it makes the traces a lot more fun and frantic. Powerups in the game are the usual variety of missiles, speed boosts and traps but all function well and seem to have a decent impact on the races. Where the game really excels is in the powerup fusion mechanic. Picking up 2 powerups allows you to combine them to create a second tier power up. I love this mechanic and think this could definetly be a selling point moving forward.\n\nIn terms of controls the game as you would expect plays best with a controller and handles well. The drifting took a little bit of getting used to but after a few races I quickly adapted as the “feel” is very different to Mario Kart.\n\nLocal multiplayer works really well and definitely is enjoyable and I really hope somewhere down the line online multiplayer is a possibility.\n\nWhile there is clearly a fair bit of development to do “Bear’s can’t Drift” is being developed by a sole person in Arran Langmead and when talking to the man in question you can tell how much of a passion project this game is. While it obviously has a long way to go I reckon this could become one of the best kart racing games out there when it is finally finishd.\n\nTo watch our video review please click on the link here:  Video Review[www.thegametutor.co.uk]","July 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","20","28","5","0"

Firstly, it looks beautiful. The world and characters have a very charming aesthetic.\nEven in early access, the game is very fun to play. There are 4 powerups to use against your opponent. You may also combine different powerups together in different ways to create new weapons.\n\nIf you'd like to see some 2 player gameplay and a more in-depth look at the game, check out this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRDwDOXcdPs\n\nThere is currently 1 hub world with which you can select different fun game types. The dev plans to add more.\nThe game is most fun played with friends locally, and with controllers.\n\nOverall, it's a super fun game!","July 24, 2015","true","0.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","19","28","4","0"

Have switched to playing this for a bit of karting fun instead of playing Mario Kart 64.  Takes a while to get used to the lack of any real text, still not sure if I like that part, but that's one mans opinon.  Online multiplayer would be nice, but I'm lucky enough to have a partner for local co-op games, and lets face it, this type of game is infinately more fun to play with friends =]","August 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Be aware, this game supports controllers and keyboard by pressing Q.\n\nThe game it self is interesting and has a fun concept with it Bear idea. The whole game is beautiful of it's use of UE4 engine. On the bad hand, you cannot change your resolution for your highest,\n\nWhile driving around, you have 3 flags of game types which is, Lab's for the best time, Labs for beating everyone with weapons to be nr.1, and collecting all food in baskets. While using weapons, you can max collect 2 weapons or boosts to fight your enemies. For some etc, you have speedboost, shield, traps, rockets, which you cannot shoot backwards. The maps have traps and secret ways to get through so you also get in first line.\n\nThe drifting part is a little bit strange because of the high amount of speed boost you get by using it. In the beginning i didn't even used it, and thought "Why is it even here?". So far it's positive effect is do get first in line quicker.\n\nSo, if you are missing Crash team Racing, and need a cuter style with bears local with 4 friends split screen on your machine, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oIBIiMDIXU","July 25, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

While the tracks could do with a bit more signalling (turn here!>>>>>) they are all characterful, challenging and visually appealing. The game looks beautiful.\n\nThe sensation of speed is keenly felt and the peril, provided by cheeky AI bear bots (friends if your lucky enough to have some) is enough to keep you on your toes.\n\nI can't wait to see how the game progresses. I'll be drifting around those corners just like bears can't until the next update...","August 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As has been mentioned by other reviewers it resembles popular cart racers of the 90s - I wouldn't know since i played practically none of those. What I do know is that it's fun to play; it looks and feels quite polished already. The sense of speed is definitely there and drifiting is seamlessly integrated. What's currently missing is some more in-game orientation with regard to game modes and, more importantly, online multiplayer support. I hope these will be implemented down the road.\nAlso, bears rule.","March 11","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I may never have known!\n\nGameplay\n\nThere is no story to follow in this game, it’s just straight up gameplay. From the main menu you are thrust into a ‘Hub’ level. As the name suggests, this is where you will be spending most of your time during this game. From here, you can access each individual level, change the gameplay mode, change the colour of your bear and add other players – or if you so wish, you can simply drive around at your own leisure!\n\nYou have the option to play on of three different game modes at the moment, Single Race, Time Trial and Checkpoint.\n\nSingle Race and Time Trial should be fairly self-explanatory. Single Race puts you up against 11 other racers as you complete a basic three lap race over varying race courses. Time Trial is similar, however there are no other racers! It sees you take to the race track on your own as you try and record your fastest laps possible.\n\nThis brings us to the final mode: Checkpoint. Contrary to the name, this is not a checkpoint based race mode. Checkpoint is essentially a Battle Arena game mode where you compete with other racers to gather the most picnic baskets with whoever fills their food-meter, and thus become the fattest bear, first being the victor. Think something along the lines of Mario Kart’s Balloon Battle, but instead of just destroying the other racers balloon, you take it off them.\n\nThere are 4 different pickups provided in each game mode too, your standard speed boosts and weapons to cause trouble to your opponents. Nothing too different here in this, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing – there are only so many items you can have in a kart racer!\n\nEach of these modes can be played with AI opponents and up to three friends, with BCD!? supporting up to 4 player splitscreen. As of writing this review, this is the only form of multiplayer as developers Strangely Named Studios have yet to add in an online multiplayer mode. It is worth noting however, that this is still a game in development. With this in mind, it is highly possible we might see this feature added in the future. Bears Can’t Drift!? still makes for an extremely fun party game however, thanks to its addition of local multiplayer – something that until recent years seemed to be dying a slow death.\n\nGraphics\n\nBears Can’t Drift!? was developed using the Unreal Engine 4, one of the most powerful and visually impressive game engines on the market. As such, this game looks incredible. Even running on my mid-range gaming PC, this game looks better than most of other games currently sat in my Steam library.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth checking out. As mentioned before, this game is far from being finished, but what we do have right now is more than enough to suffice – especially when you consider its cheap price tag.\n\nSplitscreen Multiplayer is where this game shines, and it can provide hours of fun for a group of friends.\n\nI actually had the chance to meet the developer at the recent Eurogamer Expo in Birmingham, UK and he assured me much more was to come!\n\nOverall, 8/10. A must buy if you enjoy local competitive multiplayer.","September 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The tracks are really short and not much happens on it, you only get to see a lot of trees. You can combine powerups, but I did not find this mechanic that engaging on these boring tracks. You're better off buying Sonic Racing Transformed or even F1 Race stars, these kart games offer far more content and variety. Since there is only one developer working on this game, I don't expect it to improve a lot. Very expensive for what it offers, I mean if it was 5 bucks I would not complain.","July 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 45 people (13%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","13","6","45","5","2"
