The gun play and new mechanics added an interesting twist on the Call of Duty series.\n\nI am however not going to write this as a positive review, simply because the game has marked me as cheating. Firstly I haven't even touched the multiplayer mode of Black Ops III - anyone who reads my reviews or checks my profile will see I have absolutely no interest in the multiplayer side of this type of game.  I was playing the single player campaign, in offline mode.\n\nSecondly, I wouldn't even know HOW to cheat, even if I wanted to. But one matter which really irks me is, even if I was cheating in single-player mode, why would anyone get a ban for that in the first place? Surely bans from playing multiplayer games should come when you play multiplayer? People who know me will know I am not that sort of person, where as people who read this will probably think I am just throwing my toys out of the pram. Believe who you wish at the end of the day. Heed my warning though.\n\nDue to the lack of any support from Steam or Treyarch themselves, this will be the absolutely last Call of Duty game I ever buy, review, or even lay my eyes on.  After doing some research into the matter, many people have been experiencing this issue, even people who play online, who just happen to be on a server with a cheater have received a ban as well.\n\nI'm sorry Treyarch - take your game back to the consoles.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

As you can see from the list below, the new chapter of shooter published by Activision has been judged positively by the press.\n\nEGM – 9.5\nGameTrailers – 9.2\nGameInformer – 9\nPlayStation Lifestyle – 9\nAusgamers – 8.8\nDestructoid – 8.5\nSixthAxis – 8\nGamesRadar – 4/5\nThe Escapist – 4/5\nPolygon – 7\nGamespot – 7\nGiant Bomb – 3/5\n\nMisleading?\n\nToday's Review: Call of Duty: Black Ops III\n\nOverview: So, like every year you can expect 2 things for sure: 1 Assassin's Creed game and 1 Call of Duty game, they will just keep going until they run out of ideas or ppl stop buying from them. Essentially this game takes part in 2054 i think and you become part of the Black Ops unit, an Augmented elite force that uses a new kind of techonology (somethinig related to your DNI) to performe different types of things like hacking, comunicating and other things, this review contains no spoilers of the story don't worry, so there's 3 parts of this review:\n\nSingleplayer: (You can't pick weapons during that campaign that belongs to enemies from the floor) The story takes place in the year 2054, it seems that a new cold war it's going on and an event set in the start of game trying bio-augmentation on humans, neural implantations, bionic arms, etc. and for the first time, you get to see how your character looks like, you will be also called "Player". the "RPG" part of the game were you get to choose your face it's extremly limited, so don't except more than 8 faces and they all pretty much looks like the same your gender and that's it. The SP it's pretty fun, full of enemies to shoot, walls to run over, robots to explode, drones to hack. The bad thing is the campain (also the MP) it's riddle with bugs, mostly annoying, i haven't finished yet, but it's like any cod except for MW2, a rather generic story pulled of the 10 minutes imagination time of an 14 years old, but hey, it's cod! we're here for the...\n\nMultiplayer: A few big steps were made for this mode, but at this point some keep not being made, like no dedicated servers and smaller maps. The good thing is that the MP it's pretty fun (if you make the game to work) and... you can't wallrun on every wall, there are like 1 like obvious wall to run and the rest are just like to practice parkour because there's really no need to use it, and most walls don't even work to do this you might end up using that a bit. Specialst are new to the franchise, you basically get to choose 1 specialist having each 1 a special ability that i think it's unlocked after a few minutes played, because it's not related to the scorestreak and a different character can be tuned to look a bit different, also you have the scorestreaks, weapon customization and everything that's already there, which leads me to the...\n\nZombies Mode: Perhaps this is the best part of this game, because it's really so crappy that there's actually nothing really good about it, Zombies mode feature something like an experiment or something where 4 ppl guilty of murdering someone are taken and placed somewhere when they are surrounded by zombies and you get this new ability to (pressing a button on a machine) turn out into something like the thing from The Darkness 2 for a breif period of time to ravage enemy zombies, the mode it's still pretty hard if played alone which encourages players to join with friends, it has a film noir ambient set in the 50s (but with new weapons) and the base game only includes 1 map (plus nuketown if you pre-order) Pretty fun but nothing really new.\n\nPros:\n* Great soundtrack, music it's really immersive\n* Great graphics (IF you have the powerful rig the game needs to run with them)\n* Decent story (i think...)\n* Fun MP\n* Somekind of new Zombies mode\n* Specialists\n\nCons:\n* Terrible port, poorly optimized\n* Fps drops constantly\n* Memory leak\n* CPU usages it's broken and consume the whole cpu\n* Stuttering utter and completly annoying to play happends every 3 or 4 seconds\n* Slowdowns on cinematics\n\nMy advice for you now is don't buy this game, was obviously focused on the releases of the consoles and it's a terrible pc port, as of it's now the game looks like an early alpha and i strongly suggest you wait until a sale or at least a few weeks or a month to wait for treyarch to adress the main issues with it.\n\nMetascore: 51/100","November 6, 2015","false","68.3"," 3,165 of 4,258 people (74%) found this review helpful 633 people found this review funny","74","165","4","633","159"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chimes_/recommended/311210/","Chimes_","Chimes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chimes_/","72 products in account","Context: I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, though I skipped Advanced Warfare for lack of a platform to play it on, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark. So, when I built my own PC I couldn't really resist the chance to play another Treyarch Zombies experience. So, here's a little on the game modes. My lack of experience with Advanced Warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options, bear that in mind.\n\nCampaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.\n\nYou're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of "Chase Paul Taylor around the world" and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the "new" movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just "Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time" Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customisation to add this illusion of content, when it's easier to just use the preset loadouts for each level.\n\nA boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non existant. I hope they finally ditch this future ♥♥♥♥, it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.\n\nZombies: I played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good. The whole easter egg thing was nice at first, giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras, like maybe all the perks on the map, but this is ♥♥♥♥ing absurd. You have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features, and it's just a huge chore, honestly. You pretty much have to do it as well, unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15. Once again, they compromised level design in favour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly complicated story ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the bland cast of literal whos voiced by expensive actors, throwing back to Call and Mob of the Dead, but I never liked those ones anyway. Kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own The Giant, which is still the best map, or unless you bought the season pass.\n\nIt's pulled an Assassins Creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it, I've lost track of everything at this point.  The worst part, as mentioned, is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts. Shadows of Evil is boring to play, tedious and poorly designed. I haven't played a map as bad as this since Shangri-La.\n\nThe Giant, a reskin of Der Reise, still stands the test of time, however. The new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous, and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point. The map has not changed whatsoever, besides randomisation of perk locations and a few small easter eggs (That don't take forever to do!) The mechanic of Pack-A-Punching your weapon twice was introduced in the first Black Ops and added generic attatchments to your weapon, but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns, allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an AOE, for example. Finally, the Gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the Pack a Punch in the original Der Reise. A fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable. Extremely powerful ones, such as spawning an ammo box on command, are gated behind a drop system, which reeks of a microtransaction system that was probably removed at the last second. As usual, I'll be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement, but if you're going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern Zombies, then you'll be disappointed.\n\nMultiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. I'll stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game.\n\nIn terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby "If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!" which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of colour, which sorely disappointed me.\n\nHowever, as usual Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what ♥♥♥♥ like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel "worth it" in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.\n\nConclusion: If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the *complete* lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC playerbase and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. And I enjoyed Ghosts. In its current state, I find it hard to reccomend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that "Call of Duty is always the same" but this is no more obvious than in this installment. Feels like a mediocre side-grade of Advanced Warfare.\n\nIf you're reading reviews for a COD game, you're not the primary market. Don't buy this.\n\nAlso, do me a favour and don't comment below, my inbox is filling and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what you have to say.","November 28, 2015","false","37.5"," 3,523 of 4,839 people (73%) found this review helpful 733 people found this review funny","73","523","4","733","269"

Can you believe it ? 5 FPS is out of this world I mean how lucky am I to have such a high frame rate. However reality had somehow managed to break into my room and he literally f*cked my a$$hole with such consistency it was poetic, a form of art. After countless attempts at trying to merely LAUNCH this literal sh*thole of a game it popped up with its sh*tty Treyarch and Ativision logo animations, props to you developers because from here I dropped from 100fps to 20, then back up to 40 then down to, well 2. At last ! I was in the main menu, before I did anything I thanked the gaming gods and offered up my soul in return for mere minutes let alone hours of fluent gameplay. After this I scurried over to the graphics section and set everything to 'Potato', since I estimated that anything above 'Low' was too far fetched for us mere mortals. I must say the amount of gaming time I spent on this was well worth it, the story was amazing, there was some minister or something trapped somewhere and we had to... Boom crash. If this isnt fixed by tomorrow I am refunding the sh*t out of my game. I would like to thank Treyarch for the surprise anal devastation which left my REKTUM detached from my body somewhere under my bed (gotta sticky glue that on soon). The only thing I want from Treyarch is next time is use lube please, and maybe try not to f*ck me all at the same time since my holes werent built to hold 4837895375389537328553 d*cks and 354735487438934 fists you know ?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/howar31/recommended/311210/","howar31","Howar31","http://steamcommunity.com/id/howar31/","523 products in account","No spoiler in this review.\n\nThe latest episode in Call of Duty franchise.  Continuing the story from WAW, BO1 and BO2.  The time is setting in the future, 2065.  All the sci-fi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality.  Generally, the main menu is fabulous.  You may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds.  And you can locally play with friends in split-screen! (Support both vertical or horizontal split)  This is very cool if you want to play together locally.\n\nThe game breaks into 3 big modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies.  In BO3, all these modes are quite decent individually.  Moreover, all 3 modes are well connected.  Such as, in Multiplayer mode, you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in Campaign mode.  Most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes.  And in each mode you have your own progress.  They all have levels, achievements and statistics separately.  Besides, all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends!  Campaign and Zombies mode both support COOP up to 4 players.\n\nAnother awesome part is the customizations and the media community.  Most of the FPS game (such as Battlefield series) allow players to decorate their guns with camo.  And also have custom Emblems for creative players to show themselves.  In BO3, each custom Emblem support up to 64 layers.  Which means you could create almost anything you want.  Furthermore, you may also fully customize your weapons with "Camo" and "Paint Job", even "Clan Tag" or "Kill Counter" if you got prestige.  These customizations are not only for you to please yourself.  You can upload your sick guns the to in-game media community.  All the BO3 players could see your works and rate them, even download them if they like it.  So the customization and social functionality is quite robust in BO3.  (Screenshots sharing coming soon)\n\nIn order to clearly express my opinion, I will review BO3 mode by mode.\n\nCampaignVery nice and deep story, continue the story from BO2.  The story is so deep (imo) that you may have to play over and over again to truly understand the true story behind the scenes.  And there is a secret mode (the secret almost everyone knew lol) called "Nightmare" after you beat the Campaign mode.  Basically the Nightmare mode is not only the zombie version of the Campaign, but also re-tell the story form a different aspect.  You should also try it if you want to understand the true story!\n\n+Very nice and deep story\n+Support COOP in all stages in Campaign up to 4 players\n+Multiple routes on the map.  You may choose which route (i.g. up from roof or side flank, etc) you are going to assault\n+4 diffculties provide different challenge for both newbie and skilled players\n+Lots of checkpoints.  No need to restart from the beginning when you die\n+The cutscenes are nice and immersive.  Playing campaign just like watching a movie\n+Awesome and beautiful scenes.  Not only the sci-fi stuffs, you may also see some fantastic imaginary scenes in Campaign\n+Secret mode: Nightmare.  Totally different feelings and different order to tell the story from different aspect with different challenge\n\n*Story is so deep.  Maybe not easy for everyone to see the true story in first run.  So many people think the story sucks :P\n\nOK, if you still cannot understand the story, here's a discussion by "双马尾优优姬" from Chinese forum "Baidu Tieba" explains the whole story very well.  (Sorry it's written in Chinese!)\nhttp://tieba.baidu.com/p/4151043880\n\nMultiplayerMany decent features success from the predecessor, and add more new stuffs in BO3.  The Class, Weapon Attachement, Perks, Wildcards and Scorestreaks system are quite similar with BO2.  The Specialists and the new movement are the new stuffs in BO3.  The Specialists are all have their own special weapons and abilities which makes the battle more interesting.  And the jetpack allow you to double jump, wallrun and slide on the battlefield.  Moreover, you can swim underwater in BO3.  These new movements are very nice, extending the battle into three-dimensional.  Several new perks were added to match the new movement system.  Such as silence jet-pack, fast thruster recharge and digital footsteps.\n\n+New jet-pack movement.  Fast pace 3D battle is very cool\n+Sci-fi scenes and sci-fi stuffs.  The future battlefields and equipments looks awesome\n+Highly customizable weapon.  You may show off your favorite gun with tons of camo, self-created paint job and attachemnets\n+Specialists are very interesting.  9 unique specialists, each of them have 1 special weapon and 1 special ability for player to choose\n+And specialists all have lots of outfits and taunts to unlock.  Further showing off yourself!\n+Tons of challenges, achievements, specialists, weapons, attachements, perks, camo, calling cards for you to unlock!\n+Statistics are informative\n+Lobby Leaderboard is nice if you want to see how's the players in your lobby\n+And yes, you can chat in lobby right now (can't chat in lobby in BO2)\n+Nuketown is back!\n+Better connection in my opinion.  I've played over hundred hours, never get "Disconnected from server (BO2)" in BO3.\n\n-Players in Asia is fewer than North America.  Some modes are few players playing.  (I'm in SE Asia)\n-You can only see other player's Level and shared Showcase (Paint Jobs, Variants and Emblems), no statistics, even no history match replay\n-Friend list are still bugged in BO3 (just like BO2).  If you have over 100 Steam friends, it will only display random 100 friends in BO3's friend list\n\nZombiesI played Zombies mode less, because it's not easy to find Public Game or other teammates to play together in Asia.  Sometimes the game connect me to Europe server, and my ping will over 300ms, hard to play lol.  Thus, the following review might not very accurate and not very completed.\n\n+The map is quite big.  Many place to explore\n+Very challenging, it's not really easy to beat the game\n+Transform into the Beast.  Get special abilities and access certain places.\n+New stuff: Gobblegum.  You can get these gum for different boosts\n\nI can't tell much since I play few Zombies mode.  But it's really fun to play Zombies mode with friends!\n\nIn conclusion, Black Ops 3 is quite a masterpiece in my opinion.  Although there's some performance issue at launch, Treyarch quickly patch it in several hours.  The performance is quite nice and smooth now.  If you like COD series, if you like sci-fi, and if you like fast-pace FPS, you should try Call of Duty: Black Ops 3.  It's AWESOME!\n\n超過字數限制！中文評論請見:\nhttps://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Steam/M.1448055680.A.686.html","November 20, 2015","true","341.0"," 734 of 1,058 people (69%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","69","734","1","68","32"

Same thing over and over. I played some MP and feel like I am playing MW3, with some titanfall ripoff but with poor parkour. That is not what I should feel when I am playing NEW fps. Look at Rainbow Six Siege, it feels so fresh.\n\n2. 50 usd season pass, which delivers........ Same old maps that old Call of duty games had. Renewed maps arent bad as we saw in Battlefield 4, however 50 usd Season Pass hase to be removed from game industry. For same reason I didnt buy Battlefront 2015.\n\n3. Maps are limited. This game has jetpacks and "parkour" however maps are limited and have "invisible walls". This is not acceptable in 2015, for a game that has modes bigger than 5v5.\n\n4. Optimisation is great I suppose because it was running fine on my PC. However graphics feels outdated. As I mentioned I felt like I am playing MW3.\n\n5. Easy to hack. During my playtime, I got 6 obvious cheaters out of 20 games. They were shoting thhrought the wall even when I was unreachable. (No they had no vision ability). Probably it is because engine is too old for now.\n\n6. Ethics ? After Titanfall came out, CoD Devs are trying to make similar game, but why ? Titanfall was first one, and it is one of the best FPS of the decade. Have some respect to yourselves guys\n\nSo I could continue this list but I feel like no one is gonna read it then lol.\ntl;dr ? Make something new for us.

They also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys.

They are trying to show you how PC ports of COD aren't all bad and that they're trying to work on it. Treyarch really does try and make good ports of COD, all leading up to BO3, in my book, have been well made ports.\n\nWith BO3, Treyarch is really stretching it. They're trying to make a new staple in PC CODs. With additions such as 2 player split-screen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year, this alone shows how serious they are with PC ports. Along side this we have full dedicated servers, an FOV slider that goes up to 120, a reasonable options menu, changable frame rates, and much more. They are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly. I haven't met a single hacker in any gamemode (as of writing this review).\n\nBO3 didn't have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware. I didn't have any major problems during the launch but, after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up (compaired to the launch). As of writing this, I have no farther complaints to say about BO3 performance wise.\n\nNow lets stop talking about the PC port and start talking about BO3 as a whole. BO3 adds many new features to the COD formula. Such as specalists and a more fluid movement system. A specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities. These abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time. This changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play. The new movement system isn't something to go to much in detail in, they mainly added wall running and sliding. This makes the game more fast paced and fun to play.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n- Split screen\n- Specalists\n- Alot of features for a PC port\n- New movement system\n\nCons:\n- Some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware (this isn't as bad as before though)\n\nOverall\n8.5/10\n\nREMEMBER, THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE ENJOYMENT I HAVE HAD WITH THE GAME. THIS IS ALL JUST MY OPINION.","December 29, 2015","true","159.1"," 153 of 219 people (70%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","70","153","219","14","4"

But when you play this you'll want to play one of the older call of duties where the people are actually on the GROUND.\n\nIt is no longer “realistic” but they’ve moved to the theme of being “futuristic” – which doesn’t give the same appeal.\n\nI want to like this game, and I don’t want to. The bad reputation of a call of duty doesn’t want me to like this game, but because my friends play it I want to like it so that I can play with them.\nNo matter how hard I try I cannot recommend this game. My Friends like it for the nostalgia that I simply don’t have with this game. They would buy the game just for the Zombies, where I see the main aspect of the game being at multiplayer.\n\nSo why would you get this game if Call of Duty is the same game over and over again?\nIf you’re buying it for the Zombies, get Black ops 1 and the DLC if you’re that committed.\n\nAs always it is also a bad PC port, your PC can be 2X more powerful than one of the consoles yet, you’ll equal its performance. Of course the performance is getting better with each update but still, after downloading 24GB+ of the game, surely there would be performance problems already solved in that data somewhere.\n\n(I have only watched the campaign on youtube).\nThe campaign it washed up and could have been thought up by someone who has only played 1 call of duty, and it also seems they wrote the campaign on the back of a napkin with a crayon.\n\nThe dedicated servers seem to be more dedicated to the consoles. It’s as if they want the PC users to suffer.\n\nThey try to shove more DLC down your throat as you only get 1 map on zombies.\nMultiplayer maps are very small, so you aren’t bored – yet the maps are boring as they are not adapted to the movement mechanics of the game.\nThere are also a lot of balance issues with weapons, if you play the game you’ll find out what is OP soon enough.\nIf you don’t want to be disappointed even more don’t play the campaign, you won’t care or remember any/many characters – the voice acting on them is poor and if you want to play it multiplayer – it sucks even further as it obviously wasn’t configured for multiplayer campaign.\n\nThis game is definitely not with its major price tag, if you want a Call of Duty, buy a cheaper one. If you REALLY want this game, but it from an external website like "♥♥♥♥.co m " or CDkeys.\nIf you want a shooter game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will be a lot better for you but it might take some time getting used to.\n\nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME:\nAt least it still has guns in it… at least… most of the weapons are…\nClicking the “Uninstall” button","December 18, 2015","false","2.2"," 75 of 101 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","75","101","8","2"

It has a somewhat solid campaign but the storyline is muddled and the players abilities aren't implemented all that well. Expect to finish it in 6 or 7 hours and don't expect it to leave any kind of impact on you.\n\nIf you're going to sink 50+ hours into the multiplayer and have a bunch of friends to play with, then there is a bit of value here. The new zombie mode seems fun too but at the time of writing this review, the matchmaking is having issues and finding a game is tricky.\n\nThis is hardly the worst COD game ever made, it does have a fair bit of content but it sure is far from the best.

If you wanna play this game, don't buy it at the moment.  It's literally un-f♠♠♠♠♠♠ playable! WHAT THE F♠♠♠ ACTIVISION!? AGAIN!? THIS WAS THE SAME F♠♠♠♠♠♠ ISSUE WITH ADVANCED WARFARE!!\nEdit 04/17/2016: This was definitely not a solid start for Black Ops 3 on PC. Overall bad optimization like its predecessor, Advanced Warfare. It was rather obvious that this game was rushed out a bit ahead of schedule before Treyarch could properly iron out as much of the issues as possible, and of course I blame the publisher, Activision, since they're the ones that set the deadlines for Treyarch. However though, I can say that it has improved since its release, but not as much as we would've liked as a community, so you're definitely gonna need a solid GPU to run this a a consistent 60 FPS, so a GTX 750 Ti won't cut it. This edit, however, will not focus on the optimization of the game, but more the changes that the developers have brought to the game (Spoiler Alert: This is still a negative review ). I'd like to get this out of the way first; Black Ops 3 is a solid entry in the Call of Duty franchise with its staple muliplayer mode that actually managed to improve upon the boost jumping mechanics of Advanced Warfare, along with a somewhat lengthy campaign mode which reintroduced Co-Op mode (something I personally asked for myself), and its cult-status zombies mode. I could go in depth about each pillar of the game, but this review would draw on much longer than needed, so I'll simply say that there is fun to be had with each mode despite their flaws, especially when you have a few friends to join along. The s*** stain that destroyed Advanced Warfare has returned for Round 2 to destroy yet another entry in the Call of Duty franchise, and its name is  Supply Drops . Once again, Activison takes advantage of its consumers and milks them dry of every penny possible. For those of you that have been living under a rock, supply drops are (as the name suggests) item drops that will give items of varying rarities ranging from common to epic, and they can be earned by either playing the game normally or actually spending your hard-earned money. The issue here is that the developers initially stated that all items earned from supply drops were purely cosmetic (camos, visual attachment variations, emblem pieces, etc.), and they could only be earned by playing the game. A few months later, COD points were introduced as an in-game currency that can bought with real money to buy supply drops, and further down the road, entirely new weapons with different stats were introduced such as the Shadowclaw (6 shot mini crossbow), so of course things got out of hand from there. Not only did the devs go back on their word (thanks to Activison), but they also introduced game breaking elements that are often only accessible through paying real money. For instance, the Shadowclaw has proven itself to be an extremely unbalanced weapon since each of its six shots instantly kills regardless of which body part is hit, and the dual wield option doubles the ammo capacity. A vast majority of the players that have taken to using this weapon have ranked in 1st place with a large sum of kills purely from the shadowclaw alone. To be fair, the other weapons aren't that great, but they still manage to be game breaking for their rarity alone. From my personal experience, many players in each match will drop whatever they were doing, and completely disregard the game objective the moment they see someone with one of these weapons. These players will often resort to waiting for someone to drop the weapons so they can pick them up and play around with them since they know they may not have another chance to play with them. I've once seen at least two of my team members completely disregard the objective the moment they picked up the fury's song sword from an enemy. To sum this up, the weapons have broken the balance of multiplayer, and the problem only worsens by the fact that these weapons only have a 0.8% chance of dropping, which easily motivates many consumers to shamelessly drop hundreds of U.S. dollars for the potential chance of earning them, thus promoting a rigged gambling system that can easily be accessed by minors. Activision clearly saw dollar signs in the supply drop system since they managed to make millions alone from the Advanced Warfare version, which is why they forced Treyarch to implement this appalling system, and it was obvious that adding game changing items was the only way to motivate the consumers to even buy these supply drops. In short, Black Ops 3 is an absolute mess because of this appalling system, and it's only going to get worse since more weapons are planned for the future, showing how little Activision cares about the community.","November 6, 2015","false","243.5"," 118 of 173 people (68%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","68","118","173","14","0"

Gameplay stutters, loading screen stutters, cutscene stutters; everything. Sometimes it's really weirdly timed, too. You can have a shootout with weather effects and explosions everywhere and the FPS will be fine; go into a small room and suddenly it all just drops. I tweaked the setting here and there and it's improved things somewhat - gameplay improved, cutscnes didn't. It's mostly a mixture of low - medium, with some of that resolution upscaling this game has. Jesus Christ, it made the game look real ♥♥♥♥ing ugly.\n\nMultiplayer is as chaotic as ever. Whoever shoots first wins. If you still dig that in these games, go right the ♥♥♥♥ ahead; if not, you might wanna skip this. I haven't really seen examples of some of these "Specialist Classes" being more OP than other classes. Mind you, I'm awful at the game so I'm not the best person to judge. The maps don't really seem that memorable. Just run here and shoot that. Less campers than other entries, so that's good I guess.\n\nThe whole updated mobility in this game kinda seems like a cheap gimmick to me. Most of the time it just seems to be more effective and quick to just point and shoot like a traditional CoD game than it is to run all over the walls and ♥♥♥♥. I would try performing jumps/wall runs in some spots that look really good for those movements, only to find an invisble wall blocking me and sending me to my death. It doesn't seem like mobility is actually encouraged, to be honest.\n\n\nI did find one design choice very irritating. The fact that the campaign is sorta like...split into 2 clones - one for SP and one for MP, with progression in one mode not having an effect on the other. This really bugged me because the game defaults to the online campaign (I nearly lost connection to my own campaign level somehow). When I went to play offline, I discovered I had to start over, so didn't bother with that. Oh, yeah. I can't seem to find a way to play Zombies offline.\n\nIt's not just the game which stutters, it slows my whole computer down. It takes a few seconds to close down when I quit out and then turns my PC into a potato for a couple minutes. This has never happened to me with any other game; Witcher 3, MGSV, Fallout 4 - nothing.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOK, the campaign....Unless you have friends, it's just boring and tedious. Because it's built for co-op, enemies are just eveeeryyywheeeerrrre. It makes everything crawl along at a snail's pace as you try to kill dozens of enemies in a single area to progress. At the end of all levels after the first, your kill count will just be in the hundreds. It really doesn't help with this one section section with never ending waves of re-spawning enemies. Good ♥♥♥♥ing God. Beyond the gameplay, the plot kind've falls ♥♥♥♥ over ♥♥♥♥. The concept is interesting but it often falls flat because of how it can sometimes heavily rely on the relationships between these, dull, boring, uninteresting unexplored characters. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue and voice acting is just full of cringe. There's also this stupid, cheap twist but I can't comment on that more without spoiling it. Sorry.\n\nUpdate 2: OK, Zombies is alright. As usual, it's a party orientated game, so the best experience is with friends. The new map is...interesting. It has a great look to it there there are some cool new enemies. However, it's expansiveness is a bit of a double-edged sword. Granted, there's more to do, but there's also too much to do, if you catch my drift. It takes bloody adges to get around everywhere and this can become tedious after multiple attempts on the same map. However, there are couple different environments within this map to spice things up. There's also a new "bubblegum" perk system which the player can customise, which is a welcome addition. All in all, pretty cool. Just bring mates; especially considering the time it can take to find an online lobby sometimes.\n\nSo yeah....give it a couple months to be patched some more.","November 28, 2015","false","14.4"," 166 of 254 people (65%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","65","166","254","18","0"

For all of the reviews that are upset about the poor optimization, I understand. If you can't even play a game properly due to technical issues, it can be pretty frustrating. But the game itself is pretty fun. Zombie mode is fun, but weirdly complicated. Something that would be enjoyable to figure out with friends. The multiplayer is standard CoD fare. You should know by now if that's your cup of tea. Campaign is fairly enjoyable. I do recommend this game, but it kind of depends on what you are looking for in a game.

I've found it so difficult to immerse myself into a Call of Duty game since then, due to how amazing the game was back in the day.\n\nI haven't played a Call of Duty since Black Ops 2. don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Black Ops 2 a lot but there were so many things that I hated about the game that really annoyed me (SMGs being hugely unbalanced compared to other weapon types, some areas of the game felt a little dead. to be honest it was a while ago that i played so I can't remember every detail).\n\nI'm writing this on my own opinion, and i'm basing it on the Multiplayer Gameplay, not the Campaign and Zombies. I purchased this game in spite of the Mixed reviews it was given on the steam page, which made me really anxious about spending £30 on ♥♥♥ to get this game. HOWEVER...\nIt was probably the best £30 I had spent on a game that was under a positive rating. I can't understand why this game has mixed reviews like it does (Pre Patch Optimisation maybe?) But I have to say, going from Black ops 2 to Black ops 3 has been a huge game changer for me, with the addition of Jets, Floor surfing (That skid thing, idk), Wall running, A bunch of new different scorestreak types and most of all, the new specialist classes you can chose from.\n\nThere are so many different things I love about it, it's added things that are so out of my comfort zone, but at the same time, have made the game so much more exciting to play. The gun classes are actually balanced (Hurrah!), The customisation is great, the class specialisations are amazing (And I love how you can have 2 different variants of each as well), The Black Market is an amazing concept, The game play itself, sometimes annoying because i'm still getting the hang of it, is so enjoyable. Being able to actually have a character which you can customise the clothing of and give different taunts etc. This is how Call of Duty should have evolved after BO2 (I have heard bad things about Advanced Warfare and Ghosts, probably why they died so quickly).\n\nNow with every game has bad points ofcourse. I feel like there could maybe be 1 or 2 addition maps over the current that they have created (DLC Inbound plz), Allow for more frequent map rotations instead of playing the same map cycle over and over again. and maybe add a couple more secondary weapons (Only 3 Pistols, 2 Rocket Launchers and a Knife?!). A Couple of bugs here and there as well, but it doesn't affect Gameplay enough to make it a bad point.\n\nBut all in all. If you like/love Call of Duty, and you're thinking about buying this, but you're scared because of how "Apparently" bad Advanced Warfare and Ghosts is. Buy it, because the chances of you regreting it is pretty slim. And if you do regret it you obviously don't know a good sunday night in as a single man/woman needing a good game to play.\n\nIf I was to rate the game. I'd say 8/10. Maybe 8.2/10 but lets not get specific.\n\n(Review based off of 15 Hours Gametime.

Don't judge a game based on knee-jerk reactions to a 12 hour hickup that was resolved. You can have 10 years to prep for something, and when the time finally comes... Ya, there is always that chance something could go wrong. It happens, especially in the game development. They responded quickly and we are having fun now!

Please make sure you update your graphics driver (there was a new driver release for nvidia cards to help with the game), and make sure you are running at reasonable settings for your rig. If you are still having issues, PLEASE! Let them know via their support channels (twitter, email, etc).\n\nIs the game a perfect 10/10 -- Hell no! But it is fun!

The campaign is very well done and very enjoyable and replayable, zombie mode is quite involved and multiplayer as expected is probably the main highlight of the game with tons of replayability and lots of customization.

Having these cool new abiities adds a new spin the tried and true formula. The single player, which is also one of campaigns in a CoD in a while takes some really interesting twists and turns with it's story and has all kinds of cool customizability that is sadly missing in most other military shooters. This is all great and all, but the reason I cannot recommend this game right now is because of the preformance issues that I have been experiencing in the single player. I have a GTX 980 ti, an i7 4790k oc'd to 4.7GHz and 16GBs RAM and I am getting fps drops down to 45 which also produces significant input lag. I have also noticed that all 6GBs of my VRAM and 12GBs of my RAM are being used, which is unacceptable for any game out right now. I have noticed fps drops to 55 during some multiplayer matches that also produce a little bit of input lag. With my setup I should be getting an fps of 100 at 1440p easily all though out the game.

My PC does not have top tier specs but it is a "decent" pc and plays most other current games at hight to ultra settings. ( AMD A10 6700, GTX 760,12 gb ram ). But in black ops 3 campaign all low settings AND setting to 720p resolution  The game runs at around 30-40 fps with fps spikes down as low as into the single digits!. Which technically does make it "unplayable" so for the time being I put campaign on hold until ( IF ) it gets patched .\n\nOn the multiplayer side of things ....the same issues are present but not quite as bad. Again forced to run at 720p resolution , but able to run at medium settings and run around 50-60 fps. BUT still suffering from random momentary fps drops down to around 30fps and some times random extended periods of 15 fps.\n\nThere is no reason this game couldnt have been optimized better and that my PC couldnt have ran it at 1080p on medium/high settings at the least. Its just flat out a crap PC port beacause the game is cranked out year after year and they know people will buy it because....."COD".\n\nOtherwise....although the game is your "typical" call of duty...plays the same,mechanics feel good. A few bugs but otherwise fun game play. I wish it just ran right so I could actually enjoy playing it. I havent bought the last 3 call of duties because of the path activision has taken the franchise down. And I was hoping this time would be the right time to get back in. Obviously things have not changed and I will likely opt out of buying the next itteration of COD.\n\nNOW if you want to know a game WORTH your money that actually plays butter smooth and flawless. Pick up Fallout 4!!! game is amazing and I am running 60 fps on all ultra settings with the same PC/specs that black ops has given me so much trouble on.","November 10, 2015","false","30.3"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","34","45","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KobraKira/recommended/311210/","KobraKira","KobraKira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KobraKira/","135 products in account","(UPDATE: Just moved Nightmares to the pros. Nightmares is not having many issues anymore for some reason, so i played it a bit more)\n\n(UPDATE 2: I finished the Campaign last night. I updated it's review below)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo i bought this game back in December. I mainly wanted to play Zombies, and i liked it. However, let me break down the game a little. CAUTION: A real review incoming!\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Good Zombies mode. Shadows of Evil is actually a very detailed map. I like big city maps such as that. Unfortunately though, unless you have the Season Pass or whatever, that is the only map you can play on.\n\n+ Decent graphics. It's not better looking than Battlefront (EA), or Rainbow Six: Siege, but it's actually alright for a CoD game. Advanced Warfare honestly looks better than this, but then again this game uses the same engine like all the other CoD's out there besides AW.\n\n+ Multiplayer is alright as well. I haven't really had any connection issues or hit registration issues either. Everything seems quite stable for me in that regard. I also haven't met a hacker ONCE. Hell, i've been lucky not to meet any campers for once in a CoD game! Not to mention Exo abilities such as the jetpack are non-existant except for sliding and boost jumping. Wall running is also a thing!\n\n+ Nightmares. This idea, i actually like. I've been waiting for a Zombies campaign, and now we got one. Somehow this mode is working better than before for some reason, so i'll tell you what it basically is in a nutshell. Nightmares is pretty much the Campaign levels, but done with a different protagonist AND done in a slightly different order...with Zombies!\n\n+ Splitscreen! Yes, you heard me. There's splitscreen co-op campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, and Nightmares! Not many devs nowadays actually give us local splitscreen in their games. And of all the devs out there to do so, it was a CoD dev! WUT?!\n\n+ Decent amount of Graphical options. You can change texture quality, texture filtering, mesh quality, shadow quality, dynamic shadows, subsurface scattering, volumetric lighting, ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, and motion blur. Hell, they even gave us a Field of View slider, as well as Vsync, FPS limiter/slider, and pretty much almost every other video option that's in today's games.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- My biggest gripe with this game right now, is the performance. The game doesn't perform as well as it should. I sometimes have a hard time pulling a consistent FPS at or above 60fps in Campaign and Nightmares. Even at high settings it still runs about the same. The only sure-fire way i could maintain a stable framerate sometimes at max settings in 1080p was by disabling Volumetric Lighting and Order Independant Transparency completely. However, i actually like those effects since this game manages to make some decent use of godrays and lighting in certain areas of the maps. But what can i do? Not to mention this game eats up WAY too much VRAM and RAM for what this game presents us in the graphics department. I can max out Battlefront, Rainbow Six: Siege, AND just about every other game in my library perfectly, but not this game unless i turn off said effects. I hope Treyarch optimizes this game a little more. However, here's where this game gets weird in terms of optimization. It's a hit or miss situation.\n\nSome people say that this game runs great for them, some say it doesn't. Unfortuantely, i am one of the people whom the game runs a bit poorly for me.\n\nNow, unlike most people here who will simply say this game performs like a child trying to shove a square into a round hole and never post their specs, i will. If Treyarch optimizes the game a bit more, i will change this review to a positive.\n\n\nCase: Cooler Master Elite 430\n\nGPU: Zotac GeForce GTX 970 4gb (No OC)\n\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 8-Core Black Edition (No OC)\n\nRAM: Corsair Vengeance 8gb\n\nDisk Drive: Samsung SH-224DB / BEBE DVD/CD Writer\n\nCooling Fan: Cooler Master JetFlo 95.0 CFM 120mm Red\n\nPSU: XFX TS 550W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply\n\nMotherboard: MSI 970A-G46\n\nOperating System: Windows 10 Home 64-Bit\n\n\n- Campaign isn't all that great. Ever since the start of the story, i have NO idea what the hell is even going on. I only made it to the Hypocenter level before i stopped. I just couldn't understand what it was going for honestly. One moment i'm fighting a bunch of baddies in a run down, terrorist controlled part of the city, and the next minute i'm suddenly in Singapore fighting more baddies along with robots and mechs. It doesn't help that the Campaign runs terribly for me either, but to add insult to injury, i don't even know how this is a continuation of Black Ops 2's story.\n\nUPDATE: Now that i finished the Campaign, i have to say it's still not that great. Some sequences were pretty neat. However, it didn't even feel like a Call of Duty game towards the end. It felt like it was trying to be something it was not at that point honestly. I just couldn't feel it to be honest. The whole DNI mind control thing was dragging on WAY too long.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSLIGHT SPOILER: The only thing ever mentioned about Black Ops 2 so far, was Raul Menendez. But that conversation was very short-lived. Also, they mentioned and showed Nova 6 from the first entry in the series during the last mission.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow granted i never finished the story yet, but i just cannot bring myself to do so. Maybe when they fix some of the game's issues and whatnot, i'll come back to it once more. For now, i'd just skip it.\n\n\n- Specialists. I only really like 3 of em honestly. Ruin, Spectre, and Outrider. The others, aren't really as interesting, but the whole specialist thing isn't really that great to me regardless. To me i think it'd be cooler if we could make our own MP character ya know? Or not make, but perhaps build our own.\n\n\nMy final verdict thus far, is still a 6/10. I will change this to a positive, should Treyarch fix up the game a bit. I will still go on here from time to time to play a few matches of Multiplayer and Zombies. I will update review as necessary. I do wish there were a neutral or average option instead of a straight like or dislike.\n\nI am excited for the modding tools as well, but i hope that they deliver with that. If not, then i don't know honestly.","January 10","false","54.9"," 117 of 189 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","117","189","13","28"

I CAN'T PLAY IT, the game just get stuck because my RAM can't handle it, I have 8GB (It's not to much, but I CAN play WITCHER 3 AT ULTRA AND THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN!). I like this game, but sorry, this cannot happen, unless you fix this optimization error my analysis will keep being negative.\n\nP.S: If you live in South America, with the lag, no matter how fast your connection is, you cannot be able to play multiplayer mode without some lag or even find a match. If you find a match, it will be probably lagged, and forget about the especials game mods like "gun game" you will probably not find a match. It's up to you guys, if you accept this terms, buy it. I did it.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IN MY CASE. I know that. I'm not trying to make this game look bad. It's just that a lot of people are having real problems, a friend of mine bought the game, at the beta, he run it with no problem, and now, he can't even run it in ALL LOW SETTINGS. This is not fair for people, no when you are a company that make millons of dollars with this games. There are some things for companies like this that cannot be tolerated. Just make yourselves heard.\n\n--------------------------\n\nAn attempted solution by: Big Dank\nHope can be useful:\n\n"If you have an nvidia card, make sure it's updated. Check geforce experience, check where ever you need to but there was a whole update to fix bo3 issues.\nIf that doesn't work go into the nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings, click on the program settings tab, put bo3 as the program, and for the graphics processor select the one you run games with. For me it's the "High-performance NVIDIA processor". After that press save or whatever it is, and try bo3 again.\nIf none of that works, it's either you have windows 10 (which is not optimized for nvidia right now) just can't run the game from your side."\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nSpanish:\n\nTengo una GTX 970 y un Intel Core i7, el juego me corre a 60FPS a la máxima calidad (con algunos bajones) pero no puedo jugarlo, ¡La RAM no lo soporta! Tengo 8GB de RAM, sé que no es demasiado; pero aún así, me corre el WITCHER 3 EN ULTRA sin ningún problema, 8GB debería ser suficiente para cualquier juego. Esto es un error de optimización y a menos que lo arreglen, mi análisis seguirá siendo negativo.\n\nPD: Si son de Sudamérica, con el lag que hay en los servidores no podrán jugar una sóla partida en multijugador sin tener un poco de lag, si con suerte encuentran alguna, seguro lo tendrán. Olvidense de modos de juego especiales como "juego de armas" porque no van a encontrar una sóla partida. No importa que tan rápida sea su conección. Comprarlo o no es su decisión. Yo lo hice y lo estoy disfrutando de todas formas. Aclaro que no por eso el juego se merece una critica positiva. Ésta es la única forma que tenemos para hacernos escuchar y que no nos pasen por arriba.\n\nAclaración:\n\nSé que no es la gran cosa en mi caso, no intento hacer una critica negativa sólo porque es la moda. Es que un montón de gente esta teniendo problemas serios y no es justo. Un amigo mío pudo jugar la BETA sin ningún problema y por ello se lo compró. Ahora no puede siquiera jugarlo con los gráficos al minimo. Esto es totalmente Injusto. No es justo que una empresa que gana millones de dolares haga esto con la gente, hay cosas que no debemos tolerar, no de empresas como ésta. Haganse escuchar para que no nos pasen por arriba y nos sigan vendiendo juegos mal optimizados, nos engañen, y vendan juegos por partes.","November 7, 2015","false","211.8"," 156 of 257 people (61%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","61","156","257","11","19"

The everlong health regen is terrible. The insanely fast hits from the zombies dont help either.\n\n[Personal Proformance Experience]\nThe stuttering is also terrible and ruinning my overall experience with this game. I encounter a fps drop to 8(???) and back to 60 for a breif second then again for about 5-10 seconds. This is also immediately followed by a connection issue and ping spikes to 400.

Unlike the past few CoDs that have come out which felt gimmicky and crammed with unnecessary features, Black Ops 3's multiplayer feels more simplistic and reminiscent of the older CoDs yet still manages to keep newer features like the jetpack from AW. To my surprise, it took less than a second to find a game in Australia at 5 am with a ping of 40ms; it seems as if there's already a large amount of players which is great considering it took forever to find a game in ghosts (understandably). I can easily see myself playing this like I did black ops 1.\n\nZombies... Zombies i'm not too sure about, I didn't play much of it and I did play it solo, but it was really complicated. I didn't understand what was going on or where I was (probably due to it being the first time I ever played it). I dislike the way zombies has become more fantasy than reality; they've allowed you to go into beast mode which allows you to turn into a giant slug, they've also added new perks and consumables which come in the form or gum balls or new perk-a-cola machines such as 'widowers wine'. I haven't made my mind up on it but based on the map alone, it's definitely not as bad as Black Ops 2's zombie mode and I honestly think it will be fun once I learn the map and how things work especially if it's with a couple of mates.\n\nAs for the campaign, much like Black Ops 2 and AW, its set in the future and though it is fun to play, the storyline was dull.I was hoping for it to pick up where black ops 2 left off as 2 did with black ops 1. There was a reference to Raul Menendez and the nova 6 gas which was interesting and unexpected. I found that completing the campaign on the veteran difficulty seemed easier that previous call of duty games, probably because they've added another difficulty, 'realistic' which I've yet to try out. They've also introduced zombies into the campaign in the form of a new game mode called 'nightmares' which was unlocked after completing the campaign and is probably my favourite part of black ops 3. It's basically the campaign retold to include zombies with a new and separate storyline.\n\nAfter the release of Black Ops 2, Ghosts and Advanced Warfare I was really hesitant to buy Black Ops 3 but I'm glad I did. Overall I've really enjoyed black ops 3, it's good to finally play a decent CoD game again. Would definitely recommend.\n","November 10, 2015","true","77.0"," 209 of 354 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","209","354","10","1"

I play at 1440 and have a 144Hz monitor, so I do have a lot of settings turned down so that I can get to those high frame-rates (I should also mention that I play at an FoV of 100), but it still looks fine and this is nothing unique to Black Ops 3.\n\nThe campaign was fun, very crazy story that really caught me off guard. The zombie mode is complex and very cool. The nightmares are a nice bit of fun as well when you want a less complex zombie killing time. And of course, there's the multiplayer, which is you're usual bit of chaotic CoD stuff. It does run great, the dedicated servers are great quality and I have had almost no issues with connection quality. The gameplay is balanced, the customization system is very open allowing you to truly make a loadout that fits your play-style, the map design is fantastic, and the point streaks are balanced and nowhere near as powerfull as they have been in previous CoD titles.\n\nDon't listen to the bandwagon of hate.

Last patch was Nov 5.\n\nDisregarding the performance issues Call of Duty Black ops 3 is almost exactly what you would expect from a recent call of duty games with a few additions.\nSingle player is pretty basic, choose a face you want to be your soldier and move onto the shooting. Something I really disliked though was how the AI for single player hasn't changed from older call of duty's, your always playing around cover, normally this would be understableable, but now you can wall run and slide boost to move around, these are amazing features that barely get utlitized because if you go for a wall run to kill a guy hiding behind a box hes just going to poke his head out, shoot you alongside his other buddies and you died, Please try again from hopefully a near by checkpoint. You can level up in the singleplayer, choose special enhancements and modify your guns before missions, even got a shelf with all the collectibles you've found.\n\nMultiplayer\nIts your standard call of duty, you jump in and kill people. As of writing this review other gamemodes that are not team deathmatch are sadly dead on arrival, I waited 15 miniutes for a hardpoint match only for the other team to leave right at the start. I haven't tried the arena (ranked) game mode but I would assume its doing fine as it cycles through game modes.\nSo you queue for team deathmatch or what ever game mode and get in, choose your weapon shoot some people, get shot. Wall run and thrust jump around. you level up, now you have an unlock token that can be spent on specialst which is basically a scorestreak that fills up over time even if your losing badly. The unlock tokens can also buy other scorestreak's, guns and perks when you reach the level to unlock them. Basic call of duty stuff really. Problem is damage in the game seems to be semi random and inconsistiant. You will come up on a guy with his back to you, unload on to him. He will panic jump and turn around after eatting 10+ bullets, shoot you twice and your dead. Other times you will come up on the same thing again and yet you'll kill him. Or you'll be in his place and some how turn the tides. I would love to say surviving or getting a kill this is great but every time I've survived I've just said "I should have died."\n\n\nZombies, I can't say anything about because I played one solo match, got to wave 4, died because I was adjusting mouse senestivity.\n\nSomething I'm not sure where to add is the wall running feature. at first its cool, its neat its a nice way to move around the maps. Then it starts to get annoying. Wall running isn't hard. Its easy to pull off, Just walk up to a wall, jump or walk off an edge while walking in the wall and your wall running, no button pressed, just started running. this is a problem because its not tied to a button, if you get in a fire fight, and jump and strafe to the left attempting to avoid someone firing at you, you suddenly hit the wall and the game decides "ITS WALL RUNNING TIME." and you begin wall running forward, but if you didn't want to wall run the only other choice you have is to jump off which pushes you forward, or stop and wait till you hit the ground. Yes. hit the ground, if you try to move away from the wall before you hit the ground or somewhere away from the wall you'll start up again or its to late your already off the wall and just falling, not moving very fast.\n\nWhile I still enjoy the game now in its current state I couldn't recommend it to anyone for the price point. If performance issues get some patches I would say take a look at the fourms or see what was in the patches to see if anything has changed then either giving it a try or diving straight in.","November 8, 2015","false","35.0"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

The workarounds are to drop your settings low enough to get a very high fps (>150 was good), which is unacceptable, use Vsync (which introduces input lag anyway, just no where near as much but enough to not play), or to lock your framerate to just below your monitors refresh rate, but that ended up introducing stuttering for some reason.\n\nFor now, spend your money elsewhere.\n\nI'll update this if they fix it, but I'm guessing it's baked pretty heavily into the engine and will be no easy task to fix.\n\nBeyond that issue, there does look to be some interesting features and some nice, in depth gun customisation, but unfortunately that is all for naught until the game is in a playable state.","November 5, 2015","false","19.5"," 245 of 423 people (58%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","58","245","423","31","15"

Treyarch might fix some of the performance issues, that this game sadly suffers from. I have some pretty powerful specs under the hood, as for example: GTX970 w/4GB of VRAM, and an intel core i54460 clocked at 3.2Ghz. And there are still performance issues! even tho it handles BF4 and GTA V at Ultra settings 1080p, perfectly...\n\nThe campaign isn't good at all. The storyline is not really connected to Black Ops 1 or 2.\nThere is made 1 reference to the old Black Ops, nothing more. Plus the story is ♥♥♥♥ed up basically. You just get thrown around to places where the main objective is just, Run n' Gun.\n\nMultiplayer is solid. (Sort of) It also suffers from some of the lag spikes that occurs from time to time. But it is not nearly as good as the other Black Ops games, in my opinion.\n\nZombies is actually pretty good, and quite a bit of fun. There is not really any performance issues, but the main drag down is that you only get ONE map, unless you buy the season pass. Then you would also get "The Giant"\n\nOverall Black Ops 3 is not very good right now. I really think Treyarch screwed us PC gamers over, considering the Xbox One runs it at 900p 60fps fluently, and the PS4 running it at 1080p 60fps fluently. So even if you have a much better PC, it will still run better on the consoles.\n\nI just really hope that Treyarch will fix the performance issues, and add some more content to the Zombies gamemode, wich really is the best thing about Black Ops 3 right now...","November 8, 2015","false","29.5"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","1"

Call of Duty: Black Ops III hosts a large range of new features from a long sought after zombies campaign, to a fleshed out new multiplayer mode in which players are able to take the reigns of 9 elite specialist classes paving the way for a brand new Call Of Duty experience.\n\nFor those who are unaware the Black Ops series follows several secretive Black Ops agents as they are imbued with a number of weapons and abilities whether they be past or future, in order to undertake government ordered missions regarding top-secret enemies. Call of Duty: Black Ops III takes place in 2065, 40 years after the events of Black Ops II and sees players take the role of an augmented Black Ops agent as they traverse the technology dependants plains of the globe, in an attempt to thwart an AI, and liberate its prisoners.\n\nBlack Ops 3’s story begins as players are tasked with liberating an enemy dominated missile silo, in an attempt to eliminate an encroaching airborne target. However, the objective swiftly takes a turn for the worst as players are plunged into a near death scenario by an unstable robotic foot soldier, in the midst of an extraction. Following this players are lunged into several simulations in which they are tasked with stopping a secretive organization from eliminating a crucial robotic delivery.\n\nIn addition to this, the title sees the debut of several new sound features, allowing players to seamlessly detect nearing foes, or escape an oncoming zombie. However, this new sound quality not only allows players to detect enemies drastically easier, but also allows them to distinguish a range of guns and other weapons throughout the title, imploring players to utilize more stealth tactics and attacks.\n\nStraying from prior titles in the acclaimed Treyarch story arc, Call of Duty: Black Ops III implements a large emphasis on multiple player story missions, as each map and campaign area employ several new features and perks only available to those who delve into the title’s cooperative mode. Unfortunately, this gameplay element is not without its issues as players are constantly subjected to a number of issues ranging from mere damage alterations to often tedious matchmaking sessions.\n\nUnfortunately as with many of other modern FPS titles, Call of Duty: Black Ops III boasts little replay value as players are commonly faced by a number of repetitive and tedious levels and characters as they traverse the title’s campaign. This not only paves the way for little replay value but also causes co-op sessions to grow boring and pointless if elongated.\n\nHowever, Treyarch has answered fans pleas for a Zombies campaign, with the debut of nightmare mode, in which players take the reigns of a genetically altered and immune soldier, as they traverse the zombie owned streets of the US, in an attempt to retrieve a cure, and eliminate the undead hordes. Not only does this mode allow for a fleshed out zombies storyline, but also hosts an incentive to complete the title’s often exciting campaign as this mode may only be acquired once players reach the culmination of the title’s main story.\n\nIn addition to this zombies campaign, the title’s classic undead mode yet again surpasses the expectations of fans whilst implementing a drastically larger map than other titles, alongside a myriad of new foes ranging from the fierce Magwa, to the regular zombie. This new enemy diversity and map scale consistently puts a strong emphasis on teamwork as players are often forced to remain with their partners in order to compile ritual elements, or eliminate a map boss.\n\nIn order to cater to this new map size Call of Duty: Black Ops III’s graphical status also surpasses that of prior titles in the acclaimed series, allowing far more detailed and spread out levels in both Zombies and campaign as well as more detailed adversaries, ranging from the mere human foot soldier, to a horde of vicious, relentless robotic foes. Not only does this upgraded graphical level allow gamers to more thoroughly assess their target, but also allows for several new traversal options, such as Shadows Of Evil’s suspended tram.\n\nAs engaging and fun as the story campaign is, the real meat of the Black Ops 3 experience is, unsurprisingly, found in its competitive multiplayer suite. Treyarch has done a great job of making the multiplayer more accessible through innovations like the new Freerun mode and the return of the “Pick 10” create-a-class system which balances freedom of choice with a smaller, more focused selection of different weapons, tactical tools, and perks.\n\nHardcore competitive players will find plenty of new features to love as well, including the optional eSports-oriented “Specialist Draft” and “Ban/Protect” systems which, when paired with the new roster of playable Specialists, make the competitive multiplayer function in a similar fashion to popular MOBA games like League of Legends. The Specialists themselves cover a wide range of playstyles, allowing players to pick a Specialist they feel is most suited for a given mode or simply pick the ones which are most aestheticly pleasing to them. Since each Specialist also has their own separate cosmetic unlock tree, there's also plenty of incentive to both try out different Specialists while also focusing on your favorites.\n\nAs for game modes, Black Ops 3 has plenty of familiar staples like Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, and Capture the Flag among others. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's Uplink mode also makes a return, and Black Ops 3 sees the debut of a brand new mode called Safeguard which tasks teams with taking turns defending and disabling a moving robot as it makes its way from one end of the map to the other.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III hosts a large range of new and game defining elements, from a compelling new zombie storyline to a fast new movement system, as well as fleshed out new campaign characters and diverse multiplayer specialists, making the title a must buy for both a series veterans, and new players alike.","March 30","true","204.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

I usually have 30-45 ping and in MOST games I will pump enemies with dozens of bullets, only to be taken down in one shot from the same player. The kill cam shows something completely different. Change lobbies, sometimes this problem goes away, most times it doesn't.\n\nNot to mention, at the time of writing it is 7pm on a Friday evening, about a week after release. My NAT is "open" and there is ONE half empty game of Domination available to play.\n\nI play a few games a night and at least one in five games is plagued by a hacker dominating everyone and completely ruining the experience. I have never played an online game with this much hacking and cheating.\n\nIn short, it is a laggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ game with constant disconnects and other nonesense. While fun, I will be moving on as soon as there is something else to play.\n\nI don't feel like I have got my monies worth and with the revenue this series generates, there are NO excuses for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, other than developer/publisher greed and apathy towards their customer.\n\nThese problems have been around in every COD game and are completely unacceptable. So again, ♥♥♥♥ YOU Treyarch and ♥♥♥♥ YOU Activision for not doing the right thing and skimping on your customers. You are now both on my blacklist. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo NOT buy this game. As a community, let's stop supporting these greedy and incompetant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that are happy to release products that are broken beyond belief. Where else would ANYONE put up with this?!?\n\nI get 1-2 FPS in the main menu, the MAIN MENU!\nIf I click a menu item, it takes 20 seconds to respond, then just crashes to desktop.\nRight now, this is just a worthless waste of space.\n\nEveryone involved with this game should be ashamed right now... I am ashamed for even considering it would be a half decent game, let alone buying it.\n\nActivision and Treyach, from the bottom of my heart... ♥♥♥♥ YOU.\nAs a consumer,who simply wanted to enjoy your product, ♥♥♥♥ YOU\nFor knowing the game is COMPLETELY broken on PC and releasing it anyway, ♥♥♥♥ YOU\nFor thinking it's acceptable to treat your customers like fools, ♥♥♥♥ YOU\nFor being god damn lazy and cheap with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port, ♥♥♥♥ YOU\n\nFool me once, shame on me...

Sad, really.  I've been a COD fan since the original release over 10 years ago.  However, the devs seem insanely insistent upon using the antiquated Quake engine and its inherently broken net code as the foundation for new COD releases.  Anyway, I don't need to rehash all of the well known engineering shortcomings of Treyarch et al.\n\nAs far as BO3 goes, I will start with the campaign aspect.  I will sum it up in two words:  Not Good.  I don't know what they did with the mouse interface, but, its clumsy and somewhat laggy.  None of the mouse sensitivity settings, filtering or acceleration features have any impact on the problem,\n\nThe graphics are ok and appear to be better optimized than AW.  However, they are still just a warmed over, repackaged offering of the previous COD releases.\n\nAs far as the actual campaign play itself is concerned, its bad.  There are far too many cut scenes and despite having good actors, the acting is poor and the dialogue is worse.  It seems as thought they tried too hard to make this some sort of trippy mind sch♥♥♥♥.  Overall, the campaign lacked direction and was constantly interrupted by far too many cut scenes.\n\nThe campaign story line itself is the same recycled story line that follows our fearless hero through a gauntlet of issues that have the same plot twist (the ally turned villain twist) as the last few releases.  Its tired and its time for something new.\n\nThe multiplayer experience is somewhat improved with the elimination of the ridiculous exo-suit jumping.  Weapon usage is not as efficient as AW or the previous releases.  There are still OP'd weapons and the options for perks and attachments is somewhat the same.\n\nThe inherent netcode latency is still ever present and a real downer.  Of course, that is to be expected since they are still using the antiquated Quake engine.  The lag compensation is horrible and once again, hobbles players with good systems and connections to the utter elimination of skill based kills.\n\nHowever, judging the game as a whole, its not worth the hype and is not worth the hefty $60 price tag.\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops III is just another stepping stone in the sad and tragic decline of a once great  franchise.","November 17, 2015","false","12.8"," 85 of 141 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","85","141","9","5"

The aiming felt off, it was too quick in hip fire, but when aiming down sights it slowed down way too much, I would think if you're going to make a fast paced shooter like this aiming down the sights shouldn't slow you down THAT much. I understand this game has a lot of content as far as customization goes, but my main problem with it all is that none of it feels genuine it all feels slapped together and completely random, unlocking stuff was just as confusing as the menu system I barely knew what was popping up half of the time. Regardless of all that a big part of me buying this game was to play zombies with my friends.... what the hell happened to zombies in this game? Just buy sniper elite it has a far better zombie mode than call of duty, and what the hell is nightmare? theres almost little to no explanation or easy to read description of anything in this entire game.

That is an error on my part, as I didn't play the map enough at the time to find them! They are part of the game! ***\n\nWhen I was reading up the reviews for this game, I was very concerned about buying it myself due to the excessive amount of negative reviews left by people. However, I do believe in trying out for myself instead of going off other people's words. I'm not an extreme fan of CoD, but I have so far enjoyed all of the games released by Treyach (excuse the spelling), so I thought why not give it a go.\n\nInitially, the game seemed normal. No issues on the menu or setup, all runs as it should. After starting up a private match in multiplayer to test it out, I did run into a few minor issues. Now, I'm not someone who complains about a game if I can't run it on ultra-high-realistic settings, so the fact that the game for me lagged when I had it on normal did not bother me. My computer is a fairly decent one (AMD Eight-Core processor, GTX770 and 8GB of RAM), but I still had to turn down everything to low settings, but like I said this is a minor point for me.\n\nIn regards to bugs and issues, my game does every now and then drop to 30fps for a couple of seconds, but this isn't very often. Pretty much all of the time it runs nicely at 65 frame, give or take a couple.\nI only encountered two bugs so far that caused me to get a little annoyed (however they only happened once and since then they never repeated). The first was getting a completely white screen when trying out the zombies mode for the first time, I was still able to access the menu so I quit the match, and after trying again it worked as it intended. The second one was recieving an in game error code whilst trying to access one ability on the campaign mode (can't remember the code), and it caused my game to run at 1-2fps and be unplayable. I promptly quit and restarted it, and it never appeared again so far. Overall, the bugs are not bothering me that much.\n\nGameplay wise, I find it quite enjoyable. From the things I heard about Advanced and Ghosts, this is much better and more balanced. I don't feel like there is an extremely overpowered weapon or class (just yet, I haven't encountered anything rage worthy), and the gameplay feels even. The added extra of jump boosting and wall running I feel has been done just right, and the maps are done decently. Certainly a fast paced game for sure.\n\nZombie though did annoy me a bit; there's only one map on the normal edition! I can't say much about the actual map that is there, as I only played it once successfully. It is a nice challenge though, and is quite big! It does take elements of that one Alkatraz map (I can't remember it exactly). One thing I done like personally is that fact that there are no normal perk machines, as they are replaced by a gum all machine that contains all of the chosen perks. Being able to choose your perks is also quite nice, and I guess it makes up a little bit for removing the single separate machines.\n\nOverall, unless you are dead set for ultra graphics and 120+fps and you have a mid range computer, I would say wait until they optimize it a bit more. If you don't really care about those things and want to enjoy it in a casual experience, then I don't see why you wouldn't like it.\n\nBear in mind, this is my own opinion of a more casual player than competitive.","November 10, 2015","true","103.5"," 70 of 119 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","70","119","4","0"

So Is zombies.\n\nThe problem with COD BO:III comes from two things. Poor optimization, and player base.\nI have a rig that has run the Witcher III and Fallout 4 with both graphics, games Id say were much more intense than black ops. I am lucky if I maintain over 30 frames a second on black ops with medium (30 frames being relatviely 'smooth', end everything under it varying degrees of slideshow). It's simply not enjoyable on the PC right now.\n\nThe next problem, the player base. If you're getting this game for Co-Op, buy it or play it with friends. Two days after launch, finding people for groups became difficult, if not impossible; and when you are lucky enough to find one, they play as if they're playing online and expecting to respawn the second they get gunned down (normally .04 seconds after a door opens), and they blame you for it.\n\nFor everyone who does like the tactical gameplay, just stop reading and go back to Red Orchestra. Theres nothing worth saving here.\n\nNow to process my refund.","November 11, 2015","false","7.7"," 99 of 172 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","99","172","12","7"

Bland characters and uninspired relationships between them made the story less interesting than it actually is.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Review will NOT contain spoilers regarding the story.\n\nSingleplayer\n\nStarting off really strong, it seemed like for once, after a while, Black Ops 3 went on the right track regarding the story aspect of their games.  Unfortunately, albeit the game differs from the standard Call of Duty storytelling, lack of engaging characters and caring relationships left a sour taste in my mouth after I completed the storyline. Voice acting of the 'Player' was really subpar and felt rather tedious towards the end. Black Ops 3 goes for a Bioshock Infinite or Spec Ops - The Line storytelling with its numerous plot twists and somewhat mind-♥♥♥♥ ending.\n\nPlayer gets the ability to choose the gear they start with alongside the abilities they want to use during the game which, although shakes things up a bit, doesn't really bring any sort of special excitement while in combat.\n\nOverall, even tho the singleplayer tries something different and unexpected for Call of Duty franchise, it lacks some of the core forms in order to prevail and be memorable.\n\nGraphics and optimisation\n\nCurrently rocking GTX 970 with i5 4690k and 16 GB, and when it comes to performance, I had no issues, except for the first few days of the launch, which shows the dedication of the developers to constantly improve on all fronts.\n\nGraphically, I felt it was beautiful, nothing really astonishing, but it definitely moves the bar a notch higher than previous chapters.\n\nMultiplayer and zombies\n\nAs most of you know, multiplayer is the part of the game that Call of Duty excells at. Considering this is Treyarch and how active and caring they are for the community, I felt like this game can strive for a very long time. Fluid movement, solid combat system, zombies, great maps and supportive community will guarantee this game a bright future.\n\n\nTL;DR - Black Ops 3 improves on almost every aspect compared to it's previous version, and brings even more to the table. If you're a looking for a great fast-paced first person shooter, look no further.\n\nRating: 8.5/10","February 14","true","39.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","2"

But, I feel I have to say something about the newest offering in the Call of Duty franchise. It is not what the hype made it out to be. Maybe if you are a console player, it may have redeeming qualities, but as far as a solid PC FPS, I say no.\nYou may ask, why Keyser would you say such nonsense? You LOVE CoD!\nWell, to be honest, it is like this:\n1. If CoD ghosts and Tianfall had a child, it would be named Black Ops 3.\n\n2 You have to make your gameing rig jump through hoops and perform magical tricks to get it to run, then if it makes it through the "connecting" phase, you have to become the great Sherlock Holmes to find the graphical settings to make it not look like absolute ♥♥♥♥♥, and hold frames so it is not an animated flipbook.\n\n3. Your mouse will do crazy things.\n\n4. Hate to say but Advanced Warfare is much better than BO3. There is a clunkiness to all movements, and hit detection is a joke. AW has much more customization and a better prestige ladder.\n\n5. Oh, you like Hard Core modes? GTFO and wank in a corner. Yes, TDMHC has the wait to respawn mechanic. AND HCDOM has been totally omitted. Thank you for removing my favorite game mode Treyarch.\n\nI would refund for the deluxe package but I made the mistake of giving this game a chance.\nMaybe they can patch the crap out of it as is the norm with all modern PC games. They like to sell unfinished products, and string along the consumer taunting fixes for something that should have been right to start.  If we are going to pay $100 for something, make sure it is good, and deserving of our hard earned dosh.\n\nAnd by the way, before you go off on a "this is a console port" rant, aren't the games MADE ON A PC to start with? So shouldnt it function properly on a PC? And what kind of 1 off PC do they test these things on? They use the latest tech and Nvidia/AMD offerings, which most of the gaming base does not have access to.\n\nPurchase if you think you have the best PC evar, and like Call of Duty games. Otherwise, go get Fallout 4.\n\nI'm finished with this review for now. If you would like to leave me a message or your thoughts on anything I mentioned here, feel free.\n\nHave a great day.\n\nAfter two months of playing around with settings, and patches / Updates being released, I wanted to update this review and say thatBlack Ops 3 is redeeming its self. But, I have to say the game is now, what it should have been on realease. I should not have to buy a un finished game and then hope it gets patched down the line.\nAs I said before, if you like the CoD series, purchase and carry on.\n\nUPDATE: Finally.

(8 hrs gametime)\n\nIs it good ? Is it bad? Is it the same as the other ones ?\nBasically, it's one of everything.\nCall of Duty Black Ops 3, is not a game everyone was cheering for ,especially on pc, but it has its place in the gaming community and I enjoy playing it to some extend.\nI picked this game up for roughly 35€ and from what I've seen so far, it is a pretty ok deal. Atleast I think it is..\nI bought this game, because I wanted a shooter where you don't have to use your brain to be practically good at it, and where I can turn it off completly and enjoy some music with it. I must say CoD is pretty good at this :p\n\nThe base game delivers 12 maps, including 2 horrible ones, 4-5 good ones, and some pretty OK to bad maps.\nThis is a pretty fair mappool for 35€ and I hope they will offer some free maps for everyone in the future.\nYou get to choose between severval guns, just like in the other games. Assault Rifles, Smg's, Lmg's, shotguns and sniper rifles, also there are pistoles, 2 launchers I think and the combat knife as secondaries.\n\nTo sum it up: Smg's are the way to go in this game, the rifles do fairly good, depends on the one you choose, lmg's are way to slow, shotguns are ♥♥♥♥ as in every other cod game and the snipers are only somewhat good on the 2-3 big maps we have.\n\nThe classsystem didn't really change, some perks got switched out, but you will not see anything new here. Same for the nades and stuff, they just call them differently, with some exceptions like the thermite.\n\nWe got several gamemodes to choose from again, but no new ones yet. There is some escort mode or something, but I'm not sure if we already had this gamemode in some CoD.\n\nPros:\n- Improved Exosystem from Advanced Warfare, but it is still a bit buggy sometimes.\n- The hitdetection is pretty solid\n- No disconnects and dedicated servers (hurray!)\n- FOV slider\n- Plenty of options\n- Gunsmith and huge customization available\n- The game looks fairly realistic, perfect for an arcade-style military shooter like CoD\n- No annoying Noobtubes and perks and ♥♥♥♥ yet, even though I have to admit I stopped giving a damn about this\n- The new specialists are pretty cool\n\nCons:\n- All the maps feel really similar, nothing spectacular\n- The maps are NOT suited for the new movement system.\n- ALOT of invisible walls, and places you can't go to with your exo\n- Overall bad mapdesign, except for Redwood, this one is pretty well done! More of this please + make more use of the exo :(\n- The gun-balancing is not the best. If you don't use a smg, you are pretty much screwed on most of the maps\n- Really bad optimzation; weird bugs like blue screen (just a bluescreen, no crash) after a match is over\n- No serverbrowser\n- No new weapons in particular. You got your MP5, AK47, M4, and some blackops2 weapons. All of them have some new cool names and models!\n- The weapon sounds are pretty dull and unconvincing\n- There are killstreaks in this game, I mean "Scorestreaks" of course...\n\nHOW CAN THIS GAME IMPROVE ?\n\nIn my opinion the problem with this game is not the fear of doing something new, but rather on keeping on the old stuff we already had back in Cod4.\nIf we look at Cod4, we see a really slow game. We got our claymores and nades, the helicopter and the airstrikes, the UAV and stuff. Some pretty strong and rewarding killstreaks in this type of game.\nIf we look at Black Ops 3, we see a quite faster game with slow mechanics in it. The Maps get really small, and enemys are around every corner. It went from a somewhat tacitcal shooter, to a fast paced arena-shooter like quake or unreal tournament.\nWhat doesn't fit into such type of games:\nInvisible walls, Killstreaks, claymores, stun nades, launchers, ect.\n\nFor example the enemy has an attack helicopter and you want to take it down. First of all you need to take out your rocket launcher. Most of the time you get killed if you do that, by either the helicopter itself or the enemy rushing your location.\nThe worst part about this is, the helicopter, if you even manage to get a rocket off. Does take like 2 or more hits to take down!\nThis breaks the pace of the game and results in a bad game for the players getting spawnraped ( this is not fun ).\n\nTo sum it up: Call of Duty Black ops 3 is a game I do NOT recommend to pick up at this price. If I were you, I would wait for the free weekend and decide on this.\nThey went overboard on promoting again, but they don't deliver as you expect.\nIt's like ordering from a pizzaplace which is known for its perfect crust, but you get a sloppy unseasoned piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThanks for reading :)","November 9, 2015","false","145.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

I truly do thoroughly enjoy the game (what I can, at least). The graphics are phenomenal, and the plot, so far as I've made it, is equally as spectacular. The amount of customization available - from weapon attachments to tactical rigs to cybernetics - enhances your immersion in the game, truly making the main player unique to each individual.\n\nNow, for the bad.\n\nMy PC boasts 3x GTX 980s (totaling 12GB of VRAM) all overclocked by about 20%, 16GB of DDR4 2133Mhz RAM, a Samsung 850 Pro SSD, and an i7 5930K, playing the game on a 27" 4k monitor. I use the LCD screen on my Logitech G19S keyboard during gameplay to show my RAM usage, and this game continually maxes my RAM usage, causing stuttering in game. I have the FPS Counter on, and I'm continually between 70-90 FPS; alas, the stuttering continues. As soon as I close the game, my RAM usage drops down to about 5%.\n\nI'm on about the 10th mission at the moment, but I'm done for now.

Yes is the answer, I regret it more that getting caught at 17 drunkenly on cctv with my pants down around my ankles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up the front door of the local constabulary.\n\nThe game just hasn't changed for the better, the Graphics are so poor and the gameplay is so boring and used, there just doesn’t feel like there has been any passion put into creating this game, the maps are forgettable and bunny hopping instead of being frowned upon has been implemented as a key part of the game.\n\nI really could spend the rest of my evening vetting my utter frustration and rage at how poor this game is compared to others on the market but I'm not, I am not going to even list Pro/Cons as I feel the only way I can really end this review is with the following statement.\n\nIf you are happy spending your hard earnt money on the Call of duty franchise year after year, then good for you.

Treyarch has done some great stuff with the Call of Duty franchise over the years and from all the stuff I had seen so far, Black Ops 3 wasn't going to dissapoint. Sadly, it did. To start things off, I've never had a game run so poorly before. My frames are all over the place with drops more frequent than a positive review of this game. The performance was bad enough, but trying to do anything in game with a mouse and keyboard is near impossible. I'm getting tons of mouse input lag and there doesn't seem to be a single way to get an accurate mouse sensitivity amount in the settings. There are also some very strange graphical errors ( I hope they're errors) that are really getting on my nerves and make the game extremely annoying to try and play. One of the errors is when playing zombies, on shadow of evil, the characters arms are very visible when aiming down sites. When I say very visible I mean VERY VISIBLE, literally 1/3 of the screen is taken up by it. Not just the arms eaither pieces of their shirts obscure side vision and its just very messy. I've tried messing with FOV and still to no avail.

I have a GeForce 650 (which is nowhere near the best) and I have to run it on low setting, I'm fine with this because the game looks VERY similar regardless of how good your quality is. Me personally, if I can get 60 FPS on BO3(which I do), then I couldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ what it looks like. If you want this game to look great, then buy a $2000 dollar graphics card, or you can buy the console version (btw PS4 gets DLCs a month earlier too). Stop giving this game bad reviews because your ♥♥♥♥ computer can't run it. Go ahead and dislike the ♥♥♥♥ out of this review just like everyone else that dislikes and kind of positive review.","November 7, 2015","true","142.5"," 121 of 215 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","121","215","14","6"

I've tried to force myself to come to like it. I regret buying this game unfortunately. The only time I come back to it is to hop on a game of Zombies with friends, which wasn't worth the £39.99 I payed for this game. Yes, it's fun for the first 5 - 10 hours, afterwards it just becomes a regular old Call of Duty game again, which I grew out of after Black Ops 1. Couldn't even bring myself to finish the campaign, it's the same exact cliche CoD story, good guy goes bad. However, the Multiplayer I enjoyed until I reached about 16 hours play-time on the game. I will admit, I like the idea of different classes, but the Firebreak speciliast is just completely overpowered. Trust  me when I say this, that thing is a complete morale-killer. To be honest, the real reason I bought this game was just to experience a new Call of Duty which I really need to stop doing as they (in my opinion) get worse every year.\n\nI strongly inform you not to buy this game. Yes, it has it's fun moments but without friends to have fun with, it's depressing in a way.

Fully as a game, gameplay, handling of said gameplay, sustaining of once again said gameplay. But for now I'll just deal with that part where I spent $60 on something that kinda works...... Looks really good while it does. But I have more time on my hands to type this....... So........ Treyarch, Ball is in your court.\nI figure there's going to be a few patches needed. From the forum post that I have read this game has a nasty habit of running a person's CPU high and or crashing their video card. Seems like a few technical  glitches that will patch out in the next week. with more system patches coming. If this is anything like the previous installments. My total 3hrs of game play is me forcing the game to play through the freeze.\nIt's kinda hard to recommend at this point. With all of the bugs.\nAs of NOV 19, 2015 after the first few patches. I feel your getting close Treyarch to having a successor to the Black Ops family. But.\nThe over all performace of this game is..... Well first I have to be able to play a full mission maybe without being to greedy. A few missions in succession without isssues. Fair enough Treyarch?\nAlso I'm going to attempt to run this game again, thus pushing my total in game time above 4hrs. All spent mostly trying to get the game to work. This title has a lot to offer returning players & new players to the Black Op's games. As seen on YouTube..\nAs you see after writing this I'm still stuck at 3.9hrs.

Stupidly I thought I wouldnt find anything very easily..\nI havent been able to actually play this game on my overclocked gtx 970 4 gb vram, 8gb ram, i5 rig because it cant get past the animation on the start up. I even used safe boot mode, this didnt work either.\nThe reason why I say it is a fun game is because I have played it a few times round my friends (who use consoles); it was pretty good in the zombies mode and multiplayer was alright. Not as good as the cod 4 to black ops 1 section of the series. One of the things I really dislike about the game is how I genuinely thought I was playing advanced warfare because the games are exactly the same which really confused me.\n\nTo conclude this game is not worth even their sale value because from what I see of people being able to get the game to start, it doesnt run properly ever. Not only this but you should never support such a greedy company like treyarch or whoever makes these terrible games these days because of their attude towards us pc gamers.\nHowever there is some good news, if you do want to play the game, you can always grab a 'next gen' console and get a solid 24 fps at 720p, I heard thats good too.\n\nThanks for reading :)","May 15","false","0.2"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","23","36","3","7"

I used to play on 60-90fps high-extra settings on AW when it first came out, after the patches on AW I went down to medium-high settings. BO3 beta was basically the same, but BO3 in it's current state gives me 60 fps with an occasional drop on low settings. Does BO3 look any better than AW? NOPE, but it requires more resources, It wouldn't suprise me if they're just adding code filling to make the game seem next-gen/graphically intensive.. especially since pirated AW could run on far lower specs than the legal version... I regret my purchase so much, playing this game is just depressing, but I feel like I have to get my money's worth and play it. I played since MW, on console, which was fun as hell. But the CODs after MW are just losing quality with each release. Maybe the COD formula just got boring to me, but B03 has features like paintshop that don't work 50% of the time.. The game itself crashes when I close it sometimes and it always has a lingering effect on my system's resources a couple minutes after closing it. Sure, they announced modding/mapping tools that MIGHT (It'll probably get delayed) come out March 2016 in CLOSED ALPHA. The final product will probably come out when BO4 or whatever the fudge they decide to call it comes out. This is my last COD, activison sucks, I bought this and didn't return it, since Treyarch usually makes great ports (look at BO and BO2) and allowed myself to play over 2 hours. You're paying 60$, not including DLC, for a reskin with slightly different movement and headaches, every gun is identical to some gun in a previous COD, gg activision, your cash cow is gonna die soon anyways, at least on PC.","December 26, 2015","false","57.8"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","24","39","2","3"

I would personally reccomend this game to anyone who has like previous black ops games but maybe wanted a new spin on them.   7/10","January 18","true","251.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I've set a cap of 59 fps because theres weird input lag if your fps is above or even below the refresh rate of your monitor.\n\nI've been able to mostly keep the cap of 59 fps with a mix if high to medium settings, with some weird drops because of the rediculous cpu usage. The core gameplay content is enormous though and with modding support being added sometime in 2016, this game will have an infinite amount of content for countless hours of [zombies] gameplay. If you have a decent pc, I would recommend getting this now.\n\nI've had 1 crash so far and 1 disconnect, that was due to treyarch and my other disconnect is due to my internet. If you have a mid range pc or mid to low with a 750 ti for example, I would say to wait a month or two until treyarch can push out a major performance patch.\n\nIt's a shame this game is plagued by performance issues as the core content is really great, I mean they made a whole zombies campaign that fans have been asking for since its inception with world at war. Theres gobblegums which add a nice dimension to zombies and weapon kits which is really cool.\n\nI haven't played too much of campaign, but I'd hazard a guess that its your generic cod campaign with turret segments.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, very quick.\n\nTL;DR Content is there, performance wise its lacking. Only get it now if you have a beefy pc, otherwise refund and wait for patches to fix performance issues.","November 13, 2015","true","683.3"," 30 of 51 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","30","51","2","1"

The game is a mess, with slow rendering textures, stutters and massive FPS drops. My rig destroys PS4 and Xbox one, but this game on PC is quite clearly a rushed job. This is the same issue that Batman Arkham Knight had, not sure if the company outsourced the game to others, or they just didn’t put the time into the PC version as they did the consoles. Either way it's a disgrace and should be taken down until they fix it, if that’s even possible.\n\nIn future if a company can’t be bothered to properly develop a game for PC, then just don’t bother.

First of all, the game randomly slows down to an unbearable stutter for no apparent reason just to be working completely fine in the same scenery, same settings after restart or death or just because "f**k you, that's why".\nThe game feels glitchy with bits of game-engine based scenes flashing occasionally inbetween cutscenes or sometimes for no apparent reasons. AI is probably the worst I've seen in an FPS game in a long stretch. Computer opponents just stand still most of the cases. Friendlies sometimes stop and stare at walls... Textures look incredibly pixelated (or sometimes are just missing!) on any setting below "Extra" and explosions are sets of flat animated sprites that sometimes look funny when occuring on small surfaces where it just looks like taken straight from Doom 1 :). Sometimes you do see flickering, stretched polygons instead of textures or sprites. Story feels incredibly fragmented with vaguely associated episodes. The worst bit so far is the voice-over tho. Sounds absolutely fake and lacklustre, and is quite obiously recorded in fragments with VO actors not seeing the actual game during a session. Many times I was under an impression that the VO doesn't really match what I'm seeing on screen. Absolutely horrid.\n\nAs a big and long-time fan I have to admit that it's probably the worst Call of Duty game I've played so far. What makes things even worse is the fact that in the main menu there's a button that blatantly says "Coming Soon" being almost a spit in the face from the Dev saying "Yes we didn't finish the game for which you've paid the full price. Whaddya gonna do about it?".","November 6, 2015","false","21.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

It's same but this is what makes it good\n\nCons:\n✘Scenario is weak. Characters are not memorable at all\n✘Voice-acting is average. Nothing special comparing to Black Ops 2\n✘Only 1 zombie map without Deluxe Edition\n✘Campaign is not built for coop mode\n✘Optimization was very poor. Seems fixed for me now, but still it is a shame what after 3 years 3arc cant simply optimize the game on this old engine\n✘Boring MP maps. They are not adapted to new movement mechanic\n✘Some balance problems in MP\n✘Large SP levels are empty, there is nothing to explore\n\nSince I am a COD fanboy this game worth 60$ for me. But I feel kinda dissapointed. I thought what after 3 years of development 3arc will made a game that would be a worthy succesor of Black Ops 2.

The Multiplayer is a blast. The specialists are very cool. A couple of my favorite are the REAPER and Purifier. With Bo3 doing 2XP about every other week, it can be very easy to level up and catch up in rank with the other Black Ops 3 Veterans.  With the first DLC coming out in just a few short weeks, I can’t express how much fun I will have on the new maps they’re bringing in this DLC and the other DLC yet to come!\n\n\nHowever with Multiplayer being great, I have few complaints about the campaign.  I feel like it has a few bugs that can be annoying. Things like you can’t run alongside a wall or mission progress not saving. All of the Black Ops stories never made as much sense as the Modern Warfare series did. At least for me. I still like the Black Ops stories, but I feel like they don’t fully explain things 100%.  Overall, the campaign had many cool things about it.\n\nFor anyone who has had worries about their system not working, it ran fine on my Lenovo Y40-70 laptop. Specs are on my profile. But the graphics in this game didn’t look that great on low-medium compared to previous CoD games.  That is the only other complaint I have.\n\nDespite the few campaign issues I had, I still highly recommend this.

This game has so many issues and I'm not just talking about the PC version neither. I also own this game on Console (Next and old gen) Only to still be disappointed with issues that should have really put into consideration.\nThings like servers repeated and constantly disconnecting random texture glitches terrible Frame rate on console and even Pc at certain points.\nI'm not writing this because I hate the franchise or think the series was better without jump packs. I'm writing this because of the broken system the game is in now. Things like the supply drop system was fine at first because of the fact it was a free "Slot machine" like way of getting new skins. But now it's been destroyed because of the fact they added new weapons that are slightly more powerful than the default weapons you can unlock while you level up in multiplayer. (I'm looking at you Shadow Claw and the MX-Garand)\n\nNow I'm not going to lie to you I got this game as a gift from a friend. But I payed for the other two versions. But I feel slightly bad for him consider he payed Full price for the game.\n\nAlso the PC version of the game is running issues? ( This is the reason I'm writing the review) Now my PC could run this game perfectly. But after my hard drive Crashed and I got a new one and upgraded the windows on it it has completely stopped running.\n\nNow finally these are some small issues with the game,\nShould this really have been called black ops 3? I mean it has nothing to do with the other two games.\n\nMy final opinion of the game.\n\nThe game isn't as bad as people say it is. But I wouldn't recommend this as your first Call of Duty game. Try out Either the Modern Warefare Series or maybe the original black ops games.\n","May 14","false","27.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Quite literally once played it goes deep into your computer and sucks it dry. After starting this steaming pile of horse turd, my pc memory usage goes up to 95%. For flip sake 95% of 20gb ram being used for a game?!?! Worst part is, the game even after closure causes the system to go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and start having a seizure.\n\nMY SPECS:\nIntel Core i7 4790k OC'd to 4.6ghz\nNvidia Geforce gtx 980 ti clocked to about 1178mhz\n20gb of ddr3 1333mhz ram\n\nNow, the settings I play this cancer on:\nResolution 800x600\nResolution scale 50%\nEverything else, lowest possible settings\n\nCan you believe even on these settings I do not get a solid 60, in shootouts (nearly always as to the nature of the game) my fps drops under 10fps!!! If anyone could please tell me how to get this SOB of a game working then I'd be really happy, I have yet to play a port worse than this, and oh yes I've played Unity, I can at least get 40-60 on highest settings there. Now bear in mind, this isn't a review on how good the game is itself, it's a review on the ♥♥♥♥ING DISGUSTING PERFORMANCE. Avoid if you have specs similar to mine because I've heard that other people can run it perfectly on lower specs, I assume it may be a specific problem to higher end computers???\n\n10/10 will infect my pc with aids again.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate as of 18/11/15:\nNow that finally all the performance problems have been fixed (constant 60fps on a DSR) I can finally play the god damn game to review it, I will eventually get round to it.","November 8, 2015","false","20.6"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","18","29","4","4"

The game goes like this all the time:\n\n-Start the game\n\n-Go into multiplayer\n\n-Start searching for a match\n\n-Game is about to start\n\n-Loading\n\n-Start\n\n-Chooses a gun\n\n-Runs into a enemy\n\n-Gets shotgunned\n\n-Goes on like nothing happended\n\n-Finds a enemy\n\n-Another enemy who is camping in a corner hardscoopes me\n\n-Slight annoyed but doesn't mind\n\n-Finally gets a kill\n\n-Going on with a good scorestreak\n\n-Gets called hacker and words\n\n-Ignore the cry babies\n\n-100 points away from RAPS\n\n-Enemy is camping in a corner\n\n-Catches me off guard and shotgunned me\n\n-About to break my monitor\n\n-Gives one last try\n\n-Going with a good score streak again\n\n-Gets hardscoped by a noob\n\n-RAGE QUITS!!\n\nThis is how the game goes for me at least, there is other bad things too about this, like WTF is the stupid black market for, getting new goodies. NO! Its a rip off to mine some money from the players and even if you get a gun or sometihing, you would must likely have used 100 dollars, for an average SMG or stupid meele knife.\nThen there are people out there who only play one map and spam the heck out of it, like Nuketown for example. A lot of campers too and to many NOOBgun users.\n\nI have like 100 hours on this game. and that is mainly because I did enjoy at one point and I still do, if I am lucky and get into good match, with good player I can most likely play for about 3-4 rounds and then it gets boring. Even the zombies isn't that good or fun to play, Black ops 1 for me persoanlly had the best zombies after Black Ops 2. so honestly guys if you want a good Call of Duty game, buy Black Ops 2, because this is not a game worth your time and its certainly not worth the full price either, so if you are going to buy it, do it when there are sales.\nOverall score:\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumb up! :)\n\nOverall score:  4/10","May 14","false","117.3"," 49 of 88 people (56%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","56","49","88","16","0"

Are there connection issues and optimization headaches? Yeah. Just like every other damn COD title. While there are problems with the game (like any other game, lol) over half of the reviews on this game are exaggerated or reviewed by teens trying to play BO3 on a machine that's only fit to handle games like tetris or minesweeper.\n\nThe massive COD hate train will bash the game and at the same time give BO3 a $550 million release paycheck. If they were smart and really hated the game, they wouldn't give COD a moment of their time. And if COD was as bad as the hate train claims, no one would be buying their ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAnyways, the game is fun. It's just like other COD games just with a little extra ♥♥♥♥ added. Surprised? But hey, if COD is something you've enjoyed over the many years, you'll like BO3.\n\nSome neat stuff that was added:\n\n- Many different characters (Specialists) to choose from. Each one has 2 special abilities you can unlock. You can only use one ability in a game. This is probably the biggest addition because there's a lot of variety of abilities.\n\n- TONS of new calling cards. This may seem irrelevant but there are an insane amount of calling cards with a lot of different art styles. Including some pretty ballin animated ones.\n\n- Cases. You earn "Cryptokeys" (1-2 from my experience) per match (playing a full match is better rather than playing half a match). For 10 keys you can open a common case, for 30 keys you can open a rare case. Rare cases guarantee a rare item in them. Each case will contain 3 items. There's common, rare, epic, legendary items. Everything from camos, taunts, decals, gear, calling cards, etc.\n\n\nI could go on but I'm tired of typing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StillBlaze/recommended/311210/","StillBlaze","John 'Blaze' Rambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StillBlaze/","137 products in account","One month and 172 hours it is finally time, time to give a review of the Black Ops III multiplayer game I have been so engorged in to this moment. Why multiplayer only you might ask? Because the game has been so enjoyable that the Campaign to which I am usually fully immersed in has been an afterthought.\n\nBlack Ops III is fun plain and simple! As much as I want to hate on the franchise from its disappointing releases I just can't dislike this game in full. The core gameplay is done well and often great which is something I couldn’t say for most triple A titles released in the past few years to which I have played.\n\nWhere to start? This is the hard part as there's so many things I just want to say are awesome from the weapons to the maps and game modes so let's just go over that.\n\nThe weapons in Black Ops III are all quite simplistic to use in basic gameplay while each presenting a slightly different advantage in different gun fight situations and play styles. Each SMG can be used quite similar in combat but at the same time offer a different feeling to the user the more you figure out its slight strengths or weaknesses as long with your own. This feeling of equality yet individuality extends to the Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Light Machine Guns and Snipers a like. The variety in attachments is also one to be mentioned in that each weapon can be built differently for different strengths and play styles and at the same time each weapon can also follow a similar principle rule and in the end all be competitive in their own right. When you exclude the right time right place situations where each weapons dominate I truly believe everything can be enjoyed and used to conquer the server and or objective. As a Counter-Strike player I can say that this is fun and quite nice that I can change it up depending on how I feel rather than using the same few weapons kill after kill and death after death.\n\nThe Maps in Black Ops III present everything I looking for in a casual shooter and much more. The maps are well balanced and unique mostly in their own right, not just in scenery but also in design and gameplay. Do you enjoy Sniping mid? Taking long range gun battles? Sitting around mid map with the option to rotate forward or back? Flanking left or right to any part of the map or even sneaking through middle? Close quarter combat with plenty of objects and divisions to play technical and fast? This game has it all and I really cannot put in words the detail of the variety of situations and positions this game can put you in as you read my mess above. The game is always offering multiple paths to each position generally giving a lot of different places to play from making each game flexible to your desires.\n\nThe Game Modes are all mostly different and fun like the weapons and maps all providing quite different options for  the player to have more and different experiences. Hardpoint and Domination in concept may be comparable for the average gamer but in no way do they play the same in any map in the pool, the same for Uplink and Capture the Flag being similar but still offering different gameplay experience. There is just so much gameplay in the game modes on offer! It is rare a game can offer this many game modes! With the good comes the bad and that is the popularity of certain game modes. I can pretty much guarantee you will be able to play Team Deathmatch, Domination and Chaos Moshpit at any time you desire but that is about Is about it. The other game modes are mostly anywhere from 0-2% of the players playing and often impossible to get a decent game unless you manage to join an ongoing game where someone has just quit from. Don't get me wrong you may be able to find a game and play a session here or there but you won’t be able to do this anytime you get the itch which is a problem that can most only be put on the players.\n\nOk so this is starting to get long too long so I will just brush over everything else as fast as I can since I think the above is the most important of this game.\n\nGraphics are good and there is not huge differences in most settings from low to extra with the exception of a few. The game is of the 2015 trend which is starting to require more than 8gb of Ram and 2gb of Vram but still working. With a 4770k Overclocked to 4.2ghz paired with a Asus Strix OC 970 and 16gb of Ram I am still only getting 120-180 fps on all settings low/off with AA on the minimum. This is a mixed feeling for 144hz gamers with upper mid range PCs getting the feeling of barely getting by. Sound is done well, as a CS and Quake player I just wish they were a bit louder but it's clear decision of game design promoting more action and less standing around listening so I'm ok with it.\n\nThere is a few things that prevent this game from being better on PC and I would like to quickly go over them. Dedicated servers were promised and what we got was a entirely different definition to what we thought they were, in other words they are just the same peer to peer system used in less demanding games. Why is a huge mystery since the franchise makes more money then the owners or employees could possibly count but I suspect this has something more to do with it functioning better on console and being a console port. Touching on the console subject the game is lacks a PC touch you usually get in the menus and ui compared to most other games on PC.\n\nI could type about the Arena Mode or lack of for twice as long but I will just say most players I have seen who have played the previous half a dozen titles don't even know or care what it is. I put this down to the publisher and developer not clearly presenting the mode as what it is and that is Competitive, yes competitive game mode which no one even knows about. Dam that's easily half of the reason CSGO went from 3 million players to over 9 million in the past 12 months alone.\n\nTheres more things to which are not game breaking but could be game changing if done better but we will leave them.\n\nOverall from what I have seen in all the profiles of player to which dozens were looked at, most have put already more time in Black Ops III then the majority of their other Call of Duty games they own combined. This cannot be a coincidence but affirming that this could be one of the best Call of Duty games to date.\n\nI give this game a near 8/10 as a game and a 9/10 for a Call of Duty game.\n\nThere is so much I wanted to go over but cannot without writing a essay, this review is from experience and thought about the game in every way possible while enjoying my play time. I am uninterested in the generic youtube reviews posted a couple of days after release of the same vague opinions.\n\nI can easily see why this is the absolute best choice of FPS game on console to date, but sadly it falls outside of the top 3 for PC and probably top 5.\n\nThank you!","December 3, 2015","true","284.8"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

To all you people who brought the game and said it sucked because it does return it, that's what I'm doing.\n\nNow to the game.

But I was Vac (Valve anti-cheat)- banned from it.  From what I understand, the VAC software constantly checks for any background programs you are running that are for cheating/hacking the game.  While it is a mostly fool-proof system, the latest thing I had downloaded was rainmeter -_-.  On top of wrongfully banning me (and conveniently ignoring the hackers that were present almost every game), all steam support would do when I support ticket was send me a bot message that all vac bans were final and blah blah blah.  While doing some digging I saw there may be an appeal process if you contact the developer, (in this case it was activision/treyarch).  Even worse, you can't even try to send a support ticket or talk to a real person.

The story mode, like some other COD games, is bad. I really don't know why developers spend time and money on such bad story modes in COD games at this point. The game mechanics are okay. Some things like boost jumping feel like shoddy attempts at replicating things from Advanced Warfare (the story itself is another example).\n\nMy overall impression is that this is a poorly designed product relative to what can be expected in big title PC games with a 2015 release date. I can't see myself buying another COD game after this, and don't particularly enjoy having this one. I can't invest that much time in it (partly for the above reasons), so I usually have basic weapons and attachments and just go on for 30mins or until I am tired of being frag-bait for 75% of players who get all the good guns/attachments because they play more. Would be nice to see winning and losing depend more on skill, and if there absolutely has to be more systems to keep people sinking in more hours, then it would be nice to see that payoff more in cosmetic upgrades instead (but this criticism applies to all or most COD games).\n\nIf you are going to put in lots of hours, then like a hacker with access to all kinds of souped up stuff you can dominate most of the people that don't have that stuff (and some people really like to do that so... perhaps this is the secret to COD's success).","November 12, 2015","false","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

BUT! If you get past the problems you will love this game, it has good graphic the multiplayer is great, but the gameplay for campain is...bad, I mean really bad. If you are like me that you want to complete 100% and have a good challenge, but the challenge should be fun not boring, Black ops 3 introduced "realims" which is harder than "veteran" so I chose that one, but I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me. I could not move from a cover without prediction where I'm going to be killed. So I have to stand in the same cover and instead of shooting, I'm praying that an enemy will not throw a grenade to me or beat me to death, yep! even normal enemies hit you once or sometimes two times with a melee attack, you're done. The story is actually ok, it was not very suprising, and it seems they did not get all the pieces together. and the checkpoint system in the campain is the worst, I can't explain how mad you will get until you experience it yourself. I wanted to try zombies and holy.....it was actually fun, they did not follow the bad gameplay in black ops 2 but they combined BO1 and BO2 zombies, and if you complete the game, you will get a zombie campain (kind of). But the is something very annoying for beginner to play zombies, because the first time I tried zombies online, everyone called me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for not knowing what to do. You have rituals and other systems like a giant monster comes sometimes, and som bugs are crapping on you ( I think they are crapping....). This game kind of reminds me of The terminator, with the robots.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ihatehalo/recommended/311210/","ihatehalo","I pressed Q","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ihatehalo/","212 products in account","Dull game. It rehashes dated and unimpressive gameplay from the past 10 years while using feature creep as "innovation". Its hilarious how not only Black Ops 3, but the whole Call of Duty franchise continues to have skill-less multiplayer with extremely short TTK deathmatch, rewarding players who perform killstreaks, have yet to fix noobtubing, and continues to be highly successful after all these years. This is especially true when someone with a high killstreak summons an indestructible AI controlled robot with instakill hitscan attacks that rapes the entire enemy team without any skill or effort. It boggles my mind how people spend $60 a year on another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Call of Duty game its literally the same ♥♥♥♥ing game with psuedo-innovation and relies on its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ progression system for longevity as opposed to delivering a solid game thats worth mastering.\n\nSeriously, why do you idiots spend at least $60 a year on this ♥♥♥♥? There are far better multiplayer games out there with longer lifespans and better gun-play than what any Call of Duty game could deliver. But then again, Call of Duty fans don't care. They're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys that believe the World War 2 setting of all things would save the franchise instead of a good game.","May 14","false","2.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMRichardT/recommended/311210/","IAMRichardT","👽 IAMRichardT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMRichardT/","232 products in account","The ONLY reason I purchased this was for the Zombies expansion. I played a lot of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 multiplayer, however, when participating in the COD Black Ops 3 Beta, I was not impressed at all by the direction they took. Ever since my purchase of Black Ops 3, I think I've played a total of 1-2 hours of actual multiplayer and the rest has been strictly Zombies.\n\nFrom what I played of regular Multiplayer, it was ok. I'm not a HUGE fan of futuristic games. The wall jumping is cool, and so is the new sliding animations. I seem to pick up around 70 frames in-game with my R9 390X; sometimes dipping below 40 (depending on what is going on -- while running 1080p). I like the idea of how items are unlocked, but I feel as if they are way over-doing the micro-transactions.\n\nZombies; hands-down is great. BUT for only one reason; DLC 1 - The Awakening and the Der Eisendrache map (hopefully DLC 2 leaves me in shock and awe). For maybe around 2-3 weeks; Shadows of Evil had a bug that would randomly kick the party out of the game for no particular reason with the error: "Exceeded '250' items for type 'Triggerstring'" - no matter where you were in the game. It took them quite a bit of time to actually patch this (as of patch 1.10) and I can recall the bug existing for at least three (3) weeks. This is completely unacceptable considering I am positive the error was reported to the developers, and the fact of it forced players of the Zombie expansion to go get the DLC in order to be able to play zombies at all.\n\nThe other biggest complaint I have is that Zombies releases with only ONE map for the $60.00 we pay as a customer, and then we get 1 extra map for each DLC ($15.00 per map - or by purchasing the season pass and saving $10.00 as a discount). This is quite an expensive deal considering most of the people I've read comments from and played with; only buy Black Ops JUST for zombies. I'm sure it isn't hard to put at least two (2) maps into the release of zombies so that players at lease have a selection. Because with that error going on prior to the patch, players without the DLC / Season pass had nothing to play, and that's not right considering they did purchase the game. As a fellow developer; that bug should of only existed for 2-3 days MAX if it was a difficult one to address, not weeks and weeks. It almost feels like the company did that on purpose in order to get more sales on their DLC. That's just speculation and I really hope it isn't the case, but it looks rather fishy from a developer's stand-point.\n\nI would make the recommendation to the company -- release multiplayer and the Zombies expansion on their own separate purchases instead of this unholy amount of cash you have to take out of your pocket to pay for stuff you won't even use. I'm all for paying the price for a great game, and it's not about the price of the game, it's about the content that I receive. $60.00 for zombies? Fine, but give me the content I expect it to have. You know that the zombies expansion is a hot seller, and you throw it into Call of Duty Black Ops because you KNOW people will buy it just for that. So I very seriously doubt that you'll release the two game-modes on their own in separate purchases, because your regular multiplayer sales would drop quite a bit.\n\nOverall, if you're into the Call of Duty Black Ops franchise, and enjoy futuristic games, then I'd say sure, go for it. However, if you're just into zombies like myself and most of the people I know, then it's going to be expensive to get everything and have to swallow the lost cash you'll lose since you won't be taking advantage of the actual game itself (Black Ops 3 multiplayer).\n\nRegards,\nRichard\nYouTube: IAMRichardT","May 19","true","133.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Although it has its hiccups with performance and optimisation due to being neglected on PC (console being Activision's and Treyarch's main audience.)\n\nThe multiplayer is fluent and very black ops 2 esque, except it has the extra 'futuristic' features such as the jump-pack and wall-running (which I think is a great feature.) The maps have gone with the '3 path' approach (left side, right side and the middle) which is good when it comes to fighting in chokepoints, granting players to flank with ease. Overall, the weapon system is quite balanced and feels like Black Ops II, with the classic CoD tropes like smg run 'n' gun, bolt action snipers = best sniper etc.\n\nThe zombies gamemode is by far my favourite. I remember playing transit and all of the other blops 2 zombie maps and they were really fun. The stock map 'Shadows of Evil' follows a similar storyline to the Black Ops II map 'Mob of the Dead.' Where the four playable characters have all committed a sin which needs to be settled with by an external force. The map layout might seem quite daunting at first but after playing it multiple times you'll get the hang of it. The classic perk machines are back and the new gobblegum feature adds a little extra to the mode also, with the ability to get extra perks like keeping your guns after downing, or the more rare gobblegums like the wall buy auto pack-a-punched (which in my opinion seems really overpowered.)\n\nOverall, zombies and multiplayer are my favourite parts of the game, they are both balanced and well-made in regards to keeping it fresh and fun.\n\nAlso, the campaign sucks as always <|:^)","November 15, 2015","true","50.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

I have a 980Ti with 6GB of VRAM, and this game has nowhere near the visual fidelity to warrant this. I can barely play 2 minutes of the campaign without the game crashing my whole PC.\n\nThis is, of course, when the game starts up at all, when it doesn't instantly crash itself or my entire PC right after showing the developer logos. And this also is when I can't play the online mode. Which is never. I cannot connect at all online, getting an error like A.B.C.D.... and have had NO response from Activision Support, though I've contacted them incessantly since launch.\n\nYou should not purchase this game right now, and I highly caution purchasing it anytime after that. We should not support this kind of release being pushed out the door unfinished, and we should certainly not give them money (when or if it ever gets fixed) for something they should have done at launch.\n\nEDIT: Upgraded to 16GB of RAM and plugged directly into my router (had to move my entire rig downstairs). Online now works fine, but still runs pretty badly (medium settings still stutters often, but certainly playable). Single player somehow now runs worse (even low settings running around 40FPS). Although I'd rate the game better than I did on launch, it's still not worth buying on PC. Even so, it is an alright game. Just exactly what you'd except from a post-Titanfall, post-Advanced Warfare CoD. Though it's still not even as good as Advanced Warfare in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/recommended/311210/","likeucare","LIKEUCARE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likeucare/","1377 products in account","And yet another yearly Call of Duty game!\n\nHere's what I think about it:\n\nI have mixed feelings with Black Ops 3. While it doesn't try to reinvent the franchise, you do feel at home with pretty much everything offered to you. Main campaign, zombie mode set in the campaign, an old style zombie mode from the '40s and of course, the main selling point of every CoD games, the MultiPlayer. It is like 4 games in 1!\n\nWhether you are a fan or not of the CoD franchise, you can always expect a working game, USUALLY but it wasn't the case here. While I haven't experienced anything really nasty, I did had a few frame drops and slowdowns at areas in the story mode campaign.\n\nCampaign\nFrom start till midway into, I was quite interested on the story, where it was headed and such but after you reach midway until the end, it simply feels like some messed up Micheal Bay average story that doesn't make much sense! Missions are quite the same, very linear. What I found questionable was the lack of references of previous Black Ops games. BO3 didn't seem to be a "sequel" per sé and if you are new into this franchise, you'll simply feel as lost as I was in the story! The cyber powers do add possible replayability of missions and try other powers!\n\nZombie Mode (campaign)\nThis plays out the same missions of the campaign, set in different orders and instead of bashing robots and enemies, you try to survive zombies. It is an interesting take for a complete makeover of the campaign and the game tries to explain the story while you progress at least!\n\nMagical Zombie Mystery Caper (Zombie Mode Old style)\nThis is your known zombie mode from previous CoD games except it is set in the '40s. For those loving this, you will be right at home in this mode and with friends, this mode can keep you busy for a long while! However, I have found myself having more fun with Left 4 Dead 1&2 and Killing Floor 1&2.\n\nMultiPlayer\nI haven't played this mode much, as it doesn't appeal to me since it is basically the same thing each year! But I do know it is the main selling point of every Cod games and from the little I have played, it seemed fine!\n\n\nPROS:+Multiplayer is where the game shines the most. I haven't played it much but I can see it is the main focus of BO3!\n+Campaign has a Deus Ex meet Crysis and Call of Duty vibe.\n+Replayabiity is present with the many possible cyber powers that you can use offers many options on how you wish to play a mission.\n+Entertaining zombie modes with great known Hollywood actors!\n+"Four games in One"\n\nCONS:-Dated engine (Might be heavily modified and a proven engine, but that Quake 3 engine is way too old in today's gaming)\n-Not only using an heavily modified dated engine, but it is terribly optimized!\n-Incomprehensible and messy campaign.\n-No definitive connection with previous Black Ops games.\n-Lackluster in mission variety.\n-Extremely linear, no place for exploration, Obey game scripts or die and repeat until you do.\n-Managing the cyber powers are more of a chore than being intuitive. Crysis did perfect "on the fly" power switching overlay but with this game, you have to select the chosen power in a menu and get back into the game after. Also, I would say there are too many powers that are too similar.\n-Awful dialogue and voice acting.\n-No server browser for the glitchy MultiPlayer mode.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:Quite disappointed in this third iteration of the Black Ops franchise, especially campaign speaking. Extremely linear and like the Modern Warfare series, very improbable. If you intend to get this game for the unique campaign aspect, I'd advice to get this game on a sweet deal! Thanks to GMG, I have saved a good 30$! But for MP purposes, I'm sure you will enjoy this game very well! But at this moment, the game is badly optimized so I recommend on waiting later to get BLOPS3! In weeks time, the game should be properly patched!\n\n\nRATING:5.5 / 10\n\nPS: With three COD franchises (Black Ops, Ghosts, Advanced Warrior) set in the "near or far future", I would say there is a lot of saturation and I never thought myself wishing this, but I would hope Treyarch heads back in WW2 era! Heck, why not WW1?\n\nJust my two cents!","November 11, 2015","false","13.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","6"

You have Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. All of which are ok, but the only reason I decided to pick this up is because of Zombies. I haven't touched a COD since BO2 and the multiplayer seems very familiar to BO2. The movement system is very well implemented and it just feels natural. However, there are multiple issues that needs to be fixed. The biggest is the server issues and while it isn't always messed up, its pretty annoying when it happens. The game also has some optimization issues that will most likely be fixed in the future.\n\nVerdict: Depends really. If you buy COD every year then this is a no brainer.

Yes, theres new guns, maps, ect but at the end of the day, are you happy paying £39.99-£69.99 on basicly just that?\nAnd also, ever since they started doing all of this future $hit I feel like I'm playing a knock off of Titanfall or Halo. That's not the Call Of Duty I grow up with, there weren't d*ckhe#ds jumping all over the place and even walking on the walls (even tho it's pretty cool).\n\nAt the end of the day I feel that this is going to be the last Call Of Duty I'll be buying, unless they change their ways...\n\nWould I recommend this game...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aenoxys/recommended/311210/","Aenoxys","Aenoxys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aenoxys/","65 products in account","To start off: Framerates Framerate issues are big in Campaign, Nightmare (Campaign mixed with zombies), and the zombies map Shadows of Evil. Campaign, during intense particle effects frames visibly dip below 60. It is the same with Nightmare mode. Shadows of Evil map freezes when moving from one section of the map to another. Shadows of Evil is virtually un-playable for most computers.\n\n\n\nZombies:      (Shadows of Evil):   Zombies  has become tedious. It may take 30-80 minutes to get completely set up on this map. Shadows of Evil is very similar to Treyarch's previous map, Tranzit. Tranzit similar to Shadows of Evil is a large map comprised of zones which are all used in order to get all the items possible. The power however works by using a monster that can be used each round to turn on the power of specific areas and not covering the whole map.\nThe map itself has frequent drops in fps when moving through zones of the map. The game tries to pull off the distinct style of the early 20th century and succeeds at it. Big Band Jazz plays before every round and sounds absolutely great! The architecture looks similar to the architecture in Bioshock Infinite. Tall skyscrapers and small shops.\nThe enemies include: Zombies, Rolling Exploding Meatballs, The Margwa, Mosquitos, and The Gatekeepers. The enemies  are very original. The problem with the Margwa it spawns far too often. Every 3 rounds. The Margwa is hard to kill. It would be very fun to play against if only its spawn timers were longer.\n\n\n(The Giant):  Comes with the Season Pass. An amazing map. The map is much better than Shadows of Evil. The map is simple and opening the Pack-A-Punch is far easier. There is no need to search anything up on this map to get it's full experience.\nThe map is absolutely gorgeous. The lighting is superb and it blows away the previous renditions of the map. There are small differences in the map such as having a different timeline as all Nazi symbols have been removed and replaced with Germany's flag during World War I.\nPerks have been randomized and weapons from World at War are no longer in the game. The weapons have been replaced with guns with similar stats but more modern. The M1911 is no longer in the game as well. An iconic weapon marking Nazi Zombies now gone. The perks have also been changed. Their locations are now randomized making the game just a bit harder.\nTraining on the map is also a lot harder than in previous games. Most players use the Catwalk to get to higher rounds.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe multiplayer has become more complicated every new installment. The movement makes the game for more complex than it's predecessors. The game allows characters to choose between certain classes. Classes change the playstyle. Some classes might be better at tanking, others might be better at sniping and so forth.\nThe amount of guns is ridiculous. Most guns feel equally powerful which is good but makes them feel generic. What would make the guns better would be if each gun in each category made the playstyle completely different, similar to games like CS:GO where each gun has it's purpose.\nPerks are far less game changing than before. They give the player less power than before but with skill allow the player to make their class better than the enemy's.\nKillstreaks are similar to earlier Black Ops installments.\n\nNightmare\nNightmare mode is a very fun mode to play with friends or solo. It brings an original experience of mixing Campaign and Zombies. The Nightmare mode has frequent lag spikes due to the zombies and other enemies on screen and the complexity of the enviroments. The AI for the NPC's the player is forced to play with is absolutely horrible. One thing to be grateful for is that the AI is always in God-Mode.\nThe difficulty of Nightmare Mode is minimal. Realistic is extremely easy and with friends is even easier. However reviving each other when one player goes down will restart the mission to the closest checkpoint which is very infuriating for players. The mode is an interesting concept but ends up feeling mediocre and forgettable.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nThe game has a lot of content. Multiplayer has a lot of content already in the game and will have you playing for hours. Zombies only has one map, which isn't very good.  If you want Zombies to be fun and get the best experience possible, buy the Deluxe Edition or buy future DLC.  Nightmare mode is fun but feels mediocre and forgettable. And if you're a big fan of campaign that will add even more hours to the game. So all in all I recommend this game.","December 30, 2015","true","167.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","14","23","3","0"

Now that I have thouroughly played the game. First of all, the game rewards players with lag. They slide around the map making them impossible to hit while players with excellent PING (mine averages in the 30's) are punished. When a sliding guy keeps disappearing and re-appearing across the map and has a ping of 300 is the top player, you have a problem. Next issue, shotguns. Yes I know Shotguns in real life have a greater range than in  this game, however, this is a game. Any noob can pick up the Haymaker and become a "great player" or almost any shotguns for that matter and it forces other players to do the same making the game full of shotgunners and no longer fun. Just have one as a special weapon or something. Someone across the map in sniping possition, with a shotgun, shouldn't be able to out gun an AR. Thats kinda BS. Next issue, the range of the combat knife...it's like 10 in game feet. It's rediculous. Next I wish they got rid of the "classes" in the game they are also unbalanced. Until they work on these things, which they won't, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will not be buying the next iteration of this game unless they make a huge improvement to it. The only reason I am, and will continue to play it, is because I bought it and the season pass. Since I spent almost $100, I dont feel like wasting my money. Don't be like me. Wait before buying it. If I knew they were going to do a $15 Multiplayer thing, I would have just bought that. 4/10 cannot recommend.","February 25","false","274.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/311210/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","W.I.P Review - (Work In Progress)\n\nEDIT: Treyarch implemented Micro-Transactions and therefore I no longer recommend this game unless they remove them, it is just pure greed from developers that is destroying their game, also they have capped graphics settings so you are now forced to play at low - mid range graphics settings unless you have a pro beastmode super mlg computer. There are literally no games in the world that im aware of where the developer has capped graphics purposefully seemingly to just ♥♥♥♥ off its players\n\nFirstly since Black Ops 3 comes as 1 single game on your Steam Games List when you buy it but has 3 modes (Black Ops 3 Campaign, Black Ops 3 Multiplayer & Black Ops 3 Zombies) i will be reviewing them all here split into thier own sections to make it easier to see which part of the game i will be reviewing.\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Campaign\nOver the past few CoD titles there have been all kinds of Campaign missions from blowing things up, stealthing your way through patrolling enemies, flying or controlling various vehicles of mass destruction and even venturing into space! So it should be expected of Treyarch to have a very similar style of missions.\n\nHowever, Treyarch are the big daddies when it comes to all things Call of Duty and generally have always had better content than Infinity Ward or the more recent Sledgehammer titles. Here in the Black Ops 3 Campaign they do not disappoint. Straight away you are dropped into a familiar CoD mission, which seems no different from any other previous CoD campaign mission but right after finishing the first mission you are thrown into the second mission where things start to get a little more interesting.\n\nTreyarch have done a fantastic job here, creating great tension and suspense moments throughout the campaign and it really shows that they have put a great deal of effort into creating something new and exciting that hasnt been done before in previous CoD campaigns. Campaign is also once again 4 player Co-Op if you play online which is the first time since World at War which brings the usual Singleplayer Campaigns into more of a multiplayer enviroment.\n\nBlack Ops 3 now introduces Biometric and Cybernetic enhancements to your character. These enhancements are a completely new feature to the CoD franchise and allow your character to do so much more to the enemies such as releasing waves of 'fireflies' at them to eat away at their health and set them on fire, or taking control of enemy robotics or turrets to use against them. This does change how you can approach each mission and is a very welcome new feature to a dwindling CoD Campaigns that were starting to become a little stale and repetitive.\n\nSomething else that is new to Black Ops 3 Campaign is a safehouse! This is somewhere you can relax a little inbetween missions. You are able to edit your loadout here and also use 'fabrication kits' that are aquired for completing missions or challenges in the campaign to unlock new weapons or Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements. You are also able to change your characters clothing and gender/appearance here too! Collectibles within Black Ops 3 has also had a complete overhaul from previous CoD titles. Now instead of collecting 50 or so computer intel or tablet intel, Treyarch have placed much more varied items into missions that can be collected then put onto display next to your bunk bed in the safehouse. These can be anything from minature models to various robot components or helmets/hats and some of them have glass display cases too!!\n\nNot only are there Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements and new collectibles but also there are now Medals that you can earn and display in your safehouse too. These are reletively difficult to get and will definitly require you to play through most if not all of the campaign multiple times.\n\nLastly Treyarch have included with the Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements to your character, something called Tactical View. This shows you dangerzones in the area where you are likely to be shot or killed, it shows blast proximity of grenades or rpg's and also any enemies can be seen through walls when either you or one of your allies can see them. This Tactical View can be toned down or even turned off completely via the options menu when in the safehouse or during a mission so its not forced upon you.\n\nAlso just to put the icing on the cake Treyarch show that they have gone all out this time by adding a nice surprise once you complete the campaign mode :P\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Multiplayer\nHaving played Multiplayer for around 5 hours, i have to say its definitely a fun experience! There are 9 Specialists that you can choose from to use and each has thier own special weapon/ability and seeing other players spraying fire and smashing to the ground with gravity spikes does give the game a more futuristic and slightly theatrical appearance as opposed to realistic, but i have thouroughly enjoyed playing this mode so far.\n\nA few things i have noticed while playing is that if you join a game while it is already in progress and your team loses or you lose, then it says at the end 'Loss stat prevented due to joining game in session' or something which means that your stats are not biased by joining a losing battle like previous CoD games.\n\nAlso having read community forums for this game recently, there do appear to be alot of people struggling to join games, i have had no issues with this and joined every game and lobby so far in around 2 seconds which seems if anything faster than previous CoD titles that i have played.\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Zombies\nThere are two Zombies maps upon the games release (assuming you bought the Season Pass) and a new Perk-like feature called Dr Montys Factory in which you can use something called Liquid Divinium to brew up Gumballs. Liquid Divinium is aquired in either of the two zombies maps by purchasing weapons from the wall, opening doors, buying perks and using the mystery box. As for the Gumballs, they can drop power ups, give you faster aiming and running speed, allow you to teleport across the map and so on.\n\nThere is also now a levelling and experience gaining feature for the zombies mode, you can prestige upto 10th zombies prestige and also level up weapons, earn camos and attachments for the weapons that you can then use in game straight off the wall or from the mystery box.\n\nThe Giant\n\nThe Giant zombies map is a Der Reise remake from the World at War CoD title, playing this map after so many years just brought with it so much nostalgia! The map itself is pretty much unchanged, but there are the new Gumball machines that have been introduced to the zombies mode and new perk machines. Also the weapons are the Black Ops 3 weapons instead of the World at War weapons. Personally i feel like the weapons themselves are generally more overpowered than the World at War counterparts and getting to round 30 solo seems like no problem at all.\n\nShadows of Evil\n\nThis zombies map is much larger than The Giant, while i have played this map, i haven't played it extensivly enough to review it just yet. Having said that, from what i have seen there are the usual several perk machines, summoning rituals, portals, new wonder weapons and so much more. The traditional Easter Egg steps for zombies mode seems far more complex and seems to take ideas from almost every previous zombies map all implemented into one. It is definitly a fun map to play and i cannot wait to play it more in depth!","November 10, 2015","false","377.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/311210/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","W.I.P Review - (Work In Progress)\n\nEDIT: Treyarch implemented Micro-Transactions and therefore I no longer recommend this game unless they remove them, it is just pure greed from developers that is destroying their game, also they have capped graphics settings so you are now forced to play at low - mid range graphics settings unless you have a pro beastmode super mlg computer. There are literally no games in the world that im aware of where the developer has capped graphics purposefully seemingly to just ♥♥♥♥ off its players\n\nFirstly since Black Ops 3 comes as 1 single game on your Steam Games List when you buy it but has 3 modes (Black Ops 3 Campaign, Black Ops 3 Multiplayer & Black Ops 3 Zombies) i will be reviewing them all here split into thier own sections to make it easier to see which part of the game i will be reviewing.\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Campaign\nOver the past few CoD titles there have been all kinds of Campaign missions from blowing things up, stealthing your way through patrolling enemies, flying or controlling various vehicles of mass destruction and even venturing into space! So it should be expected of Treyarch to have a very similar style of missions.\n\nHowever, Treyarch are the big daddies when it comes to all things Call of Duty and generally have always had better content than Infinity Ward or the more recent Sledgehammer titles. Here in the Black Ops 3 Campaign they do not disappoint. Straight away you are dropped into a familiar CoD mission, which seems no different from any other previous CoD campaign mission but right after finishing the first mission you are thrown into the second mission where things start to get a little more interesting.\n\nTreyarch have done a fantastic job here, creating great tension and suspense moments throughout the campaign and it really shows that they have put a great deal of effort into creating something new and exciting that hasnt been done before in previous CoD campaigns. Campaign is also once again 4 player Co-Op if you play online which is the first time since World at War which brings the usual Singleplayer Campaigns into more of a multiplayer enviroment.\n\nBlack Ops 3 now introduces Biometric and Cybernetic enhancements to your character. These enhancements are a completely new feature to the CoD franchise and allow your character to do so much more to the enemies such as releasing waves of 'fireflies' at them to eat away at their health and set them on fire, or taking control of enemy robotics or turrets to use against them. This does change how you can approach each mission and is a very welcome new feature to a dwindling CoD Campaigns that were starting to become a little stale and repetitive.\n\nSomething else that is new to Black Ops 3 Campaign is a safehouse! This is somewhere you can relax a little inbetween missions. You are able to edit your loadout here and also use 'fabrication kits' that are aquired for completing missions or challenges in the campaign to unlock new weapons or Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements. You are also able to change your characters clothing and gender/appearance here too! Collectibles within Black Ops 3 has also had a complete overhaul from previous CoD titles. Now instead of collecting 50 or so computer intel or tablet intel, Treyarch have placed much more varied items into missions that can be collected then put onto display next to your bunk bed in the safehouse. These can be anything from minature models to various robot components or helmets/hats and some of them have glass display cases too!!\n\nNot only are there Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements and new collectibles but also there are now Medals that you can earn and display in your safehouse too. These are reletively difficult to get and will definitly require you to play through most if not all of the campaign multiple times.\n\nLastly Treyarch have included with the Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements to your character, something called Tactical View. This shows you dangerzones in the area where you are likely to be shot or killed, it shows blast proximity of grenades or rpg's and also any enemies can be seen through walls when either you or one of your allies can see them. This Tactical View can be toned down or even turned off completely via the options menu when in the safehouse or during a mission so its not forced upon you.\n\nAlso just to put the icing on the cake Treyarch show that they have gone all out this time by adding a nice surprise once you complete the campaign mode :P\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Multiplayer\nHaving played Multiplayer for around 5 hours, i have to say its definitely a fun experience! There are 9 Specialists that you can choose from to use and each has thier own special weapon/ability and seeing other players spraying fire and smashing to the ground with gravity spikes does give the game a more futuristic and slightly theatrical appearance as opposed to realistic, but i have thouroughly enjoyed playing this mode so far.\n\nA few things i have noticed while playing is that if you join a game while it is already in progress and your team loses or you lose, then it says at the end 'Loss stat prevented due to joining game in session' or something which means that your stats are not biased by joining a losing battle like previous CoD games.\n\nAlso having read community forums for this game recently, there do appear to be alot of people struggling to join games, i have had no issues with this and joined every game and lobby so far in around 2 seconds which seems if anything faster than previous CoD titles that i have played.\n\nBlack Ops 3 - Zombies\nThere are two Zombies maps upon the games release (assuming you bought the Season Pass) and a new Perk-like feature called Dr Montys Factory in which you can use something called Liquid Divinium to brew up Gumballs. Liquid Divinium is aquired in either of the two zombies maps by purchasing weapons from the wall, opening doors, buying perks and using the mystery box. As for the Gumballs, they can drop power ups, give you faster aiming and running speed, allow you to teleport across the map and so on.\n\nThere is also now a levelling and experience gaining feature for the zombies mode, you can prestige upto 10th zombies prestige and also level up weapons, earn camos and attachments for the weapons that you can then use in game straight off the wall or from the mystery box.\n\nThe Giant\n\nThe Giant zombies map is a Der Reise remake from the World at War CoD title, playing this map after so many years just brought with it so much nostalgia! The map itself is pretty much unchanged, but there are the new Gumball machines that have been introduced to the zombies mode and new perk machines. Also the weapons are the Black Ops 3 weapons instead of the World at War weapons. Personally i feel like the weapons themselves are generally more overpowered than the World at War counterparts and getting to round 30 solo seems like no problem at all.\n\nShadows of Evil\n\nThis zombies map is much larger than The Giant, while i have played this map, i haven't played it extensivly enough to review it just yet. Having said that, from what i have seen there are the usual several perk machines, summoning rituals, portals, new wonder weapons and so much more. The traditional Easter Egg steps for zombies mode seems far more complex and seems to take ideas from almost every previous zombies map all implemented into one. It is definitly a fun map to play and i cannot wait to play it more in depth!","November 10, 2015","false","377.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have an i5 and a GTX 750 ti, and according to the minimum specs of needing an okay i3 and a GTX 470, I should have been in the clear. Yet, I can hardly play at full res(1440x900 for me) with 60 fps. After a series of updates and everything on low, I can finally accomplish this steady framerate.\n\nBut why is framerate important? CoD has a poor system of basing your aiming sensitivity to your frames per second, so maintaining a solid framerate that does NOT FLUCTUATE is very important. Playing even at 45 fps or 30 fps made the game perform different and unstable from my experience.\n\nNow, I bought the game for the multiplayer, and only TDM has a decent amount of players. Disappointing, because I enjoyed having every mode active when I played CoD on consoles in the franchise's prime. It becomes stale rather fast.\n\nLastly, do not use a controller online. The players with keyboard and mouse are much more accurate than what you can be with an analog stick.\n\nTL;DR - Mediocre port with lackluster multiplayer modes available due to community playing mostly TDM. There is content, but may not be enjoyable unless you are fortunate to run the game well.","May 14","false","9.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Considering I hadn't played cod since MW3, the game definately felt like a good one to get back into. Multiplayer is enjoyable with a lot of new features that I love like custom camos and the cryptokey system, while some weapons are kinda a bit too strong in my opinion. Zombies seem much more complicated and a definate improvement from the last time I played zombies on the original blackops and it is something I really want to get into more. The campaign is there, but I never really feel too compelled to go play it.\n\n\nDespite the fact that it had a bad launch, the game has been running perfectly fine on my i5 4690k - R9 390 rig ever since I originally bought it. Well, that was untill my friend bought it so we could play zombies together...\nNow, every single time I load into anything, the game crashes after about 10 seconds in. I could sit anywhere on the main menu without crashing forever, but the second I load into zombies, I crash. Load into multiplayer? Crash. Load into singleplayer? Crash. The only possible reasons I could possibly think of that caused this to happen now, is that either A, the most recent patch screwed things up for me or B, my steam controllers drivers (Got the controller today) did something.\n\n\nSupposedly, some people still have trouble running the game. I tried running it on my old 7770 - FX 6300 rig and it couldnt even run on the lowest possible settings on anywhere near acceptable frames. Keep in mind that back in the day, this old rig was able to run Crysis 3 on high settings with playable and acceptable frames rates.\n\n\nHonestly, I hate to write a negative review because I enjoyed the game when I was able to play it. But considering the fact that the game is now completely unplayable unless I was to make the mona lisa of emblems, I have give it a negative review for now. It wouldn't be so bad if there was a fix anywhere on any forum that I come across, but unfortunately I can't find a single one","December 25, 2015","false","28.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Relaxxeee/recommended/311210/","Relaxxeee","☁ Enrique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Relaxxeee/","377 products in account","I was hoping too actually get into Call of Duty again after playing so many hours on Modern Warfare 2 back on the Xbox 360. But sadly enough this game just killed it even more than I was hoping it would. After a long wait of not playing a single Call of Duty since MW2 and never experienced the goofy Black Ops series this was a hope, but it would kill the serie for me entirely.\n\nThe multiplayer was interesting too say the least, but the only thing that would keep me playing it was the movement system. Sliding, wallrunning, hoovering etc. It was that interesting concept that wanted me too keep trying the multiplayer more and more. Other than that it just felt like any other Call of Duty with better grapich, different weapon and just a more advanced system too change a class.\n\nZombies was the one thing I was really excited for, since it would be my first time experiencing it in Call of Duty. It was fun in the beginning with my mate but eventually the entertainment it could offer slowly killed it for both of us. It wasn't as excited as people had hyped it too be. After 3 games of it I eventually quit and there was the end for me in Black Ops 3.\n\nI know already a lot of people buys this game for the multiplayer, and rarely for the campaign. But I don't wanna say a lot about the campaign because if there's something that really grind my gears about Call of Duty is the campaign in each game. They are boring, lack charisma and is just outdraged. The last good campaign I enjoyed was what Modern Warfare 1 and 2 had too offer. Maybe it's more opinion driven but I just felt more into it than this one.\n\nAt the end of the day I feel like this isn't just my kind of game. The serie died out for me in Modern Warfare 2 and it's gonna stay there probably. I just can't get into the same concept of a game and stick with the series and keep supporting a company that sh*ts out 1 game every year where there's almost no change too it. I hope people enjoy this more than I do, and make the best out of it. But I just can't recommend it at the end.","December 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I have NO issues with performance, and the game is perfectly smooth, other then the occasional stutter or whatever it may be. The dedis are fine, I havent experienced any lag whatsoever as far as that. It's a new release, there's gonna be bugs, there's gonna be issues, and it makes me sort of sad to see ALL these bad reviews about game performance, when the game itself is perfectly fine. No one understands developers have to be able to optimize the game for the millions of different hardware configurations out and it does take time most of the time. But I've noticed most people are complaining the game isnt optimized, and they're trying to run it on high settings with a 650 and other lower end cards, and 70% of those bad reviews are generally due to people not understand how textures work. I have a 4770k and a 980 STRIX. The game uses a little over 3gb for me with high textures, therefore anyone trying to do that on low end cards with less then 3GB of VRAM just arent going to get good performance, it simply wont work with ANY game. It's not the devs fault for that. The game is AMAZING, one of my fav cods so far. And I tend to only like treyarch games recently anyway as they're always the best optimized and fit my playstyle. But patches will come, the game will get better.","November 12, 2015","true","143.4"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

The minute I attempted multiplayer a whole bunch of things screwed up. The particle effects were out of control; walls jittering all over the place, bots disappearing, roads glowing, sky falling, you name it. The FPS was a mess even after lowering all the settings the lag was unbearable. And after every game (even single player) there was a random blue screen for a good ten seconds before going back to the game menu.\nDefinitely issues with memory leak, on lowest settings and from the minute I loaded the game my task manager was showing 100% usesage and the game crashes after being on for any more than 20 minutes.\nIt really sucks, as the maps and customisation look like a decent follow on from BO2 and I'll definitley re-buy it once I'm sure all the issues are fixed, but being as I use it mainly for multiplayer it's really not worth £40 just sitting in my library.\n\nI'm genuinly quite surprised Treyarch haven't issued a statement at least acknowledging everyones issues yet, I know patches (especially ones this big!) take a while to roll out and there are soooo many operating systems to get feedback from for optimization but please at least give your disappointed buyers a clue of when to expect a fix, a game shouldn't be sent to release if it isn't ready, even if you've spent a ton of money on marketing it for a specific date..","November 12, 2015","false","1.7"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

All of the modes are each given proper attention, with separate ranking systems and unlocks for each mode (Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies). The graphics are good - nothing to leave your wife over - but they are good for today's standards. The game runs well despite a few uncomfortable glitches, like me being immobile for a few seconds every time I join a match.\n\nI give this game a 9/10, would Call this Duty again. Below I shall go into more details regarding each mode (no spoilers of course).\n\nCAMPAIGN\nStory wise, the campaign is horrible. Even though this bears the Black Ops insignia, it is completely unrelated to the Black Ops universe. I have enjoyed the levels, but I could care less about nearly every one of the characters, even the Player character (who is literally named 'Player'). Not any memorable moments or interesting characters like in Black Ops or Modern Warfare. 5/10\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nClassicly addicting Call of Duty gameplay with the jet-pack twist of Advanced Warfare. It makes for some great fun, but retains the same elements I have loved since Modern Warfare 2. 10/10\n\nZOMBIES\nDo not be fooled by the outrageous maps put out by Treyarch. They stay true to the zombies storyline and experience, just as they have even when we were on the moon, in ww1 with robots, and in the factory that started it all. The gameplay is challenging, convuluted, and full of suprises. The map is interesting. The characters, theme, and style of the mode are all fun and great. It makes for incomparable fun when experienced with your friends in a private game. Searching for a game can be difficult though, because most people do not like to communicate, which has become essential to the mode. 9/10","November 15, 2015","true","125.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Most of the time that is true. But this game is so awful at it's core that I can't respect anybody who likes it in it's current state. This review completely disregards all of the game's shortcomings in terms of performance and optimization because bugs and glitches are to be expected upon the release of any game.\n\nAny strategic or tactical approach to this game is cut short by the random movements and overpowered abilities aka specialists. Any effort to play a tactical game is cut short by the hectic and poorly designed maps where people pop out of nowhere and the game becomes a game of luck. Or more accurately, a random game. Even if you don't mind your skills being equalized for the sake of keeping the game friendly for beginners and casuals, you'll likely end up frustrated as you have to focus more on spotting people than you do actual combat for the player models blend into the environment so well. This would be nice if this were a war simulator but it's everything but that. Call of Duty was born out of an arena-esque battle scene and that's what it is loved for. Even if we disregard the fact that player models and the environment are relatively the same shades, everything in the game is so detailed making you unable to focus on the actual game. Trying to aim down a corridor?

I enjoy Zombies, and some of the other single player stuff, but whenever I'm partied with another player the game becomes unplayable.  To be honest, I only bought this game for Zombies, and the occasional multiplayer, but the slightest lag and you are dead.  You think you're clear of a doorway and then you rubberband into the frame.  You think you killed a zombie with a headshot from a shotgun, and he eats your face.  The fact that I get stuck on blades of grass, it feels, makes the experience frustrating and not very enjoyable.  I don't know, maybe the game is better on console, but I'm not buying it again.\n\nPros: Zombies\n\nCons: If you have even slightly slower internet than an opponent, you die.\nIf you haven't been playing from day 1, be prepared to be outclassed instantly\nIf you want to play multiplayer, prepare for 20-30 minutes wait if you want to play something other than Core TDM\nKillcams clearly show other players hitting you for headshots without even aiming in your direction\n\n\nBottom line, if you enjoy CoD, you'll probably enjoy this game.  It has all the same problems the other games have had, and even some new ones to deal with.  This is the last CoD game I'll be buying, but that's just me.","May 21","false","54.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

Blue screen between every match that hasn't been fixed yet. Feels like a game that wasn't competely tested before release. However - Zombies is beautiful and amazing, love it.

Overall 7/10\n\n* Multiplayer\nHm, what to say about this game mode, its kinda classic, same as previous games, it feels like a game mode or DLC rather than full game, but, in other way it feels different because of jetpack (much more easier to use than EXO suit) and also you can run on walls (Prince of Persia style).\nIts rapid, its ultra fast mode and its fast paced, so, if you want to buy this game, PLAY WITH BOTS ON HARD DIFFICULTY before you get into the multiplayer, or you will be slaped in face by prestige masters or other people who plays this game a lot, and you will not understand how are they so overpowered!\nAlso, in MP you get Cryptokeys for finished match to open common and rare drops -- similar copy/paste from Counter Strike Global Offensive, but it completely free (except if you are idiot to buy for 50 dollars CoD points and open those crates for untradable skins).\nAlso, much better is that you actually get cryptos for free when you playing a lot, they on CS GO when you get almost nothing...  Overall 7/10\n\n*Zombies\nWhat can I say about mode that keep this game alive and other Call of Duty games.\nIts fantastic, have a great maps, but you can get a only one "Shadow of evil" with based game, other are DLC, but, important and better news is that game IS getting MOD TOOLS AND MAP EDITOR FOR ZOMBIES!!!\nAfter 7-8 years it will come to Black Ops 3 on October 2016.!\nThis game mode dont have and futuristic stuff, any jetpacks, its normal and just run and gun with milion fantastic easter eggs over map!  Overall 9/10\n\n*Nightmare mode - Story mode with Zombies\n\nIts story mode but with Zombies all over the map, its great option for people who like to play zombie mode like me.\nIt feels like DLC, but its completely free and great option to see how will other single player maps will work with zombies.\n8/10\n\n*Freerun\n\nPretty solid training mode for jetpack and running, its pretty solid option to have if you dont know how to use jetpack system properly\nOverall 7/10\n\nLets get with cons now because this game got a lot of cons :D.\n\n* Campaign\n- Game AI is so horrible, its so stupid that enemies will kill you through wall in veteran difficulty, its like wallhacking, also, I got r9 290x GPU, but also on nVidia, you can see some graphical glitches and pixelated textures even if your game is setted to a maximal graphics and effects.\n- Some enemies got randomly more health than others but when you restart the checkpoint it will be reduced to normal as it should be before, lol.\n- Some checkpoints can be glitched and automatically get you killed aka. spawn to die checkpoint..\n\n*Multiplayer\n-Microtransactions - COD points are cancer, before, in older games, you can get everything for free, now you can get almost everything for free, but you need to play too much game for some unlock, COD points costs from 2-50 dollars or euros depends on your country\n-Some weapons are so overpowered, also perks, but thats optional thing, and it will probably be fixed in more updates.\n-Community - its so toxic, cancerogenic that i can't describe, too much kids raging, too much kiddy boosted Prestige masters peeps that can actually mod their game for some pre-fire assets and wallhacking, but don't get me wrong this game got some excellent and brutally good players, but most of players are not cooperative and don't want to play together like team.\n-Cancerogenic camping with shotgun or rapid snipers - oh yes, people and kids in this game can camp for whole game with rapid shotgun - so noobish, and so cancerogenic - It's not tactic its noobish thing, you know - don't get me wrong, I destroyed them anyway..\n-Random FPS drops in this game is soooo bad, I got R9 290X, Intel Xeon CPU from 2007 with 3.0 GHz, and 8 GB of RAM, and game is runing most of time 80 fps avg, but in some random places it can be 10 fps but in next spawn it will be normal, so stuttering and drops are here which is bad (also in Zombie mode too).\n-Did I mentioned spawn to die system - yes its here like in previous games...\n-NAT Type, uggggghhhh, its so annoying that you play with friends and just after 2 hours session, lobby will crash and you must restart your game and router to make it work again, because game changes your NAT type to strict randomly (even with port forwarding)\n-Even with 30MB/S you get about 30-60 ping - I live in Serbia, and on other games I got 10 ping easily...\n\n*Zombies\n-Game stuttering on Shadow of Evil map on Footlight district is so bad, it will random drop your FPS from 100 to 20 and will lagg a little bit..\n-Sometimes game can randomly stutter anywhere, because its not patched properly since February month...\n-Servers are slowly dying in this mode, but they will be back because mod tools will be soon released.\n-In this game mode also, sessions longer than 2 hours with friends will crash and disconnect you from servers - annoying stuff...\n-Drop system is extra rare, even if you open doors, buying weapons and etc. you can barely get 3-4 Liquid Diviniums (keys for Gobblegums)\n\n*Nightmare\n-Some zombies have a glitched health - one of them needs to be shooted 3 times in head, some casual zombies with casual health must be shooted 10 times in head with powerfull weapon - strange glitch in veteran difficulty..\n-Zombies can glitch in your back which gives you instadeath - even if they needed to spawn in front of you.\n\n*Graphics - not so good in this game, because its 9 years old engine with newer stuff in him but, you can easily see a pixels, blurry textures and bugs over maps and textures, so 6/10 for graphics (on maxed detail) - I think some older CoDs looks more polished.\n*Gameplay - its classic and you will enjoy it, but minor glitches and bugs can frustrate you as ♥♥♥♥ 7/10\nOverall, I can give this game a honest 7/10.\nIts super game, but got some really, really bad glitches, also cancerogenic community...\n","May 15","true","194.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","10","16","3","3"

By the way no one plays this game online.\n-So here's the poop\nIt's call of duty, what do you expect at this point I mean really? You are either a ♥♥♥♥♥ who plays it because of peer presure from dumb ♥♥♥ friends or some weird type of non gamer who feels obligated to buy the same broken game every year, luckily I'm neither.\n-Performance\nThis pc port was some fine garbage, the games audio is disabled when using more then 2 speakers so i have to disable surround sound in my operating system just to get audio working. The game runs smooth when it's not crashing randomly on menus or freezing trying to load a match, decent performance as far as frames per second goes but I will say i get much higher fps on games that are more visually complex.\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay itself hasnt changed except for wall running which is actually very fun, wall running and the explosive bow and arrow are the best part of this game, it's so satisfying sharp shooting with a explosive bolt. The level design is focused around the wall running mechanic and the levels over all seem more arena like which i enjoy in a game like this, but the maps are often turned stupid when people use the rolling robot perks, it's total explosion spam. The character selection is weird, it's all female and one cyborg male who happens to be black, thank you social justice..\n-Verdict\nI can't play anything other then team death match and death match because no one plays this ♥♥♥♥ online (atleast for pc), I feel like steam users or pc gamers in general are becomming more aware of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games and ignore them better then console gamers do, and thank God because I'm sick of main stream gaming being the same thing year after year.

Unlike others. But good news that eventually at the same day of the launched date Treyarch immediately updated it and most of the people can play it silky smooth already.\n\nNote\nI'm going to review the game based on itself, not on the performance like everyone in the COD community has. Yes, the game has some performance issues but for now turning down the settings and working with Treyarch by leaving constructive feedback for them to improve on is better than not playing.\n\nOriginal\nI was bored playing Call of Duty series because they were repeating/putting same stuffs in the game.\nBut I have no reason for Call of Duty Black Ops 3 because they have brought so many innovations that actually make me excited for it.\n\n1.  Love the idea that they have brought Call of Duty to futuristic style. (even more futuristic)   I know some people out there they actually hate this idea because they prefer how realistic Call of Duty was in the past. But come on… I’m actually bored already. Talking about realistic I would prefer Arma 3 or Battle Field.\n\n\n2.   The campaign mode builds for replayability   Treyarch has taken to describing the levels as “arenas”, allowing players to tackle objectives from a variety of angles while working cooperatively with friends.\n\nYes, bingo! With friends. Players will be able to play the campaign together in 4-player online co-op. (even 2 player split-screen support included as well.)\n\n\n3.  Weapon Customization    Weapon modification is nothing new for the franchise, but the weapon paint shop does add an extra layer to the extensive customization we've previously seen. Distinctive camouflage can be equipped to almost any weapon, and the weapon paint shop goes beyond simple emblem editors.\n\nThese emblems can be displayed on either side of your weapon, letting your enemy know exactly who destroyed them this round. You can literally create anything you want - with up to 64 layers and three different areas to design to express yourself in your weapon. Talking about customization, I’ll jump to number 4 reason which is……\n\n\n4.   Increased Customization    For the first time in the history of Call of Duty, players will be able to completely customize their campaign character, including their gender. This is a significant departure from the franchise norm, but Treyarch is hoping to make a gender-neutral storyline for the campaign that all players can enjoy.\n\n\n5.   Zombies return    Treyarch brings back Zombies with a vengeance in Black Ops 3 and fans of the game mode should be ecstatic at the additions.\nFirst of all, it appears that Zombies will have a full-fledged story this time around; at least it will be more fleshed out than before.\nSecondly, XP progression system is being implemented, which will greatly increase the mode’s replayability.\n\nNot a whole lot is known yet about Zombies, but mystery is part of what makes is exciting.\n\n\n6.   Multiplayer Specialist    This approach to game design is more in line with hero-based MOBAs like Dota as opposed to what one has come to expect from a first-person shooter. These Specialists all have their own personality, unique weapons, and special abilities, including a time-traveling robot named Reaper.\n\nThe introduction of Specialists is an extreme departure from what the multiplayer has represented in past entries.\n\nWill these Specialists change the pace of the game to the point that it doesn’t even truly feel like Call of Duty? The potential for failure here only further adds to the excitement, as it will be incredibly interesting to see if Treyarch’s big gamble pays off.\n\n\n7.  Nuk3town returns.    Nuk3town was one of the most popular multiplayer maps in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops. But this time is with futuristic style, which is really cool.\n\n\n8.  Prestige mode will be totally new and different   Full details on Prestige have not been announced. This will be something to look forward. Yeaph, something mysterious is the part of interesting part.","November 6, 2015","true","13.9"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","20","36","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/megomeow/recommended/311210/","megomeow","TheFunnyKittyXDlolololol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/megomeow/","133 products in account","This game makes me regret the $60 I spent becuase it is unplayable. First when I started, I bought this game because I played the other Black Ops and loved them, but that was on console. PC is a different story but my most major complain is the multiplayer.\nSinglePlayer:\nThe singleplayer may take you a couple of hours to pass, but its the most innovative singleplayer I have seen so far for a Call of Duty game. The story is in my opinion, kinda corny. The protagonist, you, were heavily injured in the end of the prologue and were ripped of your limbs and then is when you recover and then join the Black Ops squad. At the beginning of each level, the game sets you in your own safehouse where you can change your preset of 3 types of abilities, in which you can upgrade over time, you can make up your class with the weapons you want, the game gives you a bios of the purpose of the mission, and sets the scale of each leave if its either close quaters, mid size, or long range, but it doesn't really matter. I stayed with the same weapon and abilities since I started the campaign and I got through the game with that class. You can play the campaign in coop with your other buddies, but this is when the game really goes downhill.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe multiplayer has improved and has brougth new features. You still have your classic TDM, Kill Confirmed, etc, and new gamemodes like Vanguard and such, but TOO BAD YOU CAN ONLY PLAY TDM AND DOMINATION. My biggest dissapointment is that matchmaking on PC sucksssss. Every time I got searching for a match that has any other gamemode besides TDM and Domination, it is completely empty. I can't confirm if its either the community or the NAT Type which most are set to moderate but you can attempt to set it at open and see if you are lucky enough to find a single match o kill confirmed with a couple of players in it. The connectivity is okay, I haven't found myself ever losing connection to a game.\n\nZombies:\nThe Zombies gamemode suffers from the same big problem that multiplayer contracts, you can't find a single match, and when you do you will have to fight through the lag. My multiplayer ping is an average of 45 but in zombies, IT GOES UP TO THE 100S AND THEN EVEN HIGHER, and its not like you can play with a full match of 4, you will stay stuck trying to find someone to play zombies with. Another downside, the only map the game has isn't that much fun. Black Ops 2 Transit Zombies Map was huge and had alot of fun stuff to do. Blacks Ops 1 has better zombies than Blacks Ops 3.\n\nOptiminisation:\nThis game had problems at the beginning with framrates going up and down, even on high end GPUs like NVIDIA's GEFORE GTX 970 4GB Graphics Cards, but the game has been updated with pathces and I can finalyy play the game with max shadows without my framesdropping like they used to before.\n\nNightmare Mode:\n\nNightmare mode is basically a remix of the singleplayer but with zombies. Sadly, I found nightmare mode way more interesting than the actual singleplayer story. You can also play that in co-op. Nothing much else to say.\n\nFinal Verdit:\n5/10\nMy verdict would have been at least a 6 if I can play my other favorite gamemodes like kill confirmed.\n","March 10","false","20.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This time though, you won't be jumping around all the time, which is what many of people complained about in AW. Your double jumping needs to recharge after you have used it, you can't dash in mid air to avoid gun fire, which means you almost always want to have gun fights on the ground, like the previouse games.\n\nTo be honest, I have not played any of the campaign, so I can not tell you much about that, except that you now get camo unlocks for using guns in the campaign, which translate to multiplayer. There is also a new difficulty, which give you 1 health, instead of the normal 100, which means that a single shot from any gun will kill you.\n\nAnother big part of Treyarch's Call of Duty games are the zombie mode. This is very similar to Black Ops 2's zombies, except with some new guns and abilities in the new zobies story mode "Shadows of Evil", where you play as a brand new set of characters.\n\nAnother exiting new feature is the new Free Run mode. This is where you will chase the best time in a course of parkour and try to top the leaderboards.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic addition to the series and comes with a load of new content and I would have to say that this is definatley the best addition since Black Ops II, so if you like the other games, or you are a newcomer to this series, you should really pick this game up.\n\n9/10 from me.\n[Please note that there are a whole lot of bugs, and I could not start my game because of them. I did a quick Google search adn found some system files on reddit to fix these issues.]\n","December 12, 2015","true","510.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm not too keen on the multiplayer, I miss CoD4/WaW/BO1 era multiplayer. Will update with campaign once I take a moment from being hooked on the zombies :P\n\nI'm not a CoD multiplayer guy, if you are only in in for the multiplayer this review isn't for you.\n\nI loved everything about World at War and Black Ops 1 - all modes. I hated MW3/BO2/Ghosts/AW. I was just about done with call of duty. But then I watched a stream of BO3 Zombies. And damn it sparked something that was untouched since Black Ops 1. So I decided to pick the game and season pass up on Gee2A. I've had it 1 day and put 13 hours into the game. I just can't put it down - thats saying something as I'm a CS:GO and League of Legends player so most of my time is taken up playing those, I rarely go a day playing a game without looking at either of them.\n\nI'm not keen on the multiplayer so far, I preferred gameplay from CoD4/WaW/BO1. Slightly slower paced and more mindful. Now is feels like unless you are going full tryhard MLG you're not really going to have a fun time here, I'm really not very keen on the jump boost and movement, still feels very Titanfally.\nEDIT: I have played a bunch more of the multiplayer and after a few more hours of playing I have really gotten into it, absolutely loving it. Took until about level 15 but from then on I adjusted to the movement and really started going to town. A lot of fun so long as you don't rage from 1-2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths here and there :P\n\nTo conclude, if you loved the zombie gameplay from WaW/BO1, you should love this and it's really worth the money if you get it onsale or from a site like ♥♥♥ or whatever. Even though, personally, I'm not a fan of the Multiplayer, you might love it!\n\nI will update this as and when I finish the campaign, but right now I just want to play Zombies, the new map is especially fun and interesting and is a labyrinth the first few times and always surprises around the corner so far!","November 29, 2015","true","235.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nation1/recommended/311210/","Nation1","Nation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nation1/","29 products in account","(I will be mainly talking about the multiplayer, unless I say otherwise)\n\nThe 12th installment in the Call of Duty franchise and the fourth CoD game that Treyarch have released, Black Ops III goes for a futuristic aproach compared to the standard "arcade" military shooter (Modern warfare series), much like the previous, "Advanced Warfare". This time though, you won't be jumping around all the time, which is what many of people complained about in AW. Your double jumping needs to recharge after you have used it, you can't dash in mid air to avoid gun fire, which means you almost always want to have gun fights on the ground, like the previouse games.\n\nTo be honest, I have not played any of the campaign, so I can not tell you much about that, except that you now get camo unlocks for using guns in the campaign, which translate to multiplayer. There is also a new difficulty, which give you 1 health, instead of the normal 100, which means that a single shot from any gun will kill you.\n\nAnother big part of Treyarch's Call of Duty games are the zombie mode. This is very similar to Black Ops 2's zombies, except with some new guns and abilities in the new zobies story mode "Shadows of Evil", where you play as a brand new set of characters.\n\nAnother exiting new feature is the new Free Run mode. This is where you will chase the best time in a course of parkour and try to top the leaderboards.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic addition to the series and comes with a load of new content and I would have to say that this is definatley the best addition since Black Ops II, so if you like the other games, or you are a newcomer to this series, you should really pick this game up.\n\n9/10 from me.\n[Please note that there are a whole lot of bugs, and I could not start my game because of them. I did a quick Google search adn found some system files on reddit to fix these issues.]\n","December 12, 2015","true","510.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game has been running completey smooth and I havent had a so called crash yet. I've actaully tested it out on new and old hardware and it still runs good and hasn't crashed. People think it should run maxed out on 5-6 year old hardware. Sorry it's not going to happen. Thats why you have new parts come out and need new hardware to run NEW games maxed. Things change and stuff evolves. Before I get all the hate for trying to defend the game...I'm going to tell you the systems I have tryed it on...\n\n1st system:\nAMD FX 8350 (stock no oc)\n16gb ddr3 1866mhz\nHD 7970 3gb...\nAlmost all medium settings no ambient occlusion Screen res 80% and FXAA-60fps vsync on\n\n2nd system:\nI5 4440 (stock no co)\n16gb ddr3 1866mhz\nGeforce GTX 660 2gb...\nAlmost all medium settings no ambient occlusion Screen res 80% and FXAA-60fps vsync on\n\n3rd system which is my gaming system:\nI7 4790k Devils Canyon (OC'ed 4.6ghz-5ghz boost)\n32gb ddr3 2800\nEVGA 980ti FTW 6gb\nEverything maxed out All goodies on Screen resoloution 200%-60fps vsync on\n\nHave played on all three systems and haven't seen a crash or problem yet. So as far as optimization goes I personally have to give it a big thumbs up.\n\nNow the game itself...I personally think it's fun. Its Cod with polish and more content. Treyarch continues with the Black Ops franchise and does not dissappoint with multiplayer. Sorry have not and probably will not play the campaign. Never do, Zombies portion of the game is really fun but they should have added a few more maps...guessing thats where DLC's will come to play. Sorry Treyarch but DLC's suck just trying to get money for more content that should have been in with the game anyways. But besides that I personally am enjoying the game and give it a thumbs up...all of treyarchs games have been really fun.\n","December 6, 2015","true","154.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is truley one of the best in the Call of Duty series. Treyarch does care about the pc community and balancing as they have been releasing patch after patch to address bug fixes, Nerfing/buffing weapons, and optimization. I highley recommend getting this game especially with mod support coming in 2016.\n\nThere are a few hackers ,it's rare to encounter one, but it seems Treyarch is coming down fullforce with the Ban Hammer on all of them as long as people keep reporting them. The story can be a little complicated, especially near the end but you will have to replay it if you wish to full understand the story. Zombies are back and better than ever.\nFor 60USD you get:\n\n-Single Player (6-10 hours depending on which difficulty you play on + Tons of secrets to collect, Co-op mode with split screen support)\n\n-Multiplayer  ( Easily hundreds of hours worth of playtime with future mod support for custom maps/modes coming in 2016, Tons of unlocks for weapons, attachments and camos,Custom Emblem creator, Paintshop which basically lets you create your own camo for your gun, gunsmith, co-op with splitscreen support)\n\n-Zombies (It's one map if you don't own the season pass but it's huge with tons of hidden stuff/lore to find and split screen support)\n\n-A freerun mode for praticing wallrunning + leaderboard support so people can compete for the shortest amount of time it took to complete a level.\n\n-A hidden zombie single player campaign ( It's just a rehash of the story missions, in a different order, but with zombies and new dialog/cutscenes and co-op/splitscreen support)\n\n-Dead Ops Arcade 2\n\nTreyarch have truely outdone themselves compared to Black Ops 2.\n\n10/10","November 14, 2015","true","353.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftaY/recommended/311210/","ShiftaY","Axis | Milkman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftaY/","44 products in account","Call of Duty is one of the many games (FPS related) that I play, you cant exactly contrast the game with other FPS games are they have different play styles. Most of the time, Call of Duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on. Well thats what it seems like to me.\n\nThe game is good, dont get me wrong, it is enjoyable to play BUT there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button.\n\n1- What the game has become.\n\nThe days of being able to use other weapons in game is over, being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an LMG or Sniper is no longer a play style that can be used. there was nothing that I loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on DOM. instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style.\n\n2- Rush.\n\nI can understand that Call of Duty is a fast FPS game, one of the easiest to play in that matter, you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like Battlefield, you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots, Sniper Ghost Warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it. both Black ops 2, Ghost and AW (I dont own AW but from friends that have the game) are saturated with the use of SMGs and/or Shotguns, having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a Sniper almost obselete, LMG users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high DMG smgs you find in BO3, yet when it comes to balancing things....\n\n3- How to guide: Balancing Weapons.\n\nafter using the Haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that I do not understand\n-Somehow, it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage, yet, fires a buckshot, like most of the shotguns in BO3\n-I am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon, note most of the people that are hating on me, get to close.\n\nYou See, Treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between Balance and butthurt, Balance, is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol, that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the Haymaker, the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone, simple as that. but when balancing weapons, also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from. This could be from places like reddit, youtube etc, once you read these comments, actually take some time to look at statistics, I am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right. there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing SMGs with have the range of a sniper... Im not just saying this because I get killed byt SMGs quite a lot, but more so that it is true. for example, if you look at say the Vesper, chuck rapid fire, laser sight and fast mag. You pretty much has a lightweight minigun.\n\nthere are positives to the game, the zombies is spot on, I love it!, have enjoyed every single moment of it!, especially when you disconnect from Singleplayer....\n\nMultiplayer, although has a fair amount of issues, is fun.\n\nbut my main complaint for the game, is the constant FPS spikes/stutters... any kind of help I look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer... I have updated the drivers, which had pretty much no effect what-so-ever, getting a better computer well, I think I have good enough specks to be honest (i7-2600, HD7950 and 8GB ram).\n\nDont you find it sad how, supposedly, Creating a sequal to what was quite a good game (Black ops 2) take such a downfall, games are meant for enjoyment, being able to communicate with friends, and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother. Dont you feel dissapointed in YOUR inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer. Isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50% of the comments/reviews on the game are Negative? I know this will most likely not been seen by the eyes of any Treyarch developer but all these questions run through my mind. the thing is... what goes through yours...","January 4","false","301.7"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","24","44","0","0"

It seems to have a fun feel to it. Unfortunately i feel as if treyarch really doesn't care for the PC gamer. A finished product that released a beta should have no issues but here we are 3 days after its release and there are still tons of problems. Everyone has a different problem and so far no useful patches. WHAT MAKES THIS GAME UNPLAYABLE FOR ME **FLICKERING SHADOWS** I feel like i'm going to have a seizure if i keep playing this game. Every movement depicts a different shadow causing every texture in the game to be a strobe light of black shadows any way i move. HOW CAN I POSSIBLY SEE ANY OTHER MOVEMENT? its awful. Also the game loves to crash when you exit it. Leaving you in limbo for however long it takes. I just reboot my computer after 15 minutes. Shame because i was expecting more.. Treyarch is too focused on those nerds from consoles that they don't give a flying sh*t about our problems on PC just another 60 bucks a pop for them hopefully they fix these issues and i will have better things to say about them. Wait until this game updates to buy. Also for those who think these issues are graphics related that simply isn't so.

It seems to have a fun feel to it. Unfortunately i feel as if treyarch really doesn't care for the PC gamer. A finished product that released a beta should have no issues but here we are 3 days after its release and there are still tons of problems. Everyone has a different problem and so far no useful patches. WHAT MAKES THIS GAME UNPLAYABLE FOR ME **FLICKERING SHADOWS** I feel like i'm going to have a seizure if i keep playing this game. Every movement depicts a different shadow causing every texture in the game to be a strobe light of black shadows any way i move. HOW CAN I POSSIBLY SEE ANY OTHER MOVEMENT? its awful. Also the game loves to crash when you exit it. Leaving you in limbo for however long it takes. I just reboot my computer after 15 minutes. Shame because i was expecting more.. Treyarch is too focused on those nerds from consoles that they don't give a flying sh*t about our problems on PC just another 60 bucks a pop for them hopefully they fix these issues and i will have better things to say about them. Wait until this game updates to buy. Also for those who think these issues are graphics related that simply isn't so.

But ye, here we are :p.\nKeep in mind that I've never played a COD Game on PC Before!\n\nPersonally, I've been really enjoying the game. It's very competive but also (for me atleast, could just be me being bad) quite hard on PC. Lvling up goes quite fast and It's not that hard to earn camo's.\nIn the beginning although getting used to that double jumping and sliding can really be a pain in the ♥♥♥ but once you get the hang of it it gets less annoying.\n\nPro's:\n-Pretty competitive on PC.\n-Fast games, not like CS:GO Competives.\n-Alot of variation in maps and gamemodes.\n-Not many cheaters. (yet)\n-Decent graphics.\n-Feels good when having a killstreak or blasts some kids away with the new specials.\n\nCon's:\n-Pretty toxic community, if you want to take the game serious you gotta have to deal with arguing players or little kids from time to time. But you can always mute them.\n-Pretty hard to learn the maps, specialists and controlls in the beginning.\n-Expensive. I'd suggest ♥♥♥ Or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n-Other players will sometimes ♥♥♥♥ on you because they have better weapons.\n-Matchmaking can be pretty bad at times.\n-Laggy servers from time to time.\n-Can be hard to run for some people, I've read articles about people having a good pc and getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ frames. Do some research before buying it!\n\nConclusion:\nI've been really enjoying BO3 so far which I didn't expect at all. I'm going to give it a 7/10. If you can manage to pick it up for 30 euros on ♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I do recommend it.\n\nThanks for Reading,\n-Tigah","January 13","true","215.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinrabca/recommended/311210/","shinrabca","Shinra;","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinrabca/","38 products in account","There is a "too long didnt read" down below.\n\nWell now, I've had such joy and excitement for this game... Boy was I surprised, when I saw everyone complaining about the bad optimisation. I could hold 60 frames with 100% render resolution and medium settings, and having a 2GB GTX 670, I thought it was normal. Then the random FPS drops started, my aim flickered even with the slightest frame drops of 2+ frames. Mouse sensitivity in general seems like it always has some acceleration or smoothening. But then when I decided to try sniping, my favourite type of playing since COD 4, I realised that they ♥♥♥♥ed up the sens when scoped in. Well how could they ♥♥♥♥ that up you ask? Lets just say that its higher than when hipfiring. But that wouldnt be a problem, wouldnt it? No, it wouldnt, you can get used to that, BUT you CANT get used to aim tearing when someone starts shooting you and your frames drop below 10.\nNow then, when the most important part is over, which is aiming, lets get to connections and matchmaking. Well, it is for the most part pretty good, that is untill 3 days after release, when in-game online matches started to stutter, with huge lag spikes for anywhere from a minute to 4 minutes. Today on the fifth day post release, me including practically all my steam buddies from all over europe couldnt connect to a snigle online match.\n\nAnd the game is full of little bugs, which are indeed very annoying, for example:\n-not being able to access the steam overlay,\n-when you alt+tab whilst in fullscreen, the game automatically transfers to windowed\n- when typing in in-game chat, the assigned buttons instead of enabling the chat, both enable it and write "t" or "y" or "p" in chat (or whatever the designated key is)\n- private matches cant be saved online\n- when playing with virtual 7.1 surround your left and right speakers sometimes muffle themselves without any reason\n- if trying to overclock the gpu while ingame the game freezes, leaving you unable to do anything other than to restart your pc\n- today after being unable to connect to a match, when finally connected the gun (AN-44) was considerably lower than the center of the screen, while the other guns seemed to be unnafected\n- paintshop and emblem making is not well optimised for the KB&M\n- the "social" menu seems to click all the time on the same spot even though the user trying to go up or down\n- NO RELOAD CANCELING\n- NO BOLT CANCELING...\n- intro is annoying (can be disabled if you know what you're doing)\n- contrast on stronghold is blindingly high combined with the extreme brightness that cannot be turned down even when set to the minimum\n- when the servers were down i went to bo2 for a bit, and the game, which is THREE YEARS older, made by the SAME devs, looks better, and I can run it on 125FPS EASILY, even the sensitivity is better\n\nThat would be it for the bad parts, now for the good ones:\n- astoundingly great gun balance\n- diverse weapons and costumisation\n- creative, diverse and colorful maps\n- most maps are 3 laned\n- spawns were spot on 95% of the time\n- new challanges that are fun and plentiful\n- A FKIN STATREK *_*\n- viable pistols\n- viable granates and tacticals\n- perks are perks, not essential god items\n- coop campaign and zombies\n- fun killstreaks, which are not op\n- many specialists and specialist abilities to choose from, as well as custumising them with different clothes, prefered gun and win boasting\n- the return of the almighty pick 10 system\n- great deal to unlock via supplydrops\n- cryptokeys (the item with which you unlock supply drops) are not too hard to earn, and do not need micro-transactions to be earned\n- supply drops are purely cosmetic, so there's no pay to win with that\n\nIf you like COD you'll surely like this one, that is if you dont mind the apsurd amount of bugs, which honestly shouldn't be present in an AAA game. If you're like me and you cant stand the small changes and bugs, wait untill they fix this.\n\nSo, you might ask me, why have I recommended the game then, if I hate it so much? Well because, as much as I hate the game, I equally love it. It is a breath of fresh air to the COD community, which you wouldnt notice if youre not a COD fan. The game would be great if it was optimised like for the consoles.\n\nTL;DR: Black ops 2 looks better and feels better, game is unoptimised at best, very buggy. Mouse sensitivity is bad, sniping even worse. Has great value if considering play time. IF you're planning to buy, wait untill an update that will optimise this game better comes.","November 10, 2015","true","397.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngfmj/recommended/311210/","fngfmj","Wafflecopter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngfmj/","75 products in account","Easily the best Call of Duty game yet, and it will stay that way for a long time. That sounds corny, I know, but it actually is. I've played every CoD game since MW3, every single one has disappointed me, until I got this. If you are looking at getting any Call of Duty game, this is the one to get.\n\nPros\n-The campaign's story: It is surreal, it is visceral, it is disturbing, it is philosophical, it is easily one of the best I have ever played, and the game is worth buying for the story alone. There are scenes in this game that are going to stick with me for years to come. I have no idea how Treyarch will top this.\n-Campaign enemies: Lots of new enemies in this, including combat robots and walking tanks, all are actually unique in the way they act\n-Overall amount of content: You get a full co-op/solo campaign mode, a version of MW3's Survival mode in Campaign, a freerunning mode, classic zombie survival, a zombies campaign, something like Forza's livery editor, and, of course, multiplayer.\n-The weapons: A lot of the weapons feel very nice to shoot - personal favorites are the Man O' War, Gorgon and the Vesper\n-Freerunning: 3arc designed the freerunning mechanics around curves instead of straight lines like Advanced Warfare, and it feels great. Things just flow so nicely, and it's not blatantly unbalanced like Advanced Warfare, either. Also, you have complete control over your gun while freerunning, and it's so, so satisfying when you can rack up a killstreak going from wallrunning to powersliding to hovering to wallrunning.\n-The atmosphere of the campaign: It never feels as if you are fighting against some random terrorist group like it does in the other games, in fact, I forgot who the main groups in the game were because the hunt for Taylor and his group of 3 squadmates was all I could focus on. It feels personal, almost.\n-Multiplayer specialists: Each one is focused towards a specific style of play. Choose Sparrow if you like sniping, choose Spectre for CQB and stealth and Reaper for more of an assault character.\n-Gunsmith: This is a lot like Forza's livery creator. Take any weapon and create a paintjob for it using a large assortment of decals. You can also create variants of guns by mixing and matching attachments, these variants can be used in any mode you choose.\n-Mods: This is the first Call of Duty game to have mod support since World at War. Official mod tools, along with dedicated server browsers are expected sometime in mid-2016. Go figure.\n-It's addicting: I can't put my finger on it, but something about this game is really addicting.\n-Graphics: A lot of pieces of this game look incredibly good, definitely one of the better-looking games that I own. Faces were one of the things that really stood out to me.\n\nControversial\n-Weapon balance: People say that this game has good weapon balance. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥ at the game, but I feel like most of the weapons are balanced and then there's 3 that are just incredibly OP. See: Vesper, Drakon, and HVK30\n-Zombies: A lot of people say that Zombies was not very well done, but for what it's worth I think it's ok. They've treated it like an actual mode now, you have ranks and as I've mentioned, you can customize your weapons you get from the wall and mystery box.\n-Campaign "superpowers": This was supposed to be one of the big features of the campaign, but I never felt the need to actually use them at all. This is probably just dependent on how you play though.\n-Campaign characters: A few are very memorable, like Sarah Hall and John Taylor, but some of the others are just bland and forgettable\n-The community: I feel like the community has improved a bit, because I met a few people that were actually really nice to talk to, but then you also have a lot of trolls, wannabe dank meme quickscopers and people that are just toxic.\n-Only a few select modes are being played right now: As of right now, Domination, TDM and another mode are the only ones being played in multiplayer. It's not impossible to find a game that isn't on one of those modes, it'll just take longer. This might also change in the future.\n\nCons\n-Nightmares: I know that this is the "hidden" zombies campaign, but I think it's utter ♥♥♥♥ and horribly done. It's just not fun, if you try to run/jump/fly away from the zombies, they just hit you once and slow you to a ♥♥♥♥ing crawl. And they tried to adapt a new story to the existing campaign levels, and it feels like you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing reeducation camp. It is miserable.\n-Sound: After listening to Advanced Warfare's sounds, the sound in this game is a pretty big letdown. It just has zero feel to it. The Gorgon, which is supposed to be a heavy machine gun, is actually so quiet I have to turn up my volume to hear the gunshots better.\n-The "cinematic experience" ♥♥♥♥s over the percieved power of the story a bit: The final level in this game is incredibly surreal, but I feel like to keep up with Activision's expectations, Treyarch was forced to put in an entire ♥♥♥♥ing army of people and explosions to make it "look like a movie". And then you have people shooting rockets at you, like, ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, really?\n-Copy-pasted CSGO case system everyone is using now: Title. There was absolutely no need for this.\n\nAnyways, I do believe this sits inside my personal top 10 list at the 10th spot, behind Dying Light and Killing Floor 2. It's a great game overall and I say that you should pick it up.","December 8, 2015","true","89.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

If you have 8GB ram or lower you can expect frequent crashes and stutters in-game. The story in the campaign is one of the worst to date in my opinion and most of it is just a weird shootfest. Zombies is a lot of fun but after a while it gets boring because there is only 1 map available (2 with season pass). Multiplayer is fast-paced, fun and action packed but has some frustating elements like flinch and not a lot of map variety.","November 7, 2015","false","573.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

For me I enjoy the COD multiplayer experience, Blops III really delivers. A great range of guns, score streaks, perks and equipment to play around with.\n\nThe maps, oh my, the maps! Blops III has in my opinion the second best multiplayer maps in COD history, WAW taking the #1 spot.\nI wasn't a fan of the jet packing and futuristic wall running at first but it has grown on me and now I really enjoy it.\n\nA lot of people are moaning about the servers as usual, the game runs perfectly for me.\nI love the black market, where you can use game tokens earned by playing or pay real money to earn more tokens quickly, then use these tokens to try your luck at a kind of slot machine, unlocking rare and exclusive camos, weapons etc But it's not pay to win, it's basically all cosmetic.\n\nI do not like: The specialist abilities. Why is it OK for someone that is 4/17 to destroy me with a had held noob tube or a flame thrower with ease?\nAnswer: It's not.

I've spent the last 6 years making fun of CoD players. You either die a tool, or you live long enough to accept the Dew and Doritos into your heart.\n\nI have experienced 0 crashes in dozens of hours. Occasional framerate drops, but nothing gamebreaking - maybe giving up a kill every now and then. Effects are great, screen clutter is great without performance hits, and Specialist and weapon balancing is on point. There is no dominant loadout or gun, as pistols can hold their own against semi-auto snipers.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game if you aren't psychotic about tick-rates, wall-banging, or serious competitive environments and just want a fast-paced arcadey FPS.\n\nAddendum: I've noticed the vast majority of the review for this game are negative because of people experiencing frame rate issues. These people then proceed to post their "beastly" computer builds, many of which run a GTX 970 GPU and some crazy $600 CPU. I have run this game flawlessly on both a 950 and a 970 with an i5, so I have no idea what weird ♥♥♥♥ those people are doing to their computers. I show both the integrated FPS display, and a third party Fraps FPS. In game, I am at or above 60 FPS 99.9% of the time.

I never did and i doubt i ever will.\n\nThe Multiplayer is good. Not very good but good. The movements are far away from Advanced Warfare and you can still dominate a game if you dont use them. The maps are colorful and mainly have a good flow (3 way system).\nThe weapons are balanced imho. At least there is no obvious overpowered gun.\n\nOne new addition to this game is the blackmarket. Its nearly the same as the supply frops in AW but till now they dont offer weapon variants. There are camos, melee weapons (reskined), gestures and attachment variants (just cosmetic).\n\nTo open supply drops you have to use crypto keys, which u get by playing the game. You can also buy COD points to open the supply drops. I dont like the route activision takes but as long as people spend their money in micro transactions, we wont get rid off this.\n\nThe best thing about this game is Zombies. Either if you play solo or with your friends - it is awesome.\nThey added some new features without taking the good old zombies feeling. Gobblegums are produced by Liquid Divinium which you either get by playing or spending COD points. These gums can save your ♥♥♥ in some tough situations without being OP.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing COD before, you will enjoy this game even more.\nIf you didnt play COD till now, this game is good to get in touch with the franchise.\n\nCampaign: unrated\nMultiplayer: 8/10\nZombies: 10/10","March 6","true","611.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","4"

There should be a multiplayer only purchase option at reduced cost.","November 7, 2015","false","4.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The first Black Ops game in my opinion stands out above the rest.  So how does the new one hold up?  It's alright.\n\nSome new features such as more mobility (jump-packs, sliding, wall-running), characters to choose each with a special weapon and ability, some interesting weapons, and your basic melee attack doesn't one-hit kill unless from behind (however you can equip a knife in your secondary slot that will one-hit kill).  Overall a decent experience.  It still suffers from some of the same issues as usual, and perhaps new ones as well, but it's not a bad game.  It's not ground-breaking innovation either though, this is COD we're talking about.  They play it safe.  So if you're expecting innovation then save your money.\n\nThere were some launch issues with the game I believe, but those as far as I can tell have all been fixed.

Days trying to boost FPS, no success. Even after game patches and driver updates, everyone still complaining about game performance, for a good reason.

Also, from Extra to Low make a gain of only 20~30 fps. The only way to gain a real amount of FPS is changing the rendering resolution to 50~80% of native resolution, making the graphics even worst and completely unplayable.\n\nOther things to mention (BO3):\n- Sometimes to play online you must keep trying many times, because sometimes it gives an error code for no reason.\n- When I downloaded the game, it didn't come with my native language and was giving error to launch the game.

Black Ops 3 is just... good and thats all... nothing special\n- A huge step back comparing to Black Ops 2 (one ending, no moral choices, no extra missions etc.)\n- Only 11 missions (which is about 6-7hrs of gameplay and maybe 10-11hrs on realistic mode)\n- None of the characters are interesting\n- Character customization is a joke\n\n6/10... and 8/10 if You want to play with friends\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMultiplayer:\n+ Almost great balance\n+ Well designed maps (with a little exception for Breach... wtf is this map???)\n+ Specialists are awesome\n+ Swimming, thrust jumps and wall running equals smooth and fast paced action\n+ Paintjobs, gunsmith, black market, character/weapon customization, tons of skins, challenges and stuff\n\n+/- Some maps are not designed for a new movement system, but its not a problem when map looks awesome\n\n- Some "special abilities" are not as good as the others or they are too good (I'm looking at You Reaper)\n- Small amount of weapons (7x AR, 6x SMG, 4x LMG/Shotguns/Sniper rifles, 3 pistols, 2 launchers and a knife)... thats 31 in total comparing to 42 in Black Ops and 49 in MW3\n\n9/10\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nZombies:\n+ 'Shadows of evil' is climatic as hell\n+ Easter eggs\n+ Interesting characters (especially in 'SoE')\n+ Quotable dialogues\n+ Gooblegums\n+ Dead Ops Arcade 2 is way better than the first one\n+ You can unlock extra weapon camos by playing zombies (same with campaign, but campaign skins are ugly as f*ck)\n+ New Pack-a-Punch mechanics that gives You extra perks for Your weapon when You are upgrading it many times\n+ Thank God we dont have 'thrust jumps' and wall runs in Zombies (well... we can wallrun on one spot in SoE but... its only one damn spot so its acceptable I think)\n\n- Ummm... where the hell is Grief Mode?\n- Only one map (three if we count 'the Giant' as expansion and 'Dead Ops Arcade' as mini-game)\n\n8/10 (well I would give 9 out of 10 but... its only one map and the rest will be in dlc so... we just need to wait)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr? :P\n\nIn overall I rate this game 8+/10 with its great multiplayer, awesome zombies mode and cooperative campaign. The only one true downside is the 'Single Player' mode which is not satisfying as it should be with its mediocre plot and lack of things that Black Ops 2 gave to us 3 years ago.\n\nP.S. I didn't mention 'Free run' mode which is basically a time trail on 4 special maps. Its fun to check once in a while. Nothing special but its not bad.\n\n* I'm not a fanboy of Black Ops 2 but seriously... Menendez is a well crafted character with an interesting backstory... the problem is that most of the CoD players are rushing campaign (or didnt even touch it) just to beat it as fast as they can and they are not interested in characters. Menendez was ranked #1 on GameInformer's list of top 10 villain's of 2012.","December 7, 2015","true","673.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","9","15","3","5"

Ainda é Possivel!\nA Campanha, é Ok, só Ok, veja bem, não há outra possivel definição. Houve a introdução de elementos como o QG onde você verá seus colecionáveis, customizará a armadura e as armas, mas não falo de Loadout e sim de pintura e desenhos em si, faça o que quiser, o problema é que isso tudo é apenas: Inutil! (Ao Menos na Campanha)\n\nO Zombies! Ai sim, fomos surpreendidos!\nÉ o melhor, se em BO2 já existia um modo bem divertido e que valia para passar o tempo, em BO3 isso tudo foi maximizado e é como se todos os aspectos negativos daquele zombies tivessem sido resolvidos, os mapas são ainda maiores e talvez(só talvez) deixaram ainda mais dificil toda a experiencia, isso sem citar a maior variedade de Inimigos e Perks, além da narrativa que finalmente convence. Simplesmente Sensácional, por si valeria o título.\n\nE o Multiplayer? BO2 com DASHS, é exatamente como se eu estivesse jogando há dois anos porém com gráficos muito bonitos e toda a mecãnica de saltos.\n\n-Agora há a customização completa da arma, assim como havia a dos emblemas; o Mercado Negro onde é possivel trocar Points ganhos EM JOGO por pacotes contendo itens desbloqueaveis apenas pelos mesmos e a enorme variedade de Especialistas, cada um com habilidades unicas e que merecem o seu teste até que se decida qual realmente será sua classe, além da excelente customização da armadura de cada um conforme se avança nos objetivos.\n\n-Há também alguns modos secundários que envolvem a aprendizagem e aperfeiçoamento das técnicas de "DASH", porém são irrelevantes.\n\n-O Cinema continua funcional como Sempre.\n\n*Problemas, Problemas e Mais ProblemasNUNCA INSTALE SEU BO3 NA LINGUAGEM PT-BR, por via das dúvidas, já que em muitos casos se fez necessário a instalação de um pacote de idiomas externo já que não houve a resolução do problema por parte da Activision e da própria Valve, já que se trata mais de um erro nos parâmetros da instalação do que de falta de arquivos!\n\nVai jogar Online(Porque alguém faria isso né?), então vá preparado porque os servidores são instaveis e funcionam quando querem, Pings oscilando de 400ms para 8ms com a maior naturalidade, TP's constantes e afins.\n\nPreciso falar que o Suporte da Activision não resolveu nada e te ignora a partir do momento em que você provar que o problema não é na sua Internet?Resumo da Obra: RAGE, ou o servidor ou os Prestige Masters sempre vão te deixar irritados... mas espere, não é pelo RAGE que nós jogamos COD mesmo?

The gameplay is just as good as other Call of Duties, but sometimes the plot can be confusing and by the end of the Campaign you won't be paying any attention to the plot. If you're looking for a CoD with a great campaign try CoD Advanced Warfare, CoD4 Modern Warfare, CoD Black Ops, or CoD Black Ops 2.\n\nThere's a Nightmares mode waiting after the Campaign, it's essentially a Zombies campaign. It's fun, the plot is great, but it's not the Zombies campaign that follows the original Zombies universe that we've always wanted.\n\nMultiplayer is amazing. The movement system cannot be compared to the movement system of any other CoD. It's not chaotic like Advanced Warfare, and feels just right. The guns are very balanced, although some are quite annoying when used well (Drakon for example, great for certain situations, and when someone with good aim is using it, it can be devastating and very annoying). The maps are very fun and the killstreaks are fun and balanced.  I would also like to mention the supply drops in this game only give cosmetic items, unlike Advanced Warfare where you can get powerful weapons.\n\nEDIT: You can now get weapons inside Supply Drops, but I've used each one and none of them are overpowered; they are really fun to use but not viable for competitive play. The only one that is close to being viable in competitive play is the MX Garand which currently (excluding snipers which have NO downsides) has the least downsides when attaching a suppressor.\n\nZombies is just as fun as the other games. The Shadows of Evil map in this game can be very unforgiving to new players compared to other games, as in order to survive past round 15 you will need to know the map well and it's easter eggs. The Giant is an amazing remake, familiar but a little bit different, bringing in new surprises. There's a new second pack a punch system, so when you pack a punch a weapon for the second time, instead of getting a boring attachment, you get a gun upgrade. Sometimes your gun may set zombies on fire, sometimes it may turn some of the zombies you shoot into powerful allies, sometimes it may occasionally spawn a fireworks turret, or it may make your gun shoot electric that chains on to multiple zombies. The Gobblegum system is great, and even though you can pay to buy Gobblegum packs, you will still need to be skillful at the game to survive, and there's a one-gobblegum-per-round restriction.","January 6","true","601.6"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","18","33","3","2"

I run at 1080P with every single possible option at ultra/all way up and anti aliasing all the way up. Called cinematic smting or other. No need to turn the rendering scale down either. Anyway it screams, and i can play it with every frame synced or say screw it and let the 980 loose to over 130 fps easily. I did notice a couple slight and very quick (lasted milliseconds) fps drops during campaign but nothing that caused lag bc already running very fast. Multilayer smooth as can be.  But i will say that I was surprised how CPU bound it is, and per Treyarch, the more cores you throw at it, it will use them. I have never had a game go past 42 ish on my cpu. Pushing this im at round 50. No big deal but worth mentioning.\n\nBottom line:Just got the game and like COD games, so I like the game so far.  Runs like a champ, but like other reviewers have said, you cant have a poop pc and expect to run 2015/soon to be 2016 games. Then again, most people consider AMD cpus weak and i run this thing like butter. If you like Call of Duty then you'll like this game.\n\nLastly, I have never written a Steam review but felt I had to because of all the bad performance reviews so far. And I was ready to write a bad review if it didn't perform well. Also as you notice I have AMD and Nvidia(intel) products and like both companies. But I must say it is absolutely hilarious when I see people with i7 complaining that they can't run this game. And I want an i7 too... or the new Zen.

But the thing is, how can it be a great game if you see screen tearing every 30 seconds? It is close to unplayable. I have an i7 4770k and a GTX 980 but I still get about 20-30 fps. It is horribly optimized for PC at the moment and do not buy it right now. Additionally, you will always be matched up with players of much higher skill (Max Level, Prestiege 3, etc.) and they always play against you. No matter what, you will always somehow get outgunned for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason. Not only that, the community is comparable to toxcicity of CS:GO. Lastly, I wanted to put in that players that use cheap or OP weapons are bountiful. I saw someone get a nuclear with the automatic shotgun, the Haymaker-12. What do you get if you put all this together? You get a cheap scam as a PC port from consoles. A lot of these points are on console as well, so watch out for that. In conclusion, do not buy this game at the moment. Wait for Treyarch to hopefully fix these issues, nerf weapons that need nerfing, buff weapons that need buffing, improve the stability, and make this game a worthy successor to Black Ops 2.\n\nUPDATE: The game is now even more unplayable with the fact that there are even more lag spikes that came with the so called "patch"\n\nUPDATE 2: Treyarch does not know how to nerf weapons (*cough* Haymaker*cough*)\n\nUPDATE 3: Okay uninstalling works great, but I tried to simply close the game, and not even Task Manager closed it. Worse than a virus.\n\nUPDATE 4: This game is official trash. Treyarch had pleny of time to balance this game, but they simply can't. Matchmaking is worse than the BETA. You will always be outgunned by, well, everything. There is no balance, you just get the L-CARs, a VMP, shotgun, Vesper, or P-O6. Then you win.

But the thing is, how can it be a great game if you see screen tearing every 30 seconds? It is close to unplayable. I have an i7 4770k and a GTX 980 but I still get about 20-30 fps. It is horribly optimized for PC at the moment and do not buy it right now. Additionally, you will always be matched up with players of much higher skill (Max Level, Prestiege 3, etc.) and they always play against you. No matter what, you will always somehow get outgunned for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason. Not only that, the community is comparable to toxcicity of CS:GO. Lastly, I wanted to put in that players that use cheap or OP weapons are bountiful. I saw someone get a nuclear with the automatic shotgun, the Haymaker-12. What do you get if you put all this together? You get a cheap scam as a PC port from consoles. A lot of these points are on console as well, so watch out for that. In conclusion, do not buy this game at the moment. Wait for Treyarch to hopefully fix these issues, nerf weapons that need nerfing, buff weapons that need buffing, improve the stability, and make this game a worthy successor to Black Ops 2.\n\nUPDATE: The game is now even more unplayable with the fact that there are even more lag spikes that came with the so called "patch"\n\nUPDATE 2: Treyarch does not know how to nerf weapons (*cough* Haymaker*cough*)\n\nUPDATE 3: Okay uninstalling works great, but I tried to simply close the game, and not even Task Manager closed it. Worse than a virus.\n\nUPDATE 4: This game is official trash. Treyarch had pleny of time to balance this game, but they simply can't. Matchmaking is worse than the BETA. You will always be outgunned by, well, everything. There is no balance, you just get the L-CARs, a VMP, shotgun, Vesper, or P-O6. Then you win. I have never had a game where I said "You know, that was fair, fun, and I got stuff done." I honestly want my money back.

It'll really allow the community to grow and BO3 can thrive on PC compared to other CoDs. (hey, most Treyarch games are still alive on PC, they seem to be best at PC cods for the most part) Some might find it a bummer that you can't prestige, but besides permanent unlock tokens prestige is just to show off progression, and as far as I'm concerned CSGO has no progression system besides of course, trying to rank up in matchmaking, and yet look how big it is. So this honestly shouldn't be a problem since you can still get all of the base weapons, and you have access to the black market for skins and the chance to get some rare weapons.\n\nI guess one of the biggest questions is when mod support comes, will players on this version have access? Mod support has the possibility to make BO3 even better on PC, and if a wider audience has access to the supposed separate lobbies that will have mod support, the possibilites go on. Besides that, I'm guessing the season pass will only be available to owners of the full game. Reasonable enough, since you can still upgrade to the full game, and there's a decent selection of maps to begin with. Mod support could bring in more maps anyhow.\n\nEither way if you want to try out the BO3 multiplayer with a lower entry fee, and ESPECIALLY if you're only interested in the multiplayer aspect (not co-op, competitive multiplayer) the multiplayer starter pack is definitely for you.","February 16","true","173.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The weapons are fun to use (except the Kuda, that can go ♥♥♥♥ itself). The boosters/jetpacks feel a lot smoother than in AW and it's fun to slide around with a shotgun and kill them while sliding. For some reason people are saying the performance is either great or horrendus, I'm on the great side with a GTX 970/amd FX8350/8GB ram and the game runs perfect and smooth on the highest settings. I havent tried zombies yet since the SOE doesn't interest me that much with that whole alien thing. One thing that kind of disappointed me was the gore. Back in WAW, limbs would fly off when shot with high powered snipers, shotguns or grenades. The only time I see gore is with the specialist abilites, which saddens me. It'll be interesting to see what the mod support will bring us, maybe good ol' WAW and Cod 4 maps, we'll see.","December 3, 2015","true","147.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

This "review" is more of a port report and some impressions of the multiplayer. It is not a serious review since I am not big into multiplayer FPSes and the only other COD i played was the one from 2005, so I cant make comparisons with other CODs.\n\nPort report\n\nPerformance is really good. With everything maxed out except resolution scale (100%) and motion blur, which I disabled, the game ran at 1080p at 100-120 fps on average on GTX 980 SC, i7 2600 and 16gb of Ram, from a hard drive. You can rebind keyboard buttons, and the mouse feels great in this game. I have had no crashes , but I had two disconnects or so, but nothing major.\n\nThe game\n\nThe good:\n\n-good graphics\n-awesome soundtrack\n-awesome maps\n-very good gunplay\n-solid gameplay, but not revolutionary\n-nice style\n-good controls\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- the UI is rather confusing\n-some powers from the characters that you use are kind of useless.\n-the scene at the end of each match- it is done rather lazy , cliched and cringe-worthy, especially the lame sentence you hear when you lose :"I did not sign up for this, get your ♥♥♥♥ together".\n- the jetpack mechanic- it is good, but you cannot use it to climb every building , because invisible walls, thats why. The developers played it safe here, it would have been so awesome to jump above buildings. Huge missed opportunity.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the little I have played, I give it a 7/10. I give a mild recommendation. If you are tired with the franchise, you might not like it (looks a bit like BLOPS 2 from what I have seen), but otherwise I think you will be satisfied.","December 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I quite enjoyed playing this game, especially Zombies mode.\nBut in all honesty, I cannot recommend this game. The main reason being that it is so heavily connection based, even for online solo playthroughs in Campaign and Zombies. I know there is the offline modes for them and recently Zombies. but it's not as fun because most if not all the unlockables are already unlocked, you can't play with others besides locally and the fact that none of the offline progression counts towards your online profile. Worst example would be Campaign, say you played about half the chapters, found a good amount of the collectable items and got to level 10, go online, you'll have to do that all over again.\n\nMultiplayers' connection is a bit of a mess right now. When I first started playing multiplayer some matches would have played smoothly, whereas some was a bit laggy, yet still managable. But now, I get about 10/10 laggy matches. Thing is it just makes it so much more frustrating, because you know you can do better than your stats would display at the end or not being able to get that easy kill because the player in front of your is either warping or your shots aren't hitting. I have to resort to playing with the shotgun now to even get any kills in at all because headshots are out of the question when your aim staggers from the lag.","February 16","false","161.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

CoD Ghosts looks and runs smoother.\nMitmarkers (where a bullet hits the body) are all over the shop. You watch a bullet head towards the target... before it reaches the target you know that it will miss (based on bullet trajectory and target movement) and then suddenly it registers as a hit!! The opposite happens as well! Worst case is you watch a bullet head towards the waistline or leg and it registers as a headshot. Then when you see your bullet head straight to the targets head (and the head is the only thing visible) it registers as a hit (sometimes) but not as a headshot!!\nOn the upside this game is better than Advanced Warfare and they have the making of a really good game with the exosuits being restricted compared to AW.  Accuracy of bullet hitmarkers, graphics improvements and better weapon "balancing" is required for me to give this game a better rating.\nThe jury is still out if I will purchase another Call of Duty game in the future.","February 15","false","291.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/recommended/311210/","ique","ique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/","388 products in account","Gonna try to keep this review short and sweet. I've played through the campaign and dabbled a bit in both zombies and MP, but not too much.\n\nThe game performs well for me. I haven't had any issues with stuttering, but the frame rate can fluctuate a fair bit and the game can be very heavy on your system. SP played great on medium-high with a 770 but I prefer to turn it down for MP for that sweet (mostly) solid 120 fps. I don't want to discredit the people with real issues but I do see people just being stubborn with turning down settings sometimes and then claiming they have performance issues, so take the angriest reviews with a bit of salt :)\n\nMost of the PC features you want are here and all MP games are on dedi servers. Very happy with the work the PC team has done.\n\nCampaign is your standard mind ♥♥♥♥ Black Ops storyline. Sadly it doesn't tie in very much to the previous games, but there's a fair bunch to think about here, and there are little clues that things aren't perhaps as they seem. I think there might be a deeper meaning of things that you can't figure out right away. I appreciate that in a game. You can tell the campaign is made for coop play, levels are very large and missions long with loads of enemies. Me playing solo at veteran difficulty could spend a good minute just picking enemies off from a distance before entering the fray so I didn't overwhelm myself. It still has the same cinematic setpieces and a gorillion explosions going off so the pure action fans won't be disappointed. The mind powers you get are pretty cool to shake things up but a bit cumbersome to switch between. I ended up mainly using the same active and passive abilites the entire game, but the choice is there if you want it.\n\nI haven't tried the nightmares mode yet. It's played on the same maps as the campaign but with a new story line and zombies, which looks freaking amazing but can't give my own thoughts on it yet. I will say I like the idea as I find zombies cool but I don't like the round based stuff much.\n\nZombies itself then is neat, but I haven't played much. For a super casual zombies player like me I enjoy just running around the map, buying a few wall guns and dying at level 5 but I'll get the hang of it eventually. There's a lot here if you want to spend some time with it.\n\nMP is fun so far. I have to admit I don't like the specialists much, their abilites are extremely powerful and I prefer just playing gun on gun. Otherwise it is reminiscent of BO2 in many ways (which I loved too) with an extra dimension through new movement techniques. They do a lot to make you move fluently through maps and it's fun to find new tricks. Firefights still stay mainly on the ground and shooting midair is pretty awkward. People equaling the movement to that in AW are absolutely clueless.\n\nThe guns are very varied and all of them viable, perks like wise. Pick 10 is as good as ever. Streaks a little weaker than BO2 which I personally like. New game modes are nice, but nothing revolutionary. Good stuff overall and I'll think I'll pop in from time to time a lot over the next few years. Balance is a thing that will evolve over time but so far I'm digging it.\n\n---\n\nIt's perhaps not the most ground breaking game ever, but it's the best Call of Duty in a long time and a very entertaining experience in its own right. Treyarch always makes solid titles and you can tell they're proud of the game they've made.\n\n8/10 looking forward to modding this spring","November 10, 2015","true","220.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/recommended/311210/","sandra_afrika","Lars Alexandersson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandra_afrika/","244 products in account","No spoiler in this review.\n\nThe latest episode in Call of Duty franchise. Continuing the story from WAW, BO1 and BO2. The time is setting in the future, 2065. All the sci-fi stuff is awesome and fantastic in both appearance and functionality. Generally, the main menu is fabulous. You may admire your own character in the menu backgrounds. And you can locally play with friends in split-screen! (Support both vertical or horizontal split) This is very cool if you want to play together locally.\n\nThe game breaks into 3 big modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. In BO3, all these modes are quite decent individually. Moreover, all 3 modes are well connected. Such as, in Multiplayer mode, you may use the camo which was previously unlocked in Campaign mode. Most of the unlocks and customizations are shared in all 3 modes. And in each mode you have your own progress. They all have levels, achievements and statistics separately. Besides, all 3 modes have multiplayer which means you can play these modes with friends! Campaign and Zombies mode both support COOP up to 4 players.\n\nAnother awesome part is the customizations and the media community. Most of the FPS game (such as Battlefield series) allow players to decorate their guns with camo. And also have custom Emblems for creative players to show themselves. In BO3, each custom Emblem support up to 64 layers. Which means you could create almost anything you want. Furthermore, you may also fully customize your weapons with "Camo" and "Paint Job", even "Clan Tag" or "Kill Counter" if you got prestige. These customizations are not only for you to please yourself. You can upload your sick guns the to in-game media community. All the BO3 players could see your works and rate them, even download them if they like it. So the customization and social functionality is quite robust in BO3. (Screenshots sharing coming soon)\n\nIn order to clearly express my opinion, I will review BO3 mode by mode.\n\nCampaign\nVery nice and deep story, continue the story from BO2. The story is so deep (imo) that you may have to play over and over again to truly understand the true story behind the scenes. And there is a secret mode (the secret almost everyone knew lol) called "Nightmare" after you beat the Campaign mode. Basically the Nightmare mode is not only the zombie version of the Campaign, but also re-tell the story form a different aspect. You should also try it if you want to understand the true story!\n\n+Very nice and deep story\n+Support COOP in all stages in Campaign up to 4 players\n+Multiple routes on the map. You may choose which route (i.g. up from roof or side flank, etc) you are going to assault\n+4 diffculties provide different challenge for both newbie and skilled players\n+Lots of checkpoints. No need to restart from the beginning when you die\n+The cutscenes are nice and immersive. Playing campaign just like watching a movie\n+Awesome and beautiful scenes. Not only the sci-fi stuffs, you may also see some fantastic imaginary scenes in Campaign\n+Secret mode: Nightmare. Totally different feelings and different order to tell the story from different aspect with different challenge\n\n*Story is so deep. Maybe not easy for everyone to see the true story in first run. So many people think the story sucks :P\n\n\n\nMultiplayer\nMany decent features success from the predecessor, and add more new stuffs in BO3. The Class, Weapon Attachement, Perks, Wildcards and Scorestreaks system are quite similar with BO2. The Specialists and the new movement are the new stuffs in BO3. The Specialists are all have their own special weapons and abilities which makes the battle more interesting. And the jetpack allow you to double jump, wallrun and slide on the battlefield. Moreover, you can swim underwater in BO3. These new movements are very nice, extending the battle into three-dimensional. Several new perks were added to match the new movement system. Such as silence jet-pack, fast thruster recharge and digital footsteps.\n\n+New jet-pack movement. Fast pace 3D battle is very cool\n+Sci-fi scenes and sci-fi stuffs. The future battlefields and equipments looks awesome\n+Highly customizable weapon. You may show off your favorite gun with tons of camo, self-created paint job and attachemnets\n+Specialists are very interesting. 9 unique specialists, each of them have 1 special weapon and 1 special ability for player to choose\n+And specialists all have lots of outfits and taunts to unlock. Further showing off yourself!\n+Tons of challenges, achievements, specialists, weapons, attachements, perks, camo, calling cards for you to unlock!\n+Statistics are informative\n+Lobby Leaderboard is nice if you want to see how's the players in your lobby\n+And yes, you can chat in lobby right now (can't chat in lobby in BO2)\n+Nuketown is back!\n+Better connection in my opinion. I've played over hundred hours, never get "Disconnected from server (BO2)" in BO3.\n\n-You can only see other player's Level and shared Showcase (Paint Jobs, Variants and Emblems), no statistics, even no history match replay\n-Friend list are still bugged in BO3 (just like BO2). If you have over 100 Steam friends, it will only display random 100 friends in BO3's friend list\n\nZombies\n\n+The map is quite big. Many place to explore\n+Very challenging, it's not really easy to beat the game\n+Transform into the Beast. Get special abilities and access certain places.\n+New stuff: Gobblegum. You can get these gum for different boosts\n\nI can't tell much since I didn't play much of the Zombies mode. But it's really fun to play Zombies mode with friends!\n\nIn conclusion, Black Ops 3 is quite a masterpiece in my opinion. Although there's some performance issue at launch, Treyarch quickly patch it in several hours. The performance is quite nice and smooth now. If you like COD series, if you like sci-fi, and if you like fast-pace FPS, you should try Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. It's AWESOME!","December 20, 2015","true","65.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"
