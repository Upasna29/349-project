However you can download Freespace 2 and install Freespace Open from the Hard-Light Forums. The game now features hundreds of mods, campaigns, and user made ships as well as two separate takes on how the Freespace universe could have progressed after Freespace 2. It is also possible to play with upgraded graphics and at higher resolutions. All that for the amazing price of nothing. It is worth noting that Freespace Open is supported on OS X and Linux Operating Systems as well.\n\nHappy fragging!","May 7, 2014","true","0.6"," 169 of 185 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","169","185","2","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/recommended/273600/","IidoTheFox","Light","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/","232 products in account","When I saw this had become available on Steam, I was overjoyed. Freespace: The Great War was one of my absolute favorite games as a child, and I believe it still holds up strongly to this day.\n\nThe game begins 14 years into the war between the Terrans and Vasudans, and before long, an even greater threat shows its face, an ancient and destructive alien race known only as the Shivans...enemy to Terran and Vasudan alike.\n\nFreespace: The Great War is a space flight sim. While most missions involve you either protecting an important target, or wiping out enemy forces, oftentimes both, they are all varied in their actual content and no two missions really feel the same. As the game progresses, you gain access to a good variety of different ships, each with varying strengths and weaknesses, as well as an assortment of different weapons.\n\nAnother of Freespace's strong points is its atmosphere, formed mostly from the music and dialogue. It will make you feel like you ARE the pilot, and a part of the game itself. This is definitely one of the things that helps to set Freespace apart from other space sims. I have never played another space sim that gave quite the same feeling Freespace does.\n\nThis release includes the expansion, Silent Threat, which continues the story after the main campaign's ending with several additional missions.\n\nI really can't recommend this game enough. If you're a fan space flight sims or flight sims in general, and have not played this game, now's your chance to experience a masterpiece.","May 7, 2014","true","7.0"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

You are a recruit pilot who just joined the Galactic Terran Alliance in its age-long war against the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire, but the war takes a different turn when an unknown threat makes its appearance with the sole purpose of exterminating both races.\n\nPros: You get to live the war and the events through the eyes of a pilot, and the whole story is detailed through mission briefings and in-game events. Different levels of success in a mission may affect the following mission, even open entire branching side-missions. The voice acting does a good job a delivering the humane yet rigid tone of a military situation, something you'll rely on for immersion as there is little to no cut scenes. Action is great, and often allows creative thinking to resolve an issue, succeed in a mission and achieve bonus goals. The missions themselves are very varied, rivaling and often surpassing classics of the genre like the Wing Commander series. Control is spot-on, although optimized for mouse-less keyboard. As you progress, you get more and more flexibility in how you want to set and arm your squads.\n\nCons: The game isn't opened world, but mission-based, so forget any concept of exploring or visiting space stations and planets: you jump in, do the mission, and jump out. The graphics have aged a lot: it isn't retro-style, it's actual pixelated low-resolution interface and texture.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThe game's graphic aged horribly, but the rest hasn't: sound, music, control, action, everything remained as excellent today as it was back then. I'll recommend this game only to people who enjoys playing classics, and Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War is one of the good ones!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","May 28, 2015","true","27.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","3"

As a 12-year-old I was in awe and completely immersed in the experience fighting the unknown, mysterious and deadly Shivans. When it released on Steam a while ago, I instantly bought it and relived that same feeling - albeit with an xbox 360 controller rather than my old joystick - I recommend using a joystick if you have one, the 360 controller lacks precision for this type of game (though not enough to be disruptive).\n\nIf FreeSpace 2 is the better game, this one opened up the world of space combat sims for me.

The gameplay is tight and complex, missions are varied and progress in difficulty smoothly, graphics were amazing in the day (and still are with the Freespace Opensource project and FSPort), and the campaign is well-written and paced, albeit the "lore" is sparsely explained without the manual.\n\nThe release on Steam does not let you control your resolution and personally I get a terrible flicker in menus and briefings, so I would actually recommend Freespace 2 and the Open Source engine, which enables you to play the FS1 campaign as a port/mod, plus a plethora of user-created content like enhanced models with normal and specular mapping, total conversation campaigns etc. Plus, the new engine squashes some old bugs and has built-in post-processing effects.

The best in the "dogfighting" genre)\nStory: 4.75/5 (This entire series has a great story.

That's right the Reaper race is a copy of the Shivans)\nPresentation (Visuals/Soundtrack): 4.75/5 (Not as glamorous as the graphical update in FS2 but still has a better Soundtrack)\nReplay Value: 4.75/5 (Silent Threat is a fantastic add-on for the Multiplayer and the Singleplayer. Have fun spending countless hours enveloped in the massive array of missions)\nMultiplayer/Co-op: 5/5 (So many missions to overrtake with friends either as allies or enemies!)\nDifficulty/Progression: 4.5/5 (The statistical records this game stores for you is detailed, not to mention the medal case you have to put your prized accolades in)\nLevel Design: 4.75/5\nFun Factor: 5/5 (It is extraordinarily challenging to break from this game.

Finding this on Steam brought me way back and I finally got to finish The Great War! Sadly, the excitement sort of ended at the demo and the rest of the game is a bit lack luster. I was a big Rouge Squadron fan around the same time so I loved the customization of the ships and weapons as well as directing your wingmen that Rouge Squadron didn't have. The missions lack variety in scope and scenery. You are always in space shooting the same enemies and it get kinda dull. Plus, you can finish missions without even having to touch your ships and weapon layouts and they end too quickly. Some of the missions are a little buggy and the expansion is awful with no clear direction and terrible AI. Needless to say, it hasn't aged well. Haven't played the sequel yet which I hear really good. It's worth a play if you want a good sci-fi story, late 90s nostalgia, or a game to complete over the weekend. Other than that, may want to look at something else.","August 9, 2015","false","14.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

My solution:\n\nWhen the FreeSpace Launcher starts, click 'setup' then 'Detect Available Cards' and ensure the 'Primary Display Driver' is selected. Try clicking 'Play FreeSpace' and see if it works. If this doesnt work you will probably have to restart.\n\nIf it didnt work repeat what you did then bring up 'Task Manager' (control,alt & delete) find 'FreeSpace Launcher' under name.  Right click on it and bring up 'Properties' then click on 'Compatibility' Tab at the top. Tick the box that says 'Run this program in compatibility Mode For:' and select Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Apply the settings and then click 'Play FreeSpace' on the Launcher.\n\nFor me this worked. If this didnt work then try running the Compatibility Troublshooter.\n\nMy System:\nWindows 8.1\ni5 4430\n8 GB RAM\nGTX 570\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Basics:\n\nThis game is a space sim - this means you pilot fighters or bombers in the theatre of space.\nYou CAN play this game with a mouse and keyboard, it will be improved with a joystick or gamepad but its more than playable without.\nThe game purchased on Steam includes the Expansion Pack 'Silent Threat'\nI believe the game was released in 1998 although the graphics were amazing then they are obviously dated now. However not to the point of hampering my enjoyment.\n\nA Classic. The game tells a truly gripping story of a desperate fight for survival. Every story needs a good antagonist and this is no exeption, a mysterious and ruthless enemy await you. What this game really shines at is it makes you feel super involved with intense against the odds battles.\n\nNew technologies arent just thrown at you theyre introduced intwined with the story and discussed in briefings everything feels like it had reason behind it.\n\nThe ship designs are nice, if not a little limited by the technology of the time.\n\nThe Controls are simple and easy to grasp however as i pointed out before will be improved if you have a joystick or gamepad.\n\nThe mission briefings are great and sound Authentic and the missions themselves offer enough variety and unpredictability to keep your attention. The whole game makes you feel involved & has a great storyline, a definate for the oldies that prefere a riveting story and great gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n","January 7, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can fly a lot of ships, shoot a lot of guns and missiles, destroy whole fleets of enemies by yourself (well... if you are good enough). Can be pretty relaxing.\nBut, of course, there is some nuances. You have to plan what to take on missions, because a lot will depend on this.

Was the first game i ever really played through as a kid and replaying through it was just as fun. About a 12 hour game on your first play through. Controls are pretty simple and work well.
