"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/384680/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","“The world is an awful, uncool place; it should be burned to the ground, and anybody not cool enough destroyed.” This is the somewhat extreme premise of Mango Protocol’s MechaNika. With a basis such as that, one might expect a dark and haunting descent-into-madness story full of Lovecraftian insanity and visuals. In reality, MechaNika stars adorable 7-year-old Nika Allen, a misunderstood child prodigy with plenty of sass who’s tired of living in a world filled with condescending adults. Her solution to this problem is to build a robot of destruction using parts she finds, trades for, and creates herself at home and around town, in a short point-and-click adventure that seems to suffer from a mild case of identity crisis.\n\nIf not for its dark theme, it’d be easy to dismiss MechaNika as a kids’ game due to its simple art style resembling a Saturday morning cartoon and its nursery-style soundtrack. But while it features a young anti-hero, the actual subject matter is directed quite purposely toward an adult audience. Nika must deal with her ostracism from society: her parents downright ignore her, her teachers are wrapped up in themselves, and most of her peers don’t relate to her. There are deeper issues at play here, like a reference to her parents having had a failed pregnancy some time ago, possibly causing them to retreat into themselves, and Nika’s grandparents becoming recently estranged from each other.\n\nBut these things are really just window-dressing – MechaNika doesn’t attempt to delve into Nika’s mind to analyze her. Instead, the game passes itself off as a whimsical dark comedy. It maintains a silly tone throughout, even though Nika herself treats her dilemma seriously. The local school, where the game begins, is surrounded by an electrified fence to contain the students, Nika encounters an aging cosplayer on the street who flexes his glutes for the public’s pleasure, and at one point Nika dresses up as her grandmother, then walks around and interacts with others as she imagines a senior citizen would.\n\nBut there are other times when MechaNika tries too hard to be edgy, like when Nika has to supply a homeless man who lives in a cave outside of town with pornography to get an item. But the moment that really drove the point home was when her grandmother (out of the blue) makes some very graphic references concerning her grandfather engaging in bestiality. Injecting moments of South Park into an otherwise playful game just didn’t quite jibe for me, though tastes may of course differ.\n\nThe game’s visuals, while also a little off-putting at first, grew on me after a short while, especially the way Nika narrows her eyes and makes faces when people annoy her – it’s just cute coming from a child her age. MechaNika has a hand-drawn look, with thick outlines, caricatured cartoon townspeople, and basic environments. Animation is just as simple – again, think budget cartoons – with most characters simply going through a few choppy frames over and over again. Nika herself, however, is fully animated. Pre- and post-game cinematics are simply still frames with text boxes, all very rudimentary but sufficient.\n\nThere are no voice-overs. All dialog is presented via comic book-style speech bubbles and text boxes, for which the developers have included a more basic font if the preset cursive doesn’t appeal to you. Music is hit-and-miss. For the most part, the childish nature of the graphics is present in the music as well. The couple of tunes you’ll hear run the gamut from pleasant to dull, and there’s only a handful of different tracks – around a half dozen or so – to hear. Ultimately, neither the graphics nor the music do much to make the game stand out in the end.\n\nThough I felt a little iffy about MechaNika’s comedic bent, its actual gameplay works flawlessly and left me satisfied, despite its short duration. Early on, you are presented with a blueprint of items that Nika requires to build her robot, and it’s up to you to scour the town to get what’s needed. The blueprints don’t always spell out what items you need to look for, however. About half the items only provide descriptions such as “something that can be launched” or “something that can propel big objects”. It’s up to you to figure out what item matches best, then assign that item from the inventory to the blueprint, a formula that offers quick fixes of success as the blueprint rapidly fills up.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to find an appliance in your house that will supply you with a microwave transmitter, but having the right tools for the job and then getting Nika’s mom out of the room to let her work in peace are a different matter. Traditional lateral thinking and correct inventory item use are required, though most puzzles are self-evident and the level of challenge fairly low. Once all pieces are acquired, you’ll gain access to Nika’s secret lab for the final steps of building her death machine.\n\nThe inventory is accessed by clicking on Nika, bringing up a display of her backpack on-screen. All inventory items, the blueprints and a save feature are incorporated as elements of the backpack. Nika even carries around a little metal flask, filled with a concoction of cognac and cocoa. Imbibing a swig of this mixture causes her to become a little tipsy, freeing her “thought processes”. Interacting with the rest of the world is done by simply clicking on items or people; if Nika can interact in any way, icons appear on-screen, like “talk” or “pick up”, etc. When Nika is in conversation with somebody, the speech bubble will display only one dialog option at a time, even though multiple topics are usually available.\n\nAs satisfying as the shopping list-style point-and-click gameplay is, I never found myself truly immersed in Mango Protocol’s “Psychotic” universe, as it’s called, which seems to be a meta world in which various stories are meant to take place. MechaNika itself ends on a cliffhanger, hinting at possible plans for future installments. However, the world is a bit too limited, with only a handful of places to go and too few characters to interact with, and then only on a superficial level. Players will find lots of references to other games, movies, and general pop culture in MechaNika, like Ninja Turtles, Halo, and Alien, but while the the world is certainly quirky, it is far removed from being truly “psychotic”.\n\nHumor is a subjective thing, and others may like MechaNika’s dark comedy where it fell flat for me, so I’m willing to look past that for the most part. I did like the gameplay itself, as straightforward as it is. But the music could certainly do with more variety, and most players will have seen and done everything there is in less than two hours. The reason it’s so short is that the big payoff promised from the beginning is pushed to a sequel, as the game ends abruptly just as Nika completes her robot. Really MechaNika seems more like an introduction to the world, a first act rather than a standalone game that ends up leaving a more tepid impression than by rights it should have if allowed to develop fully.","November 26, 2015","true","10.8"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","53","55","4","0"

Being a genius she has the capability to do what we can't do when we are disillusioned about the way we live: Destroy it if course! I thought children were supposed to be untouched by the cynicism and bitterness we feel about the world today from our teenage years...\n\nThis is a point and click game where you will help sweet little Nika gather the items she needs. In case you miss this if you double click on Nika she will run like her life depended on it. The art is not anything to write home about. Despite the simple, drawn childlike style this is a game designed with adults in mind. In fact the choice of art style is good choice for MechaNika because it lightens the dark undertones and humour in the game. Give this plot to another developer and we would be reviewing a horror game not a short point and click.\n\nThe strength of this game is its dark humour dialogue. The references to subjects such as gaming and anime will give the player a chuckle. I would like to think there is some deeper meaning to this game as it touches lightly on the themes such as addiction. Maybe it's a commentary on the perception that the developer sees the world he lives in.\nThis game is the first by Mango Protocol and was voted through Greenlight. I missed this one but based on this game I will put my vote in for the next one they produce. This game is worth your time and money, especially if you like point and click games.\n","December 19, 2015","true","11.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

The trailer showed a teacher ignoring her young students - who drink booze out of hip flasks - as she played games on her cellphone. I was optimistic.\n\nSadly, all of this over-the-top excess is for nought. Extreme vulgarity for its own sake doesn't ring out as anything but cheap shock, and I'm afraid this is all MechaNika has to offer.\n\nIf all it takes to entertain you is that somebody '♥♥♥♥s goats' devoid of any context or connection to anything within the game, then by all means: Have a great time. The art, music and production elements are all perfectly fine. The puzzles are very easy, and guidance is always available in-game.\n\nJust don't go into it expecting something that uses its own crassness in any kind of interesting way.","July 17, 2015","false","1.8"," 65 of 102 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","65","102","3","3"

It looks like a game made for children, with its simple yet charming visuals, but is definitely aimed at adults, with some quite twisted and dark humour in it.\n\nNika is a young, intelligent girl, frustrated by the world around her. So she plans the invention of MechaNika, a giant robot with which she wants to take revenge on the whole world and destroy everything that is not awesome. Help her assemble all necessary parts and get to see yourself all of those hilarious things not awesome. Meet hobos with cats in their beards, male pro*stitutes and Martyr Pig, who sacrificed itself to show us how good sausages are, amongst other unusual characters.\n\nControls are simple, as you would expect from a point & click adventure game, puzzles are logical and not too easy at times. The humour is often quite black and great. Graphics sometimes look a bit amateurish, but have a distinct and likeable style. The music is not outstanding, but still quite good.\n\nThe only downsides, if you want to call them downsides, are that the game is very short indeed and options are more or less non-existent. It's a mobile port with low resolution, but with the choice of style for the graphics, it doesn't matter much.\n\nConsidering its length, pick it up in a decent sale for a price tag that reflects the mobile price. Having said that, it is still worth the normal, already quite low price. If you are into point & click adventures, odds are you are going to enjoy it. Probably a lot.","December 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

It is a lighthearted point and click adventure of her actions to create a device to reshape the world.\n\nFirst off, this is definitely NOT a kid’s game. Although the game looks very child friendly and downright cartoonish, there are many situations, characters, and dialogs that are way out there. As mentioned, the graphics are nothing spectacular and can be considered a little lazy at times. Still I think the design fits the story better than high resolution graphics would.\n\nThe music in this game is good. There are a couple of really good scores in some of the locations. However, they are all quite short and repeat quickly. Especially if you are going back and forth between different locations a lot.\nThe controls are pretty standard. You mouse over something and you have options based on the item. You click on Nika and you can access your inventory, setting, or help.\n\nThe game is quite short. The first time through it will take a few hours just to figure out how some of the puzzles work and the order of running around. After that, you will be able to complete the game in under an hour. Considering the price of this game and the extra elements, it is definitely worth the price.\n\nThe worst things I can really say about the game are. First the start of the game tutorial. Unless I missed something, it is completely un-skippable and is very slow. Once you get out of the classroom, the game speeds up. The second is the main menu and settings.\n\nThere are no advanced settings for this game. There are a couple of simple items like changing the resolution, sound, and type of mouse pointer. For me resolution was the hardest thing to work with. I have my PC connected to a 4K TV and it did not want to work with any resolution I clicked through. In the end, I had to manually set my resolution via editing the preferences file. Once I did that, I had no more issues with video.\n\nUltimately this is a great demented point and click adventure. Hopefully there will be a sequel!\n","April 30","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are several dark and/or mature subjects that are dealt with in the game. Also, graphic images (yes, even cartoon nudity can be 'raunchy'). I understood the creator's intention of being hilarious and shocking in a game that looks like you'd least suspect it, but playing this when there are people are not around is generally not a good idea. Unless of course you don't mind explaining yourself and the filfth that is on your screen all the time.\n\nThe game objective is fairly simple: find items to make the ultimate killing machine! The how is simple as well: get them by talking to people and/or doing this for them. It gets a bit repetative, to be honest. As long as you keep this in mind: your objective is never to open up locked area! You could finish this game very fast. There is ONE place however where all gamers appear to get stuck. Everyone knows what I'm talking about - when you've acquired a certain outfit. Gentle hint: find places to hide in WITHOUT entering a house or building. Good luck with that.\n\nAnother major disappointment is the climax that the game reaches. Nika's tension is building when you receive more items over time. You actually find yourself getting excited with her. So what is to expect when she finally manages her objective? Well, nothing much... Whether that is nothing much because Nika's plan is grander in her own mind than put to practise or because the game is just a short little indie plot, I'll leave you to discover that for yourself.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the game. Its settings are a bit too much over-the-topness mixed together. There are so many places that are locked, that you imagine there is a lot (more) to discover, but no...closed is closed (off). Nika is much too gifted to be 6/7 or whatever, but whatever. It is the bratty and ultimate entitlement that I really dislike! There are too many ways to shock people incorporated into the game. Instead of laughing, you will just start raising your eyebrows instead. It is TOO much in very little time, so it just ends up falling flat instead. What a waste...\n\nBut, mothers, do not buy this game for your kiddies.

Your quest is to find parts to destroy everything she hates, basically. If you get stuck, you can get wasted and she'll give you a hint. There's a lot of fun little quirks in the game that you can interact with, that may or may not actually impact the story. You can complete most of it in any order you please.\n\nI got it for $2.99 and I feel it was worth my money.

Players will quickly find, however, the very blatant adult elements that make this game inadvisable for exposure to its seemingly intended market audience.\n\nThe protagonist is a 7-year old girl fed up with her environment, and determined to make use of her extensive knowledge of engineering to put an end to everything not awesome. Since this is essentially any introverted child's fantasy when things aren't going their way, the game is worth a playthrough by any who've experienced similar feels as a kid.","January 3","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is first and foremost a point-and-click game for adults.\n\n7-year-old Nika Allen is a child prodigy of sorts, being quite the tinkerer with electronics and mechanical devices. She is also more mature than her age, knowing a lot more about the world than the usual 7-year-old girl. She drinks a concoction of cognac and cocoa (underage drinking, ahoy!) to inspire herself and help her 'see things clearer'. Her goal? To create a giant mech to destroy all the things 'that aren't awesome' and to eventually 'take over the world'. Hoo boy, don't get on this little girl's bad side, let me tell you.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is how short it is. It took me two hours to beat, and I normally hope to get twice that at the very least from a point-and-click adventure. Still, those two hours were very enjoyable, filled with solid PnC puzzle solving and plenty of dark, wacky shenanigans.\n\nAt full price, yeah, this game is certainly worth it.
