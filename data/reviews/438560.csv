I have played the other Mystery Case Files games and enjoyed them.  This one I played for about an hour and could not take any more because the game play changed.  Up to the point I quit playing, instead of finding hidden objects you now find objects which change appearance or morph.  There was a previous game which had these morphing objects but they were specials.  Puzzles where you must use inventory items found in one location to open other locations is still present.  If the game play gets better or has brain teasers as the previous games did I cannot say because that first hour bored me sooooo much.","February 6","false","0.8"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","0"

Every single find object puzzle was a morphing one, which were super easy.  Hardly any objects to click on in most of them, so you could breeze through in 20-30 seconds just by clicking on everything.  Your journal doesn't write down the clues you see anymore, so make sure you have some paper handy.  If you're a completionist like I am, I'd say buy for the story, but if the hidden object was the funnest part for you, pass.  You're not looking, you're just staring at the screen waiting for something to move.","May 13","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
