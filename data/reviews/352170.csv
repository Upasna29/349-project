There's no objectives, tracks are extremely linear and bland, the cars handle like shopping carts and the weapons don't really do anything at all.\n\nAll the advertized visual settings don't do anything for the game because even maxed out it's painful to look at. Mind you most of the sceenshots and even the trailer video are heavily post processed, for a good reason.\n\nMadOut needs a complete rework in order to justify any kind of pricetag.\nDo not buy this; it's ♥♥♥♥.","June 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","53","64","7","1"

There are translation errors and text overlapping in the menus. It feels like mobile game more. if it was 3x cheaper it would be acceptable i guess.","June 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","32","42","3","0"

This game has nice graphics, a good  soundtrack, nice cars and nice speed effects, but suffers with boring racing tracks and has some erros that you just don't believe how the developers do not correct before release it on Steam (like the position counter, which is wrong for most of the time).  It is like 70/100.","December 6, 2015","true","6.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","2"

Being 1st means you were lucky btw.\n\nOnly 1 mode.\nAll maps feel same.\nGame of luck.\nBoring menus.\nSome things aren't really translated.\nPretty bad handling, making driving boring.\nNo punishment on dying or on others being killed by you.\nUnfair combat system (impossible to dodge and almost impossible to miss anything. Only shield will protect you, but with it you can't win. Then again not having it means losing. Try to quickly get to 1st then take shields and a little ammo in case someone gets past you)\n\nI won once, check my screenshot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/recommended/352170/","PyroUltimate","--","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroUltimate/","550 products in account","I was looking for a good racing game with combat elements and again I got disappointed.\n\n\nNegative points\nGraphics\n- Pretty bad. Maybe due the fact that this game is just a cheap mobile game port.\n\nLevel/Track Design\n- Very, very bad. It seems that they just generated a few track section elements and after that they put this few elements together – over and over again. Sometimes they call it a new track when they changed the daytime (no weather effects – only the switch between day and night), sometimes it is the same track just reversed and sometimes it looks like they just change the amount of enemies or laps. 50 tracks they said? More like 5 settings which got combined over and over again until they got their 50 boring tracks.\n\nSound\n- Also very bad. The sound mix from this game sounds horrible on my 5.1 system. Nearly every sound effect comes from the rear left/right speakers. Also some effects are so damn loud while other sound effect, like the enemy car engine from beside you, are as quiet as a graveyard.\n\nGameplay/Game design\n- Again just ridiculous. Well what else could I expect from a russian game? I mean the position notice is still in russian language and was not even translate..\n- You only got only 3 weapons. 1 rocket launcher, 1 minigun and 1 mine thrower. The minigun and the rocket launcher are hitscanning weapons so you just have to get in range and pulling the trigger – Aiming works automatically (you always aim perfectly on the next enemy in front of you as long as you are in range).\n- You got only 3 powerups – Turbo, Shield, Health. Boring and often very bad placed.\n- General gameplay decisions like:\nIf a car got destroyed it will fly around for a few meters and while it does this, the wrack can pickup powerups/ammunition. Also the destroyed car can fly into the finish which count as successfully ended a race..\nWhen you got destroyed you lost all your ammo. The ammo boxes will lay on the ground as ammo packages. Normally you will just spawn into the packages and pick it up again so this is pretty useless.\nNo stats for the cars. The cars which I got just feel the same in handling, acceleration\nand top speed.\nYou only spawn with half of your life after you died (maybe a bug?)\nAI\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is just a matter of luck if you win or lose. The enemies are always faster than you. You have no chance to get them when they are out of sight for one moment.\n- Also it seems that the cars stop fighting when I was too far in front of them. Unfair, pure luck, zero fun.\n- The AI dont lose control and their cars are always stronger. If the AI wants to go right than it goes right no matter if you are in the way. And if you are in the way than they will push you away without any problems – dont even try to push back even if you would have a tank! The AI would still kick you out of the track without giving a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nPricing\n- You can clearly see that this game was a rip-off mobile game before it was added to steam. The prices (especially for new cars) are way too high, after I played some maps I got less money for kills and the money penalty for dying is as much as 2 kills now. At least they deleted the ingame store from the original mobile game. (on the mobile game you could buy ingame money for real money)\n\nBugs\n- The game is full of bugs. Examples:\nThe race ends on many tracks far before you reach the finish line (like 100 meters before)\nThe game doesnt update your position correctly sometimes so you can lose a race even when you finished first\nAmmo packages slide out of the map very often and the colliding boxes for these packages ares bad so you can get trouble with picking them up\nI didnt receive my money after some races.\nI couldnt purchase the nitro update for any of my cars\nIf you bought an update for your car it wont save the old part so you have to pay for every change again.\nAfter you respawned your car it still looks broken. Even when you got fully recovered via powerups your car will still looks like scrappedMultiplayer\nDoes not exist. No one would play it anyway.\n\nStory\nDoes not exist. Finish all maps – the end (without intro/outro of course).\n\n\n\nNeutral points\nMenu and settings\n- Clearly a one to one mobile device port. Configuring the few options works ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nDestruction\n- Is buggy and doesnt look impressive but at least they did something like damage models for the cars and breakable environment (of course only some, small objects!).\n\n\n\nPositive points\nNone\n\n\n\nConclusionWasted potential so dont waste your money and time for this waste. This is just another crappy mobile game port from some random russians who want to steal your money. 10 euros for this is pure scam. You cant compare this games with games like Blur, Gas Guzzlers or Carmageddon - even Post Apocalyptic Mayhem and Fireburst are better. This game belongs to crap like Death Track Resurrection or Carnage Racing","October 14, 2015","false","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
