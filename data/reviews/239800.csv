Doesn't really make sense, but i'm not here to question. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nYou are Wyrn a girl who dreams to become the greatest hero of all time. To become the greatest hero of all time you must kill the current best heroes to claim your title. The controls were a bit odd and it took me a bit to get used to them.  The feature of being able to slow down time is amazingly fun and you have a decent arsenal to pick between. There are 13 bosses to fight through. The game plays fluently and the triple dash is really helpful when you are in a pinch (along with slowing down time). The game can be completed in a quick amount of time, however it's a very enjoyable and challenging experience. There are a total of 4 levels of difficulty to enjoy (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard) along with 2 other gamemodes to fight through.\n\nGraphics/sound\nThe Graphics are pixelated and really match with the charm of the game. The music is upbeat and allows you to immerse yourself into killing whatever you happen to be fighting at that moment. The whole game gave me a kinda old-school vibe; in a good way.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ 3 different ways to play and 4 levels of difficulty\n+ Multiple characters to choose from (unlocks characters if you beat story on higher difficulties)\n+ Interesting combat mechanic\n+ Slowing down time\n+ Boss fights are different in nature and strategy\n+ Good ending\n+ Fast-Paced and Challenging\n\nCons\n\n- Short game overall\n- Controls are a bit odd and take getting used to\n- Local Co-op only (It would be amazing with online co-op but still amazing to play alone!)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI have thoroughly enjoyed playing through bleed. I honestly felt like a badass when I would slow down time dodge multiple bullets, reflect the rest with my katana, then shoot the hell out of the boss ending him. I might have gotten a bit addicted; only a bit! I enjoyed this game and while it was short, it was sweet. I once tried challenge mode only to realize I'm getting butt kicked by 3 bosses at once. Overall a very fun game which I can recommend to almost anyone who likes platformers or becoming Neo from The Matrix.\n\nTL;DR\nBleed is a highly enjoyable fast-paced, pixeled, challenging platformer where you fight your way though all the old heroes to become the greatest hero of all time. You have 4 difficulties to choose from and 13 bosses to defeat. The combat is fun because of the ability to slow down time and the ability to triple dash. The arsenal has an decent amount of weapons to choose from and the increase in challenge when you go on higher difficulties is noticeable. The controls take a bit to get used to and overall the game is short, but highly enjoyable to play through.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 27, 2015","true","2.9"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","58","66","2","0"

Yes, every bit of it, BUT it's one of the shortest games I have ever played. To me, it is satisfying enough to maintain a decent replay value. On normal difficulty I would say that you might need an hour to finish the game from the beginning to the end. This game has rather poor animations and colour depth, but a nice retro soundtrack and excellent gameplay. If you need a challenge willing to revisit the game on it's hardest difficulty, then the sweet gameplay is all you need. If you're not the kind of person who enjoys playing the same levels multiple times, then you probably should stay away from it.\n\nThis sidescrolling action platformer contains only seven short levels with a lot of mini bosses and of course an end boss in each level. The bosses are this game's highlights. In fact, you will spend more time fighting them than fighting through the levels. None of the difficulty settings are really hard and you probably will not be frustrated at all when playing the story mode, because of its MANY check/spawn points. On the other hand you will unlock the challenging arcade mode after you completed the game once.\nIn order to achieve 100% completion you have to beat the arcade mode on the hardest difficulty level, which is one of the most difficult tasks I have ever encountered. The game itself has an extremely stylish gameplay. There are no excuses to hide behind. Just you, the game and a 100% skill. I played it using a gamepad and have to say that there's nothing to complain about the controls. It is responsive, fast and it makes you feel like a blockbuster hero.","June 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","51","57","0","0"

In this game there no time to slow down and no time to reload as your placed in a various fast paced levels with a large arsenal of weapons to your disposal. You play as young girl name Wyrn, a  person with high ambitions, mass array of weapons, and a great personality to top it all off. And her goal is to become the greatest hero of all time! And be placed in the hall of heroes.\n\nEach level is different than the last from the middle of earth’s crust to the circulatory system of a dragon you’ll be there to show how much of a badass you are. With different unique but yet challenging bosses and minibosses you come across each level really makes the game charming. This game reminds me a lot of the old Megaman games and I wouldn't be surprised that’s where they got their idea of the menu screen from.\n\nThe story of the game got me hooked in an instant as it felt that I could relate from her ambition of becoming a superhero... really who never wanted to become a superhero before. However storyline flew right past me when it came to how short it took from the first mission to the last.\n\nBleed is a really fun while it lasted, but it still is a great game with its great design, several of stages and bosses, and incredibly fun storyline.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxLIlo5ICyI","November 29, 2013","true","5.2"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","0"

You play as Wryn, who can jump wryth the left thumb stick, shoot in any direction with the wryght thumbstick, change between two wrypeans, slow time with the left rigger and jump with the wryght trigger. When she jumps, she can aim jump two or three more times in mid air. So you can jump to the left, then aim her to launch herself right, while shooting left, then air jump up all without hitting the ground. She can even jump off walls, but it seems more like a visual aide than a mechanic. The game has a fast pace. There are speedy bullets, bosses and hazards raining down, the slow time mechanic becomes an easy way to deal with it all.\n\nWryn is out to become the #1 hero! So she's got a hit list to kill all the other heroes and work her way to the top of the list! By top I mean bottom! The #1 hero gets revealed at the bottom of the list. These heroes are all bosses. After each death she'll comment things like, "Don't worry its just a game, I'll be back in a sec," "Do you have an older brother that can play this part, maybe?" Bleed hits you over the head that its a game, such as hoping you can achieve your dreams for helping her achieve hers.\n\nYou go through the game unlocking all seven levels to play. Each level has a completely different theme. A dark mansion, an underground cavern, inside of a dragon and so on. Different levels have different elements, such as getting trapped in a giant apple and forced to get through the top to the bottom of the screen before the apple drops to the next screen. Others like having to evade sensors or time jumps to avoid lasers that warm up and fire.  The bosses are giant and diverse. Everything from bosses that split when shot, to a girl with a giant pink kitten car to mechanical orbs that shield themselves. The bosses are where most of the lives get lost. You need to make use of the slow time to survive and drain their health meters. Every boss has a wide array of attacks. The patterns seem random, which is great. Every level has more than one boss and I can tell a lot of work went into them.\n\nThere is a good variety of enemies. They change from level to level and fit the theme of each level without being reskins. Cats hopping around, soldiers that ride trains and get hit by tunnels, worms that burro then leap to shoot at you. The levels are fun and there are frequent checkpoints each time you leave an area. Its a nice quick game without much challenge. Its the dual stick, and dual triggers that make it tough at first. It gets a lot easier.\n\nWhen you select a level, you chose one of four difficulties, so you can always go back and play harder difficulties. Between the levels, you can visit the store to buy extra weapons. The default dual pistols are good enough and killing everything with a quick stream of bullets. The default rocket launcher does more damage, but has a slower shooting speed. There is also a revolver, homing missiles, a flame thrower and a short range shotgun to buy. While you only need two weapons if not just one, you can pause the game to equip 2 others. Why equip them when the two bumpers work well enough?\n\nBleed isn't a one hit death game. You have plenty of energy, but there is no way to get more energy. Your slow time bar will regenerate over time depending on the character. Both can even get upgraded in the store, as well as the regeneration speed.\n\nWith all that said, the game is an hour long at least on normal (medium) difficulty. There are extras like arcade mode, that is more like a YOLO where you only get once life and need to complete the game from start to finish. I always thought an arcade would give you three lives. You can unlock different characters to play as. Finally there's a boss attack challenge mode that can put three bosses on your screen at once. Its all just extra fluff. $5 is the right price for it.\n\nJudging from the fan art, there are people that love this game or its protagonist. Looking at the lack of accomplished achievements, means there are a lot of others that don't.","December 21, 2014","true","1.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","32","41","6","0"

The game is worth every penny and more, the only possible reasoning I can see to the game being 5$ is that there is not a *ton* of content, but, it still has a full game feel to it via stages, story / introductions to stages, and an ending that can move some people to tears, in a good way. <3\n\nNot only that, but it has a difficulty setting for any level of player, from the more casual player, all the way down to hardcore players who enjoy the stress of an Arcade mode playthrough set on V.Hard that could make them rage and *still* have a good time.\n\nNo matter the difficulty setting, you aren't robbed of the game's wonderful ending and beautiful message it has, so I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers as this title has a refreshing twist on bullet time and mobility.  This game truly feels unique and has the kind of game play I've not found anywhere else.\n\nAnd with a second coming of the soon-to-be Bleed series in the works ... I would recommend this game to get hyped for it!!!  Also, did I mention that the game's creator, Ian Campbell, single handedly made this piece of art?\n\nThat guy is a total baws!

Game is polished, the mechanics are tight, the bosses are fantastic, and some of them get extra attacks on harder difficulties. The movement is SO good, you always feel like you're in control (except for the occassional "walljump when I wanted to airdash", but you can disable walljumping (dunno why you'd want to, it has its uses)) and every single attack is decently telegraphed, and even when you're caught by surprise you can slow time and dash away and make it look like you meant to do that.\nIf you like skillful play like contorting an air dash to weave through bullets in slow motion while destroying the homing rockets coming your way, I don't think you can go wrong with this game.\nIt is REALLY short but for 5 bucks you're getting possibly the most concentrated, no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, action run n gun with slow motion.

The controls feel very intuitive, and the learning curve is pretty simple, despite the length of the game. Which bring me to another point:\n\nThis is a short game. All of the chapters can be beaten in a bit over an hour on a first run. However, it does include a couple modes of gameplay, one of which required you to beat the entire game in one run, on one life. I have yet to accomplish this.\n\nThere is also a co-op mode, which simply puts two characters through the same levels together. While this definitely feels neat, the screen panning could've been handled better, but it is pretty cool to see what new strategies emerge simply with the addition of another player.\n\nAll in all, this was an enjoyable experience, albeit short. if you have the couple bucks to drop, I'd consider giving it a play.","December 27, 2013","true","5.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

The slow-motion and dash effects are very nice, and executing an efficient speed run can look quite pleasing. The music and sounds are appropriate for the theme, but I personally found the bit-style music annoying after a time, and resorted to using my own music.\n\nThe controls are fairly easy to learn, however, you will have to take a look at the control scheme to figure out the key bindings. I strongly suggest using a controller if possible, as the feedback will feel much smoother and more responsive; however, a keyboard + mouse combo is still viable. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, however, experience with bullet dodging will benefit you greatly.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun - your typical side-scrolling progress until you reach the boss. You are rewarded with money after each completed level and can use this to purchase new weapons and upgrades for your health and slow-motion bars. There is an arcade mode that ramps up the difficulty, and the game supports 2-player coop. An arena (challenge) mode allows you to test your skills against up to 3 bosses, and you can select which ones you'd like to fight (after beating them in the story first).\n\nThe boss fights are good - each boss comes with a unique attack pattern that mixes things up enough to keep things challenging. Each level is not too long, however, achieving a perfect (S-rank) score requires speed, timing, and precision. For achievement junkies, you will spend a few hours on this game if you wish to get 100% completion.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun, and any platforming lovers should definitely give this a try.\n\nRecommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

This could be fixed by a laser pointer (do it plz)\n- It is short, but considering that this is a one man dev team game for 5 bucks it is still awesome.\n\nIf you like the above mentioned games, then you can be sure that bleed will give you a nice gameplay experience.","July 4, 2013","true","10.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Although the game centers around Wryn, and her quest to become the #1 best hero in the world, the controls are the star of the show here, with your character's movement being separate from aiming. This allows for the pacing to be pretty intense, and you'll want to just keep running and shooting down enemies without stopping. Keyboard and mouse controls take some time to get used to, but plug in a gamepad and something magical happens. Running, double-jumping, slowing down time, and dodging bullets left and right all become as easy as pie.\n\nThe game itself is hard as HELL, but the act of making it through mobs of enemies without a scratch is incredibly rewarding. At about 2 hours (and 6 levels), the game is short, but it doesn't overstay its welcome. There are also a bunch of unlockable weapons, characters, and challenge modes, so the game welcomes you to replay it in order to hone your skills.\n\nAnd there IS local co-op as well, which is a very nice addition. The second player controls a red-headed Wryn, and can drop-in/out at any time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/239800/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Bleed is another one of these modern-day hard-core 2D action-platformers that seem to be all the rage lately. But don't take that as a knock on it. It's actually a really well-made game with some unique elements to it. The primary story mode is comprised of 7 levels, each of which feature a sub-boss, a final boss, and some steep challenges in between. The gameplay is typical fare (jump and shoot), but with some interesting twists. The most notable thing is the shooting mechanic, which is done is the style of twin-stick shooters (shoot in 360 degrees via the mouse or right-thumbstick). Jumping is another key mechanic with a twist - you can jump up to three times, but the jumps are more like dashes in specific directions. So you have to perform the moves with precision and forethought. The final game mechanic is "bullet time", in which the action slows down to a crawl, allowing you to perform crazy dodges, super-precise maneuvers, or get more shots in on bosses. In between levels, you can also buy various upgrades (new weapons, more health, etc) using points you earn by clearing levels (performing well earns more points). The controls are spot-on and the game is very forgiving, having no major penalty for death (at least in the story mode). This allows anyone to eventually be able to beat it if they are persistent enough. Bleed can be completed in around an hour or two at most on normal difficulty (and probably much less if you are really good), so it's not very long, no matter how you slice it. Replay value and longevity comes in the form of higher difficulty levels and an "arcade mode", which tasks you to beat the game with just 1 life (good luck with that!). For those who are into brutal challenges and high scores, there's probably enough here to justify a purchase. But if you're like me, and are now "way too old for that ♥♥♥♥", it's maybe less so of a no-brainer (though I felt it was worth it, regardless). So I would say base your decision on that... If you are into tough platformers and welcome a challenge, this is well worth the money. But if you're more of a casual fan of the genre, take into account the short length for basic completion and decide whether 5 bucks is worth a couple of hours of fun. Overall, the game is solid and has some pretty cool things going for it, so I say it's worth it, but YMMV... I give it a solid B.\n\nTechnical notes: I played the game with a gamepad and it worked fine, though it did take me quite a while to wrap my head around the control scheme, which is quite unusual for games like this (left and right sticks for movement and shooting, left and right triggers for bullet-time and jumping). In retrospect, I realize it probably would have been easier to control via mouse and keyboard, due to the precision aiming a mouse provides. I just went with gamepad out of habit for this type of game, without thinking. Both methods definitely work, but this is one of those rare cases where I don't necessarily recommend having a gamepad in order to buy the game. I think it should probably be just fine, if not better, with keyboard and mouse controls only, if that's all you have.","July 27, 2013","true","1.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It has a great and very distinct art style, very catchy and upbeat music, a funny twist on the standard plot, great control, and a unique and memorable main character. The overall tone is somewhat cutesy, but rather than hindering the game, it gives Bleed a funny and uplifting tone that is oddly in contrast to all the shooting you're doing. I beat the normal game in about an hour and a half on normal difficulty, but there are also options for coop mode (as yet untried), hard mode, and very hard mode. The controls are extremely good, it has customizable options, and it runs very smoothly. It has some interesting weapons that you can unlock by purchasing with points at the in-game store, as well as extra health and time-slowdown energy.\n\nSome people will say the normal mode is extremely hard; don't be fooled, I think people are making it out to be worse than it really is. What kept me playing was the good level design, unique enemies, brevity of the levels, interesting boss battles, and the infinite continues. The game may be difficult (there are some incredibly tough sections, most notably in level 6) but it is incredibly forgiving and very fair. You just have to push yourself through to the next screen and you'll start from there if you die.\n\nI only have two minor gripes with the game. The first is that level 6 begins with an auto-scrolling section with some difficult platforming that the game had never introduced before; I would've preferred a section that introduced the difficult terrain management before the auto-scrolling screen kills you. The other gripe is that level 6 also has a section where you have to try and dodge seemingly infinite bubbles that are constantly in your way; it's a bit like jumping into the ocean and trying to not get wet.\n\nOther than these two sticking points, my only other suggestion for improvement is MORE CUTSCENES! The characters and plot were great, and the main character Wryn's dialogue was very funny and full of personality! She really had spunk, although it was definitely not overdone, and I loved to see that because she felt like a real person. It really felt like the developer made this character effortlessly, so mad props to the dev for a character more memorable than any I've played in a long time, even in big budget games. I wanted to see and hear more of her between each stage, or at least every other stage. The plot is quite funny and the ending was comedically unexpected but satisfying. I only wish it had lasted longer; the main game is unfortunately short. But I hope to see more from this developer, especially a Bleed 2. :)\n\nBleed is kid-friendly but the level of difficulty may be a bit high. Replay value is somewhat "eh" but I'm sure kids could get a more than a few hours of enjoyment out of it.","July 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I quite liked the concept of a thruster pack, and the manoverabillity and controlls were great. As far as the level design goes, I was impressed by what they had, but I also wanted more. If I had to state one flaw with this game it would be that it is too short. Fun, but short. It doesn't have too many levels. This being said, if you are the type of person who finds replay value in increasing the difficulty of a given level-- you may absolutly love this game. Personally, I was impressed with this game and its mechanics, but I also felt like it needed more content. As a game, I would recomend it to you if you have excess money to spend.\n\nHere's just one more thing to think about with this game: it is well-designed. I am a part of a game-creation/game-theory club at my school, and I have tasked myself to find well-designed games like ShovelKnight. This game, while it may be lacking in content, provides a good refference to game design in that the levels and mechanics are well-developed. The ideas in this game are great, even if it is short.\n\nOn the whole, I would give this 7/10 for gameplay and enjoyment, and a possible 8.5/10 if you're looking for good ideas and design in a game.","February 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

Check the developer's page for details!\n\nTo be quite honest, the last side-scrolling platformer I ever played was when I last broke out Megaman X3.  I've had Bleed for a couple months now, and to be very honest, it has that same particular flavor and fun.\n\nThe backstory is very simple- our heroine, Wryn, wants to be the best Hero ever, so she decides the best way to show that she's better than the heroes currently enshrined in the Hall of Heroes is to hunt them all down and destroy them, wearing a cute smile upon her face.  To be honest, Wryn is a refreshing change from all the big, overly-muscled guys who usually catch this role- not to mention the story that she's just doing this because she wants to prove that she can be a better hero  than all those who came before her.  That's all- just to prove that she's better then they are.\n\nThe heroes you go after are a mix of different patterns, and each boss battle is a different experience.  What worked on th first boss won't work on the next one.  You'll be jumping and learning patterns and generally having a great time.\n\nThe weapons are a lot of fun, as well, but I managed to make it through just by using the starting pistols and the rocket launcher.   To be honest, though, everyone has their own playstyles, and it might be that they suited my play-styles.  You'll find your own style of play, so buy and upgrade them all and see what suits you!\n\nThe graphics are actually well-done for what they are- you don't need supremely-sharp graphics to make a fun game- the cartoon-like graphics actually enhance the game, and even if you and Wryn can't make it through the level, she'll always be there with words of encouragement to get you to keep on trying.\n\nIn short- buy this game!","October 24, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play as Wryn, a pink haired videogame heroine wannabe on a quest to dodge, dash, jump, and shoot herself towards the title of Gretest Hero of All Time. At her disposal she has an arsenal of weapons, a triple jump, and the ability to slow down time. You think you've seen bullet-time done right? You've seen nothing until you've tried this game! I cannot describe with words how incredibly satisfying it feels to air-dash your way, in slow motion, through the one small gap in a wall of bullets (very hard-mode) while maintaining your combo-meter for maximum damage.\n\nBut let's not be completely biased here. Many players will probably be upset by the fact that this is a really short game. Like a really short game. To make your way through the seven levels on normal will take you about an hour. To get through hard might be another hour or so and after that the same goes for very hard. There are ofcourse some extras like arcade and challenge mode but the main bulk of the game is easily beaten in an evening.\n\nThe weapon unlocks also seem pretty useless, I stuck with the starting weapons through most of my playthrough on both normal and hard as I saw almost no reason to switch weapons during any stage or boss fight.\n\nThat said tho, this is a really, really fun game and I will probably end up spending more hours just replaying this than in most $20+ games I've bought.\n\nPick this up if you're:\nA fan of fast-paced, skill based combat.\nAn old-school gamer with too little time for those 40+ hour AAA titles\nA speedrunner.

The multiple difficulties let you get your feet wet, but Ultra Hard story more and Arcade Mode are where it really shines as you'll feel a real sense of accomplishment as you pull off the platforming and boss fights.\n\nThe biggest downside in the game is that while there's lots of unlockable weapons and even characters, the stock dual pistols are all you need for 95% of situations. A few times the Laser or Rocket Launcher are very useful, but the main event here is triple jumping, dual pistol time slowing action.","July 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PoniOfTheStars/recommended/239800/","PoniOfTheStars","Barnaby the Screwloose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PoniOfTheStars/","108 products in account","(Written after beating Hard. Have yet to try V. Hard, alternate Characters, Challenge Modes, etc. at time of writing)\n\nIf you want a direct quote to put on a trailer or something:\nOriginally posted by TigerKirby215:It's the classic game-play with modern quality, complete with all the quirks that come with each side.Oh me oh my...\nYou can beat each difficulty in about hour, but I'd be dammed if you get through it without dying. (Even on easy)\n\n\nSo BleedMy first heard about this game through YouTube. The Let's Player bumbled through the game, complementing it overall, and I thought "Hey, this is a pretty cool looking game! I'll put it in my wish list and maybe pick it up later."\n\nSo it sat in my wish list for awhile, and then I got a coupon something like 75% for it and bought it, to which it sat around in my library for awhile.\n\nAnd then it happened:\n"You know, I'm really bored with all the games I've currently been playing. There must be some random thing I have installed that I could fool with."\n"Oh hey Bleed! I remember seeing a video on that back in, what? 1987? Let's try it out!"\n\n\nSo my first real experience with the game was with the options menu. I always go into the options menu when I first play a game, not to go optimize the settings for ideal play or anything crazy like that, this is an 8-bit game, doubt I could really do any optimization but to turn the game onto Windowed mode, because I bleedy eyyyy despise Full Screen.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when I saw not only no Full Screen, and a fairly lack-luster settings menu to boot. Heck, the cursor color option was a slider! A slider!\n"Ohhhhhh noooohhhh... This is going to be one of those 'Looked cool and had to be instantly returned' games."\n\n\nSo I play the first level and get presented with a red-headed more like Pink-headed but heck lass toting two Pistols in hand. Game tells me to WASD, so I WASD.\nPush W, don't jump. "Oh good. It's one of those games."\n\nSo yep. W movement key, but it don't do jack. Gotta push Space to jump.\nAlright cool. First thing I do, being a gamer, I start mashing the hell out of Space to see if I can double-jump.\n"Alright so when you're in the air you can burst forward. That's kinda cool, I guess."\nAnd then the games tells me to Double Jump.\nAnd here's where Bleed starts to get interesting:\n\n\nThe main character Wryn has Multiple Jumps. About 4, one regular jump and three "Double Jumps".\nBut not just any "Mash Space to continue Air Time" jump. She has a dash jump.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, remember when I thought she could move forward super quick by mashing Space?\nWell, she can dash in any direction. Up, down, left, right, diagonal, you name it. This turns what would've just been another run-and-gun platformer into a very engaging fast-paced game.\n\n\nThis was then accented by the introduction of her "Energy" bar. What does it do? Slow down time.\n\nYep. Bullet Time.\nNow you have pin-precise movement options and time slow.\n\n"Oh. It's going to be one of those games."\nYep. Bullet Hells. Meh at least it aint Japanese Bullet Hell.\n\n\nPlaying on easy, the first mission was a breeze. I died once trying to figure out the double jump mechanics to be met with Wryn's cutsie "Hey no fair! This is the first level, it's supposed to be easy!" death message, reminiscent of the likes of AVGN Adventures but went through most of the game with my M1 button taped down as Wryn literally ran-and-ganned that sounded a lot better in my head through "Guppy", "The 6th best hero of all time". That guy's the 6th best hero? Christ I'd hate to see the 7th... or is that me?\n\nI popped into the shop and saw a huge variety of weapons. "Shotgun", "Flame Thrower", "Beam Rifle", "Katana"...\n\nbut my eyes were on one single name.\n"OH MY GOD THERE'S A REVOLVER IN THIS GAME."\n\nBlasted through the second level, experiencing a decent number of deaths and coming to appreciate the time slow mechanic by dodging bullets fired by the Worm Boss(es).\n\nBish bash bosh: Revolver!\nAnd it was crap. At least for a noob like me (at time of playing)\n\n\nThe third level was where the game hit me in the face. I ran through kissing my new Six-Barrel Shooter not that it matters with infinite ammo as it shot out nice big bullets at my opponents. Felt about the same as the Pistols, but the ricochet effect was nice.\n\nAnd then we got platforming around Lasers. Alright.\nAnd then we got tiny robots that spawn if you hit a Laser. Okay.\nAnd then we got the fact that the Revolver has ♥♥♥♥ poor damage (before ricochet) and lower attack speed than the pistol.\n\nDie, die, die again. Always because one of the "50+" bots snuck up on me to get that last hit off.\nBut I never felt cheated. Every time I died, there was a voice in the back of my head saying "You can do it! Just try a little harder and you're sure to make it!" That voice may have been Wyrn, who was saying around the same thing, as well as asking if I could get my Big Brother to help with the level. (Thanks love)\n\nAnd that's when it hit me.\n\n\nThis is not the kind of game where you can you whatever weapon to like.\nThis is not the kind of game which you can blaze through in an afternoon.\nThis is not the kind of game which treats you like your dumb.\n\n\nThis game is hard.\nIt'll bite you if you pet it the wrong way.\nIt's not like Super Meat Boy, which holds onto your hand with its jaws until you shake it off and get good. It's absolutely no Dark Souls, ripping you to shreads in the span of seconds and demanding you treat it like your king.\nBut it's no Kirby or Mario. You can and will die. A lot.\n\n\nBut even with that in mind, it was never unfair.\nTo keep going with the analogy, it isn't AVGN Adventures, which attacks you even if you treat it like royalty.\n\nEven hit you take is fair, and purely caused by your own inability to play games good. Every hazard thrown your way can be avoided, if hard to do. It was designed that way.\n\nIt wasn't designed like AVGN Adventures and the games of old that it mimicks. (Just harping on AVGN Adventures since it was designed as "How to make a Platformer that pisses you off") The hazards weren't designed to hit you. They were designed to be avoided by you. (Huge difference)\n\n\nNothing feels cheap. Every task set in-front of you, no matter how hard, can be conquered.\nAnd that's the beauty of Bleed.\n\nYou know that you can beat what it puts in front of you, and that's why it's so hard to put down. Every level is another challenge that awaits you. Not mocking you, since it knows you can beat it, but just waiting, like the Boss Hero waiting atop his Tower.\n\n\nAnd that's really it!\nThe TL;DR of it isthat Bleed is a very well designed platformer. While somewhat hard to get used to, and an absolute kick in the teeth most of the time, everything that happens in the game feels like a fair challenge you can overcome.\nYou want to get through each level. You know you can.\n\nAnd the game knows it too.\n\nIt knows it and it won't go easy on you.\n\nYou gotta work hard to become the best Video Game hero of all time.","October 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Initially, I didn't really like the game, mainly because of the difficulty, but as soon as I got used to the groove of the levels, I found myself extremely enticed with the game.\n\nSeriously, if you like Mega-Man, with the insanely difficult levels and tons of replayability, this is definitely your type of game. This game has a short story, but it doesn't hinder this extremely great game, especially with the arcade mode, which allows you to play until you die, and it uploads your score.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. Everything is colorful and vibrant. The performance is glorious. No matter how much was going on, at no point whatsoever did my frame rate drop down severely to a point where it hindered my gameplay even slightly, both on a strong pc and a measly laptop. The levels are difficult and require many runs through them in order to get the layout down in your mind, and the sheer amount of stuff happening is sure to keep you on edge at all times. The control scheme is absolutely comfortable and fits this game perfectly. Only problem I have is that switching items via scroll, which is my preference, needs a sensitivity adjuster, for uber-sensitive scrollers.\n\nThere are some problems with the game, which sometimes hinder the gameplay. Sometimes, I lose exactly where the mouse is, due to it no having a border or just blending in with the background, which happens a lot, causing me to die a ton. Also, the game is a bit too short for my liking, so I think the developers should make a few new levels for the game. However, the replayability of this should occupy you for a long while, especially with the different difficulties. Completing all 7 levels of this game on normal took me about 2 hours, which felt much longer.\n\nAlso...\n\n\nTHIS GAME NEEDS MULTIPLAYER! Although slow motion wouldn't be able to be done, open levels with free for all or killing bosses would be phenomenal. If you are one of the developers, PLEASE make multiplayer levels like this. It would add so much more depth to the game, and add many, many hours of gameplay to it.\n\nAnyways, BUY THIS! It is definitely worth your time and money, and it was a fun time for me. Definitely immersive, colorful, beautiful, performs like a beast, and has tons of replayability, however can get ever-so-slightly better with multiplayer and a few tweaks. 9.8/10","December 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best examples of bullet time in video games is when it is core part of the the game's elements. In this sense Bleed really uses the bullet time well with it being a bullet hell shoot and having a triple dash ability making the tiniest gap in the projectiles an escape route. The levels a really well designed making a good difficulty curve, this however brings me the flaw of the game which is the length. I kid you not when I say there are seven levels in total and each one is quite short (6-10 mins), there is increased difficulty, arcade mode and alternate character that try to extend the length but the game remains short. There are a few other problems with the game like the fact that the upgrade systems is largely useless the soundtrack while nice is really short and repeats a lot.

Initially, I didn't really like the game, mainly because of the difficulty, but as soon as I got used to the groove of the levels, I found myself extremely enticed with the game.\n\nSeriously, if you like Mega-Man, with the insanely difficult levels and tons of replayability, this is definitely your type of game. This game has a short story, but it doesn't hinder this extremely great game, especially with the arcade mode, which allows you to play until you die, and it uploads your score.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. Everything is colorful and vibrant. The performance is glorious. No matter how much was going on, at no point whatsoever did my frame rate drop down severely to a point where it hindered my gameplay even slightly, both on a strong pc and a measly laptop. The levels are difficult and require many runs through them in order to get the layout down in your mind, and the sheer amount of stuff happening is sure to keep you on edge at all times. The control scheme is absolutely comfortable and fits this game perfectly. Only problem I have is that switching items via scroll, which is my preference, needs a sensitivity adjuster, for uber-sensitive scrollers.\n\nThere are some problems with the game, which sometimes hinder the gameplay. Sometimes, I lose exactly where the mouse is, due to it no having a border or just blending in with the background, which happens a lot, causing me to die a ton. Also, the game is a bit too short for my liking, so I think the developers should make a few new levels for the game. However, the replayability of this should occupy you for a long while, especially with the different difficulties. Completing all 7 levels of this game on normal took me about 2 hours, which felt much longer.\n\nAlso...\n\n\nTHIS GAME NEEDS MULTIPLAYER! Although slow motion wouldn't be able to be done, open levels with free for all or killing bosses would be phenomenal. If you are one of the developers, PLEASE make multiplayer levels like this. It would add so much more depth to the game, and add many, many hours of gameplay to it.\n\nAnyways, BUY THIS! It is definitely worth your time and money, and it was a fun time for me. Definitely immersive, colorful, beautiful, performs like a beast, and has tons of replayability, however can get ever-so-slightly better with multiplayer and a few tweaks. 9.8/10","December 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really liked the bosses and the enemies but the thing that let them down is the combat. I didn't feel like it was necessary to change weapons and to be honest I just used the Dual Pistols because everything else that I could afford (which wasn't very much, by the way, you get upgrades and more but in one playthrough you won't be able to afford very much - at least that was my personal experience) felt kind of out of place here and they were generally slow and therefore didn't really match up with the gameplay in Bleed, which is mostly fast paced gunplay, which is controlled by aiming with the mouse. Controller support however is available and works quite well, which was quite surprising. As for the slow-motion, I mostly forgot about it but it is somewhat necessary to defeat some bosses (especially the last boss) and is quite generous as it regenerates while you are in combat.\n\nThe health was another issue as it doesn't regernate in any way during gameplay and there is no way other than death to gain back health (not that I could see). With that said the checkpoints are very good and let you carry on from each different screen in the levels. Although this is good, when you close the game the checkpoints are not saved overall and you will have to start the level again from scratch - this isn't too much of a problem though because the game is quite short and shouldn't take you too long to get back to where you were previously\n\nThe music of Bleed is okay - I didn't think very much of it but it did serve its purpose well. Art is decent and in some points looks weird such as the animation on the main character (look at the legs!) but overall is well done and definitely isn't lazily done - which is great.\n\nThis game is very short and sweet, although the game does offer a lot of replay value after you beat the main game, such as unlocking new modes, weapons, characters as well as the many achievements and difficulty levels. This is great as it extends gameplay for a short game and will entertain you if you like replaying games. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced platformers and especially so if you like gunplay in them.","June 25, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Recently I've come to ponder why. Is it the fun? The challenge? The satisfaction?  Yes. Satisfaction. In my recent gaming history I can only recall the satisfaction from beating a tough level on a game playing Super Meat Boy, back in 2010.\n\nBleed made me feel that again. And it is awesome. I knew it was going to be difficult but I thought to myself why not play it in Hard Mode? Boy, was I in for a surprise: Great controls, fast paced ction, amazing sound track, beautiful retro pixelated design and of course Hardore gaming at its bet. The one hour it took me to complete the first level made me want to write this.\n\nIn my humble opinion, videogames are the ultimate media. One can find different art forms in them combined to make a unique interactive experience.\n\nSure you can play a AAA game for dozens of hours and enjoy all it has to offer. However, sometimes you just want to have your daily adrenaline fix and the enjoyment of pushing it to the limit to prove you can do better than yourself. Bleed will give you that.\n\nThank you Ian Campbell.","January 8, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lets start with the fact that you don't have to buy any weapons to beat the game half of the bosses are easier to beat if you use the default dual pistols. You can get stuck in certain situations and end up dying, example would be a constantly spawning enemies that aren't really enemies but can hit you into spikes and keep you there until you die. Then the boss battles are poorly made, I can say half of the battles could be done if I sat in a corner and shot at the boss and then went to the opposite corner and did the same thing. There are plenty more reasons I have but those were the main ones in short don't buy this game it isn't worth the 5 dollars if you consider buying it wait and see if it goes on sale.

It's a difficult shooter, especially at the harder levels, but never unfairly so; there's frequent checkpoints, no "gotcha" death traps, and the bullet-time and multi-jump mechanics make for some really elegant dodging once you get the hang of them. Even the death screens are friendly and encouraging (not to mention varied enough so you won't get sick of the same Game Over screen too much).\n\nA lot of folks have commented on how short the game is; I'd personally use the word "concise". It gets done what it's after in a timely manner, and adding too much more would just feel like padding. Same goes for story: the game gives you just enough so that you know what your character is up to, then takes a step back and lets the gameplay take center stage until the final act.\n\nAll in all, this is a really awesome game, with a nice balance of challenge, fairness, and character.

It's definitely a memorize-the-boss-pattern style of game, which isn't bad or good, just something to be aware of.  I like the style and the pacing, but the controls kinda suck.  Forget about using a controlpad, as it just becomes 100% impossible to aim worth a ♥♥♥♥.  Wryn's multi-jumping mechanic is too easy to screw up and send yourself careening off into an enemy during fast paced fight.\n\nThe thing that's probably going to kill it for me and what shifts my review to negative isn't even gameplay related; it's that the game interacts really poorly with the desktop when it's in windowed mode.  And you can only get it into windowed mode at all via steam launch options.  How is it that it's 2015 and we still get a bunch of developers who refuse to have a native windowed mode? It's especially bad for this game, as the graphics look absolutely atrocious in fullscreen, which ruins what are otherwise really nicely done sprites.  Now that I think of it, when I tried to alt-tab out of it while it was in fullscreen, it crashed, so as far as I can tell, windowed or not, your desktop is more or less unusable while you're playing.\n\nAnyway, cool game, but the crashing and poor interaction with the desktop make it too much of a hassle to bother learning to deal with the control issues.","February 1, 2015","false","7.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It's a pretty fast paced, side-scrolling, shooter with a time slowing function and no matter what you do, you can always upgrade enough to make anything in this game easy. Even S ranking all the bosses is a matter of time, and learning boss patterns is how you have to beat the bosses so you reach a point where you can speed run them over and over, even the levels. Regardless, it's actually fun, got it in a bundle but I wanted it before that, I just didn't want to pay full price for it. I think it has online multi but I never thought about co-op, besides it offers local co-op and I thought that was cool. Good game that may be surpasable with grinding, but I didn't play it on hard till I got used to its difficulty. It's harder before you unlock extra health and slowmo, so it has plenty of difficulty if you need it and easy modes if you dont.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/239800/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: A fast-paced action platformer of 16-bit retro looks, Bleed is one of those games that anyone who likes platformers should play.\n\nIn Bleed, a girl named Wryn wants to become the ultimate videogame hero. She sets out to beat all the previous heroes of the old times. Her super powers? Bullet time and excessive amounts of fire power.\n\nRetro in looks, the game is set in the vague year 21XX and the graphics are reminiscent of 16-bit era. It works in Bleed's favour as the silly and colourful enemies and bosses have a refreshingly distinctive look to them. The soundtrack is plainly awesome. I love how the tracks have been carefully chosen to fit all scenarios; especially the last level's soundtrack was simply intense.\n\nWith colourful artwork come the silly looking enemies. Cats and flying ooze blops litter the levels. The bosses include worms, a slug and a dragon among other silly things. While the common enemies are simple and predictable, all bosses have at least three special attack patterns that get faster and more intensive the higher the difficulty setting becomes.\n\nLegacy of Max Payne and Matrix\nThe fast-paced gameplay of gunslinging and attacks coming from all directions at once is alleviated by Wryn's super power: she can slow down time at will (or at the click of a button). Bullet time renders many impossible looking situations manageable, even easy, but the twist is that the bullet time energy is limited and replenishes only when not used. Wryn can do three consequential dives in the air (like double jumps but better), a feat that becomes really useful when dodging attacks while using bullet time.\n\nThere are nine different weapons to try, two to start with and the rest to unlock through experience (gained by winning levels or challenges) and beating levels. You start with dual pistols and rocket launcher, and since there are no reloads it's rather common to just run through a level with the fire button down all the way.\n\nOne can buy e.g. a flamethrower, a sniper laser rifle and a sword that can be used to ricochet bullets back at enemies. All weapons are unique and useful in their own way but some require more practice than others. You can only equip two weapons at a time, which is a bummer since often you'd like to use 3 different ones in a given boss fight. Though weapons can be changed by going to escape menu, it's still a break in the flow that is bad in a fast-paced game like this.\n\nI played Bleed without problems using keyboard and mouse but controller is recommended (I have one but I still preferred K+M). Controller enables more accurate dodges and movement while mouse allows more accurate targeting so both are totally viable settings. At least one controller is required to play local co-op, which I sadly didn't get to try out.\n\nChallenging but not Nintendo-hard\nMastering bullet time, dodging and useful weapon combinations are the key to winning the boss battles and especially when playing through the Arcade Mode where you also have to manage the combometer (for highscores and for certain weapons), done by hitting enemies and not getting hit yourself.\n\nBleed has seven levels that can in principle be beaten in an hour or so but the four difficulty levels add a lot to replayability unless you just started out to torture yourself through it with the Very Hard mode.\n\nWhile in Story Mode there are check points and you can play any section as often as you wish, the Arcade Mode makes you play through the game without a single death. As your health bar does not get replenished between levels this puts Bleed into the category for extremely difficult games to complete 100%. Nevertheless it is almost completely fair, so you know every mistake is your own.\n\nI needed tens of tries to survive through Hard and Very Hard difficulties in Arcade Mode but it felt very satisfactory once I did it. As such take my 21 hours to 100% completion with a grain of salt - it could take you a bit less time if you were good or very much more to 100% Bleed depending on your skills. You might even find it to be nearly impossible. That said, Bleed is a very good action platformer, and if you like the genre it's one of those must-buy games.","December 15, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game pays homage to a number of legendary games such as max payne, megaman, devil may cry, bayonetta, etc. Literally the only negative I have to say about this game is its length, but dont let that stop you from enjoying this gem.","July 10, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Thank goodness for the smart control scheme on your 360 gamepad!  When it's all over, you can look forward to more well-written humor as you continue your quest to take down the world's greatest heroes, who are described as if they each starred in their own classic games but have now grown into monsters.

The game pays homage to a number of legendary games such as max payne, megaman, devil may cry, bayonetta, etc. Literally the only negative I have to say about this game is its length, but dont let that stop you from enjoying this gem.","July 10, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally put in more than 25 hours into it. But it's not for a single playthrough. I have to mention though that there are only 7 levels broken up into smaller sections. I played some levels many times. But more on that later. Let's start with what this game is about.\n\nThis is a fast-paced 2D side scroller with a lot of weapons, awesome game mechanics, variety of enemies and it requires some skill to complete it. There are numerous achievements to unlock some of which require hard training. Others are surprisingly simple but require you to read the description of the achievement to get the idea of how to unlock it. As for the graphics there's not much to say but it's nice and pretty in its own way and the art style is consistent and corresponds to game's theme.\n\nThis game is about a girl which I appreciate because I like games with female protagonist. So this girl wants to be a hero but there are some heroes already and her task is to defeat them and become the best hero of all times. She got herself a list of those heroes and set to work. And to 'work' your way through you'll need weapons a lot of weapons. And you'll be able to unlock more of those as you progress. I personally was able to find something to match my playstyle and you can switch between weapons which is very handy when it turns out that in order to beat a boss you need a different gun. But that is not to say that you can beat the boss only with a certain gun. It's just that for some players in some cases one is better than the other. But I found the double pistols more than enough in most cases.\n\nBut this game in not just about the guns it's also about stylish and acrobatic combat. And that is probably what won me over right away. Once I got into first level I tried it and I was amazed and felt very cool. And being stylish also allows you to increase the rank up to an S-Rank. And that's what made this game even more entertaining. To keep your rank at high level you need to keep shooting and being stylish. Not to mention that having that rank up during boss fights is what gets you majority of the achievements. So I haven' talked about how exactly you're getting stylish, have I? You can boost yourself and fly through the air for a short period of time and then do it again. So it's a bit of Matrix-style there. This gameplay mechanic is very important because it allows you to dodge projectiles, avoid being hit by enemies, escape certain death when you're about to fall into a pit after being hit and more.\n\nNow that we've talked about the variety of guns let's talk about variety of enemies. And there are many different ones and they don't feel repetitive. But you may find some of them being similar when they're trying to match or rather to give you a sense of what the boss is going to be like. There are mini bosses as well which I appreciate because they do a great job of preparing me for a boss battle. So when I meet the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my reflexes are ready and I already trained my projectile-avoiding skills. And speaking of bosses they're very fun to deal with and give you sense of achievement.\n\nSo what else did I do to keep myself entertained? I played it 3 more times so I beat it on every difficulty level. Which didn't seem impossible in contrast with other games where  very hard means that you only do it if you spend entire year training. But maybe it just me when it comes to some games. But again, in this case it felt very hard but not harder. I haven't tried it in arcade mode even on easy and I don't really feel like I'm going to because I died to many times. However I may fancy that one day.\n\nAt this point you'd expect some sort of conclusion and there it is. I conclude that this game is awesome and bring joy to your everyday life by being crazy fast, fun and balanced. You can argue that it's too short and I may agree with you. But it's cheap too so no regrets on my side\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","September 26, 2013","true","27.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So that's it for the story, but you would only play it for the gameplay of course!\n\nAs a bulletstorm you'll need to move fast and hit things as fast as you can. The level design is very well built with so many traps, different situations and are well-paced. Enemies don't vary much but they do the job and the bosses smash you to pieces! You can only carry two weapons at a time but in-game you can switch to another set but it's annoying that I can't simply change weapons with the number buttons. This is a PC game, you shouldn't go through this trouble of the two-weapon system.  Many of the weapons are generic, however, they're fun to use nonetheless.\n\nOnce you finish this short game, you can replay the different locked characters and difficulty modes. The difficulty modes in this games don't just make the characters harder to kill, they change the spawning and the behaviour of the AI. This is how games should differ their difficulty modes, not just making the enemies bullet-spongy.\n\nThe score system is nothing new but it's good. The more you kill, the higher is the classification level. Try not to die so many times and also don't suck! When you finish a level, use the points you got to buy linear and uninteresting upgrades.\n\nBleed has a pixel cartoony artstyle which I  very much like. The colours are very livid and are enjoyable to see.\n\nIn conclusion, for a small duration and fun arcade game, Bleed does the job very well and I recommend it!","September 29, 2013","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nothing the game does is ever truly remarkable or original, but the near-flawless execution of fundamentals in enemy and level design definitely allow it to stand side by side with all those old-school games that it most admires.\n\nBleed adds its own little variations to the formula by allowing you to slow down time as well as a triple dash jump that can be continuously aimed. These mechanics, when used in conjunction with one another, feel satisfying and evoke the action-movie flair that the game wants to emulate so badly.\n\nThe game's only real barrier to entry may be the controls, which will take some getting used to. Trying to shoot enemies at precise angles while jumping around and slowing down time is quite the workout for your hands whether you're on a keyboard and mouse or just a gamepad. There's also some real balance issues when it comes to all the weapons you can unlock, as nothing ever feels quite as versatile as the twin pistols you start the game with, so upgrading doesn't feel quite as exciting as it should.\n\nThat said, Bleed does nearly everything right if you're on the market for a quick-fix action game. It's just the right length to feel arcadey, and you'll probably blast through it in an evening, but my time spent with it felt worth it.","July 4, 2013","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Controls are tight but it can take some time to get used to the button layout. Using RT on a 360 pad to jump feels very awkward at first, but after a few minutes it starts to become second nature. The "Slow time" mechanic is used to great effect, allowing you to perform triple jumps and weave through enemy attacks in a graceful, satisfying manner. Boss battles are very well done and easily the high point of the action. The game offers a respectable challenge at the higher difficulty settings but it never feels overwhelming at any point. The story-mode is quite short, clocking in at about 1 hour, but the budget price makes up for it (a couple extra levels would've been just perfect, though).\n\nOverall, Bleed is an enjoyable arcade-style twin-stick shooter with some neat mechanics and a low price tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/recommended/239800/","dtox508","d.Tox508","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/","217 products in account","Bleed is an action packed shoot em up indie platformer sacrificed in hell and resurrected in heaven by Jesus himself. This game by developer Ian Campbell brings incredible gameplay with illustrious graphics to another level where it kicks you off the edge whispering into your ear “don’t die.” With these words of wisdom ringing in your mind you pick up the controller and begin one of the toughest fights of your life.\n\nIts games like Bleed that from the moment you watch the trailer you know that it isn’t too far from your hard drive. Unlike many of those games on that hard drive, Bleed sets itself aside from others of its genre with several different elements such as the ability to slow time at the touch of a button. Bleed also leaves a lot of the main characters abilities and stats up to you, this is done through the shop that you are able to visit prior to each level. During each level, you are graded depending on how creative you are with your gameplay, and awarded coins conducive to the grade achieved at the end. These coins are what are used to purchase each upgrade and are vital to this game’s progression.\n\nThe heroine of this game is Wryn, a girl with a big dreams and an even bigger arsenal. Your goal as Wryn is to become the ultimate video game hero, and in an action packed bid to claim the title for herself, she must take down the greatest heroes of all time. Bleed is focused on stylish, acrobatic dodging and fluid, challenging gameplay, where Wryn will have to use those abilities to kill hordes of enemies, endure backbreaking obstacles and overpower inventive bosses. Her bitter sarcasm after every tragic death leaves you with a personal vendetta against each level, not to mention a bruised ego.\n\nI give this game 5 broken controllers, because even on the easiest difficulty setting Bleed is more challenging than prying the crack pipe out of Whitney Houstons cold dead lips. The weaponry in Bleed focuses around heavy artillery, starting you off with twin guns and a rocket launcher. By gaining coins throughout each level you can buy new weapons such as a flamethrower or even remote mines. No need to worry about bullets, Wryn seems to have an extended clip with more rounds than the hero of your favorite 80′s cop film. Bleed is fast paced, combined with an intuitive sense of time along with an attention to aiming making gameplay one of a kind.\n\nOffering an EXTRAS option in the main menu extends gameplay making Bleed’s replay value higher than most. With two different modes, Arcade & Challenge, Arcade Mode can be unlocked by beating the story mode, and Challenge Mode consists of fighting bosses complete with your choice of arena. Bleed has a multiplayer option that is available anytime during the Story Mode of the single player campaign as well. Two times the power can sometimes be a burden if you can’t keep up, but also provides the effectiveness needed to complete your objective. Also, each different level is replayable in whatever difficulty may suit you. This way you are able to purchase each of the upgrades and fully experience the game, taking down anything that may come in your path.\n\nAfter playing the demo and then buying the game during the Steam summer sale, in true Bleed fashion I give it a B+. Bleed catches the eye, paired with addictive gameplay and intuitive dynamics it is destined for success. Although a tough one, this game is a joy to play and even better with friends. Endless creativity at your thumbs, there isn’t a bad thing I can think of when it comes to Bleed. Needless to say, the game is beautifully designed and creativity “bleeds” out of every scene, making this game well worth the buy.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 5/10\nChallenge: 9/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","September 8, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The player can activate bullet time at will to slow down the entire game, making it much easier to dodge attacks and aim their own.  However, bullet time only lasts a few seconds before requiring a recharge, forcing the player to constantly choose where to use it and for how long.  Combined with a fully-controllable triple air dash and a range of very different weapons, Bleed offers the player a wide variety of options for plotting their own course through the game.\n\nAPPROXIMATE LENGTH\n1-2 hours, though replays will unlock more things\n\nPROS\n(+) Game speed is fast without being TOO fast\n(+) Sprites are dynamic and give a smooth feel to the game\n(+) Bullet time lets the player set their own pace through trouble sections\n(+) Pletny of unique bosses\n\nCONS\n(-) Levels are depressingly short and just a formality in between bosses\n(-) Bosses die too quickly\n(-) Bullet time isn't NEEDED for more of the game and can feel underwhelming to use\n\nYOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY\n(?) Unlockable characters are more of a "challenge mode" than a different playstyle\n\nOVERALL\nBleed's premise is a whole lot of fun and shows great promise, though it fumbles in execution by just not having enough substance, and by not making free-form bullet-time as cool as it sounds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but potential players should be wary about setting their expectations too high.","December 29, 2013","true","8.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then add slow motion and triple jumping. This is a very fun and challenging game, albeit a very short one. Luckily, there are some extra incentives to play it some more. My favorite thing about this game is how technique and skill-based it is. You really feel like you're in control and able to do anything. That makes the rage when you die that much worse, but this rage makes you get better at the game and have even more fun. My least favorite thing about the game is that, although you can unlock different weapons to use, the default dual pistols really seem to be your best bet in terms of reliable carnage and DPS. The game is just $5 (and also really fun), so that should make up for the shortness.","July 14, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It tests your patience and your skills. You need to be fast and you need to practice if you're used to slow paced games. Bleed can be described as a bullet hell platformer shoot 'em up, and it is a good one. It is definitely a game with charm specially with the amazing chiptune soundtrack and the pixelated graphicstyle. Overall the shooting is great but I did find the jumping to be abit janky most of the times. Despite the Bleed supporting a gamepad I did played with mouse and keyboard simply because when I tried the 360 controller I just died alot, that could be just me or me sucking horribly at it. I did beated the game on Normal and some levels on the hardest difficulty. Despite all that, the story isn't really that great, you're just trying to become the greatest hero of all time and the game is pretty short if you're good at it. Overall I'd say Bleed is a great game and even if some people don't really like it I think it got through Steam Greenlight for some reason, didn't it?","September 22, 2013","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The actual story is pretty short, but there is a bunch to do after you beat it, including going back and improving your score.\n\nMy only wish is that the other weapons were more useful. I ended up buying the shotgun and planned to use that most, but the dual pistols given to you at the start were clearly the best weapon available. But maybe that's just my playstyle.The story is also pretty limited, but that's not even an interest of mine when playing games like this.\n\nIncredibly fun and fast paced.

There is some blood here and there, but it's really not that prominent. A better name would be "Shoot" or "Dash". Personally, I feel that the best name for a game like this is "Brief Awesomeness" due to short length and enjoyable gameplay. "Bleed" is a really fun shoot-em-up with some pretty tight controls (Albeit an unusual control scheme from a gamepad perspective. Good luck with a keyboard.) and a good sense of humour. Unfortunately there are only seven levels so you can finish it in no time at all. The only way to make the experience last longer is to be a lousy player who keeps dying or trying to unlock all the achievements. Nevertheless, "Bleed" is enjoyable for the amount of time you spend with it and it has got some replay value. It's currently 10% off and I think it's worth the current price. As for full price... I'll let you decide.","July 11, 2013","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If that all makes it sound a little too intense for you, play on easy mode.  If that is just your niche, work your way up to very hard mode (which is very hard).  The main story is short, but the challenge mode allows you to create anywhere from easy to impossible combinations of enemies to allow you to practice and take your skill to higher and higher levels.  As a long standing fan of serious 2D action games, this is one of my tops.

The shooting is fun, the weapons allow for different play styles and approaches to problems. The bullet time mechanic adds quite a bit, and since you can use it so often, it can be really fun to abuse it and feel great for avoiding projectile spam while drilling a boss in the face with a lazor rifle. There is a lot of replayability, with a variety of difficulties, modes, and unlockables. Overall, its a fun little game that can entertain you for a few hours, or for several hundred hours if it's really your thing.\n\nThe bad? It has a terrible movement system that you will have to get use to. You may think using a Game pad would be better, but it's not because of how precise you need to be. If you don't play with a mouse and keyboard, there are several levels that you will not get pasted, as well as having several weapons that are useless. The controller gives you much better manuverability (which can be great for the last level), but takes away all accuracy. If you can get over the movement controls, there isn't much to complain about.\n\nIt's cheep, it's fun, it's indie, it's challanging, so might as well buy it if you are curious about the game.","May 15, 2014","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a retro shooter (as you can tell from the store page). The two standout features are a triple jump/dash and the ability to slow time. The combination of these features makes for some pretty fun and crazy times. Imagine a dozen or so bullets are flying your way, all from different angles, and you jump in the air, slow time, dash to the right and curve up, and then dash down and back to the left, all while dodging the bullets. Pretty intense.\n\nThere are four difficulty levels. Normal is pretty challenging, but it's the perfect way to get used to the game's mechanics. The real fun (and frustration) is at the hard and very hard difficulties. That said, it's short. Only 7 levels long. I think I've spent about 6 hours total on it, and I've done everything but clear arcade mode beyond easy. More levels would make the game even better.

It's a really good game from the Steam Greenlight. Bleed is a Action Packed Platformer filled with acrobatic dodging and fluid, challenging gameplay. It has 7 levels that are quite fun and challenging to play. The Goal of this game is the Main Character you play as 'Wryn' wants to become the greatest hero of all time and to do so she is elimating the other heroes so she can claim the title,but besides Wryn there is 3-other unlockable characters to play and a fun arcade mode (Complete game w/ 1 Life) and a fun Challenge Mode where you can fight up to 3 selected mini-bosses/bosses from the game. The game contains a : "Easy" "Normal" "Hard" & "V.Hard" Diffuculty,good luck to you if you go for Very Hard :P Really good game for a good price.","August 31, 2013","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think that infinitely spawning enemies/obstacles are bad game design, and this game uses this a lot (especially on very hard).  It requires practice and learning boss tells to finish.  I think that enemies could telegraph a little better.  There are also a few attacks that I still don't understand how to beat or evade, even though I managed to beat the boss.  That's not ideal.  Still, it's rewarding to win at this game because it's so difficult.  If you are seeking a challenging two-stick shooter, this is a good choice.\n\nAlso, use a controller.  I never use controllers, but I tried it on this game and it makes the double jump work so much better.  It's harder to aim, though, because instead of just putting your mouse near the thing you're shooting at, you need to manually correct for angles when you jump or move.  I still think the controller is better.","April 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I just wish the story mode wasn't so darn short; I finished the story on normal mode in a bit over an hour, and the very hard story mode in not a whole lot longer than that.  When I finished that, all I could think was, "Dang, that was so much fun!  I wish there was more!!"  Fortunately, there is Challenge Mode, where you can fight up to three bosses at once, and Arcade Mode, where you can try to complete Story Mode with only one life.  Achievement hunting can also add a good chunk of playtime to the game as well.  Another little tiny gripe (if you can call it that) is that it seems the weapon you start with is quite a lot better than all the weapons available at the store, but maybe that's just me.\n\nAnyways, at $5.00, I couldn't recommend Bleed more.  Great music and visuals, and outstanding level design, bosses, and controls.  I'm probably biased because I really like platformers in general, but Bleed will probably go down in my book as one of my favorite games of the year.  Well, I don't know.  I just really like it a lot, and if you like platformers, then I'm sure you'll love it too.","May 11, 2014","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said, I'm a person who appreciates challenge in a game. It's one of those games that every time you die, you felt like you could have done something better to prevent it. It's punishing, in that your score is reduced for a large number of deaths, but also forgiving, in that there are well-placed checkpoints, letting you jump right back into the action.\nOn top of that, the game is just all-out, balls-to-the-wall ridiculous, fast-paced action for which the only word to describe it is "fun." The shop system is great, providing a wide variety of weapons and upgrades for your character. It also has a fair amount of replayability with a few unlocks and higher difficulty settings, should you wish to make the game even more challenging.\nDefinitely recommend.","June 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bleed is a small 2d platformer where you control the character known as Wryn who wants to become the Greatest Hero of All Time but the heroes have already been chosen so you have to go and kill them and take you rightfull place. It is also a fast-paced action platformer which involves loads of bullets and enemies being thrown at you while you while having bullet time and control over your character at which in no point in time is trying to screw you over. The Game also and upgrades and weapons that you can purchase with points by playing the levels.\n\nWith everything but the kitchen sink coming towards your general direction it can be quite difficult trying to avoid it and you will die quite a bit at the start (Either I just suck or I'm telling the truth) but unlike most games where it insults you for dying, it doesn't really do it in Bleed, Infact half the time Wryn is actually conforting me for my loss saying things like "Don't worry we'll get them next time"\n\nThe Bullet time mechanic is really quite neat and helpful and also quite balanced. There is a separate bar for bullet time: Using it in short bursts will allow it to recharge a little and you will be able to use it again, Use it untill the bar goes to zero and you will have to wait untill it refills again to use bullet time once more and that could involve getting hurt when you needed it the most.\n\nI've also noticed the game is very generous in check points meaning it will not send you to the very beginning of that room or level, it's as if the developer knew that it might be a tad bit difficult on players. Now I can't really explain how it all works but just play the game and you will see what I mean.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is fantabolus (yes I purposely did that) there is not a single song that I didn't like. It fits in with the enviroment it is placed in and it has that old school 8-bit feel to it, especially the boss music.\n\nThere is also Co-op in this game, I don't anyone else to play with so yea :C but I had a look on youtube and it's quite nice. Still don't know how it works but it looks good.\n\nI have no complaints about this game: It has great fulid control, awesome soundtrack, fast-paced gameplay, a good challenge and a good price. There is however one thing that I am not fond of and that is the length of the game. while there are other things like arcade, challenge mode and other difficulties to play on, I just find this game to be a little to short and could have been better game than what is already was but hey, don't let that stop ya from buying this game cuz it is worth the price.\n\nIn conclusion I think that this is a great game to play and I had fun every single second of it and for 4.99 Its worth it all the way.....\n\n\n\n....Well what are you waiting for? Go buy it already!","June 9, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because when using the gamepad, you jump with the right trigger and use the right analog stick to shoot, but to me this feels kinda imprecise and the jumping needs a lot getting used to, I often found myself trying to press the A button in close situations. The keyboard + mouse controls just use WASD, the spacebar, the mouse buttons and the mouse wheel to switch weapons, pretty standard stuff.\nThe game also features bullettime which can make for some epic moments in combination with the shooting and dashing mechanic.\nThe jumping part is pretty standard, nothing really to complain about.\nAs for difficulty the game features four difficulties (Easy to Very hard), I played on Normal and I found the game to be challenging, but not frustratingly hard.\nOverall this is a great game and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who likes some fast paced 2D run-and-gun action.","June 6, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although very difficult on their own, and quite impossible, I was just bothered that nearly every boss arena was just 4 walls and nothing else. No platforms, no nothing. Which bothered me, but mainly at the end boss. It would've made it funner, but it was not needed because I barely noticed it until the end.

This is the game's strongest element, since it helps you comprehend the amount of crazy projectiles that the game is flinging at you, and it also lets you dodge bullets Matrix-style.\n\nAlso you double jump three times in a row.\n\nGo buy it.

I like it\n\n[game play]\nmax payne bullet time  in a 2d enviroment with a large varity enemies. with multiple amounts of weapons to go/try. and then the dashing[aka your life savior in bullet time] is very well done\n\n[design]\nvery classic 64bit like graphics with a modern twist\n\n[overall score]\n8.5/10\nGood game not the best but a very good game  Keep making games Dev cause i wil support you!","July 3, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of them all, this one exudes the most charm. The bosses seem to mirror The Binding of Isaac…I haven’t figured out the connection yet. The pixel art is superb, the creature design is fun, the chip tunes jaunty. The “bullet time” mechanic is addictive and cool. The weapons shop seems superfluous when you can beat the game with your basic pistols, but I’ve only beaten the game on normal. The achievements tell me a number of bonus levels or true endings await me, should I ever muster da skillz, so – replay value, there. This game is WELL worth your hard earned Steam dollars when it inevitably goes on sale. This is one you can dip in and out of for a quickie, and its humor will guarantee you a smile once you’ve saved the day.

It tests your patience and your skills. You need to be fast and you need to practice if you're used to slow paced games. Bleed can be described as a bullet hell platformer shoot 'em up, and it is a good one. It is definitely a game with charm specially with the amazing chiptune soundtrack and the pixelated graphicstyle. Overall the shooting is great but I did find the jumping to be abit janky most of the times. Despite the Bleed supporting a gamepad I did played with mouse and keyboard simply because when I tried the 360 controller I just died alot, that could be just me or me sucking horribly at it. I did beated the game on Normal and some levels on the hardest difficulty. Despite all that, the story isn't really that great, you're just trying to become the greatest hero of all time and the game is pretty short if you're good at it. Overall I'd say Bleed is a great game and even if some people don't really like it I think it got through Steam Greenlight for some reason, didn't it?","September 22, 2013","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is some blood here and there, but it's really not that prominent. A better name would be "Shoot" or "Dash". Personally, I feel that the best name for a game like this is "Brief Awesomeness" due to short length and enjoyable gameplay. "Bleed" is a really fun shoot-em-up with some pretty tight controls (Albeit an unusual control scheme from a gamepad perspective. Good luck with a keyboard.) and a good sense of humour. Unfortunately there are only seven levels so you can finish it in no time at all. The only way to make the experience last longer is to be a lousy player who keeps dying or trying to unlock all the achievements. Nevertheless, "Bleed" is enjoyable for the amount of time you spend with it and it has got some replay value. It's currently 10% off and I think it's worth the current price. As for full price... I'll let you decide.","July 11, 2013","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got excellent controls, precise aiming, skin-of-your-teeth dodging, upgrading elements, multiple characters that change how you play, great replay value and... it's cheap.  If that all makes it sound a little too intense for you, play on easy mode.  If that is just your niche, work your way up to very hard mode (which is very hard).  The main story is short, but the challenge mode allows you to create anywhere from easy to impossible combinations of enemies to allow you to practice and take your skill to higher and higher levels.  As a long standing fan of serious 2D action games, this is one of my tops.

That is basically the story in this case, nothing more, nothing less. I was kinda let down finding this out, but considering the games overall lenght, it was kinda predictable in the end. Must mean, the game focuses more in terms of gameplay. Well, sorta.\n\nBasically, you use the mouse to aim your guns, the WASD keys to move and space to jump, standard stuff. However, you also have a "bullettime" button on Shift, a very useful tool in this game. The game slows down, also zooms in on the character a bit but still letting you see alot whats going on around you, which is very usefull since the game tends to throw dozens of projectiles at once at you. Wryn also is capable of a "triple dash", which you can perform after jumping and is used for dodging. Combined with her wall jumps (wich work very well in my opinion) this can lead to some pretty tricky maneuvers and helps keeping the game fast paced (even with bullet time, which can be drained very easily).\n\nAs for the guns, i found most of them not that usefull to downright completely useless, and usually stuck with the standard dual machine guns and the flame thrower. Because of that, anything that wasn't these two weapons, felt really unsatisfying and unhandy to use.\n\nDifficulty wise this game is ok. Normal is what you expect. In Story mode if you die in a stage, you usually just respawn earlier in the stage, with some Point loss i believe. Wryn isn't really robust but she still can take a few hits, so it's fair in my book if you take the overall gameplay in retrospectiv.\n\nThe graphics were my biggest dislike about the game. I just can't stand these sprites. Wryn and her rival look atrocious, enemies and bosses look basic as hell and the overall looks of the levels don't impress me either. As for the level design itself, it's average. They are all fairly short, most of the time containing a mini boss, an element new to the prior stages and (of course) a different theme. For what they are doing they are alright, allthough they had no real depth to it, which i missed highly here.\n\nIt is difficult to say how i really felt the entirety of this game. Some part of me enjoyed it, some other part thought it was pretty dull and the most mediocre thing in a long while, lack of story didn't help either.\n\nI guess for that price it is an ok game. Next to the Story mode there is also an Arcade mode, some things to unlock and a boss battle mode, so there should be more time after. If you are fan of Jumpers with shooting elements give it a go. or stick to better alternatives. Like Metal Slug. Yes.\n","September 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/recommended/239800/","masterevilace","A Fancy Fridge Magnet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterevilace/","707 products in account","This game is extremely refreshing to play, as it stands out from a lot of other games out there. It plays like a twitchy platforming bullet-hell shooter.\n\nThe controls are a bit weird at first, but manageable as you play more (XBox controller: Left Stick move, Right Stick fire, Right Trigger jump, Left Trigger slow-mo, Left/Right Bumpers toggle between weapons.) If you're in the air you can "dash" a few times by hitting jump.  KB/Mouse should work as well. Aiming at things far away is difficult with controller and probably easier with mouse, but the platforming and dodging is probably harder with KB/Mouse. I have no idea, but keep that in mind.\n\nSo the key to the game is activating slow-motion, and jumping/dashing to dodge projectiles. You have infinite ammo, and can purchase additional weapons using points acquired from playing the game, or unlock weapon variations by beating the game. You only have to manage your health and energy bars, but there are upgrades you can purchase to help out.\n\nThe game has 7 levels that get progressively harder. The action never stops as you're always fighting between "screens" of enemies with mini-bosses and bosses thrown in frequently. A playthrough on normal difficulty took me ~80 minutes. It is extremely easy to die, but there are checkpoints at every new section. There are no lives, so you can beat the game through repetition (think Super Meat Boy.) The more deaths you get, the less points you get, etc.\n\nYou carry two weapons at a time but can swap out while paused. There are tons of additional weapons to unlock, all with their own style of use, but basic dual pistols are kind of all you need for the majority of the game (although Shotgun helped me a LOT.) There are also additional characters with slight variations in playstyle, but they require beating the game on normal/hard/veryhard.. So if you're dedicated, you can spend a lot of time in this game.\n\nI thought this game was awesome and well designed in all categories (except perhaps story :P)... but again, you probably won't like it if you don't enjoy any of the following: twitchy platformers, bullet-hell shooters, dying frequently, playing as a girl.","December 14, 2013","true","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Bosses are frequent and varied, and they will crush you if you don't learn to read their attacks and figure out how to use your skills to counter them.

A shoot-em up platformer that sees the lead character attempting to make a name for herself by 'Bumping off' the great heroes of the land.\n\nIn order to take down each 'hero', you have to go through each level, each one providing many challenges. This is no easy game, gameovers can appear thick and fast and both the levels and bosses take great delight in throwing as much at you as possible. Thankfully the game avoids some pitfalls by making the controls sleek, giving off a great amount of control, especially when it comes to the games 'Double Jump' mechanic which works more like an air-dash. It can take some time getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it flows quick and fast.\n\nThat said, theres not only finishing the game to consider, theres also the score to keep up. Just like in Devil May Cry, every hit you make raises a bonus bar, hitting the top of the bar bumps you up a score level going from 'D' rank and up to S. Getting hit or letting the bar time out resets the multiplier, meaning that if you want to score big, you have to get as much hits in as possible, all while avoiding damage (easier said than done).\n\nIn conclusion: An incredibly sleek, stylish and tough as nails platformer at a cheap price point and one thats well worth grabbing and playing through (even though you may occasionally burst into rounds of swearing thanks to the difficulty)","November 25, 2013","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

If you want a game that's short enough to jump into, hard enough to make you cry, and good enough to make you keep trying, this game is a surefire way to blow an afternoon or two.","November 7, 2013","true","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Wryn is on a quest to become the best hero of all time. Her solution? Take down the heroes of the past first! Sure the story does not make a lot of sense, but it's hard to argue with Wryn's results. For all the violence you dish out, the game never ceases to feel like it's cheering you on even when it throws the impossible at you. One of the few action games I've played that feels like a hug.\n\nThat said, the game's learning curve is pretty steep and the strange control setup doesn't help. This is one of the first shooting games I've played where the right trigger is not for your guns but is instead for jumping. Thankfully, there are upgrades and additional weapons to be had that can make the game go a lot smoother.\n\nLastly, my favorite touch was Wryn's comments on if she dies. There are not many but they range from shock to outrage to letting you know that she'll respawn in just a second. They're nice enough to take the edge off of defeat and make you dive back in for more.","July 13, 2013","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What a mouthful. The Levels in Bleed are well made, with good design and enemy placement, and the game has a great 16bit sounding soundtrack. The gameplay is simple yet challenging and extremely fulfilling. This is purely a skill based game, and it has a high skill ceiling, so prepare to die and learn a few times as more and more you start to turn into a total badass.\n\nYou will get to do the levels one by one as you learn them and continue to manage to do them at higher levels of difficulty, and when you've mastered them, then you move on to the real game, Arcade Mode. In Arcade Mode you have one life with a non-replenishing health bar to complete all the levels in one go, on your difficulty level of choosing.\n\nThis game is a great deal of fun to play, and has a lot of style and humor. I've played a great many games and enjoyed them in various ways, but what this game has that most don't now-a-days, is genuine skill based gameplay and challenge. I've gotten a lot of satisfaction from playing this game and I completely recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning and testing their metal.\n\nFor it's genre and my level of enjoyment I give it a 10/10.","July 20, 2013","true","38.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Distance between checkpoints is perfect.\n\nIf you love a pulse-pounding, action-packed video game, it is in your interest to pick up Bleed as soon as possible!","January 1, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/araganor/recommended/239800/","araganor","Araganor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/araganor/","130 products in account","This is an awesome indie title to crave your need for fast-paced gameplay, without the hassle of a thousand loading screens or overly complicated storylines. Bleed is a side-scrolling run-and-gun shooter, best enjoyed with a gamepad (I used the Logitech F710, and it worked beautifully) for maximum enjoyment. It satisfies "the itch," even if you didn't know you had one.\n\nWhile the controls seem strange at first, once you get used to them you will have an absolute blast. Wryn (the main character) is an army of one, capable of dashing through the air multiple times, slowing down time, and utilizing an arsenal of weapons (pistols, RPGs, laser rifles, you name it) as she dodges and destroys her way through each level. All of the movements feel fluid, and it is easy to make snap judgements on the fly to avoid incoming projectiles and the like. Whevever I died, I didn't blame the game; it was almost always a mistake that could have been avoided with better play, which encouraged me to try again.\n\nI can say without a doubt that after the first playtrhough, (which doesn't take very long unfortunately with only 7 levels) I was ready to go for round 2 on the next difficulty. Every second is a rush, so a 5 minute session will be just as fun as an hour-long one. While this indie gem may not keep you occupied for more than a few hours at a time, expect every moment to be a rush that will challenge what you're inner run-and-gunner is made of. Two guns up!","January 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a fast-paced-platforming-twin-stick-shooter, all things that I generally hate being a laid-back RPG type player. However the charm of the game really helps, along with the fairly lenient checkpoint and continue systems (restart at full health in the screen you died in, takes off point at the end which you use as currency). The story was really pretty awesome for such a short one, and I find Wryn (the main character) as one of my favorite protaganists now. Just the cheeky little humor thrown in, along with the little speech at the end... plus seriously, somebody that can jump around like that while kicking so much butt deserves it.\n\nA really fun game, and one I would recommend to all gamers regardless of your genre of choice. It's fun and forgiving for those that aren't very good with actiony games, while also pretty punishing on V.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetankbuster/recommended/239800/","thetankbuster","JakeTheSnake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetankbuster/","78 products in account","The first thing that I believe should be pointed out is that the near entirety of this game was made by one person, with a few others for quality assurance, sound design, etc. While I can appreciate the amount of work it would take for an individual to make a game such as this, I am at first impressed, but then I remember Cave Story, a game made by another individual. Cave Story's composition displays immense amounts of experience and understanding of the craft that Bleed does not. Cave Story, in its original form, is also available to play free of charge, a privilege that Bleed does not, to my knowledge, provide. This is quite ironic to me, since Cave Story feels like a retail-quality game while Bleed feels like a high schooler's B-grade final project.\n\nAfter playing Bleed, I had no clue whatsoever as to why I had it in my wishlist for as long as I did. On the surface, the game looks bland at best. The background art is a few steps above being on the level of placeholders, the main character looks like something an artist in their very early stages of artistic development would draw in their math notebook, and the enemies look like thirty-second doodles with copious amounts of tweening in place of animation. All of these assets are presented in a style popular amongst indie platformers, which is somewhat inspired, if indirectly, by Cave Story, i.e. drawn in a digital paint program, then shrunk down and blown back up again. Despite this, all enemies explode in a high-resolution blood splatter, which is akin to taking a sledgehammer to the game's artstyle. Even if the game's developer was going for simplicity, they failed to take into consideration that simplicity functions best when based on rules of art that this game does not regard.\n\nThe general style of the game as a whole seems to be more directly inspired by Hotline Miami, as both are "retro-styled" games with violent gunplay and twin-stick controls. However, Bleed is more than content with throwing a side-scrolling shooter or two (Megaman X and Super Metroid come to mind) into the stew. This leads to the player having to juggle free, any-directional aiming and platforming, making for a mediocre experience in both regards. One remarkably stupid part of the platforming side is the main character's means of vertical movement. The player is given a quadruple-jump, which combines the directional functionality of Cave Story's Jetpack 2.0 with some of Super Metroid's Space Jump's maneuverability. This is much less fun than it may seem on paper. While the Jetpack 2.0 restricts movement to four directions, and the Space Jump only allows the player one direction that can be adjusted slightly, the quad-jump in Bleed can be used in any of eight directions. The variety of orientations are very hard to justify, as diagonal movement is mostly unneccessary and the momentum from the horizontal jump isn't enough to be helpful.\n\nA further ingredient in Bleed's cookbook is Max Payne's bullet time mechanic. While admittedly the most fun part of the game is dodging enemies and shots in slow motion, the novelty wears off as no other mechanics take advantage of it, making it go stale quickly. However, it seems to be almost required in a few situations, the scenario with the helicopter in the game's first level coming to mind. The shots are practically impossible to dodge, since the level is designed with very little cover from the helicopter's highly accurate shots. This leaves the player hiding in very small crevies waiting for their bullet time to recharge.\n\nThe game's balance is almost as laughable as its presentation. Levels are harbingers of torment despite having checkpoints in between every room. Meanwhile, bosses can be faced with comparatively little effort. One of the game's many plagiarized elements, the style meter, brings this to mind, as reaching a rank above a D only occurs once in a blue moon during levels, while it's to be expected to go as high as an A in bosses.\n\nOverall, Bleed feels like a love letter to everything wrong with indie games. The entire experience is bland, the music is forgettable, the art is embarassing, and the gameplay is a chore. Perhaps, wth experience, the developer can one day produce something great, since it is evident that this is a very early attempt at a fully-fledged video game.","December 23, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/recommended/239800/","glitchedjoygirl","Soultaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/","413 products in account","The strangely titled retro platformer Bleed from Bootdisk Revolution was released recently on Steam but has been available DRM free and on XBox Live since 2012. Featuring a cool pixelated purple-haired heroine dual-wielding pistols, you can make sure this game got my attention and getting it for my birthday from a friend, I had to try it out. Is it worth buying or is this indie game just another retro platformer in the sea of retro platformers? Let's find out.\n\nThe story in Bleed isn't exactly complicated stuff. You're basically sent out to kill some ex-heroes who have turned into villains somehow over time in order to become the new ultimate hero. The game does have its own unique humor though and contains several references to oldschool platformers and clichés. I particurarily love the level and boss descriptions and the main character has a ton of personality as every time you die, she will utter a comment about how she died, often pertaining to the level or enemy you fought. The story is pretty basic but sufficiently quirky to make it a bit unique although the gameplay is obviously the focus of the game.\n\n\nThe game plays a lot like the old classic Megaman games although with its own spin on things. The basic goal of each level, which can be played alone or co-op with a friend, is to make it through to the end and killing everything in your path, using your abilities to survive the hazards and enemies that come your way. The controls are gonna take some getting used to, especially the jumping mechanics (which confused me a bit at first as your double jump is controlled by aiming it). You're given two weapon slots and start out with dual pistols and a rocket launcher (two of my favourite weapons in any game) although as you complete each level you earn money you can use to buy new weapons and upgrades and you can change your weapon loadout at any time during the level, which expands your inventory slightly. You're also given a slowmo ability which comes in handy during certain areas and boss fights and it can be upgraded to last longer by giving you more energy, and a health bar which can be upgraded and you have infinite lives so losing is not that big of a deal, respawning you in the room you died. This is a godsend because this game is really challenging, even on the Easy difficulty. I really recommend not playing on anything but Easy when first playing this game as even that mode seriously kicked my ♥♥♥ on several occasions, especially since the controls feel a bit awkward at first and take some getting used to.\n\nOnce you have beat the game's 7 levels with the last one basically being a boss run, you can play through those again on higher difficulties or attempt some harder modes such as the Arcade mode (playing through the game on one life) or Challenge mode where you fight 3 bosses simultaneously on one screen. You can also unlock other characters by completing the game on other difficulties so the game does have some replay value although for me the game felt a bit too short and with not enough differences to warrant repeated playthroughs. I would've loved the ability to play more than just 7 levels personally.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent, sporting the retro pixelated style you can expect from a retro platformer so there's not much to say about it. It feels deliciously 80's though with a lot of purple and pink used and a pretty broad colour palette. The game has a pretty good soundtrack although it just didn't stick that well with me for some reason. The main theme is pretty much the only memorable theme from the game in my opinion which is a shame. I just didn't feel the soundtrack stood out that well for me.\n\nSo overall, how good is Bleed? For me, the game is pretty average and kind of gets lost in the sea of retro indie platformers these days. Although I enjoy the style, especially the dual pistols and just the fact the game has a badass heroine and a quirky story, I found it way too short and way too difficult to really get into. The controls take some getting used to and even then I just can't find much replay value. It might be something I have the odd craving for now and then but I can't see myself playing this much.\n\nSUMMARY:\nSTORY: 5/10\nLargely forgetable and just there to serve the gameplay, although a bit quirky.\nGRAPHICS: 7/10\nColourful retro graphics, but nothing you haven't seen a million times before in other retro platformers. If you like this style, this game is probably for you but for me it just feels a bit above average.\nGAMEPLAY: 5/10\nDifficult controls take a bit getting used to giving the game a bit of an unfair difficulty level for beginners and it will take a while to get into. It's a decent platformer though and the gunplay is fun. I will have to say it's a very short game though, the only replay value is there if you somehow feel the need to play through the same levels over and over.\nSOUND: 6/10\nIt's classic 8bit style sound all the way but just doesn't stand out enough for me. I've seen this done a million times already in other indie platformers and this game just doesn't do anything unique in the sound department. It's decent and definitely fits the game, but just not memorable enough to be anything but average.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 6/10","January 10, 2014","false","2.2"," 26 of 62 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","26","62","0","1"

There are 4 difficulty levels, but frankly normal is annoying enough. There are some options for different weapons but I used the starting gun for 99% of the games, the other 1% was just to see if the other weapons were worth using (they weren't). The enemies are boring and the level structure was probably the worst part, it was difficult in an annoying rather than challenging way.

You've got Ninja Gaiden wall climbing, jetpack boots, and a fun dash.\n\nAll the while you have dual stick movement and shooting control making it feel like the best combination of Commander Keen, SNES platformer, and arcade shoot em up all in one.\n\nIt isn't easy. The controls aren't always intuitive. Once I got a handle on the dashing I loved the freedom of movement over the 2d action stages.\n\nThe player acumulates coins to buy new weapons but my favorite is still the dual wield pistols you start with, which when combined with your weird flying powers feels like playing John Wu's The Rocketeer.\n\nThe art is silly in a good way and the story is hard to decipher.

All killer, no filler. If you're like me and suck at hardcore platformers, Bleed generously checkpoints at the beginning of every (short) section, so you won't have to replay too much each time you die. If you're actually good at this kind of thing, you can remix the game with a customized boss rush mode (if I understand correctly) or play the Arcade challenge with only one life (hah!). This will net you a higher score, which nets you more points you can use to buy new weapons and upgrade the main character, enabling you to play harder modes to get higher scores, etc.\n\nGamepad controls take a little getting used to (analog stick to shoot, shoulder trigger to jump?) but soon you get into a groove where the controls make sense and are perfectly intuitive. Except I'd find myself clutching the left trigger during especially tense moments, which prevented the time slowdown meter from refilling, which made tense moments even tenser.... and the game is essentially comprised of tense moments.","October 5, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story goes that you and the main protagonist Wryn have to kill all 6 great heroes in the hall of fame who have hidden themselves from the rest of the world in order to join their ranks, and reveal them for who they really are. The game is pure enjoyment, and in my opinion is what a Matrix game should be, even if it has nothing to do with that franchise. Wryn can do three directional dashes while in the air, making her extremely mobile, if a little hard to control. You use the mouse to aim her weapons and can even go into bullet time (see why I compared it to the Matrix).  Wryn is probaby the best main protagonist in an indie game. She is just so adorable! The only real issue is the control. While you can get used to it, it can cause a lot of death, especially on stage 6.  Many may say this game is too short, but I honestly prefer short but amazing games as opposed to long dull games. This game will take you about 1 and a half hours to beat, but those 1 and a half hours will be some of the best in your life. 8/10","October 10, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bosses can initially be extremely tough, but it honestly comes down to memorizing their attack patterns. The story mode is a bit short but, for me at least, the fun is in 100% -ing the achievements, buying out the shop, and seeing yourself get good at the game.\nIf you're a perfectionist or love bullethell titles, this is the game for you!\n","December 3, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great character animation when shooting at any angle (check it out while slowing time).\n3. Nice emphasis on skill over memorization (unlike other good games like Super Meat Boy and Dust Force).\n\nWhile the devs put care into the most important parts of the game, there are a couple of quirks. E.g. If using a keyboard/mouse, turning on capslock (I tend to do that by accident) makes it so that shift doesn't work for slowing time. Just get used to RMB to slow time.

You've got Ninja Gaiden wall climbing, jetpack boots, and a fun dash.\n\nAll the while you have dual stick movement and shooting control making it feel like the best combination of Commander Keen, SNES platformer, and arcade shoot em up all in one.\n\nIt isn't easy. The controls aren't always intuitive. Once I got a handle on the dashing I loved the freedom of movement over the 2d action stages.\n\nThe player acumulates coins to buy new weapons but my favorite is still the dual wield pistols you start with, which when combined with your weird flying powers feels like playing John Wu's The Rocketeer.\n\nThe art is silly in a good way and the story is hard to decipher. Definitely worth a play if you want to shoot stuff and fly around fast as a cool vampire-ish girl.","December 29, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are a bit odd at first, as jumping is defaulted to a trigger, but this frees up your thumb the ability to run, aim, and jump simultaneously--seldom heard of.  What makes Blleed even more unique is its time-slowing ability, sort of like a Prince of Persia sand of time thing, but meter-based instead of amount of times used.  With this ability in hand and many achievements and upgrades to discover, Bleed may be worth well more than the retail price depending on when you stop playing (a run through of all levels on easy is less than an hour, but attempting arcade mode (no deaths) on very hard could take many many hours to practice for).

This is just me, but I definitely recommend a controller for play.\nThis game is full of so many things I want more of in games. The varied mechanics grant you crazy amounts of control over the player character. Multiple weapons and many different enemy types provide an opportunity for strategic firepower choices. The music is great, the graphics are retro and lovable.\nThis feels like a game I would have had growing up. It is pure fun. Even when you aren't doing well, you are still throughly enjoying the experience. This is a game that makes you think, "I am awesome." "Look at all the cool things I can do! "Ha ha! Take that baddies." "Just one more try and I am DEFINITELY going to beat this boss!"\nThis seriously feels like a game straight out of my childhood, but with better mechanics, more seemless graphics and gameplay, and great music. If you are on the fence about buying this game, even a little bit, I highly recommend that you go ahead and get it! This little game packs a big punch and I can promise you won't regret getting it.","July 17, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All killer, no filler. If you're like me and suck at hardcore platformers, Bleed generously checkpoints at the beginning of every (short) section, so you won't have to replay too much each time you die. If you're actually good at this kind of thing, you can remix the game with a customized boss rush mode (if I understand correctly) or play the Arcade challenge with only one life (hah!). This will net you a higher score, which nets you more points you can use to buy new weapons and upgrade the main character, enabling you to play harder modes to get higher scores, etc.\n\nGamepad controls take a little getting used to (analog stick to shoot, shoulder trigger to jump?) but soon you get into a groove where the controls make sense and are perfectly intuitive. Except I'd find myself clutching the left trigger during especially tense moments, which prevented the time slowdown meter from refilling, which made tense moments even tenser.... and the game is essentially comprised of tense moments.","October 5, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This games does, especially if you try to master it!\n\nAn action-platformer that strangely unites the best of Megaman X and, I'd argue, a teensy bit of Devil May Cry, this game captures the best of both with its dashing, harsh combo counter (you gotta be mad good to stay at S-ranking), and nifty boss designs. Each level is thematically different, with bosses suited to each, and hazards similarly well suited for the environments you encounter, and every last bit of each is (if you ask me) intended to rip away at your health and combo ranking, making it a fantastic game if you like high-speed action and a high skill barrier to master it.\n\nThe art style and music are also really enjoyable, unless you're tired of the retro stylings a little, but even if you are, I'd recommend this on the basis of its gameplay alone, as that it makes it stand out from the loads of other somewhat slower, more methodical puzzle platformers or sidescrolling roguelikes. The story isn't much to talk about, though, as it's the basic hero's quest to overcome past heroes and be the new best hero of the world, with pretty frequent acknowledgment of you as a player if you die often.\n\nIn short, if you want a good, solid action platformer similar to old Contra games or Megaman X games, you can't go wrong here.","March 19, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great character animation when shooting at any angle (check it out while slowing time).\n3. Nice emphasis on skill over memorization (unlike other good games like Super Meat Boy and Dust Force).\n\nWhile the devs put care into the most important parts of the game, there are a couple of quirks. E.g. If using a keyboard/mouse, turning on capslock (I tend to do that by accident) makes it so that shift doesn't work for slowing time. Just get used to RMB to slow time.

"Hard" and "Very hard" are actually really challanging. Basically, for any skill level.\n- GAME WAS WAY TOO SHORT. I wish there were about 10x more levels and bosses.\n\nStory:\n- Not really existant, but doesn't get in the way. The story might as well not be there.\n+ Story doesn't get in the way. The point of the games isn't for the story\n\nAtmosphere/Art/Music:\n* Atmosphere varies by level, but has an overall cartoonish feel to it. Not "in your face" pixel art, and overall has a nice aesthetic.\n* Music was mid tier\n\nMechanics:\n+ The best platformer/shooter mechanics I've ever seen.\n+ You get a tripple dash, where you can dash in any direction three times. Insanely fun, and you just want to dash around the screen, shooting things. If you get good at it, you can combine the dashes so you can dodge and couter attack, or to get behind an enemy you would normally think you can't get over. Might take some practice, but you can do things like, tripple jump + wall jump + jump up + right dash + jump up, all withought hitting the ground. Since this game is a bullet hell, it feels amazing when you dash around 10 bullets at once\n+ Interesting weapons. You get to select two weapons, which you can switch out. The default weapon, dual pistos, is basically a machine gun, and can get you though most of the game, but buying different weapons adds a challange or an advantage, depending on the level. Adds a great dynamic to the game\n+ Bullet time: Great tool to get you though tough situations. Has a reasonable cooldown, so you can't spam it but it isn't an "ult" move. Combine bullet time and the tripple dash, and you feel like a super hero\n+ Bosses: Not creative, but good. When I say not creative, I mean the bosses really remind me of kirby or super meat boy bosses. They all have patterns, and they cycle through moves. Each boss is very different, and each presented a different challange.

Just a few days ago I decided to play it, and was quite amazed at what I found.  Bleed is a platformer shooter that also has some bullet hell mechanics.\n\nThe game is about Wryn, a girl who is trying to kill all the heroes in her time period to become the best hero ever.  There isn't much else to the story, but the game doesn't need it.\n\nThe gamepad controls for this game are great.  I used the Xbox 360 pad and after a while of practice it was quite easy to control Wryn.  It plays like a twinstick shooter, one pad to move the other to shoot.  The right trigger is for jumping which you can move in any direction with the stick. Unfortunately I did try the keyboard and mouse controls and found it lacking.  The keyboard can't compete with a pad, if the developer made it so the mouse controled Wryn's movements it would have been viable but since the arrow keys control it's unusable.  Gamepad is definetely recommended.\n\nThe game does play great though. It is a platforming shooter and the shooting is quite great.  There are 12 weapons to choose from that you can change during the level.  Some of them shoot great others are harder to shoot but have more power.  One of the main mechanics of bleed is slowing down time, which you use to dodge projectiles and move around precise areas.  When I started playing the game I ignored the slowdown as I found it not worth it, but really you learn later how important it is, and with a little bit of practice you should be able easily use it.\n\nThe music for this game is 8-bit and I feel they do fit the levels and the bosses. Each level has different music but each boss has the same music.  I enjoyed the 8-bit music but after a while they do get old.\n\nBleed is quite short but for the kind of game it is, this works well. In about 2 hours you can complete the campaign on normal, and after that there are two higher difficulties that require a lot more work.  Achievement wise, most of them require just a lot of time and understanding of game mechanics, and enemy patterns.  There is a guide for all of the secret achivements because I honestly didn't understand them, they are harder to do then understand though.  As for the last bunch of achievements the ones that require you to beat the arcade at certain difficulty levels are really tough.  You have to beat the entire game with one life, it will take a lot of practice and a lot of restarting to get them, but they are possible.\n\nOverall I'd say Bleed is a great game.  The controls are good and the mechanics are original.  It will take you between 2-20 hours depending on how many achivements you go for, and at 5$ it's amazing.  If you do not have a gamepad though, I can't really recommend it.","August 30, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While most indie platformers are slow, and artistic, Bleed is fast paced and violent, with gameplay that goes really fast, so fast you may even lose track of what you're doing. The only downside to this being that the game is kinda short, and that coupled with gameplay so quick you'd think it was programmed by a joint team made up of Sonic the Hedgehog and Dominic Torretto - the game goes by really fast. It's still one hell of a good time, though.","January 2, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Few useful weapons can be purchased also to counter whatever the enemy attacks you with. Unlock a few things from beating the game on each level of difficulty. The amount of things you can purchase is realistic and is not an epic grind to earn, although it does ask for probably no more than 6 hours minimum to get pretty much everything the game has to offer. 11/10 because I had a coupon for the game.","March 17, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story goes that you and the main protagonist Wryn have to kill all 6 great heroes in the hall of fame who have hidden themselves from the rest of the world in order to join their ranks, and reveal them for who they really are. The game is pure enjoyment, and in my opinion is what a Matrix game should be, even if it has nothing to do with that franchise. Wryn can do three directional dashes while in the air, making her extremely mobile, if a little hard to control. You use the mouse to aim her weapons and can even go into bullet time (see why I compared it to the Matrix).  Wryn is probaby the best main protagonist in an indie game. She is just so adorable! The only real issue is the control. While you can get used to it, it can cause a lot of death, especially on stage 6.  Many may say this game is too short, but I honestly prefer short but amazing games as opposed to long dull games. This game will take you about 1 and a half hours to beat, but those 1 and a half hours will be some of the best in your life. 8/10","October 10, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humor and simple nature of the game is also pretty addictive. The controls are pretty tight in my opinion anyway. Level variety is spastic and if your in the mood for that it's amazing.\n\nThe Bad\nThe game is super short and difficult even on easy. The game does not go out of the way to wow you with visuals or crazy unique sound beats.\n\nConclusion\nBleed is a fun speedy adventure with lots of humor and a unique charm. The controls work well and the level design and variety won't leave you bored.\n\nValue\nThe game is quite good, but short so I'd really only suggest paying around $1.99 or less.","July 12, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In easy mode, expect to wrap up the game in 1 hour. However it's full of contents and you can't get bored, even if you wanted to.

The triple jumps are however a bit hard to handle.\nGraphics are very good, especially considering that pixel art is not easy. And the level design is also very well done.\nThe game is rather difficult. That might be because the monsters and weapons could a little better adjusted and they are raising artificially the difficulty of the game. The infinite lifes helps you to eventually finish the game, which makes the game a try and die.\nI still didn't try to replay, but there are definitely some replayability between the items to unlock in the shop and the harder modes (which probably bring new ennemy patterns).

It took me some time to get used to, however, it has become one of my favourite game experiences I've had in a long time. Basically, you fight through a level of level themed mobs and challenges (sometimes with a mini boss included) and then fight a couple unique boss battles. In the end, it's a very short game, but it has a high replayabillity as you unlock more abillities as you go, allowing you to explore new weapons and capabillites. What also contributes to the replayabillity is the fact that as you up the difficulty on the game, the bosses gain more abillities. Finally, there is a boss arena that you can use to fight any boss, on any difficulty; you can even fight up to 4 bosses and mini bosses at once!\n\nAll in all, a good game, but you should probably wait for a sale if you're on a budget.","June 29, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's comparable to megaman in that it's a platform game with shooting and bosses, however there are a lot of big differences. In Bleed you are able to slow time. Now this might not be the most unique mechanic to video games in general but here it completely allows the game designers to be creative and make normal play very challenging, encouraging you to make careful use of the slow time mechanic. The game starts to feel extremely difficult until you realize it's designed around this mechanic, and you start to get better at managing your energy and slowing time during difficult sections or certain moves from bosses. The game is also different in that as I mentioned you shoot using any angle you wish, which again leads to enemies being more creative, more mobile, and generally harder to hit, but because you have the freedom to aim wherever you want this becomes all balanced out.\n\nThe game itself is flowing with creativity. The levels will surprise you from a moving train to a level that actually rotates while you're moving through it. The levels are designed to be very different and throw you for a loop, hoping for you to slow time to makes things managable. The bosses are also very well done. They have a lot of variety and expect a lot of your attention.\n\nBleed gives you choices in difficulty as well as some RPG elements in terms of upgrading your character and getting new weapons. In playing on the normal difficulty I was challenged but I was still able to beat the game without getting too frustrated. The game is generous with checkpoints which is always a + from me, but it even gives you the option of playing the game in a traditional arcade style with 1 life. The game is a bit short (that might just be because I couldn't get enough) but with the additional modes and difficulties and items you can gather on top of the just overall great feeling I had playing this, it's worth the $5 and a no brainer during a sale.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. I hope that the people behind the creative design choices will continue to make games as it is so blatantly obvious that a lot of love and brilliance went into this. I don't really have any complaints, I wish the game was longer so I could experience more from this company.\n\n8.5/10","June 30, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't finished it 100%, there's still a number of unlocks, difficulties, and achieves for me to go for, but after finishing the game on normal, I have to say that it's some of the most fun I've had in quite a while.\n\nSo what it is? It's a classic-style action-platformer that plays like a mix of Megaman, Contra, and Gunstar Heroes. You have a number of weapons, ranging from the basic dual pistols and rocket launcher to explosive mines, a laser rifle, and a katana. Each one has it's uses situationally, but the game is plenty playable with whatever setup you prefer. I myself like the pistols for accuracy and the katana for its ability to deflect bullets. There's an incredibly controllable triple-jump, wall jumping, and bullet time to help you dodge the massive amount of ordnance that will be flying around. You'll progress through seven short levels, each with a miniboss and a boss. The levels are derivative, as this game is basically a love letter to its influences, but it does a number of neat things with the design. It operates on a checkpoint system, which is good, because while it's not that bad on normal, but it is approaching Nintendo hard, especially on the harder difficulties. Thanks to the liberal use of checkpoint, each inevitable death ceases to sting all that bad. Like Dark Souls, Bleed is very difficult, but never punishing. Every time you die, you will know why, and that's because you messed up. That's in addition to the absolute badassery you'll unleash. While for most games the triple-jump and bullet-time would be gimmicks, in Bleed they are central to both the combat and platforming and allow you to pull off some seriously awesome moves. Rather than being nastily cheap, Bleed gives you the tools to succeed and encourages you to rise to the challenge.\n\nThe story is practically nonexistant, as it was in the old days. It is the year 21XX, and the last century was the time of heroes. However, the heroes have gotten old, there's no new ones, and a cotton-candy-haired girl named Wryn dreams of supplanting them and becoming the greatest hero in the world. There is a twist, if you can call it that, at the end, but ultimately this has a classic-style video game plot to complement it's classic-style gameplay. All it is is a setup to excuse the chaos. If you want depth, look elsewhere.\n\nOne last comment. The game has a wonderful atmosphere. While most of the backgrounds resemble old SNES/Genesis backgrounds, the character designs are extremely cutesy, and pink is a prominent color in Wryn's character design. While I understand that this might be offputting for many gamers, the way the designer used it to contrast with the intense action is delightful, what little story there is is hilarious as a result, and the ending is pure saccharine joy. Give it a chance. Bleed may not be complex or terribly unique, but what it is is an absolute blast. Recommended to anyone who can deal with a bit of a challenge.","August 7, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also have the ability to change your weapons and dash through the air in order to dodge bullets. Another key element to the mechanics is the implementation of a Bullet-Time (aka slow-mo) mode where you can slow down everything for a limited amount of time. This ability gets recharged automatically after a few seconds.\n\nThe controls are sharp and the game look alright. I wasn't really a fan of the presentation, it seemed like a 5 year old could create more innovative enemies and characters for the game but hey, it didn't bother me as much. Be warned that the game gets Tough and you'll die over and over again in order to progress but the levels are pretty short and there are checkpoints spread throughout in reasonably good places so don't worry about trial and error. Some bosses are pretty challenging indeed.\n\nI played with keyboard+mouse and it worked as it should but I can see that playing with a controller would be fine too.\n\nYou get to purchase new weapons between levels but I found myself pretty fine with the standard dual guns+rocket launcher loadout.\n\nYou can finish the game in roughly 2 hours or so and there's an Arcade mode to compete for high scores a boss challenge mode as well as 3 additional characters (read: skins) to play with but other than that, I wasn't really compelled to play this game any more than beating the story mode (there are 4 difficulties in all).\n\nTo be quite honest, I can't call this a bad game but there's nothing that special about it either. It's a great bargain at sales but don't pay full price! I don't want to give this game neither a thumbs up nor down but since it is very much playable, occassionally fun but bland through and through, a MARGINAL THUMBS UP will do.","August 5, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captain_tid/recommended/239800/","captain_tid","Alex 'Tid' Knowles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captain_tid/","107 products in account","This game mega took me by surprise. While a limited 'bullet time' power has been explored time and time again by games of many different genres, I don't honestly think I've ever seen it implemented as cleanly and effectively as in Bleed. The game allows you up to three mid-air dashes, which can be performed in any direction and steered to a very precised degree. Normally the high speed and intensity of the game's action makes it difficult to properly utilise this mechanic to avoid the almost bullet-hell like hazards of each level, but that's where the bullet time comes in. Each level is, in addition to being very creative, extremely well suited to testing your ability to find the perfect moment to slow down time and use your air dashes to carefully weave in and out of obstacles, all while trying to deal maximum damage to the enemies in your way with a variety of weapons.\nIn addition to the well crafted levels, each boss is highly unique and a tonne of fun to fight. You're unlikely to beat any of them on your first try, but none of them ever feel unfair or cheap.\n\nMy only complaints about the game are in the nitpicky details. I'm personally not a fan of spritework with coloured outlines, as I think it gives too much of a pillow-shade look to the characters. I can't say anything from the soundtrack sticks out as particularly memorable either. Generally speaking the weapon balance was a little off, with some of the unlockable weapons being downright useless, and most were just generally worse or less universally appropriate than the  default loadout, so you'll unfortunately probably go through most of the game without bothering to switch out.\n\nOverall though I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who into difficult games that require quick thinking and precise movements and aiming. I've already enjoyed Bleed more than enough for my money's worth after two full playthroughs (first on hard and then on very hard), and I absolutely plan to go back and try and get an S-rank on each boss!","December 7, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those that prefer something calmer, Bleed is like reading an amazing book when the sequel is just around the corner, and you had no idea it existed.\n\nBleed's an arcade-y action platformer that never seems to stop with the punches it pulls: it's main mechanic, being able to slow down time, does so much for the game: things that seem incredibly difficult to dodge in real time are made far easier, making Bleed something akin to almost a bullet hell (minus the tiny hitbox; but if you're hit, it's generally your fault due to some pretty lenient hitboxes). It's fast, relentless...much like you will be: fast and relentless against the heroes that dare stand in your way in your pursuit of being number one.\n\nFor only 99 cents, this game is an ABSOLUTE MUST for those into action games.

It's a fun little blast and honestly can be a little tricky at times but the fun shooting mechanics along with slow mo just makes it such a blast to play.\n\nHowever, it's extremely short. The 1 hour I have on this is the time it did take me to beat the game on Normal mode. There is some extras and time things such as speedrunning/arcade which I thoroughly enjoy; but if you're not too much into that there's not an extreme amount of replayability here.\n\nFor the 5 dollar price tag,  is it worth it? I'd say yes if you're into platformers and action games and you know you'll want to possibly play this more than once. I'd still recommend it though to everyone, but on a sale if you're not too sure if you want to buy it at full price.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10","December 28, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Could describe it as a 2D Devil May Cry, plus time slow-down powerup.\n\nInsane difficulty, you will probably start it on normal then have to switch to easy at later levels (as early as the 3rd stage for me), finish the stage on easy, and then do it later on normal, with some more upgrades. Though it's nice that you can go back to previous stages in a higher difficulty (hard, very hard, and these will make you suffer) to farm a bit for some upgrades.\n\nAlso, on higher difficulties, some parts are almost bullet hell like, when they're throwing a crazy amount of bullets at you, and the only way you can possibly dodge is by slowing down time, but still, the curtains are very dense (for those who understand danmaku terms).\n\nEven though I still haven't finished it, I definitely recommend it. I love the challenge, it's the kind of game that gets you actually talking to yourself as you play, and spontaneously swearing when you die. And finally, when you beat the boss, especially on higher dificulties, it's very rewarding. So you should definitely give it a try.","May 10","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
