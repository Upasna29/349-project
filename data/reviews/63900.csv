Story is, let's be generous and say "Familiar" to most fantasy fans and the voice acting doesn't really shine. The graphics are a little dated, but still do a good job of conveying atmosphere.\nAll in all, think HOMM in russian, and at quite a good price. worth it at full price, must-have in a sale.","May 1, 2015","true","51.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

Similar to Advance Wars in this and many other respects.\n\nCons:\n-It's difficult, even on easy mode expect to die and restart at least once per level either from a surprise attack or from being outnumbered and/or unlucky.\n-The healing system is frustrating, yet still tactical.  Heal your wounded for free but it takes a full turn, and if you're close to any enemy units you won't heal as much.  Units dont heal when in a friendly town.\n-Friendly cities do not generate gold.  In fact, i have yet to find a way to continuously generate gold except "find it" in newly taken towns.  This often mean that the units you start a level with are all you get, though you can build up and buy new units with the limited "found" money.  This makes the game very offensive-based by nature as there is no point to waiting around to build-up resources that don't exist.  This isn't really a bad thing, but i personally am not used to it.  Experementing with a powerful unit basically ends with "Ok, now i know not to do THAT.... restart...." because you cant rebuild resource and get another one.\n-AND A BIG ONE- When your captain dies, level's over, regardless of how powerful/large your army is.  You're done.  Restart.  This wouldn't be that big of a problem normally, but 90% of the time your captain is your most powerful unit and if you leave him back to protect him there's a good chance you'll lose from lack of power.  But if you bring him the AI makes him the #1 target.  Frustrating.\n\nAll in all:\nA REALLY good fantasy, turn-based strategy game.  Frustrating, but rewarding and still good.\n8/10 stars  Worth buying, worth wasting 30+ hours on.","October 4, 2014","true","10.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Nothing more nothing less.\n\nThe basic idea is this. You command a few heroes and other military units. You fight a lot of enemies and achieve some goal such as conquering a city. Then you move on to a new mission and do the same kind of thing. This is a lot of fun. Why? Because the tactical battles themselves are really good. For example thee are terrain bonuses that differ between military units and make perfect sense, e.g. elven archers may gain defence if hiding in the forest while knights will have a reduced charge attack score. Add to this a large number of different kinds of units to command, many of which are upgradable, several different heroes with unique skills and different skills to choose from for each type of unit when it levels up. Together it adds up to a challenging and fun to play turn based strategy game.\n\nThe story is the weakest element of the game. I cannot even remember what it was about and i just finished the game. But it doesn't really matter. This is not a game you play for the story anyway.\n\nThe interface is well designed and easy to understand and to use. There are three different campaigns, one of which is unlocked after you have beaten the other two (in either order). You can choose one of three difficulty level separately for each mission and there are also three different victory types depending on how quickly you finish the mission. This adds some replay value to what is already a long game.\n\nGraphics are fairly good but nothing exceptional. Voice acting is okay, not bad but could have been better, although as with the story it doesn't make a big difference.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this to fans of turn-based strategy, but not really to anyone else. It offers great tactial turn-based battles if you like that. If you don't there is probably not really anything in it for you.","February 2, 2014","true","37.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

Ultimately the units are expendable with only limited rewards for keeping them alive.  I spent the whole first campaign painstakingly choosing my units lives over timed quest rewards, which the rewards are valuable later while once the units maxed out, swap leveling up other units from the researve. Ultimately saving your units to me feels to no gain. The units max out very quickly at level 5. The heros contenue to grow and level, which makes it more appealing to use them for the slaughters. By the time you really finish the campaign, which seems to come after 10 missions or so you lose all of them to start a new campaign. In the end, you will have access to them in the alliance campaign again where all your surviving units and heroes will be of service again with all the artifacts you discovered.\n\nHoping they make a second game with more missions, more story, and more custom units with higher level caps.","September 25, 2014","true","40.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","0"

Each of the three factions has dozens of different units, upgrades, abilities, heros, and items to use, and the different terrain types and river crossings ensure that you will need to use all of these features to win.  What I really like here is that many different army compositions are viable and no units types feel superior; you must use everything you have to win.

Much nicer game graphics but lacking the beautiful artwork and musical score that made Fantasy General stand out for me.\nIn terms of the gameplay I would say this game is one of the most frustrating strategy games I have ever played.  The (unecessary) time contraints mean that I had to be constantly overextending which got me punished by the AI 9 times out of 10.  I probably spent more time reloading/restarting more than playing - I think the last mission of the Human campaign (I haven't bothered with the others) took me about 12 hours and 4 restarts.  I felt quite traumatized by the end.\nThe twists to the quests that occur at the end meant that thought I had finished the mission only to find I then had to unexpectedly get a particular hero to a specific location to win - this guy might be on the other side of the map depending on how I split my troops up at the start; so time to restart again...   Similarly if I place all my units down at the start I might suddenly find that I need to defend somewhere on the other side of the map and realize that I should have reserved some units for this and needed to restart.","September 29, 2014","false","39.2"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","8","21","0","0"
