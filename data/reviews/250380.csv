I loved it, but it made me angry, and I am sure it'll make you angry, too.\n\nMy girlfriend and I played this together, off and on for three days, trying to get the "good ending." Two things: One, it deliberately obfuscates its own systems. As in, learning the rules and dying in the process is part of the game. Two, it is about general tension and anxiety-- the atmosphere of absolute ick, not shock scares but pervasive questions about what you accept as real. It is a strangely gross-feeling game that manages to put you in a completely agitated state. Not terrified, not disgusted, not creeped out. Just agitated. To the extreme. You know, like an insomniac. Which is the point of the game. That skin-crawly, nothing-is-quite-right feeling. A world out of place.\n\n-IF- that kind of tension and weirdness appeals, and you think it might be a cool experience to live through/conquer/think about, this is an excellent game. But I also get the feeling it'll ♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off.

The game is not clear on what you must do or how you must do it. It's okay, many games do this and it's nice for us to discover on our own (Dark Souls). However I reached one of the last levels and it seems that if you do not proceed to the next level/room/dream/nightmare whatever you want to call it, you may be getting a "Game Over" screen the next time you will try to advance to the next level just like you normally would do.\n\nKnock Knock have a very creepy and depressive atmosphere. Seems to be a great game to play in the upcoming Halloween. You will always feel that you are surrounded by someone or something, yet, you feel alone at the same time.\n\nNow this is very clever: There are things that really help to create a tense mood in the game with such basic gameplay elements. Let's say something is approaching you. You hide but you are still visible. It's okay, because it does not matter if they can see you since it's you that can't see them, because, if you see them/it then it means they are real and if you believe they are real, then you must be hallucinating meaning you are losing it.\n\nThe game have more than one way to end, or to not end at all, in fact. Depending on some actions across the game, when you proceed further a larger enemy may be something for you and a very different one for me.\n\nImmersion tip: In this game the sound of doors opening and closing are quite regular. If you have a sound system with a Subwoofer, placing the Sub below your desk near one of the corners gives you a much more real feeling that something or someone is really knocking a door in your house. This adds to the atmosphere giving you a more intensifying experience especially when everything is silenced and then "BAM!", someone shuts a door, and you feel the vibration.\n\nIn my opinion you don't get those jump scares we sometimes see (faked or not) on Youtube videos from games like Amnesia. In this game instead of "AAAH, Oh my God & Buddha, that is scary!!!" I got something more of: "That is creepy... go away, please, I don't want to look :( Just... leave me alone... :( " and that, is really rare in a game.\n","June 6, 2014","true","6.6"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","53","59","0","0"

In this game you must figure out all by yourself how to play it to revel in its entirety. There are general rules told imperceptibly but each one of them has sides it takes time and retries to grasp. Knock-Knock is frustrating, hard and irritating at times, but it remains captivatingly horrifying all through the end. Lend it your ears, pay attention and believe in what you see or decide not to — control the outcome with the help of your senses.\n\nWith ingenious intended glitches like those from Anodyne, beautifully drawn visual style similar to Don't Starve's and cunning survival horror mechanics which really do improve the genre. Knock-Knock, despite not being the same game it was intended originally, is still a "phenomenon" which you absolutely should observe.","October 14, 2013","true","22.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

From there it's up to you to figure out the rest. You have six days and nights to adjust and learn, and then from there the game really begins. The time limit is pretty strict, so if you haven't figured out what you're doing by then, don't expect to survive. I barely managed on my first time with just a teensy bit of time left. Overall that stress of time and all the things out and inside your home coming after you is something that sticks with you for quite a while. Though the game does begin dull, once things speed up it truly feels like a game and all those horrifying things out there become all the more horrifying. I'd rather not say much since there are some great ideas in place and it's better to experience them for yourself than not. That's what the first six nights are for after all, just experimenting and figuring out the most effecient way of doing things.\n\nThere are flaws though, this game is heavy on RNG. Though skill can help you through most of what you're trying to accomplish, exploring the forest on a time limit is a bit much since there's no easy way to find your way home again rather than just go forwards and hope for the best. There's no guarentee that you'll figure out just what you're supposed to be doing out there without a hint or two either, though thankfully there are enough hints to make people explore the forest at least once or twice early on. Even worse, once you enter the night phases, enemies can and will spawn near you and remain there for long periods, often trapping you in a corner. Or worse, a roaming enemy will follow with it. Touching a solitary enemy is a minor time loss while touching a roamer will set you back a massive amount, but even a minor time loss is a lot here. The game's pretty well designed however and you figure out just what you should be doing before long, though there's little room for error so a few hints are always welcome.\n\nSo yeah, Knock-knock surprises though you need to give it a bit of time to shine and be patient through the less enjoyable segments. Not recommended for those who are effected by surrealistic imagry as half of this game's horror is based on that with the other half being existence and dementia based. If you think you can take it, pick it up.","July 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","1"

Knock-knock does that in the opening splash screen, and if anyone besides Ice-pick Lodge made it, I probably would have taken a pass on it. But the creators of Pathologic and The Void know what they're doing on that front, and the result is an intriguing little journey that definitely has its moments.\n\nYou take on the role of the Lodger, a wired little fellow that looks like Calvin ditched Hobbes and took up meth. Something odd is afoot in his isolated home in the woods, and if I get any more specific than that I'm bound to spoil something. Much like all of Ice-pick's games, the actual game is figuring out the rules of the game. You can turn lights in the house on and off, hide behind furniture, force open doors, and advance time with a strangely narcissistic clock. Ostensibly your goal is to survive until morning, but the house and its... inhabitants are randomized every other day, and on the other days you spend a chunk of it in the woods. Even the goals themselves get muddled as you progress, and the game is not afraid of throwing entirely new mechanics at you a few hours in.\n\nOnce you understand the pattern to the game, it can admittedly get pretty repetitive. New challenges are introduced the further into the game you get, but the core gameplay of lighting up rooms and wandering the woods does not change. One thing it does do well is introduce new threats over time, and some of them are absolutely terrifying despite the almost cartoony presentation. Information on the story comes from many different places, including the Lodger's diary, notes between days, and the Lodger himself, who talks in a charming nonsense Sims language. Most of the way through the game I'm still unclear on much of the rules and plot, but I admit it's fulfilled its original promise of "interactive meditation" and kept my attention. Definitely worth a look if you are at all curious, but be prepared for the mystery and horror to carry some rather bland gameplay.","October 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","23","26","4","0"

I really enjoyed it in the early going, and had some real moments of fear. But it's crippled by a few absolutely awful design choices.  There are a number of game mechanics that are completely confusing and almost entirely unexplained, except through cryptic notes you find during your exploration of the house.  That's not great, but it's hardly a deal-breaker.\n\nWhat is a deal-breaker?  I made it all the way to the end, only to find out I could not finish the game because I apparently missed something *somewhere* during my playthrough.  What it was and where I missed it, who knows?  I'm just trapped repeating the last section.  And there is no real save feature, so in order to actually complete the thing, I'd have to start from the beginning and do it all over again.  Since the gameplay itself is fairly repetitive, and is only bolstered by some of the mysterious story elements, that is not a very enticing prospect.  Because of this utterly frustrating and aggravating state of affairs, I say stay away from it.","November 1, 2014","false","4.0"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","38","58","0","0"

According to the game one should play at night in the dark, alone (and most likely with headphones on).\n\nThe biggest Steam complaints I found in the reviews was this game was repetitive and frustrating.  What RPG game, for example, Dark Souls, is not repetitive and frustrating, and just because Knock Knock has no blood splatter and gut spillage that does not mean one does not die.  Which happens more often then one is lead to believe.  (When one dies, it is done without fanfare.)  This of course leads to the entire campaign having to be redone from the beginning which is both frustrating and repetitive just like in Dark Souls (and screaming at the computer scene in utter frustration can occur).  Another comparison to be noted between the two is where as the player collects souls in Dark Souls, in Knock Knock the player collects time.  Each campaign though not timed until the much later levels is timed based.  The player must collect time to reach the dawn of the day either by surviving the night hours by watching the slow moving clock or finding a "clock" which speds up time (found only by turning on lights and remembering).  Running into the monsterous "guests" (some of whom will hunt the player down), let into the house through breaches of the dimensional fabric (which need to be closed or can be walked through) will lose the player time or their life. This whole game is one way, no level can be repeated, only the entire game once an ending is reached.\n\nLike The Stanley Parable this game gives the player no real clue as to the "rules" of play, what the game is about, the purpose of the character and his task or why the player should even be playing.  The narrative and storyline are told through the main character, known as The Lodger (though this is not mentioned in game) and later through diary pages.  The Lodger's actual job is world-ology and logging the changes around him.  Unfortunately, he is being kept awake at night, and part of his "job" is simply to keep the house.  To do this he turns on the lights during early hours of the morning and remembers the room contents.  This is not an easy task since the guests break lights and dimensional breaches occur.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is like Amensia: The Dark Descent, yet another game where the player has no clue about what is going on or even how to play.  As the player discovers each piece of the storyline this only ramps up the psychological anxiety and terror levels.  Also the physical horror found of Amensia: The Dark Descent is just as mystifying and just as terrifying as those monsterous 'guests' found in Knock Knock.  Though the nightmares of Knock Knock move slowly they are just as relentless in their pursuit and they talk to the player as they play hide and seek.  Fortunately they are easier to keep track of.  Running and hiding are always the preferred options, and playing hide and seek with them is an intrical part of the game.\n\nGameplay:  In Knock Knock there are three distinct play areas: the house, the forest, and the "eye" house levels.  I also suggest playing with a controller over a keyboard but the choice of course is yours.  RT I do believe gives an overview of the house and its lay out.  The house randomly changes size and layout and gets bigger the further into the game one progresses.  This is a great way to find and keep track of certain "guests" since one can see them, almost.  Also like Amnesia: The Dark Descent there is a "sanity" meter which comes into play during the timed levels.  Once this meter shows up as a lightening bolt across the top of the screen, the player only has until it runs out to finish the rest of the game levels or the player get the super bad ending "GAME OVER" with no resolution and the character becoming quite insane.\n\nDuring the house play area the goal is to find the clock and start it.  This starts time which has stopped and the player needs time to move so the dawn will come.  Once the clock starts the house door opens letting in "guests" and allowing the player to leave.  The entire point of this level is to start the clock and leave the house.  (Turning on lights is optional, I discovered.  Lights on makes the character move faster but takes up much needed time during the later timed levels.)  In the beginning I suggest taking the time to turn on the lights and remember the rooms contents.  Remembering the room contents means one has a place to hide when one needs to.  In the later timed levels start the clock and leave the house as quickly as possible. (I suggest not even turning on the lights just leave.  Do not wait for the clock or dawn.  Just leave and move on.)\n\nThe forest: There are four horizontal paths is the forest which can be stepped between vertically.  Making it through the forest as fast as possible comes in handy during the late game time levels.  Only during these particular timed levels will stationary "guests" show up.  Do not touch them for they steal much needed time.  Also in the forest the player will find the girl, who possesses reality fragments. (Ignore during the timed levels.)  Approaching the girl is tricky business, the player needs to be directly opposite her and have the character facing her.  Even then it is still tricky business.  Reality fragments are needed for the "Good" ending, the more the better.  There are a total of 8.  Each forest level yields only 1 reality fragment from the girl.\n\nThe "eye" house: Utter frustration, especially during the timed levels and will make or break getting the "Bad" ending.  The eye on the map is the house where one encounters breaches and monsterous "guests".  Late in the game one also encounters the "weeping one" which gives diary pages and/or steals time.  When playing the timed levels for the "Bad" ending I suggest ignoring the "weeping one".  The house on this level gets bigger and bigger with more rooms and a harder path to follow to the front door.  This is the place where the game of hide and seek is played in earnest so turning on lights and remembering gives the player places to hide as the clock ticks toward dawn.  One can not leave this house until dawn when the clock is full of time.\n\nIn this "eye" house is where the dimensional breaches occur letting in the "guests".  Try to get to a breach before it opens if possible.  Closing a breach costs time, but does not allow even more "guests" in.  There are moving guests who hunt the player down, and stationary guests who steal time and throw one out of the room if one turns the light on if they are in the room.  Running into one also steals time.  The player can also go through a breach into endless halls (I found three different ones).  According to one guide 2 reality fragments can be found in these breaches per "eye" house level.\n\nBasically this game must be played twice, once for the "Good" ending which I suggest doing first since it will take all the player's skill and understanding of how the game works to make it through the timed levels to get to the "Bad" ending.\n\nI recommend this game to those that want a challenging "horror" game (I would call this Horror-Lite) that has no blood, guts, torture or screaming.  Hope one can play Hide and Seek well.","May 2","true","21.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The main point of the game - survival. But that point isn't fascinating, as the means to achieve it.\n\nThe story tells us about the Lodger - a withdrawn person, recluse, who lives in the forest. There is only the forest, surrounding the house, but it isn't so creepy as the residence of the protagonist. Strange things happen here: things get lost, heard extraneous steps, someone knocking at the door...\n\nGameplay is limited in inclusion of lightbulbs in rooms, playing with somedoby invisible "Hide-and-seek" from an unknown entity, and solving the riddles.

My first and last advice for this game is to listen to the advice of the developers: all you need for playing is solitude and dark, qiute place.","November 29, 2013","true","3.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

If you do something wrong, the game will penalize you the same way every other game does, by forcing you restart a section.\n\nWhat you do in it is avoid ghosts as you go from room to room fixing lights hoping something useful will appear. You win the level after a few minutes elapse. Getting caught by a ghost or hiding from them will force you to wait longer. You may also find a clock that makes time go faster, so you'll have to wait less. The word wait is essential to this game and that may give you a clue of how much fun it is.\n\nThe rules are unclear, which is fine, even welcomed, but in the first thirty minutes or so you'll understand them.\n\nThe real problem, however, is that enemies may spawn on top of you as you're climbing down a ladder. They may appear with no warning from a door as you're busy opening it. It seems they're programmed to spawn randomly, with no regards to the player's current position. More than once an enemy appeared blocking the only exit, and I had no choice but to be caught. There is some (very little) strategy involved in winning, but it's offset by randomness.\n\nIf you're unlucky, you'll have to redo the level. That'd be okay if the core gameplay wasn't repetitive and mechanic. All you do is go from room to room, hold X for a few seconds to fix the light. Then, you may or may not get the choice to wait a few seconds to see if an object appears.\n\nThat's it. Most of what you do to progress involves waiting or holding a button for a few seconds. You may also choose to take risks and go to an area where a ghost may be in, but at a certain point you'll have nothing else to do but to venture into these areas and hope a ghost doesn't spawn on your face.\n\nYou may also force ghosts to disappear, or objects to appear, by leaving and entering a floor/room repeatedly. Which isn't engaging at all and just feels like you're abusing the game. You can also choose to do everything really slowly and remain in safe areas for as long as you want to wait for the time to pass.\n\nOften you'll see unusual things that you don't fully comprehend, and if you try to interact with them you'll be forced to restart a level. For an instance, you'll see an eye on the wall, the game will tell you how to interact with it. If you do, you'll be taken to a place where all you do is walk, then you'll have to restart the level.\n\nThen there's another section to the game where all you do is fix all the lights and walk in a forest, there's no risk involved in any of it, no challenge either. Once again, that'd be fine. I like walking simulators, I like weird games. But the section just keeps repeating itself.","June 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","0"

I'm not quite sure how to describe it... it certainly is surreal, abstract, spooky, and different, and unlike many horror games (especially the popular ones...), Knock-Knock's scares don't really come from it's jumpscares (despite the jumpscares being startling as well), but rather, it's ambience and the overall feeling of... dread and helplessness. Knock-Knock doesn't use blood and gore as nightmare fuel. Rather, it takes advantage of your own confusion, with almost unreliable tips from the protagonist (the Lodger), and many enemies that look and behave differently. I don't recommend this game to those who expect total guidance from the video games they play, nor do I recommend it to people who get frustrated from confusion, but I instead recommend Knock-Knock to those who are getting bored of jumpscare-fests and gore, for Knock-Knock's scare factor comes from it's subtlety and psychological absurdity. Even if the game isn't the scariest one around, it's worth it for it's unique presentation.","October 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Compelling.  Confusing.  Cute.  One of the most unusual, original, and hard-to-get-yer-noggin-around games I've ever played.  Even once you complete it, many a question remains, such as:  Why does your bleary-eyed scientist character speak in what I assume to be Russian (since that's apparently the origin of the game designers), while the ghosties who haunt him speak in English?  Why is his voice so high-pitched and squeaky, when he appears to be a grown man (albiet one with a face like an angry cherub)?  And what the ♥♥♥♥ is the deal with that endless corridor you keep finding yourself in, which seems to have no purpose other than to send you all the way back to the beginning of the chapter?!\n\nBut by all means, if you're in the market for a game which doesn't seek to comfort you (in a psychological sense) or hand-hold you (in a gaming/mechanical sense), then this is one well worth picking up.  Just make sure you're in the mood for a little insomnia of your own, as the aforementioned "cute"-ness is a Trojan horse and a half.  Prepare to be suitably mind-♥♥♥♥ed, boys and girls...oh, and speaking of which, if you google anything about the ending - or should I say, various "endings" - you'll see a mighty ♥♥♥♥-storm of controversy this subject has whipped up.  I won't go into it here, but suffice it to say there's been some "design" decisions made by the lovely folks at Ice-Pick which won't exactly go down well with everyone.  It certainly ♥♥♥♥ed me the first time I played, but I still enjoyed the game enough to just jump straight back in, and managed to get the "good" ending the second time through.  So there ARE rewards - including one of the oddest end credit sequences I've ever encountered - but man oh man, you have gots to EARN them!

Your protagonist and antagonists are both unreliable and only tell half-truths at best.\n\nDo you like poltergiests?  Hauntings?  Faeries?  Strange happenings?  And almost no hand-holding?  Are you willing to put up with the poor design choice of including areas that seem to stretch forever with nothing happening?  Do you want to have to figure out almost everything for yourself?\n\nDo you like really weird games?  Are you OK with a game that auto-saves and will let you screw yourself over if you're not careful and rewards exploration and experimentation in the end?\n\nIf you said "Yes" to most of these questions, then you might enjoy Knock-Knock, a game of hide-and-seek with yourself.  Its lore is of a classic faerie tale mixed with things that go bump (well, knock) in the night.  This game isn't for everyone, with slow pacing and repetitive gameplay that's saved by having a randomly generated level design and creatures with unpredictable behaviour.\n\nHowever if you're impatient, or uninterested in some really old supernatural experiences, you might want to give this a miss.  It's more an interesting game than what I would call a 'great game' -- but for me, the interesting elements far outweighed the simple game play.","November 3, 2014","true","7.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Anyway, think this more as a psychological experience rather than a game. Why, you may ask.\n\nThe gameplay of this indie title consist in a sort of "Hide and seek" game: You play as a man, that you will identify as "The Lodger", who wakes at nightime to check who is knocking at the front door of his house, that he calls "The Lodge". Eh.\nThe game alternates some awake phases, where you have to look for a child figure out of your house, and others dream phases, where you have to remain sane and try to ignore (mostly) the anomalies you may encounter in your house, until the dawn will clear any trace of what might have happened (or entered) to your house.\n\nOh, i didn't warned you that this game, as psychological is it, don't have a really precise storyline, but may have even different stories based on what the player may think while playing: for example, are the ghosts real or just appearances of the Lodger itself, and lot more to explain with the player's conscience, as we don't get a real explanation about what is actually happening during the game.\n\nSo from now of this review i will explain my point of view of the story in this game, up to you to read or not. These thoughts may also contain serious spoils of the game, so better read this after you've played the game by yourself.\n\nWell, the story's about a man, who calls himself the "Lodger", whom lives alone in a house surrounded only by trees.\nHe usually states to be a "world-ologist", writing everything he sees in his diary, given to him from his father when he was learning to write, who told him that he would write his entire life in that diary and, with it's last page, his life would end;\nListened to these words, the Lodger had by that time the habit to write very little and small, so that he could have more pages for his next experiences, and also a longer life. But what he didn't expected is that he were only trying to slow his "vital clock", as in the game our goal in the survival phase is to have enough time spent to reach in order the next day, and this particular habit gave him some kind of feedbacks in his mind.\nThe Lodger doesn't even remember the rooms in his house, and often states to be scared by what swarms to the outside, because he don't really know what there's really outside.\nThe fragments of reality and the child are connected and may represent the curiosity of the character, while the monsters that wander the Lodger's house, along with the big monster you encounter when ignoring the "curiosity" of your character during the game, may represent the much stronger side of our protagonist, which is the fear of what he still don't know, of what he never tried to find a meaning of, and is somewhat explained in the experiences we can find in his diary, if we look clearly.\n\nAs a final review of this, i would say again that this isn't to be considered something like "a game" that you often get to have some fun, but more like "an experience" you can consider either good or bad, deep or superficial, clear or confused.","November 14, 2014","true","12.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Prefer if it went back to the start of the demon showing up...\n\nBeyond that, it's a good game to play in the dark (best experience too). There seems to be some sort of mystery of what's happening to the guy, but I haven't beaten the game yet to find out.\n\nThe concept of Hide and Seek is interesting though in this game. There are certain rules to follow and you are often given forshadowing signs of what to do. Once you understand it'll be a breeze.\n\nControls are simple and basic. I had issues with video quaility at first, but after messing with settings I got it to work properly. (If I couldn't get it fixed on my end I would've requested a refeund as the quality I was getting was bothering me and ruining the immersion).\n\nEventually the gameplay does get tedious with nothing new to add or offer after awhile. The difficult shifts constantly though: may get lucky in one level but be stuck in another for several attempts.\n\nI have no other issues with this game.

Sure the basic controls are outlined, but past that, the greater set of rules by which the game functions are left for the player to guess at. And with only suspicions to rely on, the player is forced into a sort of paranoia, their behavior being defined by the fear of what may happen if they don't act on their suspicions. The story operates in the same way. There's no certainty. Any piece of information could be the result of an insomnia-addled mind, as the protagonist himself points out. Nothing can be trusted and the threads that would connect the hints that are given, however unreliable, are notably absent. But then, explanations must be brief as blank space is precious. The result is vagueness; full of potential, but ultimately unresolved.","March 18","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Instead, it's a hearty chunk of middle with allusions to a beginning and suggestions that it might end.  It's definitely an experience game, and if you go in expecting anything else, you'll be disappointed.  The thing is, it's a damn' fine experience game.\n\nThe primary complaint about Knock-Knock is that there isn't enough explanation as to what's going on.  Personally, I found that to be the most interesting part of the experience.  The game plays like a simulator of severe OCD, with the Lodger slavishly serving rules that make sense only to his magical thinking to keep monsters at bay.  Rather than lay down absolutes on whether there's something supernatural going on or if the Lodger's paranoid delusions are worsening, the waters are further muddied by each revelation we get.  By playing strange games, has the Lodger invoked dark spirits, or has he simply convinced himself they're there?  Are the abstract and frightening "reality fragments" the true shape of a changed world, or a chemical stew eating away at the Lodger's brain?  Are the diary pages a revelation of past events, or a story the Lodger wrote and forgot about?  We're never 100% sure, and to me, that's true fear--the constant questioning of reality with no answer to be found, and how easily our perception can be warped into believing our own nightmares.\n\nKnock-Knock is short, it's true, but I've never found that to be a bad thing in a game.  Games used to be long because they were routinely $60 and people wanted to feel like that investment was well-spent, and they were often falsely extended with difficulty or bloated with filler because of it.  Indie gaming has allowed for a full experience in a few hours for less money, and with less time to play as an adult than as a kid, I'm over the moon about that.  If that IS a moon up there...\n\ntl;dr: If you go in expecting a grand mystery to explore every detail of, you'll be disappointed.  If you go in expecting to explore the claustrophobic paranoia of one man and his skewed perceptions, and maybe to question your own reality, you're in for a good time.\n\nONE CAVEAT: The other primary complaint about Knock-Knock is that it's next to impossible to get an actual ending on the first time through without a guide, and this is completely valid.  You'll most likely end up with an abridged "Game Over" and the "Continue" option doesn't put you back far enough to fix it.  Ice Pick Lodge, for the love of God, PLEASE put a checkpoint in before the last levels.  This is a fixable design flaw!  Until it is fixed, though, know that if you see the bright crack at the top of the screen in the last levels run out, it's time to exit the game and restart--if it runs out and you finish, you won't get a real ending.  As much as the endings aren't the point, it's a pain in the ♥♥♥, so keep an eye on that bar.","December 18, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most of the time you'll be wandering blindly through darkness flicking on lights while hoping there isn't a monster inside with you planning to strike the second you turn it on. It's that split second of fear you get after waking up from a nightmare where you hesitate turning on the light because you think you feel eyes on you, drawn out for hours.\n\nThe story takes a few playthroughs and thought to completely understand everything that's going on, but spoiler-free the bare bones of it is you are a scientist waking up in the middle of the night to strange sounds coming from inside you house. Your goal is Amnesia-like in similarity to the fact all you have to do is stay alive until morning and hide from the monsters in your home.\n\nGameplay is simple: avoid monsters, hide, and turn on (or off) lights to lure creatures to specific rooms in your M.C. Escher layout of a home complete with dead-ends, and turn on special clocks to "move time forward" so you can live to see the sun.","August 4, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Is it a survival horror with predominantly hide-and-seek mechanics? Is it an obtuse indie puzzle game based around survival, horror, time and avoidance strategies with a hauntingly surreal and bizarre atmosphere?\n\nI believe this is one of the few games i have played - and i have played many dear reader of this review - which transcends categories and works on a more abstract artisitic approach. I have been completely terrified while playing this game in the dark; dumbfounded and confused by the claustrophobia and wretchness of the night and how time  -  and this is all about time - personified by the imagery of clocks which wind forward and at times backwards if- consumed by the creepy and unnerving monsters - to the end of the night and to the comfort of sleep only if you can let in the horror with all the knock-knocking.\n\nThe art design of the game is incredible with fantastically sharp tones and well desinged monsters. The sound is of such a great quality with bold, piercing screams and loud bangs which will shred your nerves.\n\nI did feel that the developers were teasing at times with all of the waiting and a particularly unforseen ending but i love that as i prefer being confused as opposed to molly coddled by a big AAA game.\n\nThis game is very unhinged, bold and outthere.

I'm back in my room trying to get out again. That's this game, only I'm sort of like a punked-out Chucky doll in a nightgown and my house is way tidier than it is in real life.\n\nTo be fair, I haven't beaten it yet, but I intend to when I can give it my full attention. This game *deserves* my full attention. The sound effects are nice n' creepy, the locations and characters are beautifully drawn, and I'm really digging the plot. The Lodger is appropriately self-aware, and there's something about the twisted Simlish that he speaks in that reminds me of the narration at the beginning of Lars VonTrier's "Riget". I like the mechanic of going into the rooms and waiting for the furniture to fade into view -- it may be repetitive, but that just adds to the dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nThis is not an action game. This is not full of adrenaline-boosting jump-scares. This is for when you have insomnia, and need something to make you feel like falling asleep ever again would be a bad idea.

The ghosts that chase after you are pretty horrendous and the bed that would follow you at one point was actually startling cause I couldn't tell if it was good or bad, Next your concious I didn't get anything bout that, it seems like whenever you just stand around your concious will come out and attack you but when your moving around turning on lights it will help you which is very intrigues me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanchito/recommended/250380/","zanchito","Zanchito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanchito/","303 products in account","This is an Ice-Pick Lodge (them of The Void and Pathologic) game through and through, for good and for worse. If you've tried any of their previous games and enjoyed them, you'll like this one. If you've never played their games, things get a little more complicated. Let me explain:\n\nI've been playing the game for 4 hours, and I can only say 2 things for certain about it:\n1) Wha...?\n2) This is russian as ♥♥♥♥. (yeah, the f word is required).\n\nThe game is rather simple, or so it seems: you're in a house and you fix lights around the rooms. Kinda like one of those LCD games in the 80's, except with a look not unlike what Tim Burton's really evil twin would draw (the art and sound in the game are simple, but very amazingly unsettling and well done). It's not long into the game until you start noticing things are not so straightforward as they seem. And not long after that when you start double guessing the game. And then triple guessing.\n\nIt's a game not about lights, but about discovering the actual rules of the game world. It has an eerie mythology well delivered, dreamy, oppressive and omnipresent, but still just drip fed to you, making you fill in the gaps and take risks in your interpretation of what's actually going on and what you should do about it. This is a game for detectives, not of the pixel hunt adventure type, but of the old Lovecraftian type.\n\nIf you are going to try the game, you have to be okay with not being told everything (actually, you're told very little and you have to guess, test and learn very much). It's a game about gut feeling as much as logic, about trial and error, except getting things right is not always what you really need, and getting things wrong ... Well, I don't know about that, because a few hours in I'm starting to fourth-guess the game.\n\nIf you're curious, you like powerful art, if you like mythologies and ambience, or if you like thinking about systems and finding out how things work with no help at all, give it a try at a reduced price. If you're a fan of Ice-Pick as I am, get it and support them, you'll not be disappointed.\n\nJust remember: this game is russian as ♥♥♥♥. You (YOU the player) are not a hero. You are just a helpless nutshell floating in a sea of doubt in the middle of the thunderstorm of the story. Only it's reaining ghost forest monsters from another dimension. Or maybe from your inconscious mind. Or maybe it's a second personality of yours. Or something. Be okay with feeling like that and you'll love the game.\n\n","November 29, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

I liked the style, atmosphere and weirdness. What I didn't like is the gameplay itself, it's glitchy and tedious. My main gripe is that they included a timer in the game and if you take too long exploring the sights or getting caught mid-game you'll be locked into an unavoidable game over later in the game, unable to finish, forcing you to start from the beginning. This could be a bug but they did a similar design with The Void. Because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move I can't really recommend this title.

Let’s get cracking.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nKnock-knock is a indie survival horror game from the twisted minds of Ice-pick Lodge. The player takes on the role of the “Lodger”, the current resident of an unusual house deep in the woods. Lately, the Lodger has been noticing strange things happening; not only in his home, but in the forest surrounding it as well. Things have gone missing, odd noises are heard throughout the house, and something unnatural is coming out of the woods. And, when night falls, it seems as though someone (or something) else is sharing the dark corners of the house with you.\n\nThe goal is to stay awake (and sane) until the dawn breaks. The Lodger must wander the rooms of his home by night, evading the unknown and the invisible, all while counting the seconds until the sun will rise. Only during the night can the Lodger solve the puzzle of what’s really going on. Are the “Guests” really there or is he slipping steadily into madness? What has happened to the forest? What has happened to his home? Where can he draw the line between reality and imagination? With multiple possible endings, Knock-knock is a breath of fresh air when it comes to survival horror.\n\nII – UI [9/10]\n\nThe user interface is incredibly minimal. There is no real HUD, other than a slight outline in front of certain objects which you can use to hide behind. This did wonders for the immersion level of the game and really helped maintain a spooky atmosphere throughout the story.\n\nHowever, at a certain point in the game, the game itself becomes timed and a white crack appears at the top of the screen. In some sequences, this white crack can be seen at all times and does tend to take away from the experience as a whole, if only a small amount.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThe gameplay in Knock-knock felt incredibly unique. While the controls were simple (on K&M or gamepad) the game itself can quickly become intense and you’ll find yourself wishing you could sprint. As I mentioned above, the goal of the game is to survive each night in the house while maintaining your sanity. This can be done in a variety of ways and (assuming you play the game at some point) you’ll no doubt decide on a strategy which you deem to be best.\n\nEvery room you enter will need to have the light source repaired to turn back on. This takes a small amount of time to accomplish, so you must be vigilant in observing your surroundings. Once the light is repaired, the Lodger may or may not close his eyes briefly. If his eyes close, he is adjusting to the light meaning that there is furniture in the room. Some rooms may allow you to do this more than once, to reveal even more decor inside. Repairing lights is also the only way to seal a “Breach” before some apparition from your nightmares manifests in the house with you.\n\nYou can’t reach every breach in enough time to seal it off, so, at some point, you will be dealing with some scary ghouls. You can deal with these guests in a number of ways. Your first option is to hide behind things when they enter a room with you. Your hiding spot may or may not fool them. Assuming it does fool them, they will leave the room and begin to wander off. If it doesn’t fool them, you’ll take a hit to your time meter and lose some time. If that clock goes all the way back, you go insane and repeat the night. (It is also important to note, that time goes backwards ever so slowly while the Lodger is hiding too.)\n\nAnother way you can deal with the guests is to evade them, though this can prove difficult in many cases. Certain guests can appear suddenly and block off doorways. While you can move through them, you’ll take a hit on your time meter. Also, if you turn a light on in a room inhabited by a guest, you’ll take a hit. Some guests are even impossible to hide from, like The Invisible One. The key to successful evasion is to learn all you can about the guests; how the move, what they sound like, what the best way to deal with them is, etc.\n\nIV – Content [9/10]\n\nContent-wise, there isn’t a whole lot to Knock-knock and there didn’t need to be. There are a delightfully horrifying amount of different Guests that will come and haunt you during the nights. There are even a number of interesting bits of furniture that you can hide behind when said guests come calling.\n\nThe one thing I do wish had been implemented, however, is some sort of upgrade system for the Lodger. Perhaps a skill-tree of sorts that would let you upgrade your movement speed, hiding efficiency, time it takes to repair lights/open doors, etc.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nThe graphics of Knock-knock are simply brilliant. Everything is hand-drawn and absolutely eerie. While the Lodger is a bit of an odd duck, his house and the forest around are wonderful. Not to mention the legion of spooks that are crawling around with you at night. It’s all very visually unsettling at times and I wouldn’t want it any other way.\n\nVI – Audio [9/10]\n\nThe music of Knock-knock is great. I got this one off of Humble Bundle and (much to my pleasant surprise) it included the official soundtrack for the game. The sound effects are equally well done, with a few exceptions. One or two of the guests seemed to be overly loud and they make noise constantly until they are encountered by the Lodger and then leave the house. Other than that, no complaints here.\n\nVII – Overall [9.5/10]\n\nOverall, Knock-knock is an extremely fun game and a great addition to the survival horror genre. This one is best to be played alone and in the dark if you want the full experience of it. At full price or not, this is a solid game and a great purchase.","December 1, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You slowly learn the rules by gathering notes from your diary, and if you get lucky you might actually figure everything out in time. If you don't, the game will unceremoniously lock you into a fail state, and you will have to start over.\n\nWhen I failed on my first attempt (about 5 hours in) I seriously pondered giving up. The game is very random, and sometimes the odds are just stacked against you. Ghosts appear in rooms too far away for you to reach in time, you end up getting pincered, or a door just locks in front of you, creating an artificial dead end. Certain events also tend to interrupt you while fixing the lights. Oftentimes you will be fixing the lights in a haunted room, and some random event occurs that cancels all your progress. It's all very unforgiving, and sometimes it feels kind of unfair.\n\nThe worst part, however, is the time limit. At about the halfway point of the game, a timer starts ticking down. If you don't complete the game in time you fail, and it makes you start over. It's kind of horrible.\n\nI have recently started my second run, and it's a lot easier now that I know what to expect. I could have done without having to start the entire game over, though. That felt really unnecessary. Maybe they should have put a checkpoint at the halfway point so I could get back to the part I actually failed at.\n\nThat being said, Knock-knock's core gameplay still remains fun and challenging. The whole game is a bit of a diamond in the rough, just like all of Ice-Pick Lodge's games. If you take your time with it, and avoid getting too worked up about it, it's certainly worth playing.\n\nEdit: So, I finished the game, and basically had to savescum my way through the last three stages or I would have run out of time. Again. The game is really way too random.","August 3, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I love the hell out of it.\n\nIn the game, you play the role of the Lodger, a mumbling, bed-headed insomniac trying to protect his family's home from being overrun by malicious visitors. There's more going on to the story and who the Lodger is, but to avoid spoilers, I will say that you will have to dig deeper and listen to the Lodger and the clues you find to get a better understanding of what's going on.\n\nThe game mostly consists of walking through your house, turning on lights and hiding from the visitors until dawn breaks. This is not a fighting game, and you have no weapon besides the candle in your hand, the lights above you and the places where you can hide. You also try to uncover the truth about the forest that the house is in and what happened in the Lodger's past, collecting bits and fragments of the story as the game progresses.\n\nThe art style is gorgeous. It almost seems like early Tim Burton animation, and it helps to create a wonderfully creepy atmosphere.\n\nThe mechanics are akin to stealth titles, with hiding and preventing your enemies from coming into your house being paramount. Not a lot is explained with the mechanics, though, so you will probably spend a good amount of your time figuring out what you should do. Those who do not like experimentation in games would not enjoy this game.\n\nThe Lodger has a tendency to stop and speak often, temporarily pausing the game as he mutters clues about who he is and what he remembers or gives hints on what you should do. I can see how his interruptions could get annoying for some players, but they never really bothered me.\n\nOne more sticking point I should mention: the game can get repetitive, although it's a good sort of repetitive, in my opinion. You have a timer marking when dawn will start during the "night" portions of the game, and as you go along, the time will draw closer. You can speed up time by activating clocks, and time is pushed back by hiding too long or being caught by a visitor. If you reach dawn, then you would have made it through the night; if you get caught and time goes all the way back, the map will restart, and you will be forced to start the night over. I can see how this could get really annoying to some players, but for me, it fit the Stealth layout of the game very well, and I was never truly bothered by it to the point where I wanted to turn the game off. It was a fitting punishment for my mistakes, I felt. Also, the game does get progressively more difficult, which helps to reduce the repetitiveness and add more challenge.\n\nIf you go in expecting a raw, terrifying horror experience akin to Amnesia, then you will be sadly disappointed. The "scares", if you can call them that, would quickly become repetitive and outstay their welcome in a horror game setting. However, I do not get the impression that Ice Pick Lodge wanted Knock-Knock to be a horror game; if I absolutely had to put a label on the genre, it would be "Surreal Stealth".\n\nUltimately, Knock-Knock is not for everyone, and I can see how people would not enjoy the "figure-it-out" layout of the gameplay and story and the repetiveness. However, I feel there are enough good things in the game (the art style, the mystery, the atmosphere) to warrant at least a try.\n\nMy verdict? 7 out of 10, and a recommendation lying somewhere between "Buy It Now", "Wait For a Sale" or "Try the Demo".","May 24, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It dealt a lot with the human mind and what isolation can do to a person.  The game was genuinely scary at some points (mostly a few jump scares when you turned around and ran into a monster for the first few times), but I considered the atmosphere more pleasantly spooky than terrifying.  I actually enjoyed getting home for the day and playing this game, in a way it was kind of comforting.  For some reason I could very much identify with the main character, and his insights via journal entries and dialogue did really strike a cord with me sometimes (but YMMV on that one).

I still don't understand some of the mechanics. I can only describe the type of horror as the kind you get when you're being chased by someone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndMore/recommended/250380/","AndMore","And More","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndMore/","93 products in account","At it's core Knock-Knock! is a creepy little game, about playing Hide-and-seek with ghosts. You slowly learn the rules by gathering notes from your diary, and if you get lucky you might actually figure everything out in time. If you don't, the game will unceremoniously lock you into a fail state, and you will have to start over.\n\nWhen I failed on my first attempt (about 5 hours in) I seriously pondered giving up. The game is very random, and sometimes the odds are just stacked against you. Ghosts appear in rooms too far away for you to reach in time, you end up getting pincered, or a door just locks in front of you, creating an artificial dead end. Certain events also tend to interrupt you while fixing the lights. Oftentimes you will be fixing the lights in a haunted room, and some random event occurs that cancels all your progress. It's all very unforgiving, and sometimes it feels kind of unfair.\n\nThe worst part, however, is the time limit. At about the halfway point of the game, a timer starts ticking down. If you don't complete the game in time you fail, and it makes you start over. It's kind of horrible.\n\nI have recently started my second run, and it's a lot easier now that I know what to expect. I could have done without having to start the entire game over, though. That felt really unnecessary. Maybe they should have put a checkpoint at the halfway point so I could get back to the part I actually failed at.\n\nThat being said, Knock-knock's core gameplay still remains fun and challenging. The whole game is a bit of a diamond in the rough, just like all of Ice-Pick Lodge's games. If you take your time with it, and avoid getting too worked up about it, it's certainly worth playing.\n\nEdit: So, I finished the game, and basically had to savescum my way through the last three stages or I would have run out of time. Again. The game is really way too random.","August 3, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/250380/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","Well, we had several people turn up on the stream for this one and, all in all, it was a creepy experience. Let’s get cracking.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nKnock-knock is a indie survival horror game from the twisted minds of Ice-pick Lodge. The player takes on the role of the “Lodger”, the current resident of an unusual house deep in the woods. Lately, the Lodger has been noticing strange things happening; not only in his home, but in the forest surrounding it as well. Things have gone missing, odd noises are heard throughout the house, and something unnatural is coming out of the woods. And, when night falls, it seems as though someone (or something) else is sharing the dark corners of the house with you.\n\nThe goal is to stay awake (and sane) until the dawn breaks. The Lodger must wander the rooms of his home by night, evading the unknown and the invisible, all while counting the seconds until the sun will rise. Only during the night can the Lodger solve the puzzle of what’s really going on. Are the “Guests” really there or is he slipping steadily into madness? What has happened to the forest? What has happened to his home? Where can he draw the line between reality and imagination? With multiple possible endings, Knock-knock is a breath of fresh air when it comes to survival horror.\n\nII – UI [9/10]\n\nThe user interface is incredibly minimal. There is no real HUD, other than a slight outline in front of certain objects which you can use to hide behind. This did wonders for the immersion level of the game and really helped maintain a spooky atmosphere throughout the story.\n\nHowever, at a certain point in the game, the game itself becomes timed and a white crack appears at the top of the screen. In some sequences, this white crack can be seen at all times and does tend to take away from the experience as a whole, if only a small amount.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThe gameplay in Knock-knock felt incredibly unique. While the controls were simple (on K&M or gamepad) the game itself can quickly become intense and you’ll find yourself wishing you could sprint. As I mentioned above, the goal of the game is to survive each night in the house while maintaining your sanity. This can be done in a variety of ways and (assuming you play the game at some point) you’ll no doubt decide on a strategy which you deem to be best.\n\nEvery room you enter will need to have the light source repaired to turn back on. This takes a small amount of time to accomplish, so you must be vigilant in observing your surroundings. Once the light is repaired, the Lodger may or may not close his eyes briefly. If his eyes close, he is adjusting to the light meaning that there is furniture in the room. Some rooms may allow you to do this more than once, to reveal even more decor inside. Repairing lights is also the only way to seal a “Breach” before some apparition from your nightmares manifests in the house with you.\n\nYou can’t reach every breach in enough time to seal it off, so, at some point, you will be dealing with some scary ghouls. You can deal with these guests in a number of ways. Your first option is to hide behind things when they enter a room with you. Your hiding spot may or may not fool them. Assuming it does fool them, they will leave the room and begin to wander off. If it doesn’t fool them, you’ll take a hit to your time meter and lose some time. If that clock goes all the way back, you go insane and repeat the night. (It is also important to note, that time goes backwards ever so slowly while the Lodger is hiding too.)\n\nAnother way you can deal with the guests is to evade them, though this can prove difficult in many cases. Certain guests can appear suddenly and block off doorways. While you can move through them, you’ll take a hit on your time meter. Also, if you turn a light on in a room inhabited by a guest, you’ll take a hit. Some guests are even impossible to hide from, like The Invisible One. The key to successful evasion is to learn all you can about the guests; how the move, what they sound like, what the best way to deal with them is, etc.\n\nIV – Content [9/10]\n\nContent-wise, there isn’t a whole lot to Knock-knock and there didn’t need to be. There are a delightfully horrifying amount of different Guests that will come and haunt you during the nights. There are even a number of interesting bits of furniture that you can hide behind when said guests come calling.\n\nThe one thing I do wish had been implemented, however, is some sort of upgrade system for the Lodger. Perhaps a skill-tree of sorts that would let you upgrade your movement speed, hiding efficiency, time it takes to repair lights/open doors, etc.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nThe graphics of Knock-knock are simply brilliant. Everything is hand-drawn and absolutely eerie. While the Lodger is a bit of an odd duck, his house and the forest around are wonderful. Not to mention the legion of spooks that are crawling around with you at night. It’s all very visually unsettling at times and I wouldn’t want it any other way.\n\nVI – Audio [9/10]\n\nThe music of Knock-knock is great. I got this one off of Humble Bundle and (much to my pleasant surprise) it included the official soundtrack for the game. The sound effects are equally well done, with a few exceptions. One or two of the guests seemed to be overly loud and they make noise constantly until they are encountered by the Lodger and then leave the house. Other than that, no complaints here.\n\nVII – Overall [9.5/10]\n\nOverall, Knock-knock is an extremely fun game and a great addition to the survival horror genre. This one is best to be played alone and in the dark if you want the full experience of it. At full price or not, this is a solid game and a great purchase.","December 1, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, the game is played in two rounds - the 'dream' round in which you explore the house and avoid monsters, and the 'dawn' round, where you explore the woods and try to find your way back home. Both rounds are very rich in story and atmosphere, which makes them fun to play, but the 'dawn' sections have a problem - your house does not always appear in the same place you found it the first time. There are good reasons not to enter the house immediately and take the time to explore the forest more, but doing so often leaves you stuck in a loop, constantly just walking around waiting for your house to reappear. This takes away from the frantic action of the 'dream' sections.\n\nThere are also some frustrating moments in the 'dream' section of the game. There are times when monsters spawn directly on top of your character, or else extremely close by, which of course makes them impossible to avoid. There are also times when, on the way to complete an objective, the game will lock you out of the adjoining room by turning it into a trap room. You can unlock the room, but doing so puts you in an endless corridor where there is a high chance of having to restart the level. Finally, there's no guarantee that hiding will save you from the monsters - there seems to be a high chance of them finding you regardless of where you choose to hide (although perhaps this is the game's way of telling you that some places are better for hiding than others).\n\nNone of these problems are game-breaking, however, and even with these frustrating moments Knock Knock is a really fun, scary game to play. The scares are actually really scary, but you quickly pick up on ways to avoid them so the game becomes more than a jump-scare generator. The player character is very relatable, and you quickly become immersed in their story. You can use different playstyles to complete the game, and there are plenty of collectables to keep replayability an option.\n\nOne last thing - it's very important that you keep the sound on. You'll see why.","March 14","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a while to realize that and I spent my first nights locked in my bedroom, puzzled out of my mind.\n\n[POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD] Basically, the goal of the game is to survive throught every night, filled with nightmares and monsters. If a monster touches you, time goes backward and you go back in time. The night is over when the clock does a 12h turn. You are a guy who is obsessed with hide and seek, you hear voices and you seem to be sure of the fact that if you imagine something strongly enough, it will appear in real life.... And sure enough, things do appear in your house, even if it's probably just in your head.\nThere are no concrete objectives, appart from finding the lost diary that your dad gave you a long time ago. (He apparently told you that when you'd run out of pages to write on, you would die. Either it really is some kind of magical diary, either your dad is an as*hole.) You will regularly find pages that will help you understand the background story.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't finish the game, because at some point and no matter what I tried, I died everytime I took a step outside the house. If that happens to you, you have to start the game all over from scratch, which sucks.\n\nThe atmosphere was nonetheless awesome and creepy, which is why I think you should try it out! Maybe you'll understand the game more than I did ^^","May 1","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you dont find/fix it, monsters will eventually kill you.You progress from night to night like this, switching houses frequently.\n\nThis game is weird, like very disturbing, the voices of the monsters are freaky, the knocks at the doors really make the tension go up, and having to deal with signs that obviously are warnings  (you hear a thnderclap, the camera zooms to an empty room in the house then comes back to you... does that show where the monster(s) is ?) but that you don't know how to answer to is an incredibly stressful thing.","May 20","true","1.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
