Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.\n\nEvery time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.\n\nThe user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.\n\nBarriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.\n\nAnd finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedReign/recommended/104200/","RedReign","Red Reign","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedReign/","118 products in account","Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently "pretty good," with occasional memorable moments.\n\nYou play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.\n\nWhile this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a little more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally, there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter. This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.\n\nAs a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.\n\nAt the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.","December 30, 2015","true","8.2"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","42","49","2","2"

Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.\n\nYou've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.\n\nAs of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.\n\nMy mark is 7.1/10.

Set in the 22nd Century (2100-2200) the BEEP Ship makes a big discovery and you have to travel around all the levels finishing them collecting as much anti-matter and nuggets as you can! The levels are laid out in an almost identical style to the Super Mario Bros. games, and are alot more simplistic, but personally, I prefer this. The colour work is great. It really matches the general game style. So as the setting goes, a 9/10.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is simple. WASD to move the BEEP, and Left-Mouse to shoot, Right-Mouse to reload. UP Arrow to jump, and when not hovering over your BEEP Bot, the Right-Mouse also allows you to use your Half-Life style Anti-Grav Gun to collect objects by reeling them in. This is a great way to pick up that Anti-Matter I mentioned earlier. The menus are also interactive, you can control little things on the title screen, and I know it's not part of the actual game, but these little things make a huge difference. And on the level selection screen, you fly around to your levels in your BEEP Ship which is quite fun. For gameplay, I also give this a 9/10.\n\nArtwork and SoundtracksThe Artwork as I have mentioned is bright, colourful and to the simplicity you'd expect from a platformer set in this kind of age. The Soundtracks are okay, but they are generally the same kind of thing all over again. I wouldn't rate that too highly in my view. But still, they are some good tracks. The layout makes you feel like you are really playing some kind of household title. It's almost perfect. For this, I say 7.5/10\n\nOverviewSo what do I think overall? The Setting. Near perfect, and layed out beautifully. The Story is great. The artwork ties it all together but I do think the Soundtracks could do with some work as you have to listen to them all the time and when they are all roughly the same it becomes tedious. Overall, BEEP gets a 8.5/10 for me. Hope you all agree, and I recommend this title.","June 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.\n\nAnyway, that's my review.\n\nI'm out.          ~Darkel\n\n","September 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It's certainly not as tight as Yoshi's Island, and how dare anyone mention this glorified browser game in the same sentence as Half Life? The cheek, the very cheek of it! Despite being slightly overated, and over priced, BEEP has got some substance to it. The hub world in which you select your stage by navigating a rocket ship around planets is kind of cool. Shooting enemies and throwing them around with the gravity gun is also pretty neat. There are better games out there that are more polished and cost less that the 5 bucks asked for BEEP.

The graphics looked too simplistic, and I mistook it for a half-baked effort. It isn't.\n\nIf you've ever liked platform games that ask you to stop and think up your movement beforehand rather than have lightning reflexes, you are probably going to like this game. It is a light-hearted puzzle platformer,\n\nThere is not much frustration to be had, at least up until the part I've reached so far. You casually bounce around platforms, collecting thingies and shooting badies. When they either kill you, or you fall to your death, you respawn on one of the rather frequent checkpoints. You have infinite lives as far as I can discern, so no pressure there either.\n\nI've said that on the review of another game too: I'm in a phase in my life that sometimes I just need to squeeze a stress ball to unwind from my day, I need my off time to be relaxing, not stressful. Taking gaming way too seriously is in the past for me. This game suits me just fine. It's one of the anti-stress squeeze balls of gaming.

If it's on sale, really, everyone should just buy and try it.","June 12, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of them are decent. Sure, for a little more you could afford a real game and play something a lot nicer.

Some pretty big names you're throwing around there, man. You sure your little dollar game can hold up?\n\n\nWell, okay there buddy.\n\n\nLet's get some things straight here now.\n\n\nBeep is a basic, although charming puzzle platformer. You roll around as a little robot, collecting nuggets of moon ♥♥♥♥ to ground up and snort off the cheapest space hooker's ♥♥♥ you can. Your purpose is to collect, but every stage will have an end zone to reach as well.\n\n\nNow, let's be real here. What were you guys doing at Bioware and Lucasarts? Not knocking your game here, it's very nice. But something tells me you're not the brains behind things like Mass Effect or the original Star Wars Battlefront. You sure you guys worked AT Bioware and Lucasarts? You weren't like, washing windows outside? You sure you didn't just look in the window one day, make eye contact with an uncomfortable game programmer, and feel a special little connection or something? You weren't the unpaid intern picking up wank napkins while they were doing the motion capture for the alien strip club dancers in Mass Effect were you?\n\n\nJust checking, bud.\n\n\nBecause something tells me that this isn't really something up the usual Bioware or Lucasarts fan's alley. Yeah, sure, I love me some Bioware games or some Star Wars games. But this is a toaster with wheels that rolls around with a gravity gun, yelling "♥♥♥♥ you" in a chipmunk voice whenever it blows up an enemy. This isn't an epic RPG or an immersive shooter. I think you're just kinda throwing names around to make it seem like you're a big deal.\n\n\nBeep is a great game, for its price. It's really kinda hard to see where it's getting a lot of its inspiration from, aside from the gravity gun mechanics which are pretty much directly ripped from Trine and Half-Life.\n\n\nYou'll be tasked with finding three big space turds and many smaller space turdlets floating around each level. Collecting up all of the small ones will equal a big one. So you just need to collect a lot of things. I can see how this is mildly inspired by Yoshi's Island, seeing as how there's an emphasis on collecting. But it kinda misses the greater beauty of Yoshi's Island. Once you grab a rock in Beep, you have it. If you die right after, you still have it. If you leave the level, you still have it. You don't need to collect it again.\n\n\nIt doesn't really feel much like it was building on what Yoshi had so much as it is copying a small part of a greater concept. The same with all of its other inspirations, like Cave Story and the rest. It feels like they just borrowed some fun concepts from other games without really considering what made them great in the first place, and cobbling them together to make a simple little platformer.\n\n\nIt's not a bad game. I had a lot of fun with it, actually. It's a simple little platformer, but it's put together pretty well.\n\n\nWhile it might be rather unremarkable and bland compared to many other platformers, it's still designed very well. It has a gentle difficulty curve, and makes great use of multiple gimmicks that each world is based off of. New hazards are introduced and built on very well, and the action never gets particularly stale.\n\n\nWhile it is obviously clear why the game is so cheap once you start playing it, the amount of content packed in for the price is also fair. The game's incredibly basic, geometric art style is simple, but it's not off-putting. It looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Flash game, yeah. Fair point. But it doesn't look BAD. It just looks, you know, cheap and kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's some decent ambient effects in later levels to fancy things up a bit. So it's not like it's all bad. Everything else kinda follows that same pattern. Kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not bad. Most of the game's mechanics are borrowed, and they're nowhere near executed on par with or better than where they originated. But it's not an unpleasant experience.\n\n\nIt's not a long game, but it's better that way. Stretching its material thinner would have made the game an unbearable chore. But as a short, simple game that one could knock out in a couple hours, it's really a fun little thing. It's satisfying to use the gravity to throw enemies around, and puzzles are usually require some mild figuring. Nothing grand or elaborate, but you're not paying for grand and elaborate here.\n\n\nIt's clearly cheaply made, but it's also made well. There's some craftsmanship in there. Somewhere. Like a dollar menu sandwich that a greasy teen took the trouble of jacking off into, because he wanted you to eat ♥♥♥♥ that bad. He risked his job for you. He put his minimum wage job on the line. Can you imagine if he got fired? He wouldn't be able to afford those Beats headphones he wants so bad. They're the headphones all the real rappers use, like him. He grew up on the streets of the suburbs. But he would throw it all away for you.\n\n\nBeep is alright. I wouldn't say it's perfect. I wouldn't say it's great. Maybe it's good. But if there's something I can say with 100% certainty, it's that this game is alright.\n\n\nIf you ate at home for once instead of wasting all of your money on fast food, you could use those extra couple bucks to buy this game you fat ♥♥♥♥. It could be a nice change of pace, and unlike fast food it probably won't hasten the inevitable onset of erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nProbably.","January 19","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

Anti-matter allows you to unlock new zones providing you've completed all the levels in the previous zone. You will traverse methane oceans, volcanic valleys, a purple forest and death, so much death. You can get a total of 96 chunks of anti-matter although you only need 60 to unlock the final zone. At the end it's hinted there may be a sequel!\n\nParagraphs?

I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience.\n\nThere is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them.\n\nThe reload feature is instant - just press "R" - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay.\nThere are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.","June 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/104200/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.\n\nBEEP is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","3.1"," 25 of 50 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","25","50","3","0"

And, my definition of hard might be easy for someone else, so there's that too. I bought this game for the full price in India (55 Rupees).

With the above in mind, here's my review:\n\nThe game, as such, was too hard for me. The story was not a story, just mere reasons on why you had to go out and control the bots. The monsters/enemy robots/whatever they're called are way too powerful. Many of them can't be destroyed and fire at you a lot. The game has a demo on the game's website for three levels. The fourth one was OK, but the fifth was down-right impossible in my opinion. The first three levels, on the other hand, were extremely easy. The difficulty curve is not a curve at all. it went from easy to impossible in no time flat. Also, the game introduces new mechanics at an alarming pace, with little to no explanation on how they work. No training wheels, nothing (Portal: First Slice was far better).\n\nThe graphics are OK, but by no means good. To be honest, even the game "Thomas was Alone" looks better (or at least I think so). The "Bonk" engine is not so good at physics either. In my opinion, the developer could've easily used Unity or even a tool like Stencyl. The controls are non-remappable, so you're stuck with WASD/Arrow Keys. Also, right-clicking to reload is a bad idea. Why can't we just use the E key?

You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D\n\nIf you are playing the game, and u leave in a middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and safed. So you don't have to pick them up again. checkpoints however are lost.\n\nIf you are in a dark area, you get a light lamp. the light is well done though.\nGame has some puzzle elements.\nThe game is calm, music is calm.\n\nGame is okay if u like platforming.

I really love the simplicity factor but the menu layout could be better.\n\n-story and puzzles:-\nits about a robot ships being sent to out space in the future to discover planets in other galaxies. u simply orbit the planets with ur little rocket ship and hit deploy on various places on the planet to deploy the little cute catty sounded robot.\nu face plenty of obsacles and the game appears to have many missions, u have to stack stuff, block things and slide things to reach your goal. nothing too complicated but it`s fun and rewarding.\n\nconclusion:\ncoming from a hardcore, eye candy fps, strategy and racing gamer, this game may not be as appealing but after I played it I truely loved it. it`s definitly a kid game. but one must always keep the inside kiddo in us alive and happy :) I`m definitly gifting alot of copies to my young cousins since they would love it:)\nI would say it's even worth 5$ full price and even better with 96% discount.","May 19, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My negative recommendation is not based on the monetary cost.  I wouldn't recommend BEEP simply because I don't think it's worth the time you would put into it.  Pretty much every part of BEEP can be considered "just good enough," but the game lacks polish in all departments.  The graphics aren't bad enough to be offensive, but don't really bring anything to the table.  The controls are adequate, but it's pretty obvious no effort was made to tighten them up or make them any better once an acceptable implementation was found.  The level design adequately makes the player use the game mechanics in the way they were intended to be use, but it seems like no one went and made the small adjustments to improve the gameplay ever so slightly.  Overall, it's just okay, and personally I don't think it's worth the time or effort.","January 26","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gravity gun, touted as a unique mechanic and the game's main attraction, really isn't unique at all: it's functionally identical to, and used for puzzle-solving in exactly the same way as the wizard's telekinesis in Trine, which is a much more highly recommended game.","January 17","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infinite lives and fairly placed checkpoints were quite welcome, While it does have the atmosphere of a first time game, and while it came out a few years ago, it's a surprisingly competant one, especially given what Steam is saturated with nowadays, although the flash game aesthetic doesn't help.\n\nThat being said, the floaty controls and precise platforming required do not make for a good time, although it doesn't start that way. Describing itself as a hardcore platformer to me indicates the controls and mechanics will be fine and precise, yet like the fleshed out flashgame it is, you won't find that here.\n\nFollowing basic platformer rules, BEEP introduces new mechanics every few levels or so, and getting the super hard to reach goodies even early on demand a mastery of them. However, you're little robot friend is quickly tasked with some fairly convoluted puzzles, implementing a poor man's gravity gun that doesn't work half the time, and when it does, it controls like dead animal caught in a wind turbine. Some enemies, which you can also use the g-gun on once killed, have parts that you can't hook onto, effectively turning off your beam and having you drop it. Repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad  if there weren't areas that called for the use of these enemies, or the requirement to be precise with the positioning as you're forced to move quickly instead of methodically, but of course I wouldn't be complaining otherwise. It doesn't help that the gravity implemented is a pain in butt, and although you're little robot has a jetpack in which it can launch itself in the air and decent traction when it lands on an edge, you can't use it to stabilize or adjust mid jump, leading to some frustration on already floaty controls that are mired by the fact that majority of the game is just bland chasms with chunks of platforms spread far out of eyesight.\n\nIt doesn't help that there is a function to fly, but it's purely locational, and only works when you find a pad that lets you charge it. Nevermind the fact that you can't use any remaining jump fuel to adjust, the fact it isn't a permanent upgrade, and something you have to constantly go back and recharge until you know exactly where you're going isn't my idea of fun. Implementing a metroid style progression system wouldn't be hard, and because I constantly felt underprepared no matter what level I went into left me more frustrated than anything. Combat is especially weak, and while your shield isn't awful, your gun is extremely weak. This being said, I barely managed to finish the second to last level of the first world out of sheer will before throwing in the towel, so if there are any permanent upgrades, I didn't find them. That isn't an excuse more so than it is to say that even the base game isn't great to play, and there is no driving incentive outside of seeing the next area, which is basically just a pallet swap of the last in one way or another.\n\nBEEP is not a bad game by any means, but it's not one I can reccomend. Still, since it was put on sale because of the studio about to announce a new game. I truly wish them all the luck, and for the small amount of pennies that they ask for on sale, it's worth it just for the trading cards. Regardless of how I feel about this game, it's without a doubt better than 90% of the other crap being dumped onto steam, so hopefully they've improved over the last few years.","June 7, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.\n\nBut onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.\n\nEvery "Planet" biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next.

The robot known as a beep, is very much like a WALL-E, and makes appropriate "cute" sounds. I actually crack up quite a bit from the sounds it makes, and the art style and music also follows along with the theme.\n\nThe puzzles aren't too difficult, and the platforming is very forgiving. The jumps are very floatly, with a very generous gliding back down to the ground. Combine that with the anti-gravity gun, and you have some good control over the robot. He even goes up surfaces with it's wheels that you wouldn't think he could climb up.\n\nI would say content wise, the game is safe for children, however some puzzles might cause the child to want some adult help. Even still, I think the game is friendly to people of all ages, and I highly recommend the game. I was thinking this was a game I'd only farm trading cards out of, given the extremely low price. Instead, I found a game I intend to play through, and enjoy very much.\n\nA surprise, and an enjoyable one at that.","September 24, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut i love this game :)\n","September 29, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you aim at an enemy it auto-locks, great for shooting under cover, bad for tracking moving enemies. In this case every enemy killable, moves. Sometimes it locks at an angle where the bullets you shoot will miss regardless of where you stand, making some scenarios only passable if you lose one block of your health.\n\nBut onto the good part! I never found any puzzle that were the same. Some made me feel stupid, whereas some made me feel like a genius in the making, but no two puzzles were the same. Every obsticle you encounter is one you must figure out by yourself, whether you do it by stacking the mangled scraps of your enemies, or by propelling yourself upwards by using the tracer beam to slam the corpses up onto the underside of your BEEP.\n\nEvery "Planet" biome has their own theme and puzzle styles that never borrow from the previous planets, allowing a fresh experience every time you move from one biome to the next. Definite plus.\n\nThis is a puzzle game\nIt also feels like a rage game at times.\nno.\nIt's a rage game.\n\nAlso I hate the insufferable flying mines that chase you....","August 31, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out.\n+ Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though.\n+ There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle.\n+ Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible.\n+ Some twist  or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power,  enemy, new kind of environmental  hazard. Doesn't get monotonous.\n+ Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet.\n- Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch.\n- No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.\n\n\nOverall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.","September 2, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infinite lives and fairly placed checkpoints were quite welcome, While it does have the atmosphere of a first time game, and while it came out a few years ago, it's a surprisingly competant one, especially given what Steam is saturated with nowadays, although the flash game aesthetic doesn't help.\n\nThat being said, the floaty controls and precise platforming required do not make for a good time, although it doesn't start that way. Describing itself as a hardcore platformer to me indicates the controls and mechanics will be fine and precise, yet like the fleshed out flashgame it is, you won't find that here.\n\nFollowing basic platformer rules, BEEP introduces new mechanics every few levels or so, and getting the super hard to reach goodies even early on demand a mastery of them. However, you're little robot friend is quickly tasked with some fairly convoluted puzzles, implementing a poor man's gravity gun that doesn't work half the time, and when it does, it controls like dead animal caught in a wind turbine. Some enemies, which you can also use the g-gun on once killed, have parts that you can't hook onto, effectively turning off your beam and having you drop it. Repeatedly. This wouldn't be so bad  if there weren't areas that called for the use of these enemies, or the requirement to be precise with the positioning as you're forced to move quickly instead of methodically, but of course I wouldn't be complaining otherwise. It doesn't help that the gravity implemented is a pain in butt, and although you're little robot has a jetpack in which it can launch itself in the air and decent traction when it lands on an edge, you can't use it to stabilize or adjust mid jump, leading to some frustration on already floaty controls that are mired by the fact that majority of the game is just bland chasms with chunks of platforms spread far out of eyesight.\n\nIt doesn't help that there is a function to fly, but it's purely locational, and only works when you find a pad that lets you charge it. Nevermind the fact that you can't use any remaining jump fuel to adjust, the fact it isn't a permanent upgrade, and something you have to constantly go back and recharge until you know exactly where you're going isn't my idea of fun. Implementing a metroid style progression system wouldn't be hard, and because I constantly felt underprepared no matter what level I went into left me more frustrated than anything. Combat is especially weak, and while your shield isn't awful, your gun is extremely weak. This being said, I barely managed to finish the second to last level of the first world out of sheer will before throwing in the towel, so if there are any permanent upgrades, I didn't find them. That isn't an excuse more so than it is to say that even the base game isn't great to play, and there is no driving incentive outside of seeing the next area, which is basically just a pallet swap of the last in one way or another.\n\nBEEP is not a bad game by any means, but it's not one I can reccomend. Still, since it was put on sale because of the studio about to announce a new game. I truly wish them all the luck, and for the small amount of pennies that they ask for on sale, it's worth it just for the trading cards. Regardless of how I feel about this game, it's without a doubt better than 90% of the other crap being dumped onto steam, so hopefully they've improved over the last few years.","June 7, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this game had none of that.\n\nBeep is a 2d puzzle platformer where you control a little robot which has the power to shoot bullets, ability to "fly" with fuel, and move objects around with what is basically a gravity gun.\n\n\nThis game has no story. There is a little blurb at the beginning about you being dropped off to visit various planets but it doesn't come up during gameplay.\nThe game is dull. The levels feel repetitive  to the point where I just want to get to the ending. That wouldn't be a problem except...\nYou have to find 3 'stars' on each level. It doesn't say it outright but mathwise, you have to. The first world has 8 levels with 3 stars each. The next world needs 24 stars to unlock (for some reason). You can technically get an extra star on every level by collecting all the mini stars but they are a pain to find because there are so many of them\nThe music is just not good.\nI was going to play to the end just to get through the puzzles but the game is just way too boring to let any of that happen. Additionally, It put up arbitrary walls in front of me which just annoyed me until I stopped. You might like it but I did not.","July 16, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/recommended/104200/","unpageable","Unpageable","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpageable/","473 products in account","In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.\n\nThe protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.\n\nAnother twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.\n\nIf you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.","November 17, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all this game was extremely cheap, 0.20$ to be exact, (as it was on sale). I opened up the game, found the title screen to be very basic, but hey what do you expect from a 0.20$ game? I played about 20 minutes and got a bit bored, i told my self, 'Hey i could keep it for when my younger cousins come over' and left it for a while. About 1 month later I had litle to do and I thought i might as well try it again. I found that i quite enjoyed the game's simple yet cute art style and decent controls. The most fun i had was actually discovering the different enemies and seeing how they react to my presence (eg.firing lasers or an electric body). I perhaps spent to much time flying/ floating around with the robot's booster and dying because of it but hey, you would to. The most disapointing aspect in my opinion are the puzles, I am quite early into the game but I can't seeing the puzles getting any more complex, they mainly consist of busy work and could be easily completed by a young child, to be fair this game is targeted to that audience so who am i to blame.\nOverall the game is no AAA title but it is extremely possible to lose yourself in the adorable art style, wacky controls and some interesting game mechanics for many hours. It is sure to be lots of fun for a young child (and even adults). It offers a degree of complexity and simpleness often requiring you to do precise jumps, conserving fuel and timing your movements\nAnd with a price like that? you know this is a steal.\nB-\nP.S Is it just me or is it just really fun to fling the corpses of fallen enemies across the map? Just me? OK","October 18, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
