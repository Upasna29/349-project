Instead of patching LE, Stardock decided to ditch it entirely in favor of grabbing even more money from its naive customers. Stardock may have tried to create some goodwill by offering FE owners a discount on the latest version of their infamously buggy IP, but the fact of the matter is that Fallen Enchantress is still a broken, abandoned mess that never got patched or updated to an acceptable level.\n\nI should probably mention that Fallen Enchantress is itself an "improved" paid update of another broken game, Elemental.\n\nInstead of being a sucker and supporting such horrible development habits, save your money and wait a few months for Age of Wonders III.","February 16, 2014","false","8.4"," 169 of 185 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","169","185","2","0"

Let me clear it up.\n\nFallen Enchantress ( FE ) was released on Oct. 23, 2012.\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes ( FELH ) was released on May 22, 2013.\n\nFELH is a standalone expansion, which means FE isn't required to play it. For various reasons, FELH is probably the game you will want to play. So why am I reviewing "FE"? Because:\n\nFallen Enchantress: Ultimate Edition ( FEU ) was released on Nov. 13, 2015.\n\nWhen FEU was released, Stardock, the developer and publisher of FE, FELH, and FEU, removed the possiblity to buy FE exclusively; now you can only buy FEU (or FELH). As 99% of the reviews you are reading relate to FE, not to FEU, they are not as useful as they could be. So what are you getting when you buy FEU? You get:\n\nFallen Enchantress (FE) [1.32]\nFE Map Pack DLC\n+\nFallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes (FELH) [2.0]\nFELH Map Pack DLC\nFELH Quest Pack DLC\nFELH Loot Pack DLC\nFELH The Dead World DLC\nFELH Leader Pack DLC\nFELH Battlegrounds DLC\nThat's two complete games, but while FE was an o.k. game (reviewed somewhat harshly by my fellow Steamers), FELH is better and most importantly, it's what makes FEU an interesting bundle.\n\nIf you've made it up to here, you probably want to know why you should play either of these games. Thing is, I don't know you, so I can't tell if you will like them, but they are Fantasy 4X Turn-Based Strategy games w/ some RPG flavor. If you like Fantasy 4X Turn-Based Strategy games w/ some RPG flavor, there's a chance you will like them.\n\nI would recommend getting the FEU bundle on sale (rather than FELH alone). In case you are reading this in the Reviews tab, here's the link to FEU:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/216390\n\nAt this point, I think I need to end this review like every other review I read on Steam:\n10/10 Would give a history lesson in my first review again.","February 6","true","267.5"," 121 of 123 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","121","123","11","7"

It should have been nothing more than an expansion especially since most of the new fearture including the game and the DLC for it were created by the community on there mod page.

See Conclusion\nNOTE: (MUST READ)IT IS NOT A BAD GAME HOWEVER...Elemental: Fallen Enchantress has been technically abandoned by Stardock in favor of it's stand-alone expansion Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes. Said expansion contains the original game along with it's own added features and so as it stands, there is little to no reason to buy the base version of this game.\n\nIf you're interested, take a look at the more positively reviewed Stand-alone expansion:\n“Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes”\n\nINTRODUCTION:Fallen Enchantress is a 4X turn-based strategy game that incorporates RPG elements into it's mechanic and a 'tactical map' combat mode best featured by the Heroes of Might and Magic series of games. This game was developed by Stardock whose notable works include Sins of a Solar Empire, Elemental: War of Magic and the Galactic Civilizations series.\n\nThe players can choose to play one of the several factions or make their own where they then embark on a quest to conquer or rebuild the broken land. The game allows the player to create their own factions, hero / sovereign and troops which can be done by assigning armor sets, skills and abilities to each of them. It features an RPG element where the players can upgrade their hero's skills and equipment to improve their effectiveness in battle.\n\nPROS:+ Good special effects (I wish I can say the same for the models and art style though; See Cons)\n+ Ability to create your own unique Units / Troops\n+ Ability to equip, level up and even hire new heroes on the map\n+ Relatively large maps that rewards exploration with...\n+ Side quests, hero quests, powerful items and random encounters\n+ A lot of monsters to fight aside from the enemy factions\n+ Interesting new concept to the 4X genre\n\nCONS:- Very dated graphics and poor character models\n- Unimpressive attempt at cell-shaded textures\n- Balance issues\n- Performance issues (Players may encounter poor frame rates and crashes)\n- AI for the enemy factions is brain dead (It makes bad decisions and doesn't fully utilize the game's unit / troop creation mechanic)\n- Almost no replay value (Which came as a surprise because 4X games normally don't suffer from this problem)\n- Not a lot of item variation for its RPG elements\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD CONCEPT but POOR EXECUTION, the fact that this title has been technically dropped in favor of it's Stand-alone expansion means that I CANNOT RECOMMEND this game. I would have easily recommended this game when it first came out, but as it stands, there is no point in purchasing this title when you can just get it's stand-alone expansion for the same price.\n\nIt was a good and promising new concept for the 4X genre. To be fair, I really did legitimately enjoy my first playthrough. Exploring the world, meeting the npc heroes, fighting bigger and nastier monsters, doing quests, customizing my own army and empire with my own designs and specifications were really the selling point for me. Despite all it's PROS however the fact that it's fun factor can last for only one campaign / playthrough is an unforgivable sin to be committed by a game in the 4X genre.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The original Elemental was terrible, and Stardock actually recognized that. Their solution? Instead of fixing their ♥♥♥♥ for free, given that it was a liability that they created, they decided to try to sell the fixes for their problems as a 'standalone expansion', Fallen Enchantress.\n\nI usually find some worth in Age of Wonders-style games like this, but even now, so far after release, Fallen Enchantress is not complete. Age of Wonders, a fifteen year old game, had terrain modifiers in combat. Fallen Enchantress? Nope. Or even if it does, you can't tell - the UI doesn't make that information easily visible to you. It's sad to say, but Age of Wonders read the strategic map better when initializing combat - the field of battle was modeled after the hexes you and your opponents were on in the world map, and so terrain mattered as a result.\n\nIn comparison? I tried restarting similar battle scenarios in FE several times. Instead of recognizing that the enemy would be attacking from across a river - a river that, in the world map, impedes your movement if you try to cross it - you get a pond. Over and over again. The game simply doesn't understand the strategic significance of a river.\n\nA pond, people. One that you can go around with ease. What's the point of setting your troops up by a river or on a hill if the game won't recognize the inherent advantages of doing such? Even worse, there's no terrain modifier from defending from a walled city. Instead, you just get a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ archers when you defend a city. It's not an adequate replacement for four walls and a gate at all. Your city archers can and will get wrecked.\n\nOh, and Age of Wonders? It allowed you to have walls and gates when defending a city. You wanna garrison the town you're protecting and stick out a siege? No problem!\n\nNot to mention, the spells in this game are in every way less developed than they were in Age of Wonders. Christ on a stick, Stardock, were you TRYING to take features away?\n\nDon't buy this game. Stardock is trying so hard to make good games, but they're just refusing to admit when they need to change their guard. Whatever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ managers worked on Elemental must have worked on Fallen Enchantress too, because it's still terrible at what it's trying to accomplish.","February 7, 2014","false","35.5"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","2"

But it has two serious conceptual flaws, in my opinion, that I want to bring to light.\n\nFirst and most important, all the details you can keep an eye on make it slow like heck. If you play carefully, making sure that no unit is slacking, not rushing combat etc., there will be hours until you see who you're exactly opposed to. Even then, you're probably far from making anything but the most basic, generic units, available to anyone.\n\nSecondly, since it is all about (very) long term planning, you'll probably do well to start gathering all kinds of resources early on. However there's quite a lot of different resources, so it will take a lot of work to capture all the mines, farms, lairs, and that includes ones that you have no idea if they will ever see any use.\n\nIn short - if you can't commit serious time to this game, there's just no sense trying it.","November 27, 2013","false","203.3"," 83 of 126 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","83","126","0","0"

Almost immediately you are then overcome by the huge sense of "WTF am i supposed to be doing??" The tutorial teaches you virtually nothing, so not only does this leave you with HAVING to click on each and every icon to see what it does, but also having to pretty much click all over the screen as you realise that not everything that looks clickable is, and not everything that looks like mere background decoration is. This game is a messy travesty that looks and plays like a Beta version. It is a title that badly needs a tutorial that covers what you need to actually play the game.

Basically its a combination of civilization and an RPG as weird as that sounds.  Combat takes place in a top down grid and is turn based kind of like a final fantasy or any other JRPG.    On the world map you go around finding monsters to fight (or other people if you are at war) and you get xp and items.  You also use pioneers to found new cities to add to your production.  What is really cool though is the customization. You can make custom units, heroes, factions and maps.  This really adds to the games replayability and you can even do stuff like handicap your race to make the game more challenging.  The one big thing missing of course is multiplayer, but it is a really fun game and i'd recommend it to fans of civilization and rpg games (also wait for a sale to get it cheap if you can and you can get 50% off the expansion).","March 31, 2013","true","23.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/216390/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","At first blush, Fallen Enchantress is a fairly traditional 4X game set in a high fantasy gameworld.  And it certainly is something of a 4X game, but it's more of Civ meets the classical Heroes of Might and Magic than a pure 4X.  It offers a dynamic of champion leveling and equipment mechanics very reminiscent of a roleplaying game.  The game gels really well in that regard.\n\nMost of the gameplay mechanics are fairly familiar to fans of the 4X genre, including three different tech trees (for civilization, military, and magic upgrades), the standard progression and upgrading of buildings, and a familiar interface for the governance of your realm.  It does offer a level of customisation which is a little different, however, in the cities.  Each city building upgrade takes up a 'square' near the city, and certain specific buldings must be built on certain tiles.  The latter is familiar, but the former is a bit different to the Civilization series which popularised the 4X genre.  Most of the time, you can rely on the game's automatic placement of these buildings to be sensible, however if you want to micromanage, there is a setting that allows you to place them manually.  I feel this is a fairly strong addition actually, as it was gratifying to see the city expand and grow in a very visible manner.  It gives larger cities an appreciable sense of grandeur - and it also makes it easier to tell how your opponent is doing and what they're building.  Scouting is much more effective in the game as a result, then it would be otherwise.\n\nThe champions and army combat is where the comparison to Heroes of Might and Magic comes in.  While you can just assemble normal armies without a champion like a normal 4X, armies can also be led by champions you can find on the world map and hire.  There are also quests you can find and complete on the world map, much like HoMM.  These champions can be equipped with special items you find, and also can buy items from cities.  These champions can be a definitive edge in the tactical combat, which again acts a lot like classical HoMM, though it has a fair bit more depth in the available spells, items, and the ability to create your unit types.  The influence is obvious, but the implementations of these elements works quite well in the context of the game and is executed well.\n\nThe game allows a great deal of customisation, both in your initial hero (which acts as your sovereign), and in the ability to design individual units from the ground up.  You can customise the name, gender, equipment, and special abilities of the units available to you, and the game places no restrictions other than the traditional RPG fare of encumbrance, and of course having the available technology researched.\n\nQuests in the game piece together into a small overarching story for each map.  While the game is obviously not huge on the narrative, the quests offer a reasonable way to implement the narrative of the game into the game flow without interrupting the player constant.  It works pretty well, actually, though the game could use a stronger emphasis on it in my opinion.\n\nThe AI varies in difficulty depending on settings, but the default AI offers a challenge without being overly so.  They do have a few quirks, including the occasional absolute violent streaks a.la. the memetic Gandhi from Civilization.  I might complain if it wasn't something of a genre staple, but all in all I felt challenged without being overwhelmed at the default settings, and the game offers a lot of ways to increase the challenge if you find that too easy.\n\nVisually, the game reminds me a lot of the original Spellforce in terms of the sort of 3D/2D sort of mesh you got there, although a lot more is modeled in Fallen Enchantress than is in Spellforce.  The aesthetic is aged, but well-crafted and it generally works alright if you can see past the low polycount of some of the army models (seeing as the game has to render a lot of them, the polycount was kept low.)  It looks and feels fairly good for a fantasy game, with enough of it's own touches to keep it from being simply generic.\n\nIf there was one complaint I had in the theming of the game it's that the soundtrack and sound design is the one part of the game that is pretty generic, feeling almost a little uninspired in that regard.  Nothing terrible, just not particularly inspired and no real flair to it.\n\nAll in all, a classic 4X/RPG hybrid well worth your money, if you can see past its flaws.\n\nPublished: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/35-nostalgia-train-fallen-enchantress","February 22, 2014","true","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

War of Magic was a great game and it was amazingly fun, but it had many key issues that the developers never addressed. This game however fixes a lot of problems with the original without adding anything new, while that wouldn't be enough to ♥♥♥♥ me off this game ruined itself by doing one key thing. Singleplayer matches with the AI have a time limit of 400 seasons, AKA 100 years. That means you do not have a choice of playing matches that last 40 hours and having epic wars and struggles to keep your Kingdom alive despite multiple enemy nations at war with you. What this means is that your match will last about 3-4 hours, I've played the original so much that I could win it in a quarter of that time but I chose to play longer. Then it struck me, a warning told me 50 seasons left. I unstationed my massive army within my capitol city and used Call of the Titans to send this army directly next to the enemy capitol city and destroy everything and kill Queen Procipinee. I ended up winning after 92 years of playing. My old games on Elemental: War of Magic broke a thousand years usually.

An ancient global strategy game for the DOS / Win95 era. Or if you prefer, Civilization with a magic twist. Unlike Master of Magic, and the older Civilization games, the level of customization in Fallen Enchantress is astounding. Individual units can be customized with both gear and abilities. Rulers can be customized similarly, and even factions are customizable. That said, there are a number of issues with this game. First, there's no multiplayer. Second, there's no map editor; non-campaign maps are always randomly generated. The AI doesn't deal with come units well (archers). Finally, the game gets some slowdown as the world fills up with cities and units.\n\nPros:\nAn updated global strategy game set in a fantasy era.\nStaggering amount of (optional) customization.\n\nCons:\nNo multiplayer.\nRandom map generation.\nThere is a power discrepancy for specific units (like archers), that may make the game too easy/difficult.\nGame suffers from slowdown as teh world becomes mroe heavily populated.\n\nIt's still quite an amzing game in my opinion.\n\nEDIT:\nAlright, steam put Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes on sale. Primary reason I didn't pick it up earlier is because I felt the original was fine (it felt like a complete product). Anyway, here's some differences between FE and FE:LH:\n\nFE hero units are found scattered about the map and available to hire to the first faction appropriate ruler to pay them. FE:LH uses a fame system where you will be given a choice between two heroes when your fame reaches certain values.\nFE hero units get to choose from 3 abilities that are drawn from a relatively random pool. FE:LH has full skill trees, allowing you to pick up what you want (although the more powerful skills aren't available immedietely).\nMelee units in FE:LH feel like they have been buffed to be more useful; and the AI seems to better understand how to deal with archers.\nFE:LH also seems to have a larger pool of events and quests through paid DLC.\n\nTo sum it up:\nFE:Legendary Heroes has a little more content and a little more polish than Fallen Enchantress, though Fallen Enchantress is still an excellent game.\nIf you already own one, there's not much reason to buy the other. If I had to pick between the two, I would pick FE:Legendary Heroes, but only if the price gap was relatively small.","December 21, 2013","true","118.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think I may be one of the few who actually prefer this game over the Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes standalone expansion, but, I don't like how Legendary Heroes' combat system works. However, Fallen Enchantress works great!  I'm completely addicted to this game and I haven't experienced a single bug. I do wish this had Steam achievements only because I've gotten used to getting them. A couple of things I've seen in other comments about this game are one: this game requires you to make a Stardock account. I don't understand why this is such a big deal; it only takes less than a minute and there's no waiting for Stardock to load before you play (unlike Ubisoft who is absolutely ridiculous). It's a one time deal that just registers the game with Stardock. And two: I've seen many people complain about bugs or the program crashing to the desktop. I haven't experienced any of these things. The worst thing that has happened was that the music stopped for a couple of minutes but then came back on. There hasn't been any other problems (and I don't really consider that a problem after playing some other games that I've purchased here). The only downsides, and these are minor to me, but I understand that it could be a deal breaker for others, is that there is no multiplayer at all. I usually enjoy single player only games, but this would be fun if I could occasionally connect with friends and play like Starcraft. Also, the graphics aren't the greatest, but they're not horrible either. This game does have a pretty steep learning curve but, once you've got that figured out, the game is incredible. As for replayability, you can custom create any map making every game feel like a brand new game.

Now before you blast me with rage energy bolts for combing one or two of your fevered games, this game cannot compare with either CIV or Diablo in there respected fields,  but with the empire building, hero questing, and large array of spells and customization options this game is a diamond in the rough. Now the question that is the most important is it worth the price tag, yes and no…. okay, okay, yes it is worth it if you love RTS and fantasy and always wanted to make your own fantasy cavitation and lead to world domination (they are out there…), but no for the fact that it has its limits on replay value the map selection is about 7 or 8 maps no random land masses and the world quest are always the same as well.

It has the strategic elements of Civ, with the combat, heroes and magic system of Age of Wonders. Initially this game leaves such a strong impression. Everything feels hunky-dory and beautiful, but it wears off relatively quickly.\n\nIt's chock full of technical issues and suffers from a severe lack of content, lest you buy the DLC to fix both. There's a very short, throwaway campaign that isn't super great, and then random map skirmishes. That's really it. You get to design your own factions (colour choice, race, basic combat/economy bonuses etc), but regardless of map or faction chosen the game still plays exactly the same every time, especially once you nail a winning strategy - hero as dedicated, custom mage and first hero as a tanky melee. You'll be utterly invincible and win game after game without a shred of difficulty.\n\nThere's probably enough content to get value for money from a purchase, but not much reason to play after 2 or 3 games.","October 31, 2012","false","61.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminds me of Heroes IV & V - with the best from both. The Champion (like a hero in Heroes) debth and RPG elements from IV, and the graphic and design from V. What it adds is a  vast diversity on RPG elements on both champions AND units. You can design your own units with skills and equipment. And your hero get a bit more possibilities by finding equipment and quests on the map. There are also many factions to choose from, with unique units, buildings and faction traits. And the awesome part - you can create your own Sovereigns (kind of a master-champion of your faction).\nAll in all, a great game for anyone who liked or had an interest for Heroes genre.","May 13, 2013","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Imagine this game as a fantasy-styled Civilization. It may as well be called Sid Meijer's Fallen Enchantress. The graphics could use a bit of an update, but overall, the fun of the game comes not from conquering and establishing cities, but from completing various quests found on the board, and by making your own units and watching them pummel other units into oblivion.\n\nSo, in short, if you like Civilization, quests, magic, and character customization, this is a must have.","February 20, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall I liked the way it plays and I'm a huge fan of Turn-Based Strategy. The RPG elements in the game are well executed though perhaps lacking in the variety of equipment slightly...very slightly. My biggest complaint is that'd I'd like to see more options for each tier of weapons, but more importantly armor. Such as having leather, studded leather, hardened leather, and padded leather in the first tier all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Maybe have more specific conditions of equipment such as serrated, sharpened, dulled, rusty, master-crafted short sword instead of just "short sword." This is really just being nitpicky since I adore this game. I just love variety, and truly enjoy what this series does.

Suffice to say I was extremely wary when I purchased this game, hoping to the baby Jesus the same problems that plagued Elemental werent present in Fallen Enchantress. And for the most part, they werent.\n\nA mix between Civilisation and Might and Magic, Fallen Enchantress manages to get the best parts of both games to work for it.\nStrategic Civ building? Check\nTactical turn-based battles with cool fantasy units? Check\n\nThe RPG elements such as questing and boss battles are a nice twist, though they can occasionally get in the way when you find yourself in a battle with half of the AI controlled opponents.\n\nI will say this, however. Battles can occasionally become a grind-fest when your opponent send streams of weak, fodder-like armies at you, and while there is an auto-resolve option to alleviate pointless fights, I've had mixed an sometimes dissapointing results when I let the computer decide battle outcomes. Another issue That many have mentioned is crashing. WHen i first got this game a while ago, i saved frantically every turn, waiting for the inevitable crash that was to come, and ususally at the worst possible times. However playing it again now, those crashes havent cropped up yet after 30hrs of play, which means that either the game has been successfully patched, or I should buy a lotto tickect due to my extreme good fortunes.\n\nOverall I am thoroughly enjoying this game, and minor niggling aside, this was definitely the game Elemental: War of Magic should have been.\n\n","February 17, 2014","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being able to actually control your created units in a tactical combat mode (akin to the combat system of the King's Bounty or Heroes of Might and Magic series) definetly makes this system worth it, for Fallen Enchantress.\n\nAll in all, Fallen Enchantress might lack a bit of polish when compared to games like Civilization, but it's still a fantastic game with the potential of becoming even greater.","October 28, 2012","true","48.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only things I don't like are the square grid (I prefer hexes) and lack of use of the ocean; it would at least be nice for them to explain why there are no ships, but it just surrounds the continent, being totally ignored.

Don't buy this one though. Get the Fallen Enchantress: Legendary heroes instead.""\n\nOverall Score of this version : 6/10\n\nI REALLY Recommend Legendary Heroes tho, with a score 9/10","May 7","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
