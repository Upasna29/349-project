Liked it enough to buy a couple copies and pass it around.\nI had totally forgotten about this game, and out comes a surprise free update months later! They're calling it Eufloria HD, but should really call it Eufloria 2. There's so much new and added depth I kind of feel like I'm playing a sequel. New unit types, many UI improvements and a rebalanced campaign. Steam achievements were added and it sure would be nice to see trading cards enabled.\n\nWhat could make this better of course would be multiplayer and a more customizable skirmish. I'd also like to see hotkeys enabled. As it is this is an excellent game and well worth a purchase.","October 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 75 of 78 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","75","78","0","1"

I would like to mention the cool sci-fi ideas behind this.  THis game is based on an actual proposed technology called dyson trees. THese would be some sort of replicating technology that could colonize asteroids and bud seeds that could go on to colonize others.  It also is related to a type of space probe called a self replicating Von Neumann machine. So you play as sort of an nanotechnology intelligence embodied in these trees/seed. Pretty cool.\n\nThe game itself is enjoyable, you can play it at a slow speed for a meditative growing game or crank it up to fast making it a little frenetic. I played the original a while ago. Im not sure what all has been upgraded, but it has better graphics, i think more missions and modes, some extra controls.

This game weaves together a beautiful living picture as you play, with pleasant and relaxing aesthetics, from sound to visuals.     Gameplay  7  A wonderfully relaxing game, Eufloria is great to sit down and play when you're looking to just chill out. Mesmerizing in style, with a downtone soundtrack, Eufloria offers up a unique take on strategy games. Taking a much more tug of war approach, you grow your seeds (altering their stats via another artful gameplay mechanic) and work to overwhelm the opposing forces. Eventually it becomes a domino effect as you send wave after gigantic wave of units from planet to planet, toppling over the enemy's forces. However, it can be a bit tedious at times waiting for your army to grow enough to make your next move, particularly at the start of each game. This problem is few and far between though, as several times you are under immediate pressure to act.    Story  3  You probably won't find yourself caring much about the story of this game, as it is strange and vague most the time.    Multiplayer  N/A  None to be found here.    Replayability  5  Eufloria is one of those games you come to when you need it. For me, that particular time is when I need to wind down and relax. Each time coming back is enjoyable though.    Overall  6/10  Don't get confused by the 6 over there, that's still a good number. I definitely recommend Eufloria to anyone that enjoys sitting down and playing a chill game. If you're looking for fast paced action this game is not for you. Eufloria is a moment of calm in a storm of run-and-gun, spray-and-pray, leap-then-look games.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","December 1, 2014","true","5.2"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","31","41","3","3"

Similar to games like Galcon, the goal is to plant your seed on large planets, allow forces to build up, then swarm the next planet to expand. It feels a lot like the combat within an RTS, but simplified down immensely and without any base building aspects.\n\nThat being said, it’s not a bad game. I first played it on mobile and I think the simplicity of the format works well with a touch screen,  however when making the switch to PC I found that I felt very idle in the game. With a mouse, keyboard and macros I have infinitely more micromanaging power than when I’m toilet gaming with two thumbs. Because of this, I find that this isn’t a very compelling title to own on PC. Eufloria (and Eufloria HD) are good games and I do recommend you give them a go, but be fully aware that you’re going into a more mobile-minded experience.","November 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electronugget/recommended/221180/","electronugget","ElectroNugget","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electronugget/","280 products in account","Eufloria HD is an upgraded version of the original Eufloria, which I also played.\n\nBoth games are an extremely relaxing and atmospheric strategy based on some gameplay mechanics from simpler flash strategy titles: capture planets (here called asteroids), upgrade them (here with beautiful trees that grow over time) and they will generate units (here called seedlings) over time, then use said units to flood other asteroids. Take over the map and you win. Rinse and repeat.\n\nDespite the fact that the games tend to reach a certain tipping point where it becomes easy to overwhelm your enemies, Eufloria is a very polished take on this idea, and a lot of fun to boot! The soundtrack is very mellow, and the visuals are clean and beautiful.\n\nThis version upgrades the visuals and adds some new mechanics, such as the ability to upgrade asteroids which have poor stats by sacrificing seedlings, and rallying points which means less needless clicking and dragging.\n\nThere is a solid story mode that can take about 10 hours to complete (or more depending on what speed you play at), as well as arcade levels and a New Game + mode. Overall, a decent amount of content for the price.\n\nHonestly, I cannot recommend this game enough! It has a great, calming atmopshere, some straightforward but satisfying RTS gameplay and a solid campaign and arcade mode. Definitely worth the price!","July 5, 2015","true","11.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

For those of you who have played before: The tutorial has been greatly improved, both in pacing and in clarity. The UI is much easier to read at a glance, and much more intuitive to boot. I also greatly appreciate some of the features they've added - beacons, terraforming, etc. It's definitely worthwhile to revisit.\n\nIf you haven't played before, Eufloria is a unique RTS through and through. It's amazing how this game pairs a relaxing setting with challenging goals.  I get so absorbed I often don't realize how much time has passed. There is a time element, but it's not strict. You can pace yourself however you wish. The game increases in difficulty somewhat slowly, but the hardest levels kept me entertained long after I finished story mode. There's a surprising amount of complexity arising from simple mechanics. The fact of the matter is - I played 50+ hours of the original, and here I am years later, and the mechanics are still feel fresh and challenging.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dubhe14/recommended/221180/","dubhe14","Dubhe14","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dubhe14/","206 products in account","This game isn't bad, exactly, I mean playing it isn't a negative experience.  It's just unengaging.  It's a game made for tablets (pretty obvious from the UI), but it knows what it is and doesn't try to be anything else, so I can't hold that against it.  Unfortunately what the game does try to be is...not very ambitious.\n\nThere is absolutely no strategy involved - the solution to every level is "amass several hundred units and steamroll through the map."  There is only one unit, and while some have more speed or more strength, none of that matters because overwhelming numbers trumps all in this game. There are 25 levels, and every single one of them plays the same way.\n\nThe game easy, but intentionally so - it's supposed to be a relaxing game, which it is for the most part, the music and visuals are really well done!  Unfortunately, towards the last couple of levels, the game resorts to cheap methods of increasing difficulty, like having your enemies start the level controlling more units and more territory on the map.  You may end up restarting a level several times, hoping the enemy will decide not to attack you in the first 5 minutes this time and totally wipe you out.\n\nAnd there is so.  Much.  WAITING.  Waiting for your trees to grow.  Waiting for more seedlings to spawn.  Not helped by the fact that everything happens at an incredibly sluggish pace, and even on the fastest time setting, you can still Alt-Tab to your browser once in a while without fear.\n\nTL;DR: This is a game that is meant to be played while you do something else.  It's a game meant to waste time.  You'll never wake up one day and get the urge to play some more Eufloria, so I can't really recommend it.  But if you're stuck at your parents' house for Christmas and your $3000 PC is back home and all you have is your dinky laptop, then yeah, Eufloria will distract you for a bit.","December 28, 2014","false","16.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Don't be fooled by my playtime, I played the original Eufloria years ago, and it's still in my Steam top-20 with nearly 50 hours played.  Impressive for a small indie game, especially if you consider I don't generally like RTS games.  And now these wonderful developers decided to gift the new improved HD version to everyone who bought the original game.\n\nThe game isn't complicated at all, the tutorial levels do a great job to teach you all you need to know.  You start with seedlings around an asteroid under your control.  You can move them to other asteroids within your influence sphere, possibly attacking enemy seedlings in the process, or plant them to grow a tree.  Trees produce seedlings, with increasing output overtime when they become fully grown.  Seedlings come with 3 characteristics, based on the quality of the asteroid they were grown on : energy, strength and speed.  Strength and speed are obvious, higher energy means you will need less seedlings to conquer an enemy asteroid.  Some more complexity later on, but those are the basics in a nutshell.\n\nWhat makes this game great is the atmosphere, sound & graphics.   It really looks gorgeous, with a high attention to detail (e.g. seedlings stats also change the way they look).  You notice how the developers really made this with a passion.  The levels are partially procedurally generated, the level will never be identical, but some parameters stay the same.  The music is nice and relaxing.  You also have a lot of control over the speed of the game, allowing for both rushed gameplay or a relaxing experience.\n\nIf I have to mention something negative, the only thing I can think of is the lack of complexity.  Levels start to feel too similar after awhile, because you are growing seedlings and invading asteroids over and over again.  There is some variation in each level's initial strategy, but usually it's pretty obvious if you have to grow, attack or flee to beat the level.\n","October 21, 2014","true","8.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Then took those elements and changed them to be tedious and more complicated than they need to be.  The interface has been made absurdly large as well like its made for toddlers or your grandparent's failing eyes.  Overall it lacks all the fun and quick gameplay of the original playing more like it was made to purposely complicate things that were intuitive and simple before.   I can't reccomend this version of Eufloria at all...get the original version of Eufloria and you'll have a lot more fun with it.  Playing this version just feels tedious, the fun has been sucked out of it.\n\nI have 424 hours playing the original Eufloria but I'm seriously considering uninstalling Eufloria HD as a waste of disc space since I really can't see myself even finishing this version.

You play as Freeman Dyson.\n\nI would say that the game is an embodiment of good simpleness, in many ways. Regarding the gameplay, it isn't unchallenging, but it is straightforward RTS in design; you've got your scouting, expanding, conflict, and some asset improvement—it doesn't try to overcomplicate itself. Its visuals are also quite simple, using a minimalistic style, which evokes images of insects and plants. It has chill electronic ambient music playing throughout play, never trying to do anything too complicated with its sound, and meshing quite well with the game's all around simplicity. It doesn't try to reinvent the Stanford torus, it's just a good simple game.\n\nImprovements made in Eufloria HD over Eufloria look like they have either a console or a mobile version responsible for their existence. This isn't a bad thing. While the UI isn't as purely minimalistic as was in the original, it's far more functional, allowing the player much more manual control over their harvests of seedlings; an example would be splitting a large swarm of seedlings, one half to intercept attackers of one of your undefended asteroids, while sending the other half to punish the attackers for leaving their own asteroid open. In the original, your options were to send all, or if you wanted to split forces, you were required exactly as many right-clicks as units you intended to send, or right-hold, and get a number kind of close to what you wanted; neither of which were quick. There are also now options to filter what you want to send where by traits, without delving into 100% micromanagement. In addition to the improved control over large swarms, due to the addition of beacons to direct where newly spawned seedlings go, building those large swarms is now much easier. Altogether, I feel that these are substantial improvements to the flow of gameplay, removing a large amount of frustration and tedium that wore the zen thin.\n\nWhile I loved the originals, both Dyson and Eufloria, for what they were, Eufloria HD has finally resolved its prior versions' major gameplay flaws, which worked counter to the chill environment its developers envisioned. With that in mind, I can now give the game my wholehearted recommendation for anyone looking for a nice little RTS to relax with. Even if you find its full price a bit of an ask, there are much worse things you could put in your cart during a sale.\n\n\nI should note, that due to the simple monochrome backgrounds with bright neon seedlings, the game lends itself quite well to the Tetris effect.","January 10, 2015","true","34.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it is far from a bad game; the gameplay is decent and the art has a good initial concept.\nBut in terms of production values, it falls short; some blurred graphics that shouldn't be (I speak about the HUD, not about what's blurred on purpose like the seedlings), badly designed sprites (there I also speak about what's blurred on purpose) although there is not much visual content, uninspired font and implementation... Overall it looks lacking some art skills (besides the original concept), or quickly done. All this would be totally acceptable if these amateurish-not-always-crisp-neither-numerous visuals didn't weigh more than 2 Gigs on the hard drive!

It’s a meaningless ideal at best and a poisonous priority at worst. Fun is a neurological trick. Plenty of categorically unhealthy things are “fun”. Let’s try for something more. Many of the alternatives will have similarly fuzzy definitions, but let’s aspire to qualities like “edifying”, “healing”, “pro-social”, or even “enlightening”. I encourage you to decide upon your own alternatives to “fun” in games (while avoiding terms like “cool” and “awesome” and any other word that simply caters to existing, unexamined biases).","October 15, 2014","false","2.0"," 7 of 123 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","7","123","0","9"

Unlike most games, anyone who owned the original got the HD version for free. That’s always appreciated.\n\nIt’s a semi-relaxing puzzle/RTS game where you have various planet-like structures, surrounded by your seedlings. These seedlings can move to different planets and turn into trees, which are used to make more seedlings or to work as defences. The idea of most levels is to have as many seedlings as possible and attack other planets to take over the sector. It is constantly introducing new game mechanics, so it’s always interesting. The levels sometimes have different objectives (get to here, protect this planet, rescue these seedlings, etc) to provide variety.\n\nIt’s also pretty awesome for playing whilst watching something (TV, YouTube, etc). Alternatively, if you just want to play the game, you can increase the speed.","March 7, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has both very postives and very negatives. And I feel especially the latter should be a warning.\n\n-it's unengaging. I came to the same conclusion as Dubhe14 below: it's all about creating the largest fleet. If you want an RTS to have strategy and depth, this is NOT the game for you.\n-boring. Even before I came to realise swarming was the one winning strategy, the story couldn't interest me in the least. The abstract style has to do with it, as well as the fact that there is literally nobody to identify with (unless you zoom in incredibly, your fleet consists just of dots)\n\nYet on the plus side, I must say...\n+original. This is a soothing, calm RTS. I've never encountered this type of RTS before. And while the style isn't engaging, I'm amazed at how time starts to fly by once you're into it.\n+a time waster. this may sound like a negative, but there is something compelling (though not engaging) in watching the numbers go up and slowly growing into a massive attack force. There isn't much in terms of strategy, but there is some.\n\n\n\nIn the end conclusion...don't buy this game on steam unless you plan to play it on the go. Or get it on a tablet (the game is made for touch controls rather than a mouse). I don't regret getting it...but wouldn't buy it again for my desktop PC. :-)","June 6, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started playing, expecting to give it 30 minutes or so to get a general feel for the mechanics...and then 8 hours later I realized I'd skipped dinner and it was 2 in the morning.\n\nThis is RTS gameplay in perhaps its most primal form, enhanced with audio that is spacious & mellow, and slathered in visuals that are simply gorgeous in their geometric perfection.\n\nThe game does lack greater depth once you've mastered all its 50-odd levels, but you'll have a lot of fun doing it.","December 12, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the zoomed out view in Eufloria  HD you can't tell which asteroids have new and planted flowers, or how many seedlings they have.\n\nSome interesting new mechanics were added, but they don't make up for how tedious playing the HD version has become.\n\n(The orignal Eufloria is probably my favourite casual game ever and I have more than 500 hours in it)","January 5","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anarchyalice/recommended/221180/","anarchyalice","Pumpkin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anarchyalice/","195 products in account","Eufloria is a game where you colonise asteroids and engage in seed warfare against "the greys". The concept is really simple: Plant trees to create seeds and defend your asteroids, send seeds out to colonise other asteroids and potentially take them by force. then continue to grow your colony.\n\nIn description and presentation Eufloria appears basic and casual which you wouldn't be wrong if you said it was however as you play new elements are introduced to add extra layers of strategy. Eufloria is relaxing and simple but that's only because it takes you through the mechanics of the game at such a pase that you easily learn and form new strategies. Additionally the game has 3 speed settings so wether you'd like a casual relaxing experience or a fast paced strategy setting it's your decision.\n\nEufloria is a fun game for those looking for a different experience or maybe if you just want to relax. For the price and the ammount of content it's money well spent.","August 10, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few of the interface actions could have been made a little easier (setting beacons is a bit tedious), and one of the levels 18 (Hide and Seek) seems to simply require pure luck in order to make it, but for the most part this was a fun way to kill time while listening to podcasts and the like, and a great study in gorgeous visual minimalism in video game art.","March 13","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really liked that one, a minimalistic, dynamic and fancy strategy about seeds taking over the asteroids. And still, even with the fact that many things have changes, including one's name (Eufloria now), I still love that game. Relaxing and minimalistic, uncomplicated but sometimes challenging - it's pretty fun to watch how the trees grow in real time, providing you with the troops. Also this moments when you collect an army of 1000 seeds and simply anhialate everything in the asteroid belt... yea... Very cool game.","January 16","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is relaxing and the graphics, while nothing special to look at, light up the dark landscapes beautifully. There's two ways to play - from a distant standpoint, watching the battlefield as blips on a radar, or up close and personal, where those little dots turn into your fleet, blasting the enemy and invading their planets.\n\nThe original did feel more balanced, as I feel like a few of the HD levels weren't intended for some of the new features. For example, one of the maps, Hide and Seek, intended for you to abandon your previous planets and move onto the enemy's stronger planets. In HD, they added a feature to strengthen your planets by sacrificing soldiers, so you can simply farm seedlings on a throwaway planet and bolster a crappy planet's stats until it can take on a giant, taking away from the level's original goals.\n\nThe fast forward feature is a blessing in HD, and it'll be hard to go back to the original for this reason alone. The only thing it's missing is a multiplayer feature!","January 19","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
