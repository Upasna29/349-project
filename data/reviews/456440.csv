Nothing more. It gets to the point of frustration replacing enjoyment. The puzzles are not difficult in a mindbending way but rather a hair pulling way in that they require exteme quickness with your mouse and memorizing the layout while being timed on a very short clock. They are all doable but it is not what I would call a thinking mans puzzle type of game. As a diehard lover of puzzle/adventure games I really did not like this game. It may appeal to others but for me it didn't hack it. Blind faith can be costly at times. luckily for me it was only 4 bucks.","April 27","false","1.9"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","25","43","2","1"

Very little description of the scenario leaves to much to be asked within the first 5 minutes and mini games with overly strict of constraints made the game difficult to swallow. Supposedly we will be seeing an update soon to fix the mini games, but i believe the game needs work further to be able to be a truely enjoyable experience. I'd like to come back to this game and review it further after updates but at the time, I wouldn't recommend this game.","May 3","false","0.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Seriously\n* Not perfectly polished but good enough for me\n* The game does not tell you what to do, again I'm perfectly fine with this\n","April 28","true","0.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I like the music and the artstyle. The tree has some artifacts on it but that was the only problem I saw.\n\nI do not like the puzzles but that is just me. Overall I think it's a interesting game and worth a look.","May 5","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are some parts of the game where I truly feel a bit terrified, especially when you can hear something approaching and you're frantically searching for a place to hide. The combat system is simple but it does what is needed for a game focused story telling.\n\nThe game offers a challenge by giving players one life to live and a short time to do certain puzzles which many casual gamers might not be able to complete. If you consider yourself a hardcore gamer and you're looking for a game that offers challenging gameplay then this game is for you.\n\n[Pros]\n- Unique art style that gives it that cutsey but horror feel to it.\n- Challenging puzzles.\n- Exploration and hidden boss fights.\n\n[Cons]\n- The winning chance on the slot machines could stand to be a bit more forgiving. (Perhaps increased odds with more hit points you gamble with?)\n- Some of the puzzles can be a bit TOO challenging for the casual gamer (despite the update). I would recommend perhaps either offering consumable bonuses to increase the time on puzzles or an adjustable difficulty mode. Unless such a bonus exists in the slot machines. I have yet to win at those yet.\n\n[Would I recommend this game?]\nThis game has a lot of potential and the developer seems to be listening very closely to the community.  I would recommend buying it because it is a pretty awesome experience - especially for $5. That's basically a steal for the quality of fun you can have with this game and at the pace the developer seems to be patching the game, any cons to the game will likely be addressed in a pretty short amount of time.","May 7","true","1.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

While it hints at a "gameplay" aspect, it's really more like an interactive little art film with a couple mini games thrown in.  While I would say that the memory game isn't as bad once you know how to exploit it, that aspect of the game just isn't fun.  Memory is an entertaining concept for a child, and adding an unforgiving timer doesn't add to the fun or challenge, just the frustration.  It would be like making you play hop scotch on hot coals. Adding annoyance to a kid's game doesn't make it better, just painful and embarrassing to screw up at as an adult.\n\nWhere The Orphan Dreams really shines though, is the pace.  It gives you just enough time to absorb the situation, move on to the next scene, and then it throws you for a loop.  I feel like I needed a counter for every time I said or thought "Now what the f*ck is that?!" in genuine surprise.  Little details immerse you and make you want to see just a little bit more, and it's well worth it.\n\nI only got through part 1 so far, but it was a blast to do it, and I'm looking forward part 2.  I hope Tayfun has some more twisted stories to tell in the future, because I'll certainly be watching for the next game.","April 30","true","2.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Graphics are not that good but looking fine. I really liked the soundtracks. The story looks fluent. What I really appreciate about this game is that the whole game made by one developer-except some translations-. Good work Tayfun Tuna! Give us some more in the future.\n","April 28","true","0.5"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"
