Not the most spectacular pixel art but works well for what it is. Worth nothing is the focus on plant-growth, not lifeforms. Fullscreen doesn't appear to be supported either which does reduce immersion. Only a few hints are given and gameplay is left up to experimentation. Draw in cells, fastforward time and watch the dancing pixels on-screen. DNA collected reveals new plants and mutations while power harvested gives the ability to change growth conditions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umyMD8xgc4U\nRecommendation is based on being something quite unique.\nCannot personally compare it to Earthtongue, not had the chance to play it.\n\n@Devs\nFullscreen support please. Maybe a time limited demo as well?\nXenoBloom might surprise a few people if given the chance.","September 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","42","50","2","0"

The biggest criticism I have is that it doesn't feel as though it reaches the level of "game." It's more of a proof-of-concept for a ecosystem manager FOR a game, but by itself it's more of a simple simulator than anything. With what Xenobloom offers, you get the notion that Ibology set out to make the next Terraria/Starbound with more complex flora behaviour, finished the flora behaviour code, and decided to publish that.\n\nUltimately, I think I'd get equal enjoyment out of having Observational Mode as a screensaver.\n\nI'd prefer to give this a neutral review if I could, but I'm required to either recommend the game or not in order to submit the review. Due to feeling as though I've seen all it has to offer in the brief time I played it, I'd have to go with not. If you can spend more than an hour in things like Universe Sandbox, you may still enjoy XenoBloom.","September 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 70 of 101 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","70","101","2","1"

At first, it seems a little complex, but getting the hang of it isnt too hard, and I find that figuring out everything is very rewarding! For example, some plants won't grow unless you have dirt in the right formation, so its not as easy as just sitting back and letting things grow! It's definitely a game I'd recommend to anyone who liked the old flash game Powder Game, as it definitely rewards experimentation!","September 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

Xenoblooms ability to modify species is cool but could use more options.\nI also would have liked the climate/nutrient-availability to influence what flora grew. Whether or not the lack of explanation for a lot of things is good or bad will likely vary between people (I didn’t mind too much).\n\nPro-\nThe currency system for using tools in Xenobloom is better than EarthTongue’s (and other ecosystem games for that matter). In EarthTongue it was “interventions” that the player had to pay a certain amount of each time the player used a tool. The player’s only means of gaining interventions was for them to slowly generate over time. But using tools were so expensive, and gaining interventions took so long, that ecosystems could collapsed before you could even afford to use the tools to maintain the ecosystem; not to mention it made experimenting for fun challenging (which often killed the fun for me).\nXenobloom utilizes a similar system of needing “Power” to use tools, power which also slowly generate over time. Yet, unlike EarthTongue, the player can also obtain “power” from removing soil & flora from the ecosystem or altering the environment to be “less favorable”. This system is much less frustrating, yet at the same time without make it too easy since not waiting means taking away from the ecosystem (at least if your not playing “Experimental mode”).\nXenobloom also allows you to modify the species, something one can’t do in EarthTongue. (However there are only 4 options…)\n\nCon-\n\nProbably the main thing which Earthtoungue has much of which Xenobloom is lacking in is species behaviors and interactions. In Earthtongue species, including flora, had many different behaviors and interact with each other and their environment. In Xenobloom they seem to just spawn in areas that are favorable and die when they’re unfavorable, and the only interactions that I could notice was an implied relationship between all flora & microbes, as all flora die without them.\nI don’t think the lack of fauna justifies lack of interactions because in real life flora-like-organisms do interact with each other. Certain plants can utilize their roots and surround fungi networks to share nutrients with other plants. Certain plants, that produce toxins to defend against herbivores, can also release chemicals to alert other plants to the herbivores so that they can release their toxins before herbivores feed on them.  On a more negative side some plants produce herbicides to kill competing plants and there’s also a plants (such as Indian Pipe and Mistletoe) that steal nutrients from other plants. I could go on about many other examples, including flora that’s not “plants” (e.g Vascular-plant/fungi, Legume/Nitrogen-Fixating-Bacteria, Lichen/Algae & Coral/Zooxanthellae) but back to the review. 	Then of course there’s how plants impact their environment (e.g producing oxygen, taking in Carbon dioxide and other gases, recycling nutrients from the soil and etc.)\n\nI think Xenoblooms lack of interactions is a negative thing because ecosystems are “interactions between organisms and their environment.’ Lacking interactions doesn’t really make it much of an ecosystem.\n\nMixed\nI think it’s odd that there’s an ability to alter nutrient availability and climate, yet it directly doesn’t impact what grows but rather the amount and location of microbes that the plants need. I would have liked nutrient needs & climate tolerances were factors in what could grow (and perhaps even be an option in the plant editor).\nI also imagine some people might be put off by how a lot of things aren’t explained. But for others it might add to the charm of exploration.","September 23, 2015","true","6.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I got excited thinking I could observe and influence evolution. This game has very little to do with evolution. It is more about intelligent design.\n\nThere are 3 tools available to you. Make life happen. Move some dirt. Kill a thing.\n\nI wish I could say something on the gameplay but I had no idea what I was doing most of the time since there is no explanation and most of what I learned was by trial and error while farting out life clouds. It seemed like the yellow power meter allowed you to change conditions in the environment and the purple DNA meter which is filled by killing mature lifeforms which when filled unlocks or "evolves" a new lifeform.\nYou have no direct control over what you unlock or the specific lifeforms you are seeding so it is difficult to create isolated environments.\n\nNone of it matters though. Which "plants" are in the area don't matter except in ecosystem mode. How does sunlight affect each individual organism? I can't tell you and the game won't say much other than unfavourable, tolerable and favourable. Those are the 3 levels of the 9 environmental variables. One of which being love. What does that even mean? What does it influence?\n\nThe fact that the game refers to all of the lifeforms as plants inlcuding bacteria and fungi and the lack of understanding of the mechanics of evolution suggests the dev or devs know absolutely nothing of biology.\n\nI don't get it. I don't understand the point of the game. I don't get what I am supposed to do.\nIf this were being sold as an interactive screensaver as many have described it I could recommend it but it isn't and I can't.","January 12","false","0.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"
