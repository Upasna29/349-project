Only very competitive, dedicated players will enjoy this gem to it's full extent.\nAs for gameplay? The most intense ♥♥♥♥ you could ever ♥♥♥♥ing ask for. My heart skips beats when the pump runs out of water, I shed tears when a chicken dies due to lack of feed, I dance in joy when my opponent's farms dry up (Pwned LOL!) Oh and a word of advice? Don't touch the ♥♥♥♥ing west side, you'll get pwned by my clan (-xXTruFarmz420Xx- we're #2 in the rank right now, look it up scrub).\n\nSingleplayer is like you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing movie: Action, Romance, Drama, and plenty of explosions if you're like me. The storyline could rival anything put out by Spielberg; some nights, I find myself playing the campaign again (5 full hours, ♥♥♥♥♥) while my friends go play basketball or some dumb ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo if you wanna play a dumb ♥♥♥ shit game where you have tea parties in dresses, go play Mincraft or w/e, if you want a badass replayable game, get this.","May 9, 2012","true","0.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","15","20","6","4"

If you like the challenge of beating scores  and levels, this game is for you. I personally was just seeking something a lot more casual and laid back.","June 16, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"
