It's tons of fun warping ships from planet to planet, conquering as you go. Setting up trade routes, upgrading ships and planets and battling off other empires is where the meat of this game really is. Yet, the actual battles feel a bit stale to me; it's all simply based on lining up a bunch of ships and watching them slowly laser each other to death. The combat's certainly not awful, but I'd have to say that there are other games-- such as Homeworld-- that do it much better.

Even on fastest speed, this game is elegant. It's slow, sweeping and magnificent in it's design and application of it's game systems.\n\nDo you enjoy the cinematic quality of two massive battleships going full broadside on one-another while fighters zip around and frigates queue up into firing lines? To zoom in and watch individual firing ports off your prized seige ship pound that enemy planet into submission? This game has it.\n\nDo you prefer to see things as if on a tactical map, removed and distant, like a commander moving his pieces against his foe in a war room? Do you like the challege of managing your territories and loyalties, sending hundreds of ships against your foe from multiple fronts? This game has it.\n\nMacro-managing is a must. In smaller doses, in smaller matches this game can be plaid in a very micro-intensive fashion, as you'll typically only ever fight one fleet at a time. Though the real gorgeous splendor of this game is when you find yourself beset from multiple sides, having to give up territory cause your fleet is elsewhere on the defense, and counter-attacking to send foes scurrying back to their precious resources. This game is very unforgiving in larger matches, and on higher difficulties. AI opponents, according to their presets and difficulty ratings, will use different tactics and strategies to win.\n\nThe graphics of this game are gorgeous for it's time and scale. You can zoom out to a galaxy level and see small icons representing fleets and planets, or you can zoom in to watch ships phase-jump towards disant worlds. It even has cinematic modes for those of you who like to make films! I recommend this game, though only to those who are infatuated with real time strategy games.","July 19, 2014","true","37.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I installed it along with a few other titles, played for a few hours and uninstalled it within a few days. A couple years later I decided to give it another shot and removed it within hours of installing it. In fact, actually googled online to see if there was a way to delete the game from my steam library because I swore the damn game would never fool me into installing it again. It was extremely frustrating trying to learn all of the complex technical nuances to managing and controlling your space fleet, especially when I just downloaded a bunch of other titles and this one has a learning curve, and expects you to actually play through all four of the dense tutorials to gain the minimum level of proficiency to play the game. And of course, I clicked through them without retaining anything, immediately started a skirmish, couldn't control my empire, was confused about what was going on, got obliterated, cursed the game and uninstalled...\n\nOut of profound bordom and a sudden inexplicable itch for large scale depthy 4x, seeing I had this game in my library and admitting I never gave it a fair shake, I installed this game again. I read the other reviews of it and actually watched some Lets-Plays first and rightly concluded that I should give this game an earnest attempt, and I\'m very glad I did.\n\nExperienceGameplay\nIf my preface wasn't verbose enough, let me spell it out now: This game is complex. There are a lot of moving parts and this an RTS so you will have to manage your resource production, fleet building and war tactics at the same time, but because it is a near seamlessly integrated 4x, you will also need to consider commerce, political allegiance, alliances, colonization and world building simultaneously. Don't get me wrong, it's not unbearable and that is a testament to the game design, but it can easily be overwhelming if you aren't trying to learn the game. Also, because there are so many moving parts, the pace of the game is therefore turned downnnn to make it manageable. There are controls to turn it up to 2, 4, 6 and 8 times the normal speed when you're playing AI, thankfully, as sometimes you really have nothing to do except wait for taxes to roll in or for your fleet to be built.\n\nI've played games from S.M. Civ and Total War, two turn based games that integrate a lot of elements. Civ has no RTS and total war seems to break the game up into separate modes of play. Sins-Trinity manages to take all (or most of) the elements from these games and blend them in real time, so that you're building fleets and managing diplomatic relations without waiting on other players. This means that you have to multi-task and keep track of your separate enterprises simultaneously, and without the convenience of your enemies waiting on you. Compared to a straight RTS it is much slower, however. Each planet or asteroid you take on is like a micro-base that needs to be built up and more microbases lead to greater technology advancement as well as board control.\n\nA 1v1 AI skirmish can last anywhere from 45mins to a couple hours. A2v2v2v2 skirmish can last several hours. This could be a plus or minus depending on how you like to play. It was a plus for me. I thoroughly enjoy developing enemies and maybe a nemisis throughout the game and slowly but violently encrouching/sabatouring/assaulting my way through them over the course of hours.\n\nThere is no campain mode. Didn't bother me at all as I think most RTS campains are just skirmishes with limited supplies/tech trees and blurbs of dialogue. Jes gimme da skirmish\n\nTech trees are interesting, and even though there are only 3 factions to play as, there are some very interesting playstyles and tactics. I won\'t talk too much about this as I feel like I'm only scratching the surface, but suffice to say I am approaching the triple digit hours mark and I feel like I'm only scratching the surface.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there is an active modding community for this game. I haven\'t gotten into it yet.\n\nGraphics, Music and Sound\nLets be real, this game is kind of old. It has aged well but the models aren't exactly awe inspiring. It is actually sometimes tricky to even zoom in correctly to get a magnifying glass on your ships, so most of the times your fleet and structures will be a 2d blip on your screen. The particle effects aren't spectacular, but at least they don't bog down your machine. Where this game makes its money is in the solar system maps. You might have to use your imagination a bit, which I actually kind of like. The planets, bustling with life and activity and the constructs you place in its orbit, the amorphous gaseous nebulas (which actualre are gorgeous), stars and planets in the distant backgrounds... there is something sweetly satisfying and oddly profound about the execution here, about the sense of space and scale. You feel power in the worlds you conquer, colonize and build up. There is an extraordinarily seemless and fluid zoom function in the game as well, from full on solarsystem right down to your tiniest trade ships, and you will use it a lot as you manage your empire. If you can immerse yourself in it, I think its fantastic. If you need more powerful graphics than I don't think this is your ticket. I would invite anyone to look at the screenshots I've personally posted or anyone else, and I'd like to remind you when you do that building a fleet can be difficult. So while these pics may not have a lot of context for you and maybe just look like a patterned collection of polygonal shapes, to the people who built them they are a statement of our economic and technological success.\n\nMusic feels kind of lackluster. I actually mute it and play radiohead or the Stellaris OST in the back. It's not crap but not memorable at all either.\n\nVoice overs are fine at first and then get repetitive. Its funny because when you\'re mass producing one unit type and you have your game speed turned up, you will hear the same sound byte over and over again. The diplomacy voice overs are downright irritating, tho. Every time they offer a mission or you succeed or don\'t it is the same voice message, and over a game that takes several hours it can be exhausting\n\nFun Factor\nThe last thing I'll include is a word about how much fun it is. This game is the sort that's not particularly easy to learn and much more difficult to master. If you enjoy games that demand attention, observant learning and epic imaginations than I think you might enjoy this game as I do. The combat takes place on epic scales, it can be incredibly nuanced and technical depending on how in depth you want to get, and I think that it speaks volumes to it's balance and staying power that the SoSE subreddit is still very active after several years of its release, as is the modding community. All in all, if you can swallow some of the detractors than I think this game is loaded with hours and hours and hours of rich entertainment, wins, failures and memorable conflicts.\n\nVerdictIf this is on sale - Buy it, I love it but I wish I had gotten Rebellion\nIf you\'re into the space empire building genre, I say get it or perhapse wait until SoSE: Rebellion goes on sale\nIf you\'re not particularly into the genre - this is an interesting blend between RTS and 4x, so it will be paced somewhere in between. It is older, and though it is unique enough to warrant its own playthrough for its own consideration, there is a plethora of games that could fall into that category. The graphics and presentation in general is dated. If you can deal with these things than this is a wonderfully entertaining release.","May 31","true","61.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Discovered game is just bugged. Sometimes the AI doesn't build or is very delayed no matter what difficulty you give the AI. This is what was causing my previous difficulty issues, so it's just a bug. Nah didn't report it in forums since I don't know hw to replicate it. But if you make a game with you and AI's versus AI's, look at yours 5 minutes after you start and you'll sometimes notice one that hasn't built anything but a coloy ship that is sitting in front of the frigate factory. Sometimes you can save and restart the game and it'll work again, sometimes they never come to life. This bug has been frustrating obviously as the old review will explain.\n\nI have read how there's a new patch is coming from Stardock I believe and that's pretty cool that they continue to support Sins of a Solar Empire and, I hear, working on a 2.0.\n\nIn light of these things review will be switching to thumbs up. Also, if you haven't zoomed in to your shops and planets, which I hadn't done for months (treated this more like Master of Orion 1 and 2 than what it is), please make sure you do, you'll see something remakrable and realize the videos were shot in game. Considering how that'll be in the next version is something to look forward to.\n\nI still don't like buying anything from Steam but not due to this game, and instead, due to them continuing to sell defunct and no longer developed games, games that it is documented were ruined by their developer (i.e. search "Starforge"). To me that's a bit of a scam, which is pretty funny in light of the ideological claims of a company bragging about having no boss (http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/people.html).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld Review below:\n\nUninstalled.  Again, comp "normal" means "comp vicious" instead, menu interface not indexed to the right value.  Game used to play fair, indexing working fine, maybe Rebellion's install of Micrsoft C (and some libary for Ironclad) is corrupted and corrupted the whole series now.  But, as the company doesn't care about it, the game is unplayable for me and anyone else who likes to just play single player games with comp allies and enemies, a casual player.  As noted on my unofficial support forum posts for Rebellion, this bug disappears when playing over the network, but the cheating/unfair/vicious comps showing up in your game because some coder was sloppy and a company doesn't care about game quality in single player mode, that persists in single player with Trinity as well.  If you think SSE is like an updated Master of Orion, the game we all wanted in MOO 2, MOO 3, etc, avoid it, it isn't such a game.  Do not buy this unless you only play to play online, it will not give you a fun single player experience, only entirely unpredictable results because of this bug.","July 17, 2014","true","127.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While each map is essentially the same, (limited number of planets, but with varying pathways and tactical benefits) the strategic choices you make can have a severe impact later. Also the game has an excellent aesthetic to it, each ship is fairly well detailed and brings your forces to life. When you see beautiful ship being ripped apart it presents as a true loss.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lancobus/recommended/201290/","Lancobus","James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lancobus/","491 products in account","An epic RTS game that utilises fast expansion mechanics that could give you a tactical weakness, unlike more simply games such as the command and conquer fanchise. There are multiple different types of ships to choose from, which nearly all of them have a direct opposite that they are designed to destroy, meaning you need to learn quickly or be destroyed. However, saying that, the auto AI on targetting is second to none, as it'll target its counterpart and work together with fleets of other ships to burn down individual targets also, without the player micromanaging it. This is important as you probably won't be having a linear fight in 1 planetary orbit, as you could be defending numerous worlds at the same time! This game has the finest parts from titles like haegemonia: legions of iron, in regards to upgrades and planetary combat and then star trek armarda style fights where fleet size means nothing against fleet composition.\n\nAn example of such epic gameplay is I entered a 1v1 with the AI on normal. The AI discovered pirates, bribed them with a bounty on my head and the pirates sent a massive fleet that took me right back to my capital world for a last  ditch defence. I'd made a capital ship (massive, well armoured and armed!) and a handful of frigates and managed to beat the fleet back. That then resulted in rapid expansion, putting me in a better position than I started with. Its situations like that which you won't find with other games.

It's damn hard to quit once you get going.\nIt's much like Master of Orion 2 (which i looove) and any other game in the genre, but it does it well enough to stand out. You have 3 distinct faction, you have your research trees all a little different  for each faction, diplomacy, pirate raids, planets to colonize and ore and crystal to mine.\nThe AI is quite good, both for combat and general faction to faction interaction. Watching your fleet grow in power (gain xp pr captil ship and upgrade them!) and numbers and winning battles is awesome fun.\n\nI would of course have more faction then the 3 here. I would also love bigger research trees and have them even more distinct to each faction. But that is just because i love the game and want more, not because it's a bad as it is.\n\nI do recommend the game, and that when you play it you rappidly try out bigger solar systems (more planets) as well as push the difficulty up on a few NPC factions.

It also has multiple big mods that really add on it (Halo mod: Sins of the prophets and a Star wars mod). Multiplayer is great especially if the game drags on for 2 hours (multiplayer games are often short: you either get rushed or you lose all your planets with doomsday weapons). There are lots of tense fights that keep going for 10 minutes with a lot of micro management.\n\nThe AI is good, there are different AI types (economic/aggresive/defensive/...) that offer a big variety of play styles, put it on random to get the most fun out of it. Increasing difficulty only changes the income variable of the AI (Very hard is like 8 times more resources out of a planet than you would normally get). Having a good chokepoint is the key to victory when playing against harder Ai's.\n\nThe game gets a bit laggy when you are with 10 players and everyone has 1000+ units but other than that you can run this game on a laptop with a decent cpu.","December 31, 2013","true","110.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here are my problems with the game.\n\nEverything costs too much money/resources. It seems you just spend hours and hours saving to be able to afford the most basic research. Almost every building requires research and once you finally get that research you'll find that you have no room for the building you need to build because every zone you conquer has a VERY small limit to how many buildings can be built in it. As well the bonuses the techs in the tech tree give are stupidly small for how much they cost. The tech tree is large but I how long I will have to for the resources to spend on research before I can get a ship that isn't complete garbage, apparently it's longer than 4 hours so I am not interested.\n\nThis game seems like it took the worst parts of Shogun 2, Age of Empires and Starcraft and threw them into a gigantic, boring, confusing game.\n\n","May 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

Multiplayer is not really that good because unless you play on fast-speed and small maps, a game would take hours.\n\nI play it from time to time, but I don't think I will be paying up full price to get an extra unit (which will probably be as dumb as the others if A.I. controlled) anytime soon.","September 15, 2014","false","314.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It could be good, maybe.... The problem here is that the AI in this game gets a massive boost to income from word go, so they have plenty to spend on beefing up their fleet. That fleet you just killed with two flagships in it? There are about three more behind it.\n\nThere is only one way to play this game: Be Aggressive. Don't like playing that way? Like to take it slow and enjoy yourself? To bad! This game is very quick to beat you into line. There is only one play style.\n\nDon't bother going to the community for help either. I think I've run into more people telling me to "Get Better" or "Be More Aggressive" or, and this takes that cake, "Stop playing because you suck and this game isn't for you"\n\nIn summary: Looks nice, has potential. But a steep difficulty curve, unfair AI advantages, and a bad community spoil it.\n\nI want to like this game, I really do. The problem is it just doesn't like me. I'll keep playing, trying to find a way to beat the AI when I'm kneecapped from the beginning.","July 19, 2014","false","11.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","1"

Its scale is unmatched at the current time. Very similar to Civilization but on a larger and deeper scale. You can play on small systems consisting of 1 star and maybe 15 planets all the way up to 9 star systems with over 100 planets. Only downsides I can think of  are the lack of any kind of Campaign/Story (its a skirmish type game) and the slow starts of matches due to lack of resources and research. The AI in single player skirmishes is no pushover and can easily give you a run for your money if desired.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic real time strategy game with a unmatched scale. Easily worth the $20 since it comes with the base game as well as two content expansions.","January 8, 2013","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am enjoying this a lot.\n\nI think the one disappointment is that the game (and it's publisher's website, for that matter) allude to a ten-thousand year backstory for this game, but then once you start playing, it's a sandbox with no actual plot other than achieve the victory conditions.  If you're going to keep dropping hints about a story, you should provide some story some way, and if that's not your intent, then why bother with the hints?\n\nI do recommend playing with the Trinity expansion, even though Steam gives you the option to turn it off.  It makes the game more well-rounded.","May 9, 2012","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the kind of game that can get really intense. A typical match will be several hours long. Building a fleet takes a lot of time, and the actual battles and maneuvering takes a lot of time as well. The longer you wait the bigger armies will get, and it isn't that uncommon to have times when another team is of equal power to yourself. The AI are smart, the controls are excellent, and the options menus are nice. I recommend using the map editor program, Galaxy Forge. It is very easy to use and will give you the variety and control over the maps you want. Great game.

SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE!\n\nThis game rocks my socks. I would call it "daddy" anyday in bed.\n\nAnyway, this game features lots of pretty visuals especially when you turn on cinematic mode and zoom in. Playing fully zoomed out isn't the prettiest though so the two extremes are kind of strange.\n\nGameplay-wise this is a strange melding of CIV and standard RTS play .You research your tech, manage diplomacy, and upgrade your planets in a way similar to CIV but the combat, construction, and strategies all come from your average RTS. I like this melding and the experience it provides the gamer.\n\nAlso, games take an average of 2 hours, much shorter than I expected. That is if you play using the recommended maps for small groups of FFA's, 2v2, or 3v3. I can see if you are using one of the massive maps how it could take much longer, but that it something I have yet to experience.\n\nAlso tutorials are for lamers and casuals.

Its scale is unmatched at the current time. Very similar to Civilization but on a larger and deeper scale. You can play on small systems consisting of 1 star and maybe 15 planets all the way up to 9 star systems with over 100 planets. Only downsides I can think of  are the lack of any kind of Campaign/Story (its a skirmish type game) and the slow starts of matches due to lack of resources and research. The AI in single player skirmishes is no pushover and can easily give you a run for your money if desired.\n\nOverall this is a fantastic real time strategy game with a unmatched scale.

Trinity comes with the base game and the two expansions, Diplomacy and Entrenchment.\n\nEntrenchment is a fantastic expansion that brings in space stations for the various races as well as vastly boosted defense weapons.\n\nDiplomacy however is very broken. Its far too easy to win a game (at least against the AI) with it and it really takes away a lot of the fun. Should you choose to buy it and play I would suggest turning the Diplomatic Victory condition off.\n\nHowever the major thing to keep in mind, and this can be a deal breaker for some, is that there is absolutely no campaign. Its just a series of maps, from small (a star and a few planets) to very large (up to 5 solar systems, with multiple stars and planets). You can also have up to 12 (if I remember correctly) players on a single map.\n\nIts a really fun game that you can spend hours on without actually winning (or losing) that session so prepare for the long haul.","July 19, 2012","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different races make for varying types of ships and abilities. My personal favorite are the Humans, but that is because the super weapon is massively over powered. Essentially in this game you build up planetary resources by upgrading planets and asteroids, then you research various science, social, and military trends while allocating resources to search out new sources of resources and defend them from pirates and other factions and races. If you don't have a gaming PC, don't play anything other than the small systems with the visualizations all turned down... otherwise, the visuals are quite fantastic in their details, and you can work games with 5 stars with a net of 80 nodes. The pirates get excessively difficult to deal with if they are being paid off more frequently, so if you can defend your systems moderately, just take the hit and repair your system after they hit. Generally you get a pop up notification saying where they will hit, so you can adjust for your fleet to get there... invest in hanger bays and mines.","July 31, 2015","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
