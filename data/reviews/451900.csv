It could get out of hand if you have hundreds of long dialogues, but if it's just UI elements it'd be fine, and it's the easiest thing to implement.\n\n- Would be nice to prioritize tasks for the unwashed.","March 23","true","5.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","1"

Love RTS games, this one just has such a nice vibe to it!\n\nSo the game is pretty well designed, most of the resource gathering is automated with a percentage based system used to distribute the 'workload' between wood cutters and gatherers.\n\nThe Game runs at a smooth 60 fps, no frame rate drops at all, very impressive!\n\nIt reminds me of age of empires to some degree but it includes elements of Warcraft, with the cannons reminding me of Nod from C&C haha :)\n\nHere's me playing the first mission: https://youtu.be/DU8A2trD3rM","March 15","true","110.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Even more important than this however: Is this a good game? read below to find out instead of reading through this nonsense and you'll see what I think.\n\n\nPros:\n-The gameplay is quite fun and can be enjoyable watching your peasants running around doing their jobs.\n-Automation is indeed a thing. tear through resources and march out troops all without pressing a single button once it's finally set up. you still have to control the troops, so don't get lazy.\n-The graphics look fairly nice. I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but it fits the gameplay style.\n\nOk, this section is a little empty in comparison, but honestly there's not much to say. It's got good points, but the bad points are a bit bigger and it's currently 1:13 for me. give me a break.\n\nCons:\n-Controls are a bit messed up and not what you'd expect. For example the hotkey responses for the stone and iron mine are switched around. Also the champion comes prepared with a portable cannon for some reason. How he turns swords, shields and gold into a god damn cannon I will never know. Maybe he's a wizard.\n-Not much information is given about this game at all. it throws you in and says "have fun!". This can be enjoyable for games like dark souls however this is an rts, and I'd expect a bit more of a tutorial for hotkeys, controls etc. Even if it's just a side bar.\n-Difficulty is off the scale! Again, it works perfectly well for dark souls, however I can't get past mission 1 on casual. I'm figuring out how to train knights and bowmen, and at 20 minutes or so the enemy is engaging me with dragons, magicians and mounted archers. I tried it again just to check on normal difficulty, and they do the same stuff. practically zero difference.\n\n\nScore: 7/10\nReason:\nLike I said above, the game is fun. However I do believe a little more refinement and testing should go into this game before being sold like this. Hotkeys, Difficulty, Tutorial etc. should all be in a game such as this.\nI will point something out I've noticed recently however. What is it with developers using unity to code real time strategy recently? I mean it works but for a 2d game, there are a few programs out there that could make the game a bit better. Just an idle thought.","May 28","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you are into this kind of game you should definetly check out WizardCraft.\n\nYou build up your base, towers as defense and your troops/army (actually as many as you like). You can upgrade your base/units with victory points that you have to earn during the battle. The graphics are just cute and the music gives a nice atmosphere to the game. I especially like the map editor where you can create your own battlegrounds and the skirmish mode where you can have a battle session on one of over 50 maps and just focus on your supply chains, building up your army and destroy your enemies (on top of that all kind of parameters are customizable!). Also I love the dragons and the little gandalfs (wizards) that come in different types.\n\nAfter a couple of hours playing this, it still is fun and I can definetly recommend it!","March 14","true","19.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

In the first two missions you have a small tutorial in the back which helps you getting started with the game.\n\nThe game also has a skirmish mode and a map editor, where the Players can build their own maps. On top of it you can send your own created maps to the developer who then can include your map into the "Community maps" tab in the skirmish mode. This makes your map available to all Players, which is extremely cool in my opinion (note: Only 100 community maps can get included and only 2 maps per map creator).\n\nThe war system is simple: build up your army and destroy your enemies Castle. You have a variety of units, which you can throw at your enemy (for example 4 types of wizards; dragons; archers and swordsmen on horses; portable cannons; etc.).\n\nWizardCraft is a singleplayer game, but it is possible that multiplayer will be build in in the future. The developer said that he is looking into it, however Mulitplayer mode for this game can not be confirmed 100%.\n\nMy thoughts\n\nWizardCraft is a great game and has huge potential to become a competitive game once Multiplayer is there (if it is going to be build in of course).\n\nThe developer supports his game and reacts to his community very fast. You can also see him commenting on youtube videos. This is someting you don´t see very often from other developers.\n\nThe game is more than worth the $ 11.","June 3","true","40.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
