Onikira - Demon Killer takes a bold step into the darker side of Japanese tradition and mythology, pitting you against the dark energies of hellish realms that threaten to creep into the world of the living and feast upon the souls of the unsuspecting.\n\nThe gritty, heavy visual style of the game and its usage of dark demonic imagery and lots of blood red hues gave me strong vibes of the PS2 era Shinobi and evokes that same kind of obscure attraction to the Japanese underworld felt from that series. The gameplay itself takes cues from only the greatest of action games with a grading system strongly resembling Devil May Cry's, insane almost endless aerial combos reminiscent of Bayonetta, and brightly colored red and blue orbs for replenishing your health or energy that fans of the Onimusha series will be familiar with. In the end, this is a developer who wears their influences on their sleeve, and some mighty fine influences these are.\n\nThe music is dark, heavy, and fitting. The percussions beat with the strength and power of a taiko drummer, the eerie and almost gothic sounding riffs of the interspersed guitar tearing in and out. When I hear the evil and ominous melodies in Onikira with their Eastern overtones I am instantly reminded of some of the best music from Mortal Kombat, particularly of the 3 and 4 era, and this is a very good thing when it comes to the subject matter dealt with in such a game.\n\nCurrently Onikira features two very lengthy, sufficiently challenging (though a hard mode would be nice for the old schoolers!), and detailed levels and one outstanding boss battle. If the boss fight we're shown here is any indication, Onikira has some huge ambitions when it comes to monster designs and the bosses will hopefully continue this giant titan-like structure that gives the current boss such an epic feel. Aside from hacking and slashing your way through the first story based levels available currently. There's a combat arena facing you against waves of increasingly difficult enemies, and is the perfect place to hone and perfect your skills while testing your ability against the rest of the world with the included Leaderboards.\n\nJust like these great hacknslash titles of the past, Onikira - Demon Killer has some of the sharpest and most responsive action around. You can slice your enemies with a barrage of normal attacks, toss them in the air with a heavy attack and continue your onslaught with a follow-up air combo. Freakish oni heads float above shooting lazers at you while you use the dash ability to dodge the beam and keep the combo meter going. Boss battles are already beyond exhilirating and show huge ambition in size, and the weapons you're given to slay these grotesque creatures with are already a serious blast to experiment with.\n\nIn the end, this is an already satisfying action slash 'em up with some incredible influences and only a few non-gamebreaking rough spots, and if you're as excited as I am about its future there's no better time to get involved than now.","November 15, 2014","true","6.7"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","64","73","0","2"

However, for a game just out of Early Access it has a few too many basic day one glitches that should have been sorted out in general tests before even considering leaving EA. Also in its current state, it’s worse than what it was in Greenlight.\n\nFirstly, I haven't finished the Campaign as I played 1hour, quit and came back only to find out I had to start the level again as checkpoints don't save and there is no save game. Along with no save-game I can’t even continue a level due to Crashes and Re-Validating Steam Files deleting my Save File for this game. With that said I can’t recommend you buy this and here is why in my Pro’s and Con’s so far.\n\nPros:\n♦ Decent Storyline so far (I can't comment fully as I haven't finished the game fully as of release due to crashes and Save File Deletions)\n♦ Good Soundtrack\n♦ Awesome tooltips for some of the controls (I say some as some are still fully not explained and are in Controller talk all the way through the game even if you are using a keyboard. Also, I'm not sure if these tooltips would change from Keyboard to Controller if I had a controller plugged in, but they worked for Keyboard)\n♦ Perfect Controller/Keyboard Support (I say this in terms of working, figuring out what buttons do what may be a different story)\n♦ Awesome Artwork\n♦ Stunning Graphics\n♦ Cool hidden level features such as the Photo frame Switch lock idea (Keeps the game interesting and unique)\n♦ Awesome Re-mappable Controls for Keyboard\n♦ Steam Trading Cards\n♦ Awesome number of Achievements\n♦ Nice variety of weapons, attacks and enemies (See cons Relating to Weapons)\n♦ Great variety of scenery, obstacles and such between fights sort of adding a nice platformer aspect to the game\n♦ Awesome Devs who seem to try to listen to feedback as best as possible (I’ve talked to multiple Devs before but it looks like they have let this die… I’ve just posted in the Discussion part of the game and will wait to hear from them)\n♦ Eargasmic Sound effects (For when there isn't a really loud highpitched crackling sound)\n\nCons:\n♦ Porting to Fuse when the Game has never worked properly on Steam (Someone asked where the Devs had been and they responded “Busy Porting to Fuse”. I find this weird as there are many bug/glitch reports and crash reports for the Steam Version that haven’t been fixed. Plus Onikira, has never worked more than 50% in Greenlight and out of Greenlight for it to warrant being ported to another platform.\n♦ No Difficulty Settings (This is annoying as there is no incentive to play the game over on a harder difficulty or for bragging rights etc)\n\n♦ Checkpoints aren't actually Checkpoints (I say this in the sense that I played for a long time and got past the first boss and went to main menu and had to start the whole level again, not from checkpoint)\n♦ No save points (This is really bad as you have to play a whole level before you can leave and come back and from the looks of the first level the levels are really long)\n♦ 50% of the time the controls are in controller language and 50% in keyboard (This is bad as it confuses both markets and doesn't satisfy one. There should be a way to select your method of input which converts the whole game into the method of input chosen)\n♦ Can only scroll backwards through Highscores until Light On Your Feet (This is annoying as you should be able to loop through the categories and not hit what I call is a "Brick Wall". Also if you try to scroll backwards past Light on your Feet and then Scroll Forward through the categories again, you have to keep clicking forward until it changes category depending how many times you clicked to try and go backwards past Light on your Feet)\n♦ Continue isn't a Continue (It's more a Level Select as you aren't continuing off where you left but infact the start of the Level you have selected to continue you from. In my understanding continue would be to continue where you left off)\n♦ Can pay $20 to get an extra copy of the Game but the game doesn’t have multiplayer (Why would I want an extra Game? I’d rather ingame content)\n♦ No advanced graphics options\n♦ No multiplayer whatsoever, not even co-op or verse mode\n♦ You can pause on the Combat Arena Main Menu and still choose game modes whilst the Pause Menu is Open (This is bad as each Menu overlays each other and you can click on both menus at once)\n♦  You can pause over the top of Tooltips and Dialogue in game (This  shouldn’t be able to happen until the tooltip or dialogue box has gone)\n♦ No voice over (Not needed but would really enhance the game)\n♦ Inconsistency between game names On the Main Menu it's called Combat Arena... however it's called Challenge Arena when you enter it (This is an inconsistency that shouldn’t ever exist)\n♦ No way to tell what keyboard control lines up to what xbox control (For example on an Xbox Controller it says "A" is "Jump" on an Keyboard it says "Jump" is "SpaceBar" but "SpaceBar" is not "A")\n♦ Can buy Upgrades from the Soul Shop for Blades I don't seem to have yet (This is weird, as I shouldn't be able to purchase an upgrade to a blade if I don't actually own it)\n♦ Beat the First Level and didn’t unlock a new Weapon (This I found weird as mentioned above I can buy upgrades for multiple Weapons when I don’t own them)\n♦ Default controls for PC have conflicts (This is because "W" is set as up and "W" is set as special. Both these have default Alt buttons but this shouldn't be the case)\n♦ Souls stack on death (You can get a checkpoint near a bunch of vases, enemies or whatever containing soul points for the soul shop, collect the souls and just keep dying and repeating to collect an unlimited amount)\n♦ Leaderboards are broken (Blank names, scores and positions until you highlight over them to make them appear. Some people’s names are just ????. Also, no way to easily locate your Steam Friends or your own score)\n♦ Have to press the "Main Menu" button twice to get to the Main Menu from within game\n♦ Level Select is broken (I Started a new game, beat The Breach and says I got a different score and rank to what I got. Also says I have beaten Daimyo's End as it has a score and rank when I haven't played it in this playthrough yet. All other levels are still locked)\n♦ When continuing levels they randomly Crash (I've witnessed crashes on the first two levels, as I can't progress any further due to the crashes, after the level loads and during fights.\n♦ Re-Validating Files Deleted my Save-File (I re-validated to try and fix the crash problem and lost my current save which should never happen unless stated in an update as nothing should have been broken)\n♦ Random Crashes when on menus (I went to select a level and got a random crash even before I got to the loading screen)\n♦Load Screen animation is laggy and slow (This just makes the game look poor even before you have got into the game, which is bad in any case).\n♦Combat Arena 100% Broken & Never Worked (Major Game Modes shouldn’t be broken)\n\nMy opinion on the game now it’s 100% out of Early Access (EA) is the Devs didn’t test the complete game with the public before removing it from (EA) and just went ahead and did it anyway. It seems as though they still rushed the game towards the end as from day 1 of the game I’ve been reporting the same errors and bugs and they have seemingly progressed from minor glitches to major game breaking crashes.\n\nOverall, in its current state it's worse than it was in Greenlight and paying $15-20 for something that crashes randomly and upon level selection, deletes save files and has major game modes that never worked... then I'd say do not buy this.","December 2, 2015","false","14.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","12"

After a first session without any problems, the second time I I tried to play the game it kept crashing on the first minute of gameplay, every time. Googling about it brings a lot of people having similar problems, and there are no solutions at the moment.\n\nIt wouldn't be such a major problem if the devs continued working on it but the game was abandoned soon after release. The game came out on August 2015, the next week a patch to fix performance issues and add achievements was released. Since then; nothing. It's been 7 months now and there are no news from the devs.\n\nOther than the crashes, my only complaint would be how it doesn't allow you to disable vibration on the controller, and this is a game you don't want to play with a keyboard.\n\n--- This review was written on April 2016, if there has been an update later fixing the crashes, consider the review not valid anymore. ---","April 8","false","2.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

(i hope the jumping animation and timming get a bit better and longer)\n\nPrice is at 10 [but 5 bucks now!? heck go get it in my openion] and argubally i'd say it's worth it, get it now if you can deal with the bugs and have patience, or get it later down the line with beta release or near official release.\n\nShamless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","November 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","1"

The Feudal Japan setting and art style are really appealing, the gameplay is pretty good (think Metroid meets Devil May Cry), and the combat's pretty easy to get into. What may put some off, however, is how sluggish the game runs. There are bouts of slowdown, and the game even crashed at one point. Still, I'm willing to look past these flaws (and I'm confident that the developers will polish this game before the final release) to enjoy this game. Again, it's Early Access, so don't expect the game to be perfect.","April 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Only 1 or 2 weapons have anything to upgrade on right now.  The upgrade "station" seems in hap hazard location, i prefer the upgrade anytime instead of wondering when the next shine is.\n\nPickups: (50% working, maybe)  Orbs from enemies do not actually fill your health back up, not sure if this is just GUI issue or if it is not impleneted as i randomly got health back.  Also, the coins/dragons blood locations were well thought out and not too bad to get to, but they were just after... a check point so you had to pick up each time. interesting GLITCH / oversight if you died and went back to the checkpoint you could pick up the item again and you will notice that you STILL have the number after you picked it up the first time and it just keeps adding.\n\nCheckpoints:  These are pretty well set, but thought i was going to be stuck in a few places just the way you have to try the options and fight the controls sometimes on (grappling hook / air glide) or chased by vines that you have to do 'dodge' dash all the way across the screen since running isn't fast enough.","July 5, 2015","true","2.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

While the game is in Early Access, this is the review of the final product that will be released the 27th of August.\n\nSTORYThe story is your typical "feudal japan fantasy" featured in so many movies: demons come to the earth, someone with magic slays the demons, they come back stronger than ever centuries later, the player starts a journey to slay them.\nTo be fair, there is very little story in the game, told through animated cutscenes or small dialogues during the game. It is very basic, but lacks anything to make you care about your quest. But lets be honest: you are here to kill demons in cool ways.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game looks gorgeous: the hand-drawn sprites are very polished and the animations are fluid. But the real star is the background: god rays, cities burning to the ground, beautiful trees and gigantic demons are just some of the things that really made my jaw drop while playing this game. Fans of this art style will have a lot to stare at.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is a mixture between Devil May Cry and Guacamelee: you have a style system which rewards you for beating enemies using various combos and weapons, and sometimes you will fight enemies that require you to destroy their shield with a certain weapon in order to defeat them. There are also some fairly easy platforming sections, that usually lead to secrets and hidden upgrades.\nIn the years I grew tired of hack'n'slash games, but Onikira felt fresh to me: maybe it was the use of 2D, maybe it was the art style, maybe it was the setting, but I rarely got tired while slaying demons through the 7 levels of the game. If you are a fan of the genre, there is enough variety here to satisfy your hunger for non-stop action.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game isn't all that hard: your only way to avoid getting hit is dodging, but sometimes that is not all that easy because of the huge number of enemies on the screen that make it impossible to see who's doing what. That wouldn't be a problem if the health that the enemies dropped didn't heal you. Also, some of the bosses are so big and slow that they are easier to beat than a group of standard demons. The really challenging part is the Combat Arena: multiple levels a-la God of War challenges that require all your skills and reflexes, resulting in some very frustrating rage quits.\n\nSOUNDBoth the sound effects and the soundtrack do their job: nothing memorable. The soundtrack will easily appeal to fans of japanese movies.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are a total of 7 levels (each between 30 to 40 minutes long), plus Combat Arena, hidden secrets and 45 Steam achievements make for a game that, if enjoyed, will make you stay for more content.\n\nOverall, fans of hack'n'slash and action will have a blast playing this game. However, if you are looking for a game with variety or more depth, you won't be satisfied.\n\nStory: 6\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7.5\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","August 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","0"

Each hit I land feeling satisfying. Dashing around and swiftly taking out each demon that stands before me. My combo meter rises to show that I have done a good job.

Very VERY few times so far, I've had a stutter, character was out of place when reloading a checkpoint and some audio cut out too early. Nothing major. The graphics options are bare bones.

In Onikira you can do both, you could just about get along by button bashing although you'd have to be pretty prepared to die on a regular basis. I like beat em ups that have combo's, if done well it gives combat more depth. Onikira thankfully pulls of combos well, you can pull of ground and aerial combo's easily. Your able to seamlessly transition between weapons in battle allowing you not only to pull of great combos for example slicing the enemy up on the ground with the katana then lifting and slaughtering them airborne with a nagita, then hammering back down to the floor with the dual blades.\n\nEach weapon has different attack combos and more can be purchased by using souls at the store that comes along every now and again. As you build up combos you will gain a rank that will which will effect the amount of souls you collect to spend on combos. Throughout the levels you'll come across dragon-blood shards that once you have collected three you'll gain a permanent increase to your health.\n\nThe enemy variety in the game is pretty good, there's a selection of both airborne and ground enemies and each has different attack mechanics that can either be dodged or is some cases countered like the bomb throwing demon samurai where you can hit the bomb back at them. There are several boss battles throughout, each requiring different tactics to win. The bosses look pretty cool like the giant demon samurai.\n\nOne thing I personally didn't like was that there is no block which means that you must rely on your dodge. The main problem with this is particularly against bosses and tougher enemies is that often you can't dodge their attacks due to their attack radius being so large. It can become quite frustrating, that being said with enough skill and making sure you dodge well and stay airborne quite frequently you'll manage to avoid most attacks.\n\nThere's is also some platforming elements in the game, these usually entail wall jumping or running away from something such as fire for part of the level. The platforming sequences are not usually long and can provide a nice break after a tough fight. There are quite a few secret areas where you'll find the dragonblood fragments as well as bonus souls so keep on the look out for areas to explore.\n\nGraphically the game is not bad, like I said I like the art style though I would have liked everything to look a lot sharper so that everything stands out a bit more, everything is has almost a blur effect over it. The game currently does have a few bugs but nothing game breaking has happened to me quite yet but that's the nature of early access games. As long as it doesn't translate into a buggy full release I'll hold off the scorn for now.\n\nIn terms of actual playable content you can only access a few levels at the moment with more on the way. Levels are a decent length and tend to be pretty well paced. As the developers add levels they do intend to add more enemies too. I think that for $10 its not a bad price for the game if you want to play it in its limited early access form. I like Onikira it's a solid beat em up that will entertain and for $10 its well worth it when it comes to full release.","February 25, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay is remenicient of the shank series, which quick hack and slash gameplay helped make it a hit also the combat is simple, clean and easy to use but is also varied with different combos to make the games combat not just a one button mash type game.\n\nThe graphics are also like shank, but the games graphics do stand out by having it be dark and it really complements the gameplay and other aspects of the game like the flashy combat and smooth controls.\n\nThe story of the game is that a man fuses his soul with a dragon giving him power and blah blah blah im sorry but i can't get invested in a plot that is cliché as hell, of course it fits the plot perfectly butit needs to be more well different it needs somthing to stand out and grab the player.\n\nBut there is problems with the game, i know i can't speak for everyone but these are the some of the problems that i had. The main one was the controls, i personaly used the keyboard but all the instructions were xbox buttons and made it hard to find out which botton i need to press not just too use attacks in the game but to start the game and i looked for a way to change it maybe im just blind but if this is a problem than a wish for it to be fixed if is not fixed already.\n\n\nI hope what i said will want people to at least try the game out and know im just going to put my pros and cons into points\n\nPros:\n\n.Gameplay is simple but varied as well as quick and feels good\n.graphics are simple but look good and fit the games theme well, as well as complement the gameplay simplicity\n\nCons:\n\n.Game is suffering from instructionary problems and confuse the player and downright make the game less enjoyable... well at least until you get the controls downpat\n\n.Story does fit the game to a tee but is quite cliché and can make people just skip past it or even think less of the game as a hole because of this\n\nWhile this game has it's problems the pros out weight the cons and with some love and effection as well as competent work this game could really shine and i wholeheartedly reccomend this game to people especially if you have played and liked any of the shank games.","January 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Anything with Samurai... I'm in. No questions asked. At first I didn't recommend this game because of some bugs I found. One of the most annoying was this crackling noise that accompanied the whole game. But after a little tinkering aka reinstalling the game and verifying the game cache the problem seems to be fixed so if you have that problem that's what I would recommend doing.\nThe levels are quite lengthy, you have to finish the level before quitting or you'll restart it, though which is nice seeing as there are only seven. The game itself runs very well and looks great. Combat is nice. tight and clean. Nice amount of moves/weapons to unlock. Basically a game that isn't over the top or complicated. Its just a solid game with a few bugs here and there. One of the main bugs has to be in the arena mode. I forget which one it is, I believe it has to do with getting a 100 hit combo but it loads so many enemies at once it crashes. Other than that though, it was 10.49 well spent.\nAlso the Devs are very active in making the game as best as it can be. You'll see a comment from one below asking which sound card I used in an effort to fix the crackling and will also see many comments from them in the discussions. I take my hat off to Digital Furnace Games on that.

That's because it is a cool game. However, that alone is not enough for me to recommend this game to anyone. Yes, it does look promising, and I'm looking forward to playing the final product, but as it stands, it is still very clearly in the very early stages of development. If you're looking for an addictive 2D action game, I'd suggest checking out either Shank or Strider instead. Now then, let's get on with my Pros and Cons of this game.\n\nTL;DR - Cons far outweigh the Pros. Highly suggest waiting on this purchase.\n\nPros\nBeautiful Artwork\nDecent Soundtrack\nFull Controller Support\nSteam Leaderboards\nCons\nMenu Has a Very Minimal Amount of Options. You can adjust the resolution, check fullscreen on/off, set anti-aliasing level, and that's pretty much all. Would be nice to at least have an option to adjust video quality, brightness, difficulty, V-Sync, and of course some advanced graphics and gameplay options as well. I also feel that button mapping would be extremely useful for a game such as this.\nFrequent Frame Drops. The game is nearly unplayable due to this. A major con that needs to be worked on. Greatly impacts gameplay and fluidity.\nCombat Feels Strange. I'm not sure what word to use here, but I always found myself checking my FPS during combat because of how jumpy everything is. Could use a lot of improvement to make it more fluid. I feel a large part of this problem is the animation for certain moves and abilities more so than the actual controls. Both could honestly use quite a fair bit of work though.\nMenu Glitches and Crashes. This is pretty self-explanatory. Jiro will sometimes glitch into an infinite fall after you return to the main menu from seemingly any point in a level. This will also cause the sound to start glitching and doing weird things such as making morse code out of random in-game sound effects.\nNo Difficulty Levels. This isn't really much of a complaint for me as I don't usually change the difficulty in games from the default difficulty anyway, but I know there are definitely people who would like to have the ability to at least change between an Easy and Hard mode if nothing else. Also, I know this sort of goes back to the Lackluster Menu con, but I felt it deserved its own point.\nNot Always Easy to Find Your Character. This became an issue particularly in the boss fight. I found myself lost in the myriad of enemies numerous times throughout the fight and even died a couple times because of it. I would either blend into the background too much, or I would just get swarmed and not be able to distinguish myself from the enemies.\nNo Button Remapping. Again, self-explanatory point that goes back to the Lackluster Menu. I played this with my DualShock 4, but even then the controls felt a bit off. You can never go wrong with including remapping in your game. Just make sure it isn't presets instead of full remapping.\nNo MP or CO-OP. Not a big deal to me, but I know some people would be turned off by the lack of this feature.","February 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","25","45","0","2"

If the game was half the price of what it's currently listed at(£10.59), then it might be worth it. The combat in this game is very clunky and slow so it takes away from the entire point in being a samurai. The enemies spawn in waves which gets very repetitive... it's not exactly a thrilling experience. One main issue for me that I can't get past is the on-screen text at the beginning of the game which is meant to explain the story after you start a new game; it changes to the next section of text way too fast and doesn't give you the option to skip to the next bit of text yourself due to it being a cut-scene rather than it using in-game mechanics, but they give you the option to skip text with the A button in-game so it really doesn't make any sense as to why they chose a cutscene over in-game options. Games will capture me straight away if they are actually good, but sadly this game doesn't because of the slow, clunky combat and repetitive nature. If you want a very good samurai/ninja game then buy 'Mark of the Ninja' as it won't disappoint.

They want you to kill the demons and ghoul-like feudal japanish humanoids, in order to continue your journey and you have to fight in that place where they spawn.

It even played amazing...at one point.  For me, ever since this game came out of Early Access, it just crashes.  Sometimes it crashes on a menu, sometimes at the level select, and then crashes randomly during gameplay.  Now, I can't even play the first level without it crashing and an error message of program has stopped working.  When I played during Early Access, I made it past the second level and decided to stop playing and come back when the game was finished since the devs were adding some enemies and tweaking the gameplay to make it more fluid and responsive.\n\nI installed the game when I heard it came out of Early Access and really wanted to play.  Well, I can't play because it crashes every time I load the game.  I've validated files, tweaked game settings, and did fresh installs of the game.  Nothing worked for me.  I posted on the pinned forum that was setup specifically to report errors and get support from the dev team.  Months have gone by and I have heard nothing from the devs except that they are "busy porting the game to the Fuze Console".  Apparently too busy to fix a broken game and essentially ignoring their customers.\n\nI really enjoyed this game back when I was able to play it.  The art style is great, the music and sound are amazing, and its a 2D side-scrolling beat'em up (a genre which I love).  If the game works for you, then enjoy it.  All I can say is save your money and buy something else.  Even if this game were offered at 90% off, it still would not be worth it due to the state at which the game is in.\n\nEdit: Notice how most of the positive reviews are from Early Access.

You are a samurai in Japan and the forces of evil are out and looking for a fight and its up to you to deal with them. Using your various weapons, a kattana, claws, club and a naginata you must side scroll your way through droves of enemies to fight the big bad bossman. Each of the weapons have various move sets and different damage values, as standard for this type of game you have your combo meter and you have got to go for those high combos or you can try button mashing your way through and get wrekt. As for your moves you have the launcher attack from the kattana, the standard slash, the smack em down and more and of course you have your dodge. During the fighting you will be overwhelmed by enemies be it melee or ranged there are a lot of them and you will have to dodge, launch, jump and slash to survive.\n\nThe controls work very well in my experience so far, the game has controller support as you will need one for this game. I personally use a ps3 controller emulated as an xbox controller, to change weapons you hold various buttons, either L1,L2 or L1 and R2. When you attack your moves are queued so the button mashers might have a hard time.\n\nOnikira is a rather difficult game and I expect you to die, in its current state I have not ran into any healing items however I am playing this in alpha and things may change as the game is soon entering early access on steam and further through the development. As it is early access the game is incomplete and many changes and improvements may be implemented.\n\nIn its current state you will have access to the first 2 levels, various enemy types, all 4 weapons and a bossfight. The game currently doesn’t allow you to save and carry on later but this will be available later. Arena allows you to hone your skills doing various challenges such as getting your combo as high as possible without touching the ground.\n\nproblems I have encountered\n\nthe opening dialog seemed to be missing the ends of sentences and because of that made very little sense\n1 crash so far\nOnce the game is fully complete it will include much much more.\n\n8 levels\ndifferent enemy behavior and vulnerabilities and strengths\nThe music of the game are not something I took to much note of as I was to busy slashing up demons, the soundtrack is very well suited for the samurai as he fights his way through evil. the game is beautifully done with a very dark feel to it and yet it still looks lovely when you ignore the giant samarai with an eye for a bellybutton as look at the scenic backdrop of japan.\n\nnow you may be asking should I buy this for $9.99, £6.99 or €9.99 as it is early access and to this I say yes although the game has its bugs and there is a lot of missing content all of this will be sorted out as development continues and even in ts current state the game is very fun although I do recommend you play in windowed as I haven’t had any crashing problems like I did in fulscreen. The advantage to buying the game in early access is you can see how much the game improves and you get it for a lower price than if you wait but for people who prefer to just get the finished product then you can just wait until the game is finished and better than ever.\n\nfor those of you who want to wait the full release is planned for February next year.\n\nnow in the games current state I give it a 7.5/10 as it is early access and there is a fair bit still missing but the bones of the game are there, mainly the combat is fun and difficult to discourage button mashing, the art style is beautiful with the hand painted details, all we need is for the game to have all its levels finished and have any bugs sorted and this game could easily be a 9/10","November 14, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It stutters constantly and the combat starts lagging behind drastically, especially when the samurai enemies with guns and bombs show up. The "epic boss" which I'm guessing is the big dude with the huge eye, kills the pacing of the first level and really shines a light on all the mechanical problems this game has. You can't block (there isnt even a block button) or dodge the boss attacks because the stutter makes it impossible to coordinate those things. Feels like playing a game if the mechanics were covered in digital molasses.\n\nWhen tapping the x button, it could produce one sword swing or two depending on what the game feels like doing.\nThe special attack after the second swing doesnt seem to do much damage at all and it'll constantly put you in danger, forget about using if if fire is anywhere in the battlezone.\n\nThen the "epic boss" shows up for a second time with more attacks you can't hope to dodge in this unresponsive game.

This was picked up as part of a bundle.\n\nWhile the game itself is really quite fun, the graphical style is quite charming and runs (For the most part) quite smoothly, There are still some clear signs this is an early development build.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like a 2D version of the most recent Devil May Cry. The combos and weapon switching plays very well and can be strung together to make some quite satisfyingly flashy combos, although there's a bit of a lack of depth beyond the basic attacks you do have with each weapon. The main problem is that frankly a lot of the enemies behave the same and can delt with fairly quickly by just mashing attacks. There's no real technique other than hammer away and occasionally dodge (or even just walk) out of the way when an attack comes near. There's no real need to switch weapons beyond your own amusement. No enemies take advantage of the different styles to make you change the way you play. To compare again against DMC. Where as heavy enemies would requite you to break through shields or land attacks with your stronger weapons to stun to be able to get an in for your regular attacks. From what i've played so far (Admittedly not much since the game glitched out a few times after the first boss) there doesnt seem to be any real need to change tactic.\n\nWhile i can see it being fun in short bursts, overall it's too simple to be played for too long without getting bored. The fights themselves are repetative, Hopefully in later updates (Or later levels, again cant get past the first boss yet for some reason.)  This can be expanded on.\n\nOther minor issues mostly relating to the fact of early development:\n-Not enough feedback or impact that you've been hit.\n-No real detriment to losing a life apart from just restarting a section.\n-Stuttering and skips on occasion.\n-The letter F refuses to cooperate with words in the font.\n\nFor an early alpha you could get some fun out of it in it's current state, but It's clear some work is yet to be done for it to be truely great.","February 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Maybe chill out on the effects and make combat quick and fluid, with the moves having a distinct heft to them. And phase the weapons in, as DMC does (not to encourage more DMC inspiration but it is a good system), because you have literally no time to learn how to really use the sword, claws and halberd before another new weapon comes along and makes it so much more complicated.\n\nOther than that, the storyline sets out with a pretty cool premise but there is basically no introduction to the character you play as. And I never really liked the "trap the player and open portals" thing from DMC, which had similarly bland level design but redeemed itself with detail and layout. But then that might be personal taste.\n\nIt's a game to look out for in the future, but there's still a long way to go. I can't recommend it yet as it's frustrating getting trapped in menus (in-game pause menu is also blank for me every time I open it), it's unpolished and the combat feels too fluffy and mushy.","March 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

It is true, I didn't give it much time for it to develop, but I couldn't help but notice some design attributes to this game that really set me off.  First, there is no health potion in the first level, and it is understood for the most part, considering it is your first time playing the game, to die, and then respawn with full health at a check point.  I was concerned this would be the way things are done.  Second, I found the restricted area of fighting to be quite annoying.  And I get that maybe the ideal distance to fight, then I would argue put less stuff on the map at the same time.  I get it that the game is trying to be more challenging, and this comes to my other point, it wasn't challenging, it was annoying.  It wasn't fun.  There are these head guys that float in the air while you fight on the ground, and it just takes away from the experience.  I would rather fight without some head thing dangling above my head forcing me to dash and sometimes take damage, even if that means it is easier.  Third, on the first boss, these head things use a red laser to tell you the trajectory that they are going to fire.  Well, the background is a fire, and you can't really see where they are going to fire.  This I think is poor design, and they should of had that laser be blue or something.\n\nI also understand that it is the beginning of the game, and maybe there is a level up system, but the combos were insanely easy to pull off.  I feel like what would of been a better alternative, is get rid of the heads, and force people to kill opponents quicker by using the combos given to the player at that time.\n\nNot to mention the environment progression, albeit it is the first level, is just left to right.  There's no secrets, no multiple levels, annoying as hell fighting, and no health potions, it just isn't a game for me.  Oh yeah, insanely easy combos.  Usually what games do if they have easy combos, is they introduce a fatality sequence.  This wasn't presented to me when I played it.\n\nI make quick decisions when it comes to my game selection, simply because there are so many games to play.","September 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I guess devs love DMC5 but, I think they should love DMC3. If these games are easy and simple, there is no point in playing.\n\nOld Review(Which is still valid):\n\nIt's pretty much 2D DMC 5. Controls are same, you start with katana and fight like you always do, as you progress in level 1, you get 3 more weapons, I don't know why you get them so quickly though, maybe for testing purposes.\n\nWeapons are very similar to DMC's, like pressing LT to choose light but fast weapon like Aquila, there is even spining launch move, press RT for long weapon similar to Osiris, you can even pull enemies below when you're mid-air, and LT+RT at once for very heavy powerful big mace very similar to Arbiter.\n\nNo music btw, I don't know why, and sounds effects are lacking too, I don't feel like I'm slaughtering bunch of poor creatures.\n\nNo health bar, no HUD.

Currently I beat the boss with no problems I just found that dodge ability is very useful and that this game can be unforgiving. I don't claim to be someone who is good, but I would advise to other players to use Senpuku (Which is where your character kills yourself) whenever your health is low after you get to a checkpoint and you will die and go back the check point with full health. The visual style is really nice I find it to be aesthetically appealing to the eyes and the gameplay does fit. There is a visual response whenever you hit enemies which is really good because some indie games lack that. The controls to the video game are subpar. It's intended for controller use and you will have some success with controller, however I ran into a bug that maybe case specific to just me. The bug occurs whenever I jump in the air. I'll find that when I land it automatically uses the dodge ability. I have not tested this with an actual XBOX controller, however I have tested it on a PS4 controller which is what causes the bug to most likely occur. To the developers I would say take a look at the program DS4 windows which is the program I use to run the PS4 controller on my PC and hopefully they will solve this annoying problem. Now since I'm done digressing I will go onto my major problem with the game and that is the initial keyboard controls. They are absolutely atrocious in my opinion. I am the type of PC gamer that whenever I move around in any game I use WASD, yet in this game the default attacks are 1,2,3, and 4 which makes it very difficult to reach and thus makes it more difficult to enjoy the game. Thank lord Gaben for the fact that the developers ever so graciously provided us with the ability to rebind our keys. I now currently use QERF for switching my weapons and I use left click and right click for my two different attacks. Anywho with those out the way I would like to say I recommend this game, however the developers have yet to fix a couple things the game. They can still do optimization and I think they should try some different keyboard bindings. Wait until a steam sell and try it. You may not regret it.
