For all who love running games like “BIT.TRIP RUNNER” this game is totally a must-buy! You play as the cat “Bast” running through a dark and totally beautiful fantasy world. During your run you have to jump and slide to not die. It’s really difficult and you will die often… But don’t worry there are achievements for dying and it happens to everyone. ^-^’\n\nWhy the cat “Bast” is running through the dark?\nHe wasn’t alone before. His best friend is a girl called Arielle. They have cuddled and played together in the forest and everything seemed to be perfect. But Bust couldn’t stop playing… there have been so many interesting things around him e. g. butterflies. :3 And so he was running around, playing with everything that moves. Then he tried to catch a little creature and jumped to grab it but he missed… and so he fell on top of some old stones which broke under him. He fell and fell and landed in a dark world – far away from Arielle. Bast is alone and its cold and dark… A smoke formed a shadow and nailed him to the ground. Unable to move he heard Arielle calling for him. As Arielle came closer the Spirit took her and enveloped her. Arielle screamed and Bast tried to help her but the shadow was too fast… Bust realizes that the once pleasant forest has become a dark and strange place and that Arielle is in danger. So he starts to run scared that its maybe too late…\n\n═ CONCLUSION ! ═══════════════════════════════════════════════\n• When you play this game you really feel with the cat and it totally feels like you are the cat.\n• Even the controls are perfect! Basts moves are smooth, elegant and kittenish.\n• The colors are well chosen for the landscapes. It really looks amazing!\n• The music is just beautiful and sad… of course it has to be sad in a dark fantasy world where Bast lost his best friend.\n• Really challenging levels and gravity inversion mechanics which test your skills, abilities and TOTALLY your reaction time.\n• The game is also not expensive and really worth the money! I love it! ♥\n","December 21, 2013","true","39.5"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","24","24","0","2"

The music and art direction are phenomenal, and create a unique atmosphere that few games can achieve; but the game itself was just not well developed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starengine/recommended/248730/","starengine","Marooned Mart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starengine/","36 products in account","Number one vote for one of the most precise and beautiful games I have ever played. A Walk in the Dark is an amalgam of puzzle, platformer and speedrun, rolled into a gorgeously crafted game. In A Walk in the Dark you play 2 roles, a girl who is enamoured by her cat, and a cat that's enamoured by said girl. The storyline is pretty brief, the girl and cat are separated, and the two partake in finding each other. It's actually kinda heart wrenching to me personally as a lover of animals and the bond between what could ultimately be your best friend is understood by both the game and the player, it shows, and it's executed very well.\n\nSo let's talk about the meat of the game. I do prefer the cat levels so we'll start with them, there are two modes of play for the cat, platforming and speedrunning. Speedrunning has you on an auto-scroll chase to the end of the level, whilst avoiding obstacles by jumping from floor to ceiling, almost like flipping the gravity, similar to the popular indie game VVVVVV. The platforming levels will have you navigating some perfectly designed levels with the tightest controls you will ever use. The cat can control his jump height, his speed and can wallkick.\n\nThe girls levels are platform based, and the mechanics involved are very very similar to VVVVVV, albeit with a bit more inertia to make things difficult. The girls levels have sort of a floaty charm to it, separating it from VVVVVV.\n\nThe hook here for me is the wonderful aesthetics. The art style is so good, almost boasting a Limbo-esque feel with some wonderfully scrolling backgrounds, coupled with an ambient vibe soundtrack with lashings of deep piano. A Walk in the Dark is not easy, I think I actually now hate cats, and girls that float. The engine is so well designed and so precise it will have you on your knees, begging for something easier.\n\nI jumped into A Walk in the Dark expecting some kind of cinematic platformer, as the inspirations from Limbo are apparent, at least graphically. What I got was a well designed, precise and gorgeous little platformer/puzzle game that has taken the very best from games like Limbo and VVVVVV, turned into something a bit more thought provoking. A game for fans of the genre, a game for anyone who likes being dominated by difficulty, cat-lovers and indie gamers alike. A Walk in the Dark is awesome and brilliant, one of the best indie games I've played. Very much recommended.","December 20, 2013","true","2.2"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/248730/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","A Walk in the Dark is an esoteric compilation of odd and ends ripped from some of the most memorable platformers of recent years. The influences of Super Meat Boy, VVVVV, Limbo, and others are easy to spot but this proves to be its biggest downfall, as while those games pushed the genre forward A Walk in the Dark stagnates it. By doing nothing unique it doesn't manage to distinguish itself, and simultaneously fails to live up to those that it so liberally borrows from.\n\nEncompassing 100 levels, gameplay is split between three distinct styles of play. The majority consists of typical minimalistic platforming, which from the start establishes the extremely taxing difficulty that only gets harder. The other two portions are slower paced sections that swapped your jump for a gravity switch mechanic (ala VVVVV), and runner-esq cave levels that again task you with switching gravity to avoid the oncoming obstacles.\n\nWhile the different parts are solid enough, I was never impressed by the level designs or use of the different mechanics. It's very "by-the-numbers" and I feel a wasted opportunity to do something original with the interesting setting and character. Controls while mostly tight lose a lot of their precision once you're in the air, and the inability to quickly turn on a dime lead to many unjustified deaths. More troublesome than that is the unpredictable wall jump which often doesn't work and repeatedly sent me into the row of spikes or endless pit almost always at the bottom.\n\nThe one thing the developer did get right was the soundtrack, which is a beautiful arrangement of instrumental pieces that somewhat makes up for the otherwise underwhelming package, and does a great job matching the tone of the environments. The artwork is also gorgeous to look at, but it felt directionless. A handful of short vignettes attempt to flesh out the meager shell of a narrative, but they completely fail in that regard and left the game feeling hollow and meaningless. Great stories and platformers might not often go together, but in this case the world the developer was trying to create is simply begging for something, anything to drive the experience forward.\n\nThat could have been the communal aspect of competing in speedruns, but again the developer flounders by placing what ought to be a central prominent part of the UI (leaderboards) behind far too many menus, requiring you to quit back to the map and then check times level by level. It's a clunky and dated design decision, and frankly feels as if it was included out of some sense of obligation, with little thought as to the actual implementation.\n\nIf you are a fan of challenging platformers you could certainly do worse than A Walk in the Dark, but on that same note you could easily do a lot better. Taken on its own merits I actually found it mostly enjoyable (if also frustrating), but with how oversaturated the platforming genre has become there are dozens of more interesting and fun options available. In the end it seems the developers were themselves walking in the dark, and never quite managed to find their own way for the game they created.","November 13, 2013","false","4.3"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/248730/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","In this challenging platformer you get to be a cat named Bast. Your best friend (owner?), a girl, is whisked away by a creature akin to grim reaper and you have find her. To do this you have to run, jump and crawl through 100 levels of increasing difficulty, all with high contrast graphics similar to Limbo.\n\nThere are actually three different kinds of levels. In all of them you have to reach the light at the end of the obstacle course of a level. Cat levels are the most numerous of the bunch. They are the basic platforming levels where you, the cat, can run, jump and wall-jump through the dungeons filled with lethal spikes, playful porcupines, levitating spike balls and moving saw blades and spear traps. Later on there are crumbling, disappearing and reappearing, occasionally sharp-edged platforms to watch out for and also happy swinging giant spiders and cannons with both regular and homing bullets to dodge. Spiky death is pretty much guaranteed.\n\nSecond kinds of levels are the girl levels. Girl is trapped in a spirit world, filled with (surprise!) spikes and saw blades and other lethal things I already mentioned. However, for an unknown reason she can jump to the ceiling and back at will. This being the only thing she can do the game pumps a lot of levels out of the simple movement mechanics and both stationary and moving traps.\n\nThe third and the most frustrating level type (for me) are the cave levels. In these the cat moves with the same jump-up-and-down mechanics as the girl but running constantly. Precision jumps are easy enough in the early levels but later on they have to be made within a tiny fraction of a second, quickly accumulating tiring deaths. Sometimes you also have to crawl under deathly spikes, bullets or those sneaky, swigging spiders. Frankly, I disliked the cave levels a lot because the speed makes the imperfect hitboxes significant. Also, why must Bast suddenly run when s/he was fine with careful jumps before? Fortunately, there are only some 20 cave levels, so they are in the minority.\n\nMost levels are quite short, lasting just some 10-20 seconds. You get an achievement for par-timing all levels, which is fairly difficult but gets easier as you learn to control both characters. There's also a shiny collectable in each level. Cave running levels don't have par-times, instead requiring you to beat them on the first go. That sounds evil but it's a bluff because you can just try the level again from the level selection screen after each failure to try again.\n\nAfter beating the game there are ten more challenge (cat platforming) levels to beat that are even more difficult than the story levels. Fortunately they are not required for the acquirement of the ultimate achievement: Ninja Cat. To get that you have to beat the game without dying more than 10 times. It's a very difficult and frustrating achievement despite that you can beat the game in around half an hour.\n\nUnfortunately, the last few of the cave running levels have speed sections that lag the game to a halt, making it jerky with a framerate less than 10. This makes those very precision-heavy levels virtually unplayable. I know this is a problem with my system but I have tried the game on three different computers, a laptop and two desktops, all of which have this same problem (and AMD Radeon type cards that are probably to blame). It makes the Ninja Cat tries a true pain. For some reason the levels work alright when I first start the game but not if I play through all the levels.\n\nAll in all, A Walk in the Dark is a very challenging platformer. Granted, sometimes the deaths become really annoying as the hitboxes don't exactly match the graphics, but it's worth its present price (6 €) and can often be grabbed for half that on a sale.","March 4, 2015","true","19.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The level designs are clever and interesting, with what should be a steady difficulty curve, but movement--particularly jumping--feels drunken and ungainly.\n\n* The forward momentum of a typical jump is about equivalent to Shovel Knight's forward momentum when he's jumping in the direction of a strong wind\n*Hitboxes extend out so far, you can die by jumping straight up when there are spikes on a platform to the side of you.\n*The wall jump tends to be more of a wall headbutt, followed by an immediate fall onto spikes.\n\nEvery level plays like the aerial equivalent of an ice level, and that's simply unworkable for what's clearly supposed to be a twitch platformer requiring precise control.\n\nOn the rare occasions this game works, it works beautifully.

The levels with the cat started off easy and fun as expected, I played about 5 levels as the cat and all was well. And then it continued, and the next 3 or 4 levels were playing as the girl, I thought "Ok that wasn't as fun, but I'm sure I will play as her again soon and it'll be better". I continued to play the levles one by one and it wasn't long that the gameplay just started to become kinda dull and drawn out. I am a fan of platformers such as Super Meat Boy and Bloody Trapland, but A Walk in the Dark failed in comparison. The level designs were not all that great and actually took too long to actually become any form of challenge, and as a result began to lose my interest the more and more I played.\nBut I kept playing, and I started noticing something, "What the ♥♥♥♥ happened to the little girl?" It was a 16 level stretch of playing as nothing but the cat and took up until level 26 to get play as her again, and that was for a brief for 3 levels. And this pattern continued to follow suit throughout the whole game. Now its not so much that I am complaining about the lack of girl sequences, because I'm not, these girl sequences weren't all that fun and did nothing but break up the game, I'm just wondering why they were in the game at all, its like the developers just threw their hands up in the air and said "We got nothing for her as far as gameplay, so lets just stick mostly to the cat and keep little bits of the girl in there for the sake of story!" But really the sequences with the girl need to be improved, expanded on, and deversified like the cats sequences are or else they just need to be taken out entirely.\nAs far as story goes, there isn't one. Yes the beginning cutscene shows death seperating the girl and cat, but this is never brushed up on again. The idea of the story is the only thing fueling the desire for progression, other than pure completionism.\nHowever, I will say that this game has a great soundtrack and it one of the better ones I've heard in recent memory. Its not like Dustforce in the sense that its great to do homework or whatever to, but its pretty and solemn, making it a good soundtrack to fall asleep to.","August 15, 2014","false","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The music is beautiful, the gameplay is amazing and you get to be a cat! :D This is a game that will get your face red from failing so many times but you still want to play the level again. This game is almost like mario and you have to get to the other side without running into spikes, porquipines <---I spelled that wrong and chainsaws, yes chainsaws. The story of this game is your owner gets taken away by a shadowy creature and you (the cat) is going after her to find and save her. But when you die or run into spiky things the cat disperses like smoke, it's actually really cool. Now for the bad, as much as I love it there are a few things that I would like to say I would like to see improvements on. The cats jumping is horrible, yes its like a cat but when you have to jump from wall to wall like in "Remember Me" it's very frustrating when the cat jumps off course and runs into a wall spike or you get it just right to fall onto a spike. But I do recommend this to anyone who wants a good way to unwind lol","September 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This is such a pain when you need to do precise moves or jumps,and especially wall-jumps, or steering in mid-air\n- edges of platforms are buggy, and you will sometimes freeze for no reason, or being unable to jump\n- due to the very bright background, you often can't see well things that are white and shining (such as trinkets or gravity reversers). This holds true for the whole game.\n- timings of saws/platforms makes them often in the way of your progression, and you need to stop (and loose your speed, of course), this kills the pleasure of a fast run/fast death/fast respawn\n\nFor the girl (VVVVVV like) :\n- still the same problem with inertia, but as you don't need to jump, it's not as painful\nThis is by far the most playable mode.\n\nFor the runner like :\n- whenever you lag, you're dead (and to me it happened a lot of times at any time, maybe because of my comp)\n- a STUPID achievement requires to win each of these levels in the "first run", meaning that if you want to finish the levels at 100%, then whenever you die, it's ESC -> go back to map -> reload the level (restart won't give you the "first run"), which is a dumb concept for a fast respawn runner.\n\nIt's not really what I would call a bad game, but due to the several points I mentioned, it kills fun. All that remains is frustration, piling up in all the levels, and the will to finish at 100% this addictive game (when you respawn, the game automatically begins, so you hardly have a second to breath or to get out of it), and all of this for what ? to see that you will NEVER finish it at 100 % when you witness the last challenge level (I've tackled it for half an hour and I always die after the first seconds, and the levels are awfully long).\n\nWell, this review is certainly quite long too, so I will end it here :\nThis is NOT a new SMB and NOT a new VVVVVV, because I don't want to compare a jewel to a rock","June 21, 2014","false","6.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's good for a few hours of entertainment, and is recommended for its art style, including music, and enjoyable gameplay. On the downside it's too short and doesn't offer enough challenge to play for very long.\n\nYou usually control a black cat, named Bast, and less often the cat's owner, a little girl named Arielle, through 100 short but fairly tricky levels. There is no story to speak of - it appears that the cat and girl are separated and are trying to get back to each other, which is all the motive they really need. Your goals are to (1) not die as you make your way to the end of each level, (2) optionally complete the levels within a "par" time, collect a difficult-to-reach "shiney" in each level, and beat a few auto-scrolling levels without dying on your first attempt.\n\nWithout a plot, you might entertain yourself by identifying all the gaming elements that AWITD has borrowed (ahem, stolen) from other games. This is true both of its art direction and gameplay, although the game adds just enough of its own personality to make it feel like more than a knock-off.\n\nStarting with the game art, the most obvious influence is Limbo, as the characters and landscape slide by in silhouette. But where Limbo was dark and violent, this game always stays light and fairy-taley, with your character's many deaths rendered with a rather artful puff of black smoke. The backgrounds come from any number of recent indie platformers, with bright contrasts and light blooms and generic "world" colorings. The game's music - tinkly piano - is unusually good, although after awhile the repeating themes start to wear thin.\n\nIf you've played Super Meat Boy, you'll instantly understand how most of the cat levels work: precise jumping, up to and including sticky wall sliding and avoiding spikes and spinning blades. If you've played any of the million games that incorporate an inversion mechanic, you'll recognize the girl's (only) trick, a gravity flip. If you played VVVVVV, you'll recognize similar tricky flipping challenges in later cat levels. If you played Bit.Trip Runner, you'll recognize the auto-scrolling levels. Unfortunately the game is too easy and too short to really stand up to any of these others - only the later levels were really interesting or challenging, and the game could have been more satisfying if it had more thoroughly explored its own interesting mechanics.\n\nOverall this is an enjoyable, but light, little game.","May 3, 2014","true","5.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/248730/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","I do recommend the game to some degree:\n\n- Starts easy but becomes extremely challenging or frustrating (pick your side) later on\n- Story is nearly nonexistent and only there to give you a reason to do what you do. A "damsel-in-distress" outline: Girl is kidnapped by evil thing, cat trying to rescue her. I think the introduction cinematic giving you this outline is basically identical to Super Meat Boy (and that in turn is probably imitating Super Mario Bros)\n- The gameplay follows in the wake of Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV: Run through the levels as quickly as possible and evade obstacles by jumping, wallrunning and switching the direction of gravity (walk the ground and ceiling). It's mostly about having quick reactions and understanding when to jump and how far to move the cat in either direction.\n- Art looked good at first, but it's becoming repetitive quickly. You see the same backgrounds over and over just with different color sets. The settings sometimes switch, but there are only like 4-5 and they switch back and forth. The music isn't too bad and may have a few recognizeable tunes, but I haven't come to notice more than 3 or 4 tracks that ripple around a bit meaningless (bad mouths may say it's dull, simply).\n- Even if the story, art and music were better: You wouldn't come to appreciate it too much. The later stages in this game become so difficult your thoughts will mostly circle around coordinating your jumps and moves pixel by pixel, and hitting your keys to the nearest millisecond for there is almost no room for error later on.\n\nIf you are looking for story, art and music that keep you drawn to the end don't buy it. If you are looking for a platforming game that refuses to hold your hands and that punishes every mistake you make you'll enjoy and at times probably curse this, as seems normal with these kinds of games.","March 29, 2014","false","3.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

I really like the art style.\n+ Music is okay\n\nBut it all fails at one really important thing. The control. There's a delay between pressing a button and the reaction in the game. I found out at a later point, that you can reduce the delay by playing in window mode but that might just apply to myself.\nI guess the developers knew they ♥♥♥♥ed up the controls, because one of their achievements is to die 10k times. Which you will probably obtain at the middle of the game.\n\nThe game itself reminds me of a mixture between Limbo (art style), Super Meat Boy (difficulty) and VVVVVV (gravity changes), which is nice but the level design starts to get okay to good after the first third of the game, which is sad.\n\nThere are 3 gameplay types basicly.\nNormal platforming (reminds me most of super meat boy)\nThe girl: platformer like VVVVVV (really frustrating with a delay up to 0.5 seconds for me)\nThe cave: scrolling levels with VVVVVV change gravity aspect (really really frustrating, because some levels require pixel perfect "jumps" almost, and I really recommend not trying to achieve the "first try" badges.\n\nEach level requires for 100%ing that you beat the time and collect a shiny object in every level (except the cave once, where there is no time to beat but "first try" it). You don't need to do both extra objectives at the same time.\nYou also don't need to play the levels in order, you can skip some if you can't beat them.\n\nFor collecting 10 shiny objects you unlock a challenge level. If you got used to the controls they are really nice actually.\n\nThis game is a nightmare for all completionists. In order to 100% the game you need to pass all cave levels without dying once. That is really frustrating, because if you do you need to shut off the game and then restart it and then try it again once. That delay I wrote about makes this impossible for me.\n\nThere are also some weird aspects ... for example: The "cutscenes" in this game are weird. They are mostly like 1 second long and do nothing to present a story or whatever and the main menu looks really bad compared to the actual gameplay.\n\nAll in all I really want to like this game but the controls give me the feeling that most mistakes where not made by me but the game, which is something you don't experience in Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV.","February 21, 2015","false","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did get it on sale.  When I finally played it, I really wanted to enjoy the cat levels.  I liked the environment and the motion of the cat.  It was ok that the first enemies I encountered had the same logic as the enemies in a game a friend coded in a week.  I was a little disenchanted with it by the time it tossed me over to the first level with the girl.\n\nThe levels with the girl are just not fun for me at all.  It's not because they're difficult that they are not fun; it's because they are not difficult in an interesting way.  It's just - well, here are your mechanics and here are your levels, and if you want to try getting around in any but one way, too bad, even though the movement and environment are not nearly as fun as those of the cat, so accomplishing that getting around in that one way is just not something I want to spend my time doing.\n\nSo, although I was hopeful for it and maybe if I play it in the future while watching something interesting on another monitor, I can get to some of the more interesting cat levels - I don't anticipate my opinion of it going way up and I cannot recommend it to anyone.","March 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks amazing, mysterious and the overall art style is fantastic. The music is, even if very repetetive at times, really nice as well.\n\nBut there's where the good things end.\n\nTo me, a platformer should be about having total control over your character and being able to use your skill to be able to progress. As the game goes on, the levels get harder and you're supposed to use your experience from earlier levels to clear the later ones.\nThis is made impossible by the controls of this game, which might be the wonkiest I've ever seen in any game. It's extremly hard to be precise when playing through this game and yet, the game requires extreme precision to get the shinies, clear the challenges or, heck, even clear the normal stages! If you create a game and want to creat challenging platforming you create difficult levels and use intricate level design, not controls that work against the player.\nAnd this is why the music is annoying, even if it's good - listening to the same music over, and over, and over again as you try to battle against the controls make it so you'll lose any good memories with that music, thus not liking it.\n\nI really want to recommend this game due to it's visual style, but I can't because this games fails so greatly at what makes a platformer a platformer.","April 26, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Run a little script to slow down the whole program and make it chug allowing you to navigate the secnod cannon better.

(The similarities between the games are very, very slight, however--essentially limited to 'generally dark shadowy art style.') Where the game shines is in the controls: playing as the cat feels just as graceful as you might hope. Simply jumping around is fun--the same sort of feeling you'd expect only from a super mario game, where the fluidity of the jumping mechanics makes idling around the mushroom kingdom/delfino plaza highly satisfying. The cat's levels feel less like VVVVV and Super Meat Boy and more like The Impossible Game, if it were granted free motion and a graceful high-flying update. The little girl's levels--though outnumbered probably 5:1--are not as strong; she controls more awkwardly, and her broad figure makes it easier to accidentally hit spikes, blades, etc. But her levels, like I said, are infrequent; they act as a sort of breather from the main, catty game, and are not nearly as difficult as the cat's, so they're mostly unobtrusive--just somewhat unnecessary. Its other downfall is its slight story and beautiful but tragically brief and basic cutscenes. But these elements are really just a frame for the excellent precision platforming.\n\n4.5/5","May 18, 2014","true","6.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Or especially original, but it does what it does well enough that I can forgive that.\nSomething like half the game or so is a super meat boy-esque platforming engine, with wall jumps and decently fast move speed and all that. Unfortunately, the physics here have a few issues; walljumps will randomly fail to activate, and air control is next to non-existent. Clearing the main game and all the challenge levels did not help me understand how momentum in the air works in the slightest; fortunately air control isn't a big factor in the game. The level design here is pretty solid throughout, throwing in a variety of standard platforming elements; crumbling floors/walls, gravity switches, precarious jumping puzzles, all the usual. Again, nothing new, but done well enough that it works. The last string of levels in the main game and about half the challenge levels fall victim to some platforming sins, unfortunately, but aside from them there's a lot to like here.\nAnother quarter of the game is basically VVVVVV-lite; you play as a young girl who can't jump but can switch between floor and ceiling. The main issue here is that she has literally no weight to her at all and very casually floats up and down with gravity switches; it really feels awkward and not especially well-executed. Fortunately the levels here never get too difficult and this mechanic seems to be axed earlier than the others for some reason. There are some interesting puzzles, but this section also tends to have the issue of the background hiding collectibles.\nThe last quarter is a runner-style game incorporating more gravity-switching; often accompanied with rather precise jumps and well-placed enemies. The tail-end of these levels also fall victim to long sequences of really tight jumps, and a wind mechanic introduced near the end leads to sudden physics changes that are barely visible on-screen. Other than that these levels are competent enough.\nTying the whole thing together is visuals that remind me most specifically of Knytt Underground and LIMBO; black foreground and characters of the latter and vibrant backgrounds behind dark foreground of the former. The music is a very relaxed soundtrack that helps lessen frustration and is really quite pretty; not that special but it serves its purpose well.\nAlso there might be a story here, but not really, it's mostly platforming action.\nThe main game will run you about 3 hours, maybe more if you go for all collectibles/time trials/no death runs. It's not especially long but it's not especially expensive either and I certainly don't regret buying it.","October 2, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I didn't know anything about it and playing the game did nothing to change that.\n\nYou play as a platforming cat trying to reach a luminescent fog at the end of each level. Along the way you can collect light spheres to increase your level rating. Reading up online I learned there was a story planned for the game that was abandoned by the dev, supposedly for budgetary reasons. Without any real story, all you're left with is a time trial platformer. It was fun for a few levels and it integrates community features to let you compare your time with your Steam friends. For me, it just got frustratingly hard and I wasn't willing to retry a level dozens of times with the hopes I'd hit the buttons fast enough once. It didn't help my wired 360 controller was failing on me, but even now that i have a DS3 installed and configured, I don't think I'll be revisiting this one.\n\nI've stuck through difficult games before, but there's always been a story I've wanted to finish to help cement my resolve.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toddhunter/recommended/248730/","toddhunter","toddhunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toddhunter/","1216 products in account","Did you ever play Limbo, Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV and think "these are fun games, but what somebody really needs to do is combine them together?" No, I didn't either and if you are the type of person coming up with these ideas it might be time to take a step back from gaming for a while.\n\nBut once you come back again, A walk in the dark might be just the game for you.\n\nGoing in I had very different expectations for the title. The screens promised typical indie platforming with a nimble cat protagonist. I also expected some sort of dark and foreboding story through long levels that ultimately didn't go anywhere. In reality, there is a little bit of story there but the game didn't seem to think it was important so I won't dwell on it either. What does matter is how it plays and this is where I got something quite different.\n\nYou take the before mentioned artwork of Limbo, add in short Super Meat Boy type levels and just when you are getting used to the game it becomes VVVVVV before cycling back through once again. It is a strange sort of mashup given the heritage is so obvious, but strangely the game doesn't really offer anything new. If you have played those games you should know what to expect here and very little more. The levels are short, if you die it is back to the start and pretty much anything you touch will kill you. Rinse and repeat, perhaps trying to get a better time until you are done.\n\nWhile that sounds simple, this isn't to say it is necessarily a bad thing. What it does mean is it is just an uninspired journey, as you navigate the cat Bast and little girl Arielle through the 100 or so short levels. Arielle in particular needs special mention. She is much slower than the cat and doesn't have the double jump or crouch run abilities. On the other hand she has the VVVVVV gravity mechanic allowing her to switch the polarity to run along the ground or the ceiling. While this makes sense from a variety perspective it doesn't change the fact that her levels are a lot less fun to play. Then the game actually gives the exact same ability to the cat for certain stretches, making her inclusion even more redundant.\n\nTo make up for the lack of ideas the rest of the package needs to be exemplary. A walk in the dark doesn't do the worst job in terms of presentation and the sound and music are as good as you might expect from a modern indie game. It is just that there isn't much else to see or do. The cat (only once again) has a light collecting mechanic as you speed through levels. But unless you are particularly obsessive there doesn't seem to be a lot of point in beating the arbitrary times or gathering all the shiny things.\n\nIf anything this sums up the whole experience for me. The game is simply "there". The titles the mechanics are based on are quality efforts, so those same things work well here and you do get them all in one game. The controls are fine, if not perfect and the graphics and music do the job.\n\nWould I then recommend it? Maybe, but only at a very cheap price and you would still be better off with the base games. I could only think that this game could serve as a gateway to the more fleshed out titles perhaps for a younger audience (but those games do an excellent job of leading in new players too).\n\nSo overall, I would have to rate this as a game I have played.","February 4, 2014","false","1.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Suddenly, the green forest is turned into a never-ending corridor of obstacles that Bast must overcome in order to save his owner. Simple, no?\n\nSo, after the short animation sequence depicting the events described above, we begin the first stage. Needless to say, we control a slender black cat (pretty much everything in this game is black except for the backgrounds) and our objective is to take him to a pillar of light representing the end of the stage, without allowing him to be hurt (no life bar here, if something bad touches you OR if you touch IT, you instantly dissolve into a smoke cloud and are put back at the beginning of the stage). At first there aren’t really any threats to the cat’s integrity except for some spikes here and there, but as you progress through the one hundred stages, things get tricky. Levels get longer and/or more confusing with gravity -changing devices, rotating blades, less safe ground and an increasingly smaller margin for jumping errors.\n\nRead the complete review at  http://blurbarians.blogspot.pt/2013/01/a-walk-in-dark.html","November 28, 2013","true","9.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There is no tutorial in-game at all, which I personally found strange, but the gameplay is very intuitive and can be picked up by the end of the first stage.\n\nThe on-rails running parts came as a slight shock on the first encounter of them, as it was unexpected. These stages are fun,  and contain gravity flipping parts, but I prefered the platforming stages.\n\nThe gravity-flipping platorming stages I found to be a bit clunky. The descent when flipping felt heavy and weighted, not exactly what you want when landing on a small platform surrounded by spikes. These were the stages that I dislked the most.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoy this game. The short stages with the shadow-puppet show art style and unobtrusive but enjoyable musical score make this one of the more relaxing pick-up and put-down platform games I have played in a while. If you want a short time kill, I fully recommend this game.\n\nSmall bit of self promotion now, I have done a Let's Play of this game on my youtube channel if you want to check out some of the gameplay for it.

Have you played and enjoyed the gravity-reversing platformer VVVVVV? Are you a fan of auto-run levels in games like BIT.TRIP Runner? Did you like the dark aesthetics of Limbo? Are you a cat lover? If the answer to 2 or more of the above questions is "Yes", then you will probably like this game.\n\nFor the most part, the gameplay is very Meat Boy-esque, with short levels full of spikes, saws, and other nasty obstacles. You play as a cat whose goal is to make it to the end of each level in one piece, which is easier said than done. It's a very simple game, mechanically - your only abilities are jumping (including advanced wall-jumping techniques) and crouching. There are also two other types of level variations: "auto-run" and "gravity-swap". In the "auto-run" levels, you have no control over the cat except to jump or crouch as the level scrolls by automatically at high speed. The "gravity-swap" levels, in which you play as a little girl instead of the cat, feature gravity-swapping gameplay similar to VVVVVV. Aesthetically, the game is really nice looking, with dark silhouette foregrounds and backgrounds of varying colors and styles. It's sort of a mashup between Limbo and NightSky, and works well. I must also make a note of the soundtrack, which is pretty good. The music is fairly low-key and consists of nice piano arrangements, with a few additional variations in the later levels.\n\nSo how does it actually play? For the most part, it's good... but it's not perfect. Hard-core platformers like this really need to nail the mechanics perfectly - the controls and the character's interaction with the world need to be spot-on, so that when you die, you feel like it was your fault, and not the game's. Unfortunately that is not always the case here. An especially frustrating aspect of the game is the collision detection, which feels very inconsistent and "wrong" at times. You will die from spikes that you swear were nowhere you, and other such inconsistencies. Ultimately, you just have to learn (and make peace with) the quirks of the game and try to be super-aware of exactly how you are jumping in certain situations. The "auto-run" levels, in particular, can be a nightmare, requiring pixel-perfect timing of jumps to complete.\n\nThat said, for all of these rough edges and frustrations, I still think this is a pretty good game overall, considering its low-budget indie nature. It is very much worth checking out if you like hard-core 2D platformers like Super Meat Boy. This isn't nearly as complex or polished as that game, but for the amount of content you get (100+ levels) and the reasonable price, I think it's worth picking up. Again, that is assuming you are up to the challenge - despite the cute exterior, this is not a casual game. Some of the later levels can get pretty difficult. So if you don't have a lot of patience, you might want to hold off on a purchase. Additionally, as is the norm for 2D platformers that require precise input, I also recommend avoiding this game unless you have a controller.","March 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Anyhow, this game is still so much fun! If you liked any of the games mentioned above, be sure to check this one out as it mixes those elements very well. One minor issue is the movement, though. As the cat, the walljump doesn't always work and as the girl the controls in mid-air are nearly horrible.

The soundtrack is nice and calm, but it's nothing special, although it does help to set the mood.\n\nThe gameplay is very challenging. You will die. A lot. And you will be very frustrated. I found that it was one of those games where there is one really hard part near the end of the level that you'll die on over and over. Then once you respawn you'll try to rush through the first part of the level and die even more. Rinse and repeat. I got pretty annoyed at some points but I wasn't annoyed at the game, just annoyed at my inability to get past an obstacle.\n\nOn the downside, the default controls are horrendous. I had to re-map my controls multiple times while playing but there's really only 2 actions so it's not too hard to get used to.\n\nThis game is really good if you just want something entertaining to sit down and play for a few minutes or half an hour. It definitely isn't something you would want to sit down and play for hours at a time as the gameplay is pretty repetitive and you would probably end up wanting to rip your hair out by the time you were finished.\n\nOverall it looks great, sounds nice, and plays smoothly, but the controls are a bit mediocre.","February 9, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are 100 basic levels and 10 challenge levels. The achievements are not too difficult but will require some grinding.

The achievements are always fun to try to get but the game itself, in its simplicity, is beautifully done as you alternatingly take on the role of either a feline with astounding parkour abilities or said cat's little girl companion. The music is beautiful and relaxing, and the controls are also rather simple and easy to adjust to, seeing as how there are really only a few buttons you need to use. As the levels progress they become more challenging but it never loses that sense of "Okay, what's up next?" as you continue through it. I haven't completed the game yet (in fact I've been going back over it from the start just for the fun and enjoyment of it) but I fully intend to keep playing. The developers seem to have put a lot of thought and love into both the play style, art concepts, and story and I highly recommend giving it a try.","July 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In-game, the influences are extremely obvious. For some, such derivative design would be off-putting. I don't personally mind it; the end result is an attractive game, although not without issues.\n\nCharacter movement is slippery, similar to that found in VVVVVV. In the latter game's case, there were frequent checkpoints to make up for the frequent deaths this would cause; in this game, however, there are no checkpoints, so the only saving grace is that the levels are short. Also, VVVVVV's chunky pixel art style made it easy to see and make pixel-precise jumps, whereas the higher-resolution graphics in this game make it much, much harder.\n\nJumps are very floaty; you can slow your fall by holding down the jump key. The air control (or shortage thereof) takes some getting used to. Every jump is a commitment, though, which is the way it should be (IMHO).\n\nSome of the hitboxes are also confusing; several times, I got stuck running headlong into the side of a platform, which left me floating in mid-air.\n\nWith these issues in mind, though, the strong audiovisual work for this game (beautiful graphics and serene piano soundtrack) elevates it from the level of a generic Flash/HTML5 game. There's also enough variation in gameplay (switching between three types of levels: standard platforming, VVVVVV-style gravity flipping, and auto-running flip-only levels) to keep me engaged. It isn't until Level 46, however, that the objects introduced in previous levels start to come together in more interesting ways. Many of the early levels are too easy and feel like unneeded padding.\n\ntl;dr Do you like challenging platformers but don't have more than about 4 hours (total) to commit? Get this game... when it's on sale. For extra difficulty (and a few more hours of play), try getting the collectibles (one on each level, and sometimes non-trivial to get), beating all of the par times, and playing the unlockable Challenge levels.","March 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, when you pause the game by pressing (Esc) you can't un-pause using (Esc) again; NO NO NO, you have to press (Resume) otherwise you can't shut your pausing screen.\n\nThe game starts good, eventhough you can feel there is something with the controls but you can't put your finger on it. But once you start playing useing the (GIRL!!!) you can 100% see the problem with the controls. The girl movments are unnatural, when you start moving either she take a small step or start running. That will really ♥♥♥♥ you in the @ss once you start jumping. I found her very unstable when she shift the gravity, and press forword she will start moving  so fast while in the air and knowning the platform is mostly spikes, they will GET you. Another thing is when you step on a moving platform, most of the times at the edges you will stuck and she shows the animation of her moving in mid-air. That is really annoying, mostly snice her puzzles are consist of moving platforms.\n\nThe cat/pet or whatever, is really good speically in jumping. BUT, when it bounces of the wall it really starts to get to you. Sometimes it doesnt bounce of the wall and when you start a ♥♥♥♥ing level with a small hall with walls need to be bounced on and spikes + projectiles everywhere, you really start to get annoyed. Not to forget that once you hit the wall if you don't bounce fast you will fall/(slide) almost instantly on the wall.\n\nAnother point is the Stupid glowing ball, that you collect each level. I really dig that sh!t and all but when your STUPID glowing Ball is colored the same as the background, how the fu(k am I suppose to find it? [Trail and Error] Yeb\nAnother point is they put this Damn glowing ball above a spike on the wall so you must boucne of it and enever jump to high or you will hit the spikes on the top and never delay or you will slid on the wall instantly which both results in your vaporizing.\n\nBounce point: With the diffculty of the game increasing you will die, which is acceptable. But once you still playing the same level you will hear the song stoping. Yes that is the end of the music, they didn't bother to put a loop on it, that is why I wanted to turn off the music. Beacuse once the music stops you will hear nothing but the awful backround sounds and it is almost half to one minute of no music.\n\n\nThe one of the most positive thing in this game is (Key binding), some famouse games doesnt have this feature.\n\nBottom line, rating\n\n\nThe Graphics:  Good\nControls: Really bad\nPuzzlles: half good half bad\nStory: non-existing\n\n\nI woud give it a 6/10        I want to finish it, beacuse I paid  3 or 4 $ I dont remember. Still with the discount\n\n\nIf you love games with a lot of frustration then its a good game.

Every jump is a commitment, though, which is the way it should be (IMHO).\n\nSome of the hitboxes are also confusing; several times, I got stuck running headlong into the side of a platform, which left me floating in mid-air.\n\nWith these issues in mind, though, the strong audiovisual work for this game (beautiful graphics and serene piano soundtrack) elevates it from the level of a generic Flash/HTML5 game. There's also enough variation in gameplay (switching between three types of levels: standard platforming, VVVVVV-style gravity flipping, and auto-running flip-only levels) to keep me engaged. It isn't until Level 46, however, that the objects introduced in previous levels start to come together in more interesting ways. Many of the early levels are too easy and feel like unneeded padding.\n\ntl;dr Do you like challenging platformers but don't have more than about 4 hours (total) to commit? Get this game... when it's on sale. For extra difficulty (and a few more hours of play), try getting the collectibles (one on each level, and sometimes non-trivial to get), beating all of the par times, and playing the unlockable Challenge levels.","March 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, when you pause the game by pressing (Esc) you can't un-pause using (Esc) again; NO NO NO, you have to press (Resume) otherwise you can't shut your pausing screen.\n\nThe game starts good, eventhough you can feel there is something with the controls but you can't put your finger on it. But once you start playing useing the (GIRL!!!) you can 100% see the problem with the controls. The girl movments are unnatural, when you start moving either she take a small step or start running. That will really ♥♥♥♥ you in the @ss once you start jumping. I found her very unstable when she shift the gravity, and press forword she will start moving  so fast while in the air and knowning the platform is mostly spikes, they will GET you. Another thing is when you step on a moving platform, most of the times at the edges you will stuck and she shows the animation of her moving in mid-air. That is really annoying, mostly snice her puzzles are consist of moving platforms.\n\nThe cat/pet or whatever, is really good speically in jumping. BUT, when it bounces of the wall it really starts to get to you. Sometimes it doesnt bounce of the wall and when you start a ♥♥♥♥ing level with a small hall with walls need to be bounced on and spikes + projectiles everywhere, you really start to get annoyed. Not to forget that once you hit the wall if you don't bounce fast you will fall/(slide) almost instantly on the wall.\n\nAnother point is the Stupid glowing ball, that you collect each level. I really dig that sh!t and all but when your STUPID glowing Ball is colored the same as the background, how the fu(k am I suppose to find it? [Trail and Error] Yeb\nAnother point is they put this Damn glowing ball above a spike on the wall so you must boucne of it and enever jump to high or you will hit the spikes on the top and never delay or you will slid on the wall instantly which both results in your vaporizing.\n\nBounce point: With the diffculty of the game increasing you will die, which is acceptable. But once you still playing the same level you will hear the song stoping. Yes that is the end of the music, they didn't bother to put a loop on it, that is why I wanted to turn off the music. Beacuse once the music stops you will hear nothing but the awful backround sounds and it is almost half to one minute of no music.\n\n\nThe one of the most positive thing in this game is (Key binding), some famouse games doesnt have this feature.\n\nBottom line, rating\n\n\nThe Graphics:  Good\nControls: Really bad\nPuzzlles: half good half bad\nStory: non-existing\n\n\nI woud give it a 6/10        I want to finish it, beacuse I paid  3 or 4 $ I dont remember. Still with the discount\n\n\nIf you love games with a lot of frustration then its a good game. I liked this game more than Meat Boy because of the jumping system in meat boy.","April 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The movement animations are great, the way the character runs or turns around in midair after a wall-jump. The death animation is great too.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and fast, greatly reminiscent of Super Meat Boy. Controls are just as responsive (though there's a more inertia to the character), death just as sudden, and getting back to play just as fast. Runs are timed putting the focus on speed and reflexes. In fact, the game feels so similar that I play it as SMB and find it difficult to get used to the more weighty movement.\n\nI really can't recommend it enough. Everyone should play it, especially fans of skill-based platformers.

Well...it sounds easy enough, but when you throw in some obvious and not-so-obvious obstacles and threats, each level becomes a point of intrigue for the overly analytical person.  You'll find yourself picking apart the levels in an attempt to streamline your run through.  The game keeps you drawn in even when you find yourself repeating a level constantly out of the desire to get that 100% completion, where most games would infuriate the player by that point.  It's definitely worth the play-through, and worth coming back for more when you feel like zipping through previously completed stages.","February 10, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The reason I got this game was because a read a few reviews that said it was hard, and slightly difficult to control, but I could probably work with that.  Well...\n\nControls:  On the ground changing directions happens instantly, no delay super nice.  In the air however you float around sceaming and the computer BACK UP BACK UP!  But noooo!  It wont, it can't.  The girl is so fricken big the levels with her were a pain, and since I have such a hard time with the air controls I found the cave levels to be the most fun, as all you have to do is time your jump right.\n\nThat is... until I almost won the game.  It occured to me that it is a really good thing that this game is not multiplayer as a few platformers I've played have been, because with a 5ms delay it would be impossible, the window to actually make your jump on the end cave levels is like 0.4 seconds long, and 0.4 might be a little generous.\n\nThe levels are at most around 20-25 seconds long, most can be completed in about 12-15 seconds.\n\nNow you may have recommended this game, and that my review seems negative... here's why.  I was thinking about it and I want my friends to suffer at least as much as I did with this game.  I've decided, if one of them can win the game which is all 100 levels, and get at least 75 Shinies before they accumulate the 1000 deaths achievement, I will give them 20$.   I want my friends rediscovering all of their swears and all of the colorful ways to use them, and then I want to laugh in their faces as they get so close and fail miserably right at the end!  That being said... I have a feeling at least one of them will breeze through this almost impossible game pretty much flawlessly and be like, meh... that wasn't too hard...\n\nThat said, for that reason, I say yes, I would recommend this game, because well... In an odd way, I'm doing just that to my friends. :P   However, if you are thinking about playing the game, and you don't mind achieving the far too easy to get 1000 deaths achievement, then yes, go ahead and get it, you might like it.  I personally will likely NEVER TOUCH THIS GAME AGAIN!   And I mean that with all the seathing hatred I can muster... Aaah, my rant is over... now I can feel better.

I'm not a huge fan of platformers, let alone TIMED platformers, but this is still a fun game to pass the time with, albeit really frustrating (for me) for a few reasons.\n\nThe controls seem really unresponsive/wonky at times. I don't know if that's because I'm using a controller, but given that this has full controller support, I would've imagined it wouldn't have been a problem. The buttons either don't respond, or respond too little. I could depress the jump button as hard as possible one moment for a long jump, and get a measly weak jump that'll kill me and restart the level, or the exact opposite issue with the same outcome. It also doesn't exactly feel like being as smooth as a cat; in fact, in some areas, I've seen my own three-legged cat jump more gracefully than Bast, which is just depressing. Bast just doesn't seem to respond to the controller in a typical cat fashion, and won't act like a cat when it really counts, especially around wall-climbing/jumping segments. Not to mention that the movements are really picky, but I feel like that's more a margin of error issue.\n\nWith that being said, the margin of error is so ridiculously small that it gets on my nerves, because of the movement issues. I could be completely in the clear of a patch of spikes, and still get killed by the very last one, despite being far above it. Or, in the case of the little girl, the movement is so incredibly sensitive when gravity's being inverted and you're having to constantly flip up or down to avoid spikes and move through the level, that you could so much as look at the screen wrong and be shoved into the wall of spikes without having even touched the D-pad/thumbstick, whichever you prefer to use on a controller.\n\nMy last small issue, and it's probably a very minor one, is the lack of checkpoints, which I wholly believed were what the dandelions were for. Instead, I discovered they're just for a ridiculous achievement. Imagine my irritability when I've gotten 3/4s of the way through a tough level with all of the above issues working against me, find a dandelion thinking it's a checkpoint, only to die and have to start the headache ALL OVER.\n\nI do like this game, don't get me wrong. I just think there are a few issues that are a serious turn-off in terms of no one's gonna want to sit here and play this game for more than half an hour at most before leaving it alone for weeks on end, because looking at it only reminds one of the frustration endured. Do I think this game is worth seven bucks? Not particularly, but I didn't pay that much, so I don't really have to worry about it.","January 16","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
