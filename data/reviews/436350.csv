I found it difficult to even  get all the letters  dropped for my first few words before  my lives ran out due to constantly hitting the letters, which in this game you are not allowed to do.\n\nThe premise of this game is to collect   letters from  the  side scrolling  onslaught of weird and wonderful monsters of which there are many varieties (including flying toasters, bloated boomers, velocicopter cats, mosquitomen and many other melded  mosters of   lore and imagination some of which I  could't even start to describe). If you hit the ground, get hit by a monster, or one of its projectiles you lose a life,  you also lose a life  if you shoot  one of your letters.  Those you  need to  collect  when they have scrolled  to the far left of the  playing field.    Once you've filled the grid at the bottom you have to rearrange the letters  into the  correct word  using a combination of the x key and the left and right arrow keys within a specific time.  Once all of the letters have been collected you are on a timer to complete the correct word. While trying to rearrange the word, monsters continue their onslaught, so you also need to ensure you  avoid  incoming  monsters and their   weapons fire.\n\nTrying to  concentrate on  rearranging the letters into the correct word in the time you have available before the  timer bar  is empty  and at the same time avoiding the projectiles and monsters is quite difficult, especially for us males  who can usually only concentrate on one thing at a time. ;)   If you succeed in completing the word  in the alloted time you will earn a power-up such as an extra life or a shield that once activated lasts for 20 seconds;  create the wrong word or  fail to   make the word in time  means no power-up  which makes it much  harder to survive the level, which is as expected   the  dreaded boss battle.  If you fail to kill the  boss you start all over again, though you can add your name to the score board.    The only  positive  if you do fail is that   levels appear to be randomly generated, so  you won't see the same combination of monsters attacking you at each try. Level backgrounds change from level to level.\n\nYou only need to remember   seven keys to play this game,  enter, Z,  all four arrow keys and the X key, all of which are explained in the brief tutorial, which on starting the game for the first time you are forced to endure.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nExcellent graphics and a fantastic variety of monsters. The ability to earn power-ups if you complete the  word game before the timer  bar runs out and  the randomly generated levels. Finally, you really can't beat the release  price which, with no discount was  only ¬£0.79/$0.99/E0.99/C$1.09  Of the four, Canada is significantly cheaper and is equivalet to ¬£0.58 at present exchange rates.  You can use either keyboard or controller.\n\nNegatives:\n\nYour ship can only move up or down, unfortunately there is no sideways  movement, which in my opinion would have made this a better   'but slightly easier' game, there are only two music scores; a rock  track  when  playing the main  game and  a hip hop track when fighting the boss, both of which really don't fit the game and became annoying after hearing the same two tracks constanly  over the time I played the game. Finally I would make the tutorial voluntary rather than forcing   the player to play through  it  before starting the game proper. Can't save progress.\n\nHow could the game be improved?\n\nInclude  forward and backwards movement, add a greater variety of appropriate music  and include the ability to add your own music.   Enable players  to save progress, or at least  continue from the level they died on rather than  have to start from the beginning again (that said, the randomness of the  levels does counter this suggestion somewhat).  Also   add more power-ups and include   different levels of  game play, i.e. novice,  average  and expert players.\n\nVideo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6iyfzCpj8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrv4jwaUQyo\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nDespite the horrid soundtrack, (the rock  music was okay, but  hearing it over and over  for a couple of hours really got on my nerves, the hip hop just didn't fit the game at all) and the  lack of forwards and backwards movement,   I quite enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone into side scrolling shooters. It was an odd combination; i.e.  a side scolling shooter melded with a word game but it did work for me despite   finding it really difficult to progress further than three or four levels at a time due to  the difficulty level.  Pity  progress couldn't be saved, or when  you lost all of your lives be able to restart  from the level you  finished on. That said, therir didn't seem to be a definite level progression in this game.  High scores  and beating  previous scores are the main reward in this low cost game.","March 31","true","2.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","1"

It tries to add a word game in at the bottom, but the game has a specific word in mind, despite there being plenty of possible combinations, and you must find that word whilst also playing a bad shooter.\n\nThe ship is far too large when compared to the giant projectiles the enemies fire, the hitbox is unforgiving and far too big, the boss leaves very little opportunity to both learn his pattern and effectively dodge him (because of the prior two problems being painfully clear) and there were no interesting pickups (such as weapons) to speak of.\n\nI know I didn't spent a lot of time with the game, but it was just... so... bad.","April 1","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","5"

The introduction of letter collection make this game a bad copy of super killer hornet: Ressurection and the multitasking (kill enemy, collect letter but don't shoot letter because you loose a life) make this game extremely hard and frustrating.\n\nAdding no power up features (upcoming features from the developer comments), a bad word matching (possibly a bug to resolve from the developer comments), and oversize sprites (especially when they overlap a precious letter that can cost a life if shot) make this game BORING.\n\nUninstalled on my side until further game development update.","March 29","false","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

Letters have to be collected and be sorted to create words, while shooting and moving.\nVerdict: Funny idea. In the actual game the shoot'em'up flow is interrupted, while the word puzzles are uninspired.

As a time killer, it's pretty good. The enemies look awesome and that's as far as really, really good visuals go. Otherwise, it's just not that impressive as a shooter. The overall idea of the game is great, but in execution it leaves much to be desired.\n\nDon't get me wrong.\n\nA good concept goes a very, very, very long way with me. Storyline goes a long way, as well. The integration of both will almost always get a game my recommended vote, but I'm on the fence on this one. It's like when the Howard Stern show was trying to get that one guy to win American Idol, but he ended up losing. The idea was funny, the execution was good, but something about it just made the whole thing anticlimactic.\n\nVisuals\n\nI feel the need to say something about the visuals in this game, in particular. The enemies are FREAKING AWESOME looking, and I hope that the developer reuses them in another game. They would be great in some sort of platformer spoof. This will only work if the developer really tones down the difficulty level of the game, though.\n\nIt's friggin' hard.\n\nThat whole thing about execution of an idea is what this particular part is about. Some devs seem to believe that if they can play their game, everyone should be able to play it. This developer is definitely very creative, and definitely very interesting, but they do not have a good idea of how other people will play their game. It's frustrating to play simply because it's next to impossible to get anywhere. You will die. You will die a lot. That's all fine, but this game's visuals don't justify keeping you playing for more than a few minutes at a time because you just get sick and friggin' tired of dying all the time.\n\nHow's about this, dev?\n\nMaybe if, after collecting all the letters you need, you have until the timer runs out to solve the word puzzle. If you get it wrong, instead of losing a life, you just have to collect all the letters again instead of losing a life. The shooter element of the game is really friggin' difficult as it is. This would keep me playing longer and definitely push me to see more of what you've done here - and I sincerely want to see more of it. However, if I have to work this hard for it, I'm not going to. I play games to escape tedium and stress, not introduce it.\n\nStill recommended!\n\nBecause it's good, and it costs less than a buck. It looks amazing - the soundtrack is alright and pretty varied. The sound effects could use some work, but they're not invasive enough to really give a turd about. This developer has a lot of potential, especially if they're this creative from the conceptual end of things. A few tweaks to the gameplay elements and this game would be playable for a few hours. As it stands, it's fun to tinker with until you feel you've gotten your dollar's worth, and then put down until the dev decides to make it playable.\n\nSrsly, though, recommended.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 31","true","5.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","2"

(that ive played)\n\nCons:\nDONT press the Esc button it closes the game (you need to fix that game maker guy)\n\nOther:\nNot sure if the Spelling B like element fits with this type of game but it is interesting and adds another level of panic.\n\nNot sure yet but i think there is only one kind of attack but i haven't played a ton so I may be wrong.\n\nIf you like puzzle time based games, side scrolling shooters, bullet hell, and lots of weird random crazy mutated alien dinosaurs with buzzsaws then you'll likely get some enjoyment out of this game.","February 22","true","0.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","6","13","4","4"
