That's it.\nThe characters are lame, the story is meh and the ending is even worse.\nCombined with easy puzzles and a repetetive soundtrack (which doesn't even loop correctly), it's overall a boring game.\n(Also, I almost fell asleep while playing..)\n\nTherefore, I'd rather recommend other hidden object games than this one.","December 10, 2015","false","5.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

It's a relaxing way to spend two hours.  All the usual trimmings are there - hint/skip buttons so you're never stuck, a teleporting map that indicates the areas in which there are things to do, and a journal to keep track of the (minimal) story.\n\nThe graphics are nicely done. The music is inoffensive.  There is no voice acting, and no extras of the sort you'd see in Collector's Edition hidden object games.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are list-based junk piles with the occasional interactive object (e.g. pick up the sponge and wipe the mirror with it to reveal an image that is an item on your list).  Each hidden object scene is revisited, but not really repeated, since the objects you found the first time remain found.\n\nThere aren't that many puzzles, and those that are present are mostly of the tired old slider variety.\n\nMost of your time in-game will be spent point-and-click style, finding an item to help unlock a box that has another item you can use to reach another locked box and so on.  These inventory... interactions? They're not really puzzles.... are satisfying in the same way that popping bubble wrap is.\n\nHarmless fun at a reasonable price. Recommended for fans of the genre, as long as they know going in that this is just more of the same.","November 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

While you're a lawyer, you want to find the artifact he was hunting in order to make the culprit come out of his hidden place. However, you would have never imagined to travel through time...\n\nThe plot is kinda going everywhere, though you visit places from an hotel room that are very different (an airport, the village in the winter, a old mansion, a cabaret) to find pieces of totems.\n\nWhat? Oh the title? Yeah, I'm still searching the connection with witches, warlocks and the main plot.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay is the standard one: hidden objects scenes, mini-games, everything is well balanced. However, there is a little problem at one moment: the item you need is an axle jack but is not in the list  - in reality, it seems that the lists were inverted for that scene.\n\nThe graphics are quite good and I loved the unique track.\n\nHowever, I'm quite mixed of this game because of two things. The first one is a game breaking bug out of nowhere that made me do a second profile. Indeed, I couldn't access anymore a scene where a vital piece was stuck. When I start the game again, suddenly, I lost my diary, my totem case and my map. And the scene was still unavailable.\n\nThe second one is the problem met for the achievement with no skip and no hint for scenes. In reality, you have to avoid any click on the hint button, even outside of the hidden object scene. You have to wait until the skip button is charged for the mini-game because you may risk the hint button to resplenish itself and counting as a skip/use of hint. Some people got a problem when exiting by accident an HO scene. And you need to do it in one go: you can't leave the game if you want these achievements.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm still letting a thumb up but I would wait for a discount or another bundle to get a key, even if 6 euros isn't expensive.","December 1, 2015","true","6.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

This game changed that.\nI really enjoyed the hours i spent.\nGood thing is that you have hint/skip buttons, so you're never stuck.\nYou also have a teleporting map, that can teleport you to the place where you were already.\nThe graphics are great. Music is also cool.\nI LIKE that in this game is no voice acting.\nYou haved CRASH before? It's 100% fixed !\nThere is some bugs, but i am sure administration is working on fixing it.\nI don't know why the name of the game is "Chroinicles of Witches and Warlocks" when there are no Witches/Warlock at all..\nI recommend this game for everyone. It's really cool. Cool Music, Cool Story, Cool Art, Cool GAME ! In this game it's not matter are you a fan of hidden object genre, anyways you will have a great time !\n\n####PRO's : ####1. Expensive Steam Trading Cards !\nhttp://prntscr.com/a9izco\n2. Nice Story\n3. Nice Art\n4. Nice ♫ Music ♫\n\n####CON's : ####1. Game can crash often\n2. Game is a little bugged\n\nA little Walkthrough(View count is frozen for a while)","February 29","true","11.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
