"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/recommended/347520/","agw_ottawa","Sheep!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/","420 products in account","I made it about three-quarters of the way through Legends of Atlantis: Exodus, and thought that it was a competently done time-management game about prioritizing tasks, deploying people as efficiently as possible, and controlling resource flow.  By the three-quarter mark, however, I found I was having to restart levels multiple times, because I was boxing myself into corners where I lacked a key resource, and needed some of that same resource to access new sources of it.  That's a danger in this style of gameplay, of course, and you're expected to plan around it.  What kept catching me, however, was that areas that looked like paths weren't paths, and places I expected my people to be able to go, they could not go.  Finding yourself trapped in an unbeatable level because you mismanaged your resources is one thing; doing it because your men inexplicably can't go to a resource area that appears accessible is poor level design.  Poor level design on multiple consecutive levels indicates time to hit "Delete Local Content."\n\nI have no complaints about the engine, it worked fine.  But expecting me to discover where my workers can and cannot walk through trial and (level-restart-requiring) error is not acceptable in this genre.","October 30, 2015","false","4.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The story takes place in legendary Atlantis...which I guess was a huge freaking island because it has mountains....and snow....and hellfire!   I'm afraid I didn't pay much attention to the story but for some reason atlantis is sinking and you have to save the townspeople.  You start on the coast and work your way inward.\n\nYou start with one worker guy, an advisor, and a queen who sometimes hangs around and sometimes allows herself to get kidnapped by bandits...who just stand there waiting for you to build the building for the warrior to come kill them.  Yep, they just stand there hoping you will be scared by their manly wolf hats.\n\nEverything is done by clicking with the mouse.  Click on a pile of wood and the worker goes and collects it.  There is wood, stone, crystal, and water in buckets.  Use those resources to build walkways for the villagers (who can't wade the few feet to shore?!) and for your advisor who follows you in a moving vehicle of some sort (he's old so I give him a break).  Each level gives you specific tasks to achieve to finish it.  Along the way you have to build stuff like a quarry for stone, a woodcutter's for wood, a well for water, etc.  Sometimes if you don't build things in the correct order you run out of something you need and have to start over.  But usually you can just wait around for the generators to give you the items.\n\nThere are 2 difficulty levels, casual (not timed) and expert (time).  The hard difficulty is timed and if you dont' finish in time you start over.  I had no trouble finishing in time most of the way.  Also, the achievements are only unlocked if you do them in expert difficulty.  And the achievements were really easy to get other than the "Do a Hidden Object level in less than 45 seconds!" one.  Ugh.\n\nA few Hidden Object levels spice up the game occasionally (there's only 4-5 total).  And also a few match three type, where you have to drop orbs into various contraptions and match the ones with glowing symbols on them.   That was kind of cool but there's only a few of them.\n\nGraphics are okay, I guess.   The characters look weird to me, just strange.  And sometimes it's difficult to tell where the pathways are that your workers can and can't go on.  The Hercules games do a much better job of showing the pathways.\n\nMusic:  it's the same boring tune the whole game.  Ugh. It's a slow plodding flute-like tune.  There are sound effects for when items become available at generators: such as a plop sound for the water.  No voices.\n\nIn conclusion: not my favorite in this genre but nothing really against it.\n\ntl;dr version:\n\nCasual Time/Resource Management\nA few Hidden Object & Match Three levels also\nEasy and Expert Difficulties\nAchievements only on Expert (mostly easy)","December 21, 2015","true","8.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The artwork is drawn really well and the animations are too. The music is calming since you're going to use your organizational skills to advance through it. I didn't have a problem at all running it on a Win 7 64bit single core laptop. So the requirements are pretty basic. Some secret mini-games are included which I've never seen in time mgmt. before which adds a fresh and innovative addition. Even if you can't find this on sale? It sure seems to be well worth the full retail with the 3 hours I've already invested. And most importantly? There are no negative reviews as my updated review. It tells you something for sure.","September 30, 2015","true","9.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Busy, challenging levels with enough variation to stay engaging. Achievements are some fun bonus challenges, not just "beat all levels" type things. The randomized bonuses can make it difficult to plan ahead, but they make it more interesting to replay the levels because you can't always use the same strategy. The biggest downside is that paths are not always clear, so you can get yourself stuck when a resource looks accessible but actually isn't.","January 29","true","10.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I purchased the game as part of a bundle, perhaps expecting an hour or so of mindless entertainment. Instead, I got an addicting little time management game that had me going until I 100% completed the game, not just the achievements, but the entire game. Granted, it is fairly simple and most levels can be beat within a few tries at most, but it still had me coming back for more. The story is silly with no real takeaways there. There are 2 different types of mini games to break up the time management side of things. One is a Hidden item puzzle where you have to quickly find all the listed objects in the given time, while the other was a ball drop game where you had to match 3 of the same color balls to move on. They were pretty easy, but nice little diversions. Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. Fun to play, nice in short bursts, and plenty of levels to keep you busy.","October 13, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
