And sometimes even mixed.\nMy only remark is that it's a very short game for its price. Even for -20% of the price, I still payed 12 Euros. Having finished the main story (Not talking about the extra Time Attack levels) in almost 1 and a half hours, I think it's a bit overpriced.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/357720/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4901 products in account","Looking back on some of my most memorable gaming experiences, the ones that stand out in terms of character and consistent enjoyment are those that weave the music and rhythm of the soundtrack into the gameplay in some sense. Gitaroo Man, Osu!, Parappa the Rapper, Theatrhythm and Daigasso showed me how you can make a musical game feel more than just hitting the right buttons at the indicated time. Then came the games like Rhythm Tengoku, Beatbuddy, Planet Quest and Sound Shapes that incorporate the beat into gameplay less related to the typical set-up. Inside My Radio is definitely in the latter camp, offering a recognisable platforming experience that requires nearly every action to be performed to the tempo of the audio.\n\nYou follow the story of a lone LED, awoken from slumber by the fading spirit of a boombox. A terrible fate has befallen the residents of this world and it’s up to you to save them all. It’s been done a thousand times over and we can all predict how this will end, but it’s flavour text to keep you motivated on the journey rather than attempting to weave an epic story that keeps you from getting on with the action. There’s a small supporting cast of musical stereotypes that offer comic relief but the focus is most definitely on the gameplay and mechanics rather than the fluff you’ll most likely skip on repeat playthroughs.\n\nEverything you need to do in Inside My Radio needs to be performed to the beat of the background music. Each pulse (symoblised by a metronome-esque visual indicator should you need the assistance) is a point in which you can make one of many different actions necessary to make even the slightest progress. Jumping, dashing, butt-slams and interacting with the environment are all tempo-related, which does take some getting used to in order to play efficiently. Certain moments require surprising dexterity and a good ear, so over-riding the automated “panic platforming” developed from games like Meat Boy requires practice and inevitably an occasional spot of frustration.\n\nWhen it performs at its best though, it’s well worth the time it takes to acclimatise. Each action has a certain sound that combines with the level’s music track to produce an evolving symphony reacting and feeding on your own actions. While I’d love to have seen this aspect invested in further, it still gives an almost tactile feel to your movement and a sense of satisfaction when you break into stride and pass multiple obstacles in fluid motion. It calls upon some of the best moments of recent Rayman games; the song-based levels, where each barrier broken produced audio cues to perfect match the melody. It doesn’t quite hit those elated highs due to be more open-ended but it’s well implemented and highly effective.\n\nIt’s often the little touches that turns good games into great ones, and Inside My Radio is full of clever ideas waiting for inquisitive minds to experiment. At one point, you pass a soundboard that can be interacted with in sixteen different ways to morph the current soundtrack; applying bass, dubstep and volume to different elements. The best sign of quality is how all of these moments are entirely optional, like RPGs including lore-filled books, you can judge the love put into a game by how strong the unnecessary parts are, those that most people won’t even find in a solitary playthrough.\n\nInside My Radio’s biggest point of contention comes in its brevity. Clocking in at around 2 hours, it’s arguably average for a platformer but it’s always something that weighs heavy on the scales when justifying a purchase, especially considering its cost is slightly greater than the average. I don’t personally agree with factoring a game’s cost into a review; it’s not only purely subjective but also prone to wild changes with sales, bundles and permanent reductions hitting many games in the past. If you value ingenuity and character, love the genre or premise and you don’t mind its current content to hour ratio then you will likely absolutely love it. Those that do can extend their playtime with some great hidden achievements, an incredibly testing score attack mode and an original adventure that never outstays its welcome.\n\nThere are complaints in my time with it but most are minor to the point of nitpicking, such as a text font that can be difficult to read and a final boss battle that sadly falls onto genre tropes rather than exploiting the strengths displayed earlier. They’re typically forgotten as quickly as they appear once the charming adventure continues its stride. Most people complete Inside My Radio in one sitting, one way to take that is to actually be impressed that it grips the majority of players for a single unbroken session. Given our tendency to flit between multiple sources, it speaks volumes (ba-dum tsh) on how it is persistently enjoyable.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews?\n","June 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Having the music as a basic part of the game is a mechanic I wish would be implemented in "usual" games, as in, games that are not classified as "music games". Anyway, Inside My Radio is a nice little music platformer that uses a rich and very nice adapting soundtrack and builds the game around it. It doesn't quite reach the perfection of 140 in this regard, but it's really fun to play through it none the less.\n\nA few things I disliked were that the input for specific actions only possible on the beat - might be useful on rhythm games but a platformer like this not so much. I don't see a use for it anyway. Also in my humble opinion all the dialogue boxes were unnecessary, the game would have worked without any of those just as good.\n\nAside from that I had a fun - albeit short - time with Inside My Radio and I do recommend it to everybody who likes games with interesting music mechanics.","February 15","true","9.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It tends to have a mind of it's own and will get you killed. There in lies the main problem really, you don't feel in control. There is a very narrow course laid out in front of you. A lot of these courses also have interupting patterns to them. Honestly, it makes the track skip.

Having to jump and dash with the beat is a cool idea, and I definitely enjoyed quite a bit of the game.\n\nHowever, it has far too many flaws to recommend it. A lot of times I found myself getting frustrated when the beat mechanic would flat out contradict the platforming, as sometimes you have to move quickly and will often fail due to missing a beat. Then there are 3 different characters which have different music (electro, disco, and dubstep, I think) but all control the exact same. The only thing actually different is the music, I think there could have been more diversity in the levels and platforming if the characters had different abilities.\nThe final boss is much more frustrating than it is actually hard, it's split into three stages for the three characters, but the first two stages are basically the same thing, then the third stage is a frustratingly long sequence of dodging falling balls which will kill you in one hit and make you start the whole ball sequence over again.\nAnd alas, it's short, really short. I beat in 3.5 hours and that was with taking at least a half hour break for something to eat without closing the game. $15 for such a short game that has quite a few frustrating moments isn't really worth it. I'd say only get it on sale if you really want it.","February 29","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

There's no reward or reason for the 'rhythm'. It's just simply play on beat, or your controller doesn't work. I dislike that.\n\nAnd the final boss being able to heal itself is unnecessarily frustrating. Just let me win after 20 minutes or something.\n","March 21","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Put simply, you can only perform basic but essential platforming actions such as jumping and dashing if your key presses match the "beat" of the background music. I personally don't think this type of rhythm mechanic goes well with a platformer at all, since each type of gameplay requires a different sphere of concentration- and for me, they were near impossible to combine. Clearly, I'm in the minority, given the prevalence of positive reviews, but I also doubt I'm the only one who might become frustrated with it.\n\nCould one say I am biased because I'm not normally a rhythm game fan? Well... yes, I suppose. But I had hoped that a game that combined rhythm with a genre I'm familiar with might be easier to get into. However, Inside My Radio does not cleanly marry two types of gameplay- it merely resricts one behind another.\n\nThe keyboard controls are extremely awkward as well, but you can rebind them, at least. The music and art serve their purpose but certainly aren't anything special. I admit I didn't finish the game, but I feel like I really don't need to, given that I could barely play for a few minutes without thinking about how much more fun I could be having if the game's primary mechanic was no longer present.","May 24","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything in this game seems to be perfect and it is enjoyable and fun to play but it has game breaking issues and bugs that replaced my joy with anger and hate.\n\nThe first example is, that the beat system doesn't work properly and it was responsible for some of my dumbest fails in this game and i played with 60 fps at a smooth rate.\nThere seems to be a launch bug to, that prevents me to interact with the game and it doesn't recognize my keyboard and i have to close the game via alt f4. Sometimes i had to restart my whole computer because of this.\nBesides all of this, my biggest issue with this game is, that it is way too short to fit the normal prize. I mean seriously. 1 and a half hour to complete the campaign is just not enough and the time attack mode doesn't make it better.\n\nSo please take my advice, if you expect a game with a long story, you WILL be disappointed, but it makes it up with his beautiful scenery and musical kick. But there isn't just enough content in the game yet to make up for it.\n\nSo here is my personal advice and even a dying wish from myself for the developers.\n\nAdd more content to your game! There isn't enough in the cart to fit the prize of the game. And please don't add additional game modes like time attack because it wont make the game better at all.\nAdd more stages and mini games. Build up the story line. Add more characters. Maybe add a small Multiplayer mode with mini games.\n\nYou can still do so much with this game.","May 16, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
