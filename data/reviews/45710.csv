That is because, it isn't.  You have to contact Capcom and give them a screenshot of the cdkey, and proof of purchase (A screenshot of the email steam sends when the game is bought).   After doing this, you wait a day or two and try to install it again and everything should work beautifully.\n\nIf you went to Capcom, and nothing happens, try again, over and over until it does.  It took me 3 tries but finally got the game to install.  Below are the instructions to get your copy working if you run into the invalid cd-key issue.\n\n1) Go to http://shop.capcom.com/store/capcomus/html/pbPage.capcom-support\n\n2) Click on the "Contact Us" button under the search bar.\n\n3) Explain your issue, something like "bought Dark Void, trying to install got invalid cdkey, etc"\n\n4) Provide screenshots of your cd-key, and proof of purchase.\n\n5)  Wait.\n\nIf for some reason this method doesn't work, repeat until it does.  Steam support can't/won't help you and the whole secure-rom team is probably crying in a room cause everyone hates them, so no point in trying to make contact for help.\n\n\n---------------------------------------Review---------------------------------------------------\n\nWell I spent almost 8 hours playing this game, 3 which were spent trying to install it over and over due to the cd key issue.   I don't feel like wasting more time on this so my review is short and to the point.\n\n\nGraphics 8/10\nIt looks good for a game of 2010 (I am old, so it's weird to say it that way, but yah, for it's time the game holds up quite well)\n\nGameplay 2/10\nYou'll play the first level and that's basically it, no other elements are added to the gameplay maybe 2 or 3 different weapons and the upgrades for them and the jetpack.  Overall the game is SUPER repetitive, making this game boring as hell.   All the missions are the same "oh no, enemies, shoot them please"  once the enemies are gone, that's it.   Some levels have you running around for no reason only to trigger a "oh no, enemies again".   If you enjoy repetitive gameplay, go for it, this game is for you, but you can just watch a video of youtube in loop, hold any sort of gamepad and try to play along like a child who is being tricked by his/her parents so they can go bone in peace. You'll save the money and won't feel as stupid as I do right now.\n\nI played this game in the hardest difficulty by the way, and it was as hard as throwing a rock into a lake.  So maybe sucking at games will raise the challenge for you.  The last boss is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Seriously.  I don't like to use the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all, and I am sorry for the last boss's relatives, but it was very disappointing, lame and just overall stupid.\n\nSound/Music 3/10\nUmm... nothing memorable, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ background music.  Noticeable enough that you don't hear the sound of a piece of your soul dying while playing this game past lvl 1 and forgettable enough that you can actually sleep at night after the feeling of emptiness leaves your body before bed.\n\nStory  3/10\nI was going to give it a 1, but that's mean, and I've been mean enough already.   The story is bad, just full of holes and the character development is nonexistent.  The characters have names that you won't care about, there's a cameo of a cool scientist for like 2 mins total, and even then, they don't managed to properly include him in the overall development of the story.\n\nI feel they hired dead fish to write this story, but since fish can't hold pencils or pens, they had to just wing it and interpret the smell of slimy scales under the sun into a filler story to get this game out there and ready to sell.  If only they had hired a child capable of mumbling words this game would be entertaining enough to follow along till the end.\n\nReplay value -1000/10\nWhen you finish they game they give you an unlocked radar to find all the hidden treasures...  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  omg.  Nice one guys.  That is the best April fools joke ever.\n\n\nOverall - 3/10\nThis is not an average at all, I just felt like 3 is a nice number.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough to be under 5 but good enough to be above 2.  At first I had the "don't buy this game cause you can't install it" review, but now I edited to say, don't buy this game cause it will make you dumb.\n\nI mean it is entertaining for like 20 mins, so if you are ok with that, go for it.  If not, please heed my advice:\nGo outside and pick up a rock, throw it in any direction as far as you can, then close your eyes, count to 10 and go look for the rock.  You'll have a lot of more fun than playing this crap, you'll play outside, you'll get some sunlight tan and who knows, you might hit a leprechaun or something and find some gold.\n\nIf the price of this game is $3.00 or less, buy it.  I like to collect games, so why not.  If you paid more than that, you are officially a sucker, like me.\n\nHey,at least you are not alone.","December 24, 2014","false","11.5"," 153 of 166 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","153","166","5","3"

First on the game, second on the DRM.\n\nFirstly, the game is an okay Sci-fi FPS.  There are two distinct modes in the game, the FPS part and the flying/shooter part.  I perferred the FPS to the Shooter part as the flying is a little clunky in the controlls department.  Aswell the flying shooter part also felt lackluster as there was a very limited enemy pool and the enviroments were a little dull.\n\nThe FPS was actually not bad, it was a typical cover based shooter.  However the cover mechanic was pretty decent as there was parts in the game where you had to scale or descend and the cover mechanic was used quite well in those as well.  In particular the end of the first chapter/mission had a real fun use of the scaling cover.  There is a lack of weapon variety in the game but you can upgrade your weapons to change them up slightly as well and at the beginning of each chapter/part you can switch up your weapons and there are weapon chests in the levels were you can do the same.\n\nStory was okay, not specatular, it was a little predictable, but still a interesting enough that you are interested in the story.  As well there is lore hidden about in levels to add to the story if you so choose to read it.\n\nGraphics were good and really enjoyed some of the level design, first level/area in particular.\n\nAlright, on to the second part, the DRM.  The DRM for this game is terrible to be fair.  When you buy/install/launch the game you won't be able to.  For some reason the Steam Keys don't end up in the third party DRMs (securcom? I think).  Anyways, the process sucks and takes some time but the game does work in the end.  Here is the proces I followd:\n\n1.) Launch game -> doesn't work even using Securcom directions\n2.) Contact Securcom, provide them with screen shots of steam key, they will reply it's not in their database and to contact Capcom support.\n3.) Contact Capcom support and provide them with screen shot of steam purchase hisotry showing purchase as well as screen shot of steam key.\n4.) Capcom support will email back that the key has been added to database.\n5.) Launch game.\n\nThat process is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and is not needed, especially on such an old game and if you have a stance on DRM, don't buy this game.\n\nFor me, the DRM process was stupid, but the game does work and it was an enjoyable game for me so I give it a very hesitant recommendation.  I recommend the actual game, I DO NOT recommend the crappy DRM that comes with it.","February 22, 2015","true","8.3"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","42","55","12","0"

It satisfied an itch I've had for a shooter, but also gave me something else to yearn for in the future - seamless horizontal to vertical combat.\n\nWriting wise, the game is pretty solid. There are some thematic elements that will feel familiar - a LOST-style island, references to reptillian conspiracies, a bit of the Matrix-style Oracle-tells-Neo-To-Save-The-World kind of stuff. It's a little flat towards the end, but its engaging enough to be enjoyable.\n\nThe characters themselves are simple enough - the main character (voiced by Nolan North of Uncharted fame) is the typical male super-protagonist, pilot turned badass super soldier with a jetpack. You don't get very much A.I. help, and the friendly A.I. are just barely useful. That said, they aren't really necessary for much more than that - the majority of the game you alone are enough to handle the enemy hordes while the A.I functions nicely as cannon fodder. They _do_ deal damage though, which is nice - you can't assume they can finish an enemy off, but they certainly help a bit.\n\nThe enemy A.I. isn't half bad either. They make use of cover, attempt to flank, use grenades, and will use jetpacks in mid-to-late game to get around you and take a vertical position of fire. It's not the smartest A.I. in the world of gaming, but they certainly put up a decent challenge.\n\nNow, with that said, the gunplay is pretty straightforward at best - cover-based combat in the beginning isn't anything special. But you'll find you don't use it very often, because you have a BLOODY JETPACK.\n\nThe jetpack transforms you into Rocketman, blasting around the landscape with mounted guns blasting the crap out of enemies. It's well balanced - in hover mode you can boost around, taking advantage of the landscape to take on enemies on lower planes of battle, or engaging mid-air enemies efficiently. Some areans allow for full-range combat, converting from hover to full jet mode. In the latter you forgo your traditional weapons for a mounted gun that does tremendous damage to ground troops and moderate damage to flying ships.\n\nThe addition of vertical combat was a very welcome change. It reminded me a bit of old Unreal tournament or Tribes in a sense - being able to descend upon the enemy was a very warm and awesome feeling. Smart use of aerial maneuvers could allow the player to zip through and lay down fire like an A-10 on enemis, swap to hover mode, and rain down from the rear while what few A.I. friendlies keep up fire from the front. It *does* work rather well in the end.\n\nThe maps are generally well done - many times there are areas to engage enemies vertically, as well as traditional horizontal cover-based advances. Your jetpack is given plenty of areas to be used, and this helps keep combat fluid and engaging. There are always ways for you to get an advantageous position on the enemy, even at the risk of being shot out of the sky.\n\nI do have some gripes, in the end - there is an upgrade system that feels very half done. Weapons can gain up to 3 levels of linear upgrades, as does the jetpack. But it doesn't seem like there are enough upgrade orbs in the entire game to allow for more than a few fully leveled weapons. I went with the standard human weapon and a fully upgraded jetpack in the end, because the human rifle gets explosive rounds and that seemed to last well into the endgame. I will say this - endgame opponents are serious bullet-sponges, even with upgraded gear. It got a little annoying because the upgrade tree maxes out so quickly. It was an unfortunate oversight as it would have allowed for end-game units to be challenging instead of annoying. There is a dearth of instruction in the game - you can hijack enemy aircraft, but there is (to my knowledge) no guide to figure out the mixture of pressing 'E' to rip a panel off, and A/D to dodge around. There is at least one boss battle where the prompt says 'PRESS A AND D' instead of "PRESS A OR D". The latter will save you, while the former will force you into re-doing a relatively time-consuming sequence.\n\nThere are not a lot of quicktime events, thankfully, but the ones that are there do not feel very challenging or engaging. I feel that if you are going to have QTE for boss/miniboss sequences, make it something a little more involved - the final boss QTE is very underwhelming.\n\nIt is, in the end, a rather short game - expect to beat it in a sitting. I did it in about 7 hours on normal - I think hard would only yield another hour of gameplay at best. There are collectibles that may extend the gameplay experience - new game + allows them to pop up on your radar so you'll find them a bit easier (which, given the often extensive maps to fight on, its easy to miss them). Unfortunately CAPCOM didn't take the opportunity to really expand on a world that could have dived much, much deeper. I would say this title is worth it on sale for a Saturday worth of blasting lizard-robot alien scum and saving the world.","July 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Maybe the first most realistic implementation of the idea ever made.\nWell this game was a complete inspiration of this concept. And it was sweet. But with a really messed up ending.\nSo here's the thing, you got a cool action game with lots of potential and very nice story telling almost as if it came out of a good Disney scifi movie (EXCEPT THE ENDING).\nThe voice acting was ok, and the graphics seemed also cool for a 2010 game.\nSweet environments and awesome gameplay including exploration and action on foot, while hovering and while flying.\nSmall but cool number of weapons to use, covering system omg yes, nice animations and models and decent maps to go through.\nAll well and cool and a story that looks intriguing up to a point. But if you like GOOD stories that are being WELL told.... you'll get a bad surprise..\nThe ending is so freakin dmn ♥♥♥♥ing LAME that it will make you stare at the ending credits with a serious WTF expression in yoru face wondering why you spent your time playing the whole thing at the first place.\nIf you like a good relaxing acton shooting game, then you will have np spending your time with it.\nBut if you appreciate good story and get mad when people ♥♥♥♥ the story up for you... Then you might not really enjoy the way this game ends.\nFor the 1,24 bucks spent to get this on this holiday special offers, this is a great deal.\nBut once you come to think that this title was once sold for full price and people actually bought it.... My god I feel sorry for them...\n\n\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n[Warning; Big Spoilers ahead after this point - angry rant following]\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\nWhat's the deal with companies getting to be so damn ♥♥♥♥ing lazy in some games?\nI mean, ok, you get your ♥♥♥ down to gather developers, modelists, music composers, voice actors to get a job well done, and your script writer is like what, a ♥♥♥♥ing 10 year old?\nSeriously this game could had been something really extraordinary enough to compete the top games of fictional story franchises ever.\nAnd right at the ending, they completelly ♥♥♥♥ up the whole romance background between the main character and his (ex) /girlfriend/\nAfter a huge ♥♥♥ final boss battle.. ~omg how freaking original right? - but ok let's say that this is an action shooter, It's understandable up to a point.\nBut anyway after the final boss battle, you, the chosen one, who are supposed to save the parallel universe world from the evil machines who enslaved humans, you get to kill and destroy all the means the alien machines ever tried to use to oppress the humans of that world.\nWhile at it, all remaining humans build a huge ♥♥♥ freakin Ark that you have to keep fighting to keep it alive through hords and hords of enemies in order to get them to the portal to the real world [40s WW2 real life]\nAnd just about before the big final, the prophet tells you that only YOU can go through the portal after revealing that you are the chosen one.\nSo instead of staying back helping all those people you dragged along just to acompany your sorry ♥♥♥ fighting in the sky on your way to the portal\ninstead of staying by teh side of the love of your life\ninstead of having the least amount of interest anyone could have had to explore a vast uncharted new world\nThe main character crosses the port. ALONE! Like not giving a single ♥♥♥♥ about anything that happened during the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game.\nAnd that's not even the worst thing.\nRight at the end of the boss fight, on the top of the highest and sharpest ♥♥♥♥ing peak ever existing in teh horizon.\nAfter landing with your girlfriend right at the portal.\nA bad guy appears out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere, without a ship, without ♥♥♥♥ing stairs to lead him up there, just spawns and stabs your gf!!\nAnd even after that WTF-JUST-HAPPENED scene, does the main character take his gf back to the ark to have her aided? NO\nDoes he at least stay by her side to hold her hand on her final moment? NO.\nHe just crosses the portal, not giving a ♥♥♥♥ about his slowly dying gf and just sits watching her die with a sorry-♥♥♥ expression on his face.\nWhy the hell would you even take us through the whole romance story of the main character reuniting with his ex, actually bond all over again, reveal their background and have them fall in love all over again just to kill the girl and have the dude walk away like that without a kiss goodbye?\nWhere the ♥♥♥♥ did you take the script from? A ♥♥♥♥ing japanese manga for teenagers?\nAnd as if all this didn't blow my mind well enough, you get to see a cinematic at the end.\nYour main character sits by the side of river Thames thinking about that girl, then out of nowhere a guy who was a secondary character and a person who lived inside the parallel universe world, appears next to you wearing a suit and tells you "come on, there's much t be done"\n......\nwait.. wasn't the main character the ONLY one who was able to cross the portal...?\n....\n..\n.....\nWHAT.THE.ACTUAL.♥♥♥♥.DUDE?!?!??!????!?!??!?!?","December 26, 2013","false","7.0"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","38","56","0","10"

Before I go into how much I love this game, let me tell you about how many areas need improvement:\n- Controls are very confusing (at first)\n- Flopsy combat system which bi-polarly interchanges from great to awful throughout\n- Flight needs some serious fine tuning\n\nNow let me unfold the awesomeness of this game\n- RELENTLESS ACTION\n- EPIC SOUNDTRACK\n- LAUGHABLY CHEESY PLOT\n- LAUGHABLY CHEESY CHARACTERS\n- UNDENYABLY FUN COMBAT SYSTEM, FLOPINESS INCLUDED!\nEverything cheesy about this game, is a GOOD kind of cheesy. Reminded of Uncharted voice acting. It's very realistic and engages the character, but at the same time just makes you laugh at how the characters react to the situations at hand.\nIt's like B movie.\n\nPeople seem to dislike this game, and their complaints seem to be what make it really fun to me. Goofy animations, cheesy everything, just above bad ragdoll physics. It might be just me but these things make me want to play the game so much more. I honestly think this game was released as it was on purpose. Capcom didn't want to make something serious, but they also wanted to keep it engaging and fun, and that's exactly what Dark Void is. Engaging, and fun.\n\nSince I can't really release a review (without hating myself later) and say nothing about the plot, so basically; you crash land on an island, you encounter weird robot alien tech-like things you don't know about, you fight them, you survive the island and it's elements. It's quite forgettable, but in all seriousness, it more than gets the job done.\n\n\nIT'S UNCHARTED WITH ALIEN-LIKE ROBOTS!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/45710/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Dark Void isn't a must-play game. It's somewhat buggy, it crashes from time to time, there's not a huge amount of weapon or enemy variety, and there are certain parts of the game that are pretty boring. It also has a Securom online activation that was broken for almost a year, and even though Capcom has now reached out to them and fixed it there's always the possibility of it happening again. But it's one of those games like Dark Sector where while at heart they're just third person shooters, they have unique concepts that I haven't seen anywhere else and do them just well enough to be worth trying. In this case, the concept is the jet pack, which gives the game more verticality than most cover shooters have. The controls for flying it take a bit of getting used to at first, but once you do it's a lot of fun playing in the areas where you're free to fly around. There's a disappointingly high amount of missions that mostly involve confined spaceship interiors where there isn't much room for the mechanic to shine, but there are just enough missions that are great to make up for them. The story is also somewhat interesting, though the concept is more interesting than the actual execution of it and the main characters are just bland enough to feel like they don't really deserve to be in a story concept that neat, and the side characters that you actually want to hear more from usually get benched. The game goes on sale for around $2 pretty often (I got it for $2 from the Green Man Gaming summer sale), so it's probably better to wait for one of those times since it isn't exactly an "you should urgently play this game right now"-good game, but it's certainly worth trying for the sake of playing the good parts. Dark Void isn't the best third person shooter you'll ever play, but chances are it's not the worst, either.","July 22, 2015","true","11.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","5"

The story, while not exactly the next Great American Novel, served adequately as backdrop for the action and most of the characters have enough personality without being obnoxious.  The visual style fits the concept very well, clearly influenced by the same alternate history comic the main premise is based on.  The air combat and cover based shooting mesh surprisingly well and I found switching between them to be fairly smooth and intuitive.\n\nI did read some other reviews mentioning that the air game was hard to control, however I believe this is because the game was designed to be played with a controller.  By realising that fairly early, I had no problems at all.  In fact I found that the whole air game felt particularly "good".  You can buzz around with your jetpack, take over enemy aircraft, hop into friendly AA turrets and seamlessly move between flying and hovering.  Note that the game doesn't really tell you to do these things though, I didn't even realise I could take over enemy ships until halfway through.  Still, it is small optional elements like this that sold the game to me.  In fact, I was impressed enough that if someone told me these developers made an open world game using the mechanics demonstrated here, I would probably throw some money its way.\n\nNaturally, it has its flaws.  Chief among which that the game is rather short and a bit random at times, most likely because the developer was more ambitious than its wallet allowed.  There are some signs of separate segments of the storyline being Frankensteined together in an attempt to keep things coherent after money ran out, but all in all this won't bother you much and I felt that a good job was done all things considered.  At least not until the very end.  There the game ran out of steam and threw in two bossfights in quick succession that obviously were only thrown in because it is what was finished.  Oh well.  Bigger titles have done the same with less excuse.\n\nAnother issue I had was the placement of the checkpoints, which were not always properly spaced.  There was a defend section I had to do over a few times because I failed a quicktime event and died instantly.  Yes, the game has quicktime events.  That's another minus.  A minor saving grace there is that they are short, sometimes optional and, in the case of one particular hostile, even allow you to choose which quicktime sequence you want to do by picking between two different prompts.\n\nMy final grievance is the upgrade system.  The game has you collect points to upgrade your weaponry of choice with, allowing you to hold 2 weapons at a time.  Upgraded weapons are vastly superior to non-upgraded ones, meaning you'll often stick with the ones you upgraded instead of picking whatever would objectively be a better weapon for the situation.  It is here that the game is also a little bit schizophrenic.  On the one hand, it allows you to steal the weapons your enemies use if you run out of ammo.  However, ammo packs and chests are plentiful and dying resets you to your last checkpoint with full ammo regardless of how much you had when you passed that point.  In addition to that, you'll only find enough points to upgrade 2 or 3 weapons properly, further encouraging you to really just use whatever you picked as your first upgrade choices for the entirity of the game and killing off what could have been a good way to add challenge to the game.\n\nStill, maybe it was because was I going through a backlog of generic shooters at the time and had low standards going in, but I really am glad I picked this one up.  It impressed me enough to write a review at least and I really only do that for games that leave a mark in some way.","July 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game has you collect points to upgrade your weaponry of choice with, allowing you to hold 2 weapons at a time.  Upgraded weapons are vastly superior to non-upgraded ones, meaning you'll often stick with the ones you upgraded instead of picking whatever would objectively be a better weapon for the situation.  It is here that the game is also a little bit schizophrenic.  On the one hand, it allows you to steal the weapons your enemies use if you run out of ammo.  However, ammo packs and chests are plentiful and dying resets you to your last checkpoint with full ammo regardless of how much you had when you passed that point.  In addition to that, you'll only find enough points to upgrade 2 or 3 weapons properly, further encouraging you to really just use whatever you picked as your first upgrade choices for the entirity of the game and killing off what could have been a good way to add challenge to the game.\n\nStill, maybe it was because was I going through a backlog of generic shooters at the time and had low standards going in, but I really am glad I picked this one up.  It impressed me enough to write a review at least and I really only do that for games that leave a mark in some way.","July 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The smoothing, combined with the horrible mouse sampling means that zoomed in weapons jerk around the screen & jump, not moving smoothly. I had to switch the DPI on my mouse from 800 to 200 while zoomed to keep control.

Set in a parallel universe called "The Void", players take on the role of Will, a pilot dropped into incredible circumstances within the mysterious Void. This unlikely hero soon finds himself swept into a desperate struggle for survival, joining forces with a rebel human group called The Survivors. Trapped in the Void, these resistance fighters are battling to hold off a mysterious alien race that plans to threaten Earth.\n\nDark Void’s unique combination of jet pack-booster aerial dog fighting and third-person combat brings a thrilling new gameplay dynamic to the third-person shooter experience. Taking 3D action to a whole new level, Dark Void’s unique vertical combat system allows players to dangle from thousand foot drops as they take cover and hurl enemies to their doom, bringing a whole new sense of tension and thrill to the player. Will is also equipped with a powerful rocket pack which allows for fierce in-air combat, hurtling through the Void at blistering speeds while shooting down anything that gets in his path.","January 11, 2014","true","50.9"," 18 of 43 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","18","43","0","0"

The biggest gripe you hear is about how short it is, or how the "devs ran out of money while making it". I wasn't seeing anything like that. The ending definitely leaves the story open for a potential sequel, sure, but it's not like you're playing and the game just stops and shows the ending at some point. At any rate, it's a lot like Gears of War, but with a jet pack. The flying bits are pretty cool, and it's nice to be able to break out the pack whenever you need to get some height on enemies. There are veritical climbing areas too, and those are also a lot of fun. The gunplay is rock-solid, the upgrade selection is nice and enemy AI seems pretty competent. All in all, definitely worth the $10 they usually charge for it....","January 16, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game revolves around the use of a Jetpack and it does so in such a beautiful way it is like playing a air combat game like Ace Combat one moment, then with the press of a button you switch to hover mode and its like the jetpack parts of San Andreas but with nice and responsive controls.  And finally once you hit the ground, it becomes a competent third person shooter with standard cover mechanics.  Except if you are by a ledge where you take vertical cover and fire down or up on enemies.  The vertical cover moments really feel like those crazy moments in the Time Crisis arcade games where your character uses something really rediculous for cover, like in Time Crisis 3 where you take cover by a ledge then hang upsidedown to return fire.  And then at any time you get bored of the ground you hit a few buttons and you are flying away like you just hijacked an airplane in Just Cause 2, which you can actually do using your jetpack incase you want some extra protection.\n\nThe criticism leveled at the game isn't wrong, although for me I had no issues with controls or framerate, but I think that was console criticism.  There was 1 part early on that caused a CTD but running the game in windowed mode got me past it and afterwards the game only had 1 more crash which is pretty good considering Triple A titles everyone owns crash more frequently.\n\nThe game sadly suffers from being either too ambitious or being rushed, there are a few rapid jumps through time where it feels like the developers had an extra hour of gameplay planned and skipped it, and this really does make the game in the end sort of disappointing, however once you get your rocketpack addition to the jetpack, you will want to just fly around and never stop.  But the game does stop, and it stops very abruptly and the poor reception the game got probably means we won't see a game with this type of unique gameplay for a long time.\n\nIf you enjoyed using the grappling hook in Just Cause 2, the Sky-Rails in Bioshock Infinite, the VTOL vehicles from Saints Row, or just the idea of freeroaming huge areas with a jetpack, you won't regret buying this game at it's current price, and if its on sale you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it, its not an epic, but it is something anyone who wants to be able to fly around a series of huge battlefields should at least give a try.","December 7, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes ages to aim, the controls sometimes feel like they're not responsive.

There is no full screen/window toggle option anywhere in the menu (fortunately, alt-enter works).\nLast but not least, when you start the game, before you get to see any menus, you have to sit through an unskippable slideshow, which includes ads from nvidia and alienware.\nAll in all I would not recommend it, although I hope to one day find the patience to enjoy it like the people who gave it a thumbs up.","October 3, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The biggest gripe you hear is about how short it is, or how the "devs ran out of money while making it". I wasn't seeing anything like that. The ending definitely leaves the story open for a potential sequel, sure, but it's not like you're playing and the game just stops and shows the ending at some point. At any rate, it's a lot like Gears of War, but with a jet pack. The flying bits are pretty cool, and it's nice to be able to break out the pack whenever you need to get some height on enemies. There are veritical climbing areas too, and those are also a lot of fun. The gunplay is rock-solid, the upgrade selection is nice and enemy AI seems pretty competent.

Personally, I bought a copy of this game on sale a while ago and finally decided to play it on a whim with no activation issues.\n\nPros:\n- The gameplay and shooting is honestly pretty run of the mill for a cover based shooter. However, the addition of verticality and jetpack combat made the game a bit more interesting. The gameply itself was also solid and only bugged out on me once where I became stuck in the wall/ground, but a simpel restart fixed it.\n- The graphics are solid (character models are kinda outdated) and the game runs at a nice framerate\n\nCons:\n- The story is kinda lame and feels as if parts have been left out. Like they just want you to assume some things.\n- The story just kinda ends. Like there is a set up, a quick boss fight, and that's it. Like they ran out of money towards the   end.\n- The boss fights and the game overall is very easy. I think I died like three time because of me doing stupid sh*t.\n\nOverall:\nI gotta say I had fun. The game didn't overstay its welcome, yet ended oddly quickly. Also, it appears they had a set up for a sequel, buuuuuuuut we all know that didn't pan out. I'd recommend the game on sale for like no more than $5. A dollar per hor for this game was a solid investment.\n\n6-7/10\n\n","June 18, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My game did activate (28.06.2015) without problems.\n\nStill games should not include copy protection mechanisms. Its proven everything so far has been hacked. People that downloaded it without buying it will have a game without complicated activations and protection software that is never updated and thus a risk for your computer... even worse in a few years ahead this game might still work but the copy protection could prevent you from playing it (Slave Zero is a good sample for that) - the way to go - NOT! :-/\n\nGameplay 10/5-6\nStory 10/8 (Nikola Tesla, Bermuda triangle, Alien Conspiracy - what else you want?)\n\nNow comes the catch the game has no revocation tool. How many times are we allowed to play this game? Will i ever be able to replay it? ...\n\nIs it wroth getting this game if its up for sale? Yeno :-)","June 28, 2015","false","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take the ground combat of Killswitch and Gears of War, throw in some flight combat like Crimson Skies, add a pinch of human enslavement from Prey and Half Life 2, and you have Dark Void. Now it's not as good as any of those games, but it is worth a play through. The story is an interesting take on The Bermuda Triangle but has more than a few holes in it, but i would like to see someone pick this up and continue on with it. In the right hands and a little more finesse, I think it could turn into a decent franchise. For me the vertical cover system and the ability to go from cover based firefights to hopping in the air with your rocketpack to flank and even strafe your enemies was the freshest and most interesting part of the game. It is without a doubt worth $10 in my opinion.\n","July 5, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked it but i can see some people not liking it.\n\nThe big HICK of the game is the jet pack and that change a lot of the gameplay suprisingly. The jetpack / ground shooting can lead to some epic moment when your ♥♥♥♥ ship, then hijack one of them, destroy the other ships, eject, get in the base while flying with your jetpack drop a grenade in the generator and the BOUM everything explodes. ♥♥♥♥ING EPIC!!!\n\nOh yeah there is a story......but it sucks ♥♥♥.\n\n7/10","January 18","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game's gameplay and short campaign would be great on a device like the Playstation Vita, but on stationary consoles and PCs, this game just doesn't cut it. The gameplay is poor with bad controls and dull weaponry. It has a very bland "Main Character is voiced by Nolan North and he isn't playing Nathan Drake" basic feel to it. The main selling point, the "Rocketeer" look and badass looking jetpack are ruined by just how bad the flying is handled and how easy it is to die by crashing withought a "God Mode" cheat enabled. There is hardly any story to be had here, and to save you time and money, the girl dies at the end. Don't buy this bad game. 5.2/10.","January 7","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
