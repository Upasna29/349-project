Place them, upgrade each ones health and attack 5 times, and use the three abilities of your main guy, the one you need to protect. That is it really. There are some resurect and teleport abilities, but they seem pretty useless as I did not need to use them once.\n\nEven counting the "arena" which is the same map 5 times, increasing in difficulty each time, there appears to be only 9 maps overall, even though it seems to suggest at the end that there is more, maybe unfinished? Each map will take you 5-10 mins tops. There is a high score feature that you can upload and see your scores against other players, but it basically asks you to register to do this and I felt uncomfortable putting this in so never completed it.\n\nFeels a lot like a phone or tablet game, even though I can play tower defense games on my phone that keep me busy for weeks, some of them free, all of them cost less than half as much as this.\n\nThere is no way in the world you can justify spending the full price on this game, or even on sale. Should have been a little side game that came as part of the package when buying the Two Worlds 2 RPG.","December 29, 2013","false","3.0"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","79","84","0","2"

The gameplay pretty much consists of placing troops, leveling them up, and waiting to win. There are a handful of spells to cast, but I rarely had to use them. The short 5 map campaign can be finished in just over an hour. This is one of those games you'll play once and likely never touch again.","June 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","42","46","0","0"

If that is true then that game must be ♥♥♥♥ing horrible because this ♥♥♥♥ing sucks balls. The first couple levels were alright but then the desert level with scorpions spikes the difficulty from a 3/10 to a 10/10. I was doing everything I could, laying down the best guys and I had champion guards, necromancer and healers, and all fire mages, all fully upgraded including my main captain, spent about 40+ minutes on the level fighting upwards of 20 waves, and late in the level on a late wave a boss scorpion still got through and killed my captain despite me doing everything I could. I tried three other times doing things somewhat differently but still doing enough that it should have warranted a victory but still ♥♥♥♥ed me over on or right before the big scorpion. What a joke. I will be God damned if I try it a fifth time and waste another 40+ minutes of my life on an ignorant game like this. You have no freedom in how you play. A lot of bad tower defense games are like this. You have to play an exactly exact specifically specific way.\n\nLong story short I wasted over an hour of my life on this ♥♥♥♥ing joke of a generic game for nothing.\n\nSucks massive d1ck.

How WRONG I was... or maybe devs just doesn't understand the idea of this genre. Two Worlds II: Castle Defense is BORING. There is not much strategy you can use, Units are dull, skills are rather useless, maps are small and not a well planned for a game in this genre. I'm not sure if there is even any music when you are playing, all I heard were screams. Also, it's very short, with almost no replayability, which is a great loss for a Tower Defense game.\nSure, there is thing or two I liked in this game. Like, teleportation between units. What's more... oops, that's all. There isn't more good thing I can say about this game. Can't recommend it to anyone. Don't start your adventure with TD genre with this game - it will ruin your fun with this genre. I wouldn't even say to try it out to people who are familiar with this genre because of how boring it is. It would be a different if it was some bonus thing for beating Two World II main game. Something you get for free, but for this price? Sorry, it's not even worth full price, half of it, and even one dollar.

You have thoroughly played and enjoyed either or both of the Two Worlds games; 2. You are intuitive to details when thrown to the orcs.

Sadly, the mechanics aren't the best, and little to no hint as to even what level you should start off in (the Arena is the practice).
