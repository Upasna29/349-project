Fight, Talk, or Bargain = No Difference.  This frees you to be as idealistic and altruistic or as cold-heartedly cynical and self-serving as you want in your "choices" since nothing you do will ever affect anything that happens on this one-track plot railroad masquerading as an "adventure game".\n\nIf you steel yourself and play it again as I did rather exhaustively, then you will quickly discover that your - "choices" - won't change a single thing beyond a line or two of spoken dialogue here or there...and perhaps the life or death of a completely insignificant and inconsequential extra whose life or death can have absolutely no significance since even if said character had a name and a voice in the story your "choice" will have relegated said character to "determinant" status.\n\nWhat holds for Telltale's TWD Season 2 also holds here thus far in full force:  Determinant characters are effectively dead already especially when it comes to the plot.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  Its still a good story.  Yet it is painfully and quite frustratingly hamfisted in ruthlessly driving you down the length of its plot railroad regardless of your "choices" even when it makes absolutely no sense from any rational perspective.  This is a point that bears repeating since it runs directly counter to the tagline for Telltale games.\n\nYou can only fool yourself into thinking that your actions have some minute but meaningful consequence on the narrative and/or plot.  This is a terrible untruth to uncover with this modern almost kinetic visual novel style common to recent Telltale games.\n\nSure, you might argue that you can steer your character's personality at times and you get to choose their reaction to various stimuli but none of that is real outside the bounds of your own head.  There is no real immersion since there are no meaningful consequences to any of your decisions in the game.\n\nThe illusion of choice is very real here and that reality can begin to wear itself into a very hollow shell indeed especially if you ever decide to revisit your choices and make different ones expecting a different result.  This concept of all seemingly at odds choices blending into a single unvarying outcome grasps the essential Truth of all modern Telltale Games. It is truly unfortunate that Telltale's "New Direction" strips you of any and all forms of meaningful player agency, interactivity, and reactivity but there is no escaping this conclusion.\n\nThe bottom line is that baring a lot of people actually calling them out for it in favor of a lot more viable competition suddenly popping up in Telltale's little niche well...let's just say that Complacency is now the "One True King" of Telltale and "Long Live the King" shall be heard from their studios for a very long time to come.\n\n-------------------Summary--------------------\n\nThe Pros:\n\n+Great Voice Acting especially from the show's HBO cast\n+Good Narrative provided you buy into the false advertising of player choice affecting anything.\n+Protagonists are much more likeable and relatable than TWD Season 2 cast.\n+Excellent Atmosphere and Tension for the first playthrough.\n+Five more Episodes to watch...eventually.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n-Requires knowledge of the first three books and/or first three seasons of the TV show.  No handholding.  This is not an introduction to GoT!\n-You watch a group of powerless protagonists flail about...utterly helpless to affect or direct any of the events swirling in the world at large around them...\n-Lack of Substantive Reactivity in regards to your choices\n-Lack of Meaningful Interactivity with other characters\n-Plot Railroad is woefully single-minded in its implementation and often painfully transparent.\n-Meaningless choices.  Illusion of choice very much "stream-lined" throughout this episode.\n-Art and Animation is overall very sub-par, unpolished, and glitchy.\n-Audio and Mixing poorly implemented and stitched together in some spots leaving a rough finish.\n-Lack of meaningful game mechanics that require player interaction beyond dialogue based "choices" especially once you get pass the first part of episode 1 which is the only dominated by QTEs and with none whatsoever once you get past the second part of this episode.\n-Of course, like all recent Telltale games; there are absolutely no puzzles of any kind to solve and nothing to do but simply click or move forward to advance yourself to the next cinematic scene in the very linear plot sequence.\n-The cinematography features a lot of servicable close up profile shots of currently speaking and often completely stationary characters.  Not enough of the story is conveyed through its visual elements.\n\nBottom Line:  A good story with a lot of talented voice actors from the show that very professionally convey the proper tone and setting for their characters in-game but this is a good story with very little replay value since you have no agency and very little interaction as a player on what happens as a result of your actions.  The game takes even that illusion of choice away from you by tossing you some throw-away line or two of spoken dialogue.\n\nThe "action" itself is limited to you pressing a single key until prompted to press another key.   That and perhaps several parts where you left-click the cursor inside a circle is about the greatest level of interactivity in the action you as a player should expect in Telltale's GoT game.\n\nIf you want my advice, then you should probably wait until all six episodes are out and the "game" is on sale at a relatively steep discount before purchasing it to play through once like you are watching an episodic movie...before putting it away on your Steam library's digital shelf to collect dust and be forgotten.","December 7, 2014","false","63.3"," 3,214 of 4,180 people (77%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","77","214","4","131","181"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/330840/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account",""Your choices matter"\n\nHow cute. How can your choices matter when you are put in opposition to book characters like Ramsay Snow who, already having plot armor in the main story, are completely immune to harm in this spin-off title? You enemies in this story have the backing of someone who anyone familiar with the books/shows know is still alive, and therefore you know that no matter what Ramsay will get what he wants. Because if he didn't, then it wouldn't be canon, would it? The idea of having major characters in this game was novel, but not when they had a major impact upon the plot or, in Ramsay's case, were made to directly oppose the little game characters you got to play as.\n\nThat, more than most, underlies the major failing with this game: a game where choice is supposed to matter... but really doesn't. Telltale had this sort of problem with their previous games too, but it's impossible to miss here. Perhaps even worse is that this is supposed to be the first in a planned "series" of GoT games by Telltale, so it ends with unanswered questions and generally leaves things at a low point to leave as little as possible to make it into a next season.\n\nThey might think they got the "Game of Thrones" atmosphere right, but there is more to it than that than just having a bunch of Frey-expys bully the hell out of your characters. There are reasons why things happen. The Red Wedding wasn't just a random event caused by Walder Frey being a massive jackass. What happened to Ned Stark was the ultimate result of his decisions, not because somebody decided he wanted to see someone die. Tywin Lannister didn't have his life end just because someone gets off on humiliating people. Here... bad ♥♥♥♥ just happens. And keeps happening. And then it ends with more bad ♥♥♥♥. There's no reason behind any of it except "because they are just ♥♥♥♥♥."\n\nFurthermore, a number of the plotlines feel like they ultimately were for nothing and served no purpose, but might, maybe in some sequel thing you can spend more of your money on in case you really want to find out. Except that no truly good game ends itself with a sequel hook. The story is left incomplete and you are left with a deeply unsatisfying and unpleasant experience. I hate any game dev who creates game specifically with sequels in mind, and this is, without a doubt, one of those.\n\nSorry, but no. Telltale, you got my attention by having this based off of one of my favorite works of fiction. And what you did was create an experience I can only recommend to masochists who enjoy getting ♥♥♥♥ed with and lied to. I waited all this time hoping that by the time of the finale all of the issues I've had with this game having no real choices, having enemies you were completely unable to do anything to because they were central to the main series' plot, and the story seeming to delight in punishing the player just for its own sake would resolve themselves in order to get a decent conclusion that might merit further exploration (like Walking Dead Season 1) and make it all worth it.\n\nYou have failed me Telltale.","November 17, 2015","false","12.0"," 933 of 1,204 people (77%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","77","933","1","41","27"

Sure, seeing a character die the first time is brutal and amazing. But after the 3rd episode, after literally every decision you make having no impact and watching people die despite specifically taking precautions (a.k.a you order the gate to be lowered, but the game forgets that and suddenly thirty Whitehill scum are in your hall because nothing you do matters.)\n\nThe only choices that matter are the following:\n***SPOILERS***\nMira: Accept Morgryn's marriage proposal, or die.\nRoderic: If you don't sacrifice him to save Asher, his is survival is left ambiguous because Telltale didn't bother to write an ending.\nAsher: Same as Roderic.\nGared: Has no impact what-so-ever on Ironrath.\n***SPOILERS OVER***\n\nAnd if you're interested in any of the mystery that the early episodes hint at, don't get too excited, because Telltale hadn't a clue so they didn't bother answering any of the questions.\nNot that anyone will buy this game for the warfare, but the grandscale fights make no sense whatsoever. Also, get ready to sneak past people who are staring right at you.\nLastly, I hope you like NPCs making brain-dead decisions, like women running out during a SIEGE and then being SURPRISED that they get captured/killed. And WHY are the peasants in the town square when we're being SIEGED. GET IN THE KEEP YOU IDIOTS.\n\nBasically, Telltale makes unpolished episodes with weird cuts and reused assets (including reusing faces of people who die on screen), meaningless choices followed by a single life/death decision, and no true ending to the story, but they know it'll sell so who cares.","November 17, 2015","false","2.7"," 288 of 362 people (80%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","80","288","362","18","0"

No spoilers inside!)\n\nNote: This review was written by the time episode 1 came out. Only the very end of it has short updates about new episodes.\n\nI played through episode one, and I loved it! Having said that, there is criticism about it and I believe it's partly warranted. I don't share that criticism because it relates to something that doesn't personally bother me, but it will bother some people, so can you be disappointed with the purchase?\n\nFirst, I'll describe the game a bit. Most of the gameplay of this game consists of picking dialog options on a timer; all other gameplay is secondary and forgettable. This system works very well by giving you hard choices in tense scenes, whose consequences feel potentially very impactful. There is some action that requires pressing the right buttons quickly, which I believe is the weakest point of the game. Fortunately they're sparse and easy. I find a particular action scene choreographed rather poorly, almost breaking suspension of disbelief. However, the action that matters in this game happens in the form of dialogue, and that's where it truly shines.\n\nYou play three new characters that are not part of the show. They never meet, but even though in different places, they all move the same story forward, and their actions impact the others. The three characters are all related in their origins. The usual flow of the game consists of a brief introduction of the character/scene in a relaxed pace, followed by a rise of tensions up to a climax, at which point the game changes characters giving the player a calm after the storm. Then it introduces the context of the next character only to ramp up tensions towards the end of the scene again. This pattern repeats, and I must say, every time the character changed, it always felt jarring to me. It was always unwelcome. I wanted to keep playing the other character because I was too immersed in that scene that just ended. However, they won me over every single time, quickly making me care by introducing high stakes to some event as the scene unfolded.\n\nThere are only a few characters from the show appearing in this episode, but all of them have great performances and behave like you'd expect from any episode from the tv series. I don't think that the game's enjoyment is completely dependent on watching the show, but it will be severely impaired if you haven't. The game's story occurs between two seasons, so if you haven't watched it and plan on watching it, it will contain very heavy spoilers. If you don't plan on watching it, you'll be able to follow the main story line without a problem, but you won't understand many references and, most importantly, you won't feel the same tension on some scenes that you'd feel had you known more about some characters. In some cases, the characters from the show are barely introduced at all.\n\nNow, let's get to the meat of the complaints. I said before that these scenes "feel" very impactful due to the potential consequences of your actions, but many people have criticized the game for not changing much "under the hood" according to your choices, claiming that there's no choice, only the illusion of choice. This criticism comes from the fact that the game's marketing, as is usual with other games from the same developer, repeats the mantra that the game will adapt to your choices. I would say right off the bat that the developer's statement is true, although its vagueness is what creates wild expectations on many consumers. You might expect the story to branch out multiple times and have multiple endings, depending on your choices. The truth is that the choices do matter... a bit. Some people will simply have different expectations about the degree with which the game changes. Choices change content, but they change it in a self-contained way so that they can reduce the extra work-load that it creates, and the main event that ends the episode doesn't change. Now, bear in mind that these choices might have an impact on next episodes (in fact, that's very likely the case), but I'm only addressing criticism of outcomes not changing within the first episode. In the end, the main story arc will be the same (meaning that the episode always starts at point A, event B happens, and ends at C), but process will change slightly (meaning which characters are present in a scene and how they act).\n\nThe problem in expectations also results from the definition of a game. I think there could be much to say about this, but to avoid going on a long tangent here, I'll say that I believe this game (to a lesser extent than others, like Dear Esther) challenges that definition. There are failure states, where you have to restart a scene, but only on more physical action sequences. You know, the ones I said were too sparse, easy to get through, forgettable, etc. The core of the game doesn't really have failure states. It's more of an interactive story where your actions dictate how that story is told, but not whether you win or lose. The outcome is already set in stone. You might ask then, why having interactivity in the first place, and I'd say that, beyond the obvious instances where things do change, I believe that the choice of options on a timer during dire situations are a great use of interactivity as a device in story-telling.\n\nTo sum it up, I'd say that, with the caveats that 1) I didn't have the expectation of a more ambitious branching story, 2) I knew and loved the tv show, and 3) I was primarily looking for more of the show: the experience was absolutely thrilling and I totally recommend this game.\n\n---\n\nUpdate on episode 2:\n\nSo, episode 2 left me in a less enthusiastic state. I'd describe it in a word as: fine; and even though fine isn't bad, the contrast with episode one makes me feel slightly disappointed with just fine. To sum it up, there's a lot more of action, and a lot less of psychologically tense scenes or shocking twists. The more action-dependent episode doesn't really mesh well with the franchise nor with the strengths of Telltale's storytelling devices, in my opinion. More quick time events, but less of an impact. Even the appearance of a fan-favorite character of the show seemed lackluster due to the circumstances and the lower stakes presented to the player.\n\nBut then again, it's fine. I was kept entertained and interested in the story.\n\n---\n\nUpdate on episode 3:\n\nI literally just finished it... and it's awesome! I was worried after not feeling it with the second, but this one, I'll dare to say it's the best episode yet. It starts slow, but after it picks up it kept my attention all the way through. It's full of difficult decisions to make and I feel like they made a great job in making all of them feel organic and interconnected. The plot advanced at a fast pace, lots of tension and excitement, the main action sequence towards the end was very well done (one of my problems with the first two), so all in all, five stars. Even though the first episode still has the most shocking twist, I'd rank the 3rd on top for its consistency in its quality. I'm very impressed with it.","January 14, 2015","true","9.5"," 198 of 240 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","198","240","12","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/330840/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Disappointment utter disappointment! Game of Thrones (GoT) has been the most frustrating & dull game I have played from Telltale to date. Starting stronger than it ends (?), it's story across six episodes is cliché, lacking interesting characters other than those already established in the TV series.\n\nGoT brings little that is new to the table. The parallels between the Forrester's story & Stark's story arcs are uncanny, leaving me with a strong sense of déjà vu. After the first couple of episodes the pattern becomes clear, & as such becomes predictable. It lacks the twists or shock value that the TV series/books are renowned for, instead it compensates by using excessive violence & swearing. GoT world is brutal (that was to be expected), but this is not the brutality surgically used to emphasise the emotional impact of a scene that is done so well in the TV series.\n\nThe entire game sets you up for failure, regardless of the choices you make. Its one painful scene after another, leaving you feeling bullied & powerless to make a difference. This left me angry throughout most of the experience. In some respects you want a strong emotional response to the antagonists in such a story, but to put it simply the Whitehill's (your rival family) are simply one-dimensional assclowns where every single line of dialog comes off as obnoxious. They lack any charisma needed to be memorable villains. It's almost like the writers said, "ok, what is the most insulting & horrible thing we could say at this point" .. lets write that! None of the subtly or cleverness seen in the scripts that makes the TV Show so compelling.\n\nThere were also many parts of some of the story arcs that just didn’t seem to have any meaning/motive/link to the overall story. Senseless. Spoiler: The entire Mira line seems to have been put in simply to include existing TV Series characters & could have been cut all together, & Gared story line seems to have no impact what so ever on the characters or events in Ironrath.\n\nOverall quality of the production is sub-par compared to previous Telltale titles, from the animations to the facial expressions. Lips are often out of sync, emotions are not communicated clearly (crucial for a game like this), & often see odd things like character smiling when its a dead serious situation. Character 'popping' is semi-frequent, where they would just disappear, or jump to another location or miss a few animation frames. Texture mapping also left 'holes' in the characters where you could see right through them. Also many of the characters look very similar & in later episodes you can clearly see the same models being reused blatantly. If you fail a scene several times, music &/or some audio elements would stop triggering.\n\nIt is possible in many situations for you to not even press any button (or even mistime a button) when prompted & still get through the scene. Other times it took me several attempts despite pressing the button quickly/on queue. Felt very hit & miss, no pun intended.\n\nOne of the most annoying things though was the blurriness from the 'oil painting' effect used, that you simply cannot turn off. In a still screenshot it doesn't look too bad generally, but in motion the edges flicker badly; it is really distracting. It varies from scene to scene too, where some sections actually look pretty good, then others where the entire view looks like I am playing without my prescription glasses on. Other times parts of the screen are impacted & others are not, has such a random feel to it. On top of this there is a blurred 'halo' constantly seen around the characters. Nothing graphically is sharp & frankly looks horrible much of the time - it was a bold design choice from Telltale that regrettable doesn't work for me. Anti-aliasing also doesn't seem to work nor does running the game in 4k using DSR seem to help. Overall, this just diminishes the richness & beauty of the locations & the individual objects created in the world. An option should have been provided to disable this!\n\nThere is also some good aspects to come out of GoT. As with previous Telltale episodic adventures, the camera work & direction is great! The actual textures look vivid & detailed, as is the multiple locations which span most of Westeros. The multiple protagonists of the Forrester family are used well, changing often giving the same feeling/flow as the TV Show following several story arcs. There were the occasional scene or one-liner that did give me a good laugh too. The animals & beast animations are fantastic from the horses to the dragons. The voice acting is high quality & actors do their best with the script given, plus it includes the original actors from the TV series which is a bonus for fans.\n\nDespite the few positives I can take from this, & my previous issue explained with the story, dialog, choices & technical issues, by far the worst part of GoT is the ending. There is no closure, & my cynical self simply sees it at an attempt to sell a sequel. It is atrocious to be honest!\n\nUnlike Walking Dead seasons, which do come to a natural conclusion (yet leave it open enough to continue) you are basically left wondering what you have wasted the last 12 hours doing! Lots of death, lots of blood, too many loose ends & a lot of guff.\n\nSeems I will need to buy Season 2 to find out what happens...\n\nNo thanks Telltale, no thanks... I'll stick with the TV series.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","November 21, 2015","false","12.5"," 168 of 204 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","168","204","4","6"

Otherwise don't bother.\n\nYour choices mean nothing. The narrative consistently pushes you in the direction of failure, no matter what you do. Over and over and over. Just like most Telltale games, the animations are very weak. Not one semblance of natural human movement in the animations.\n\nOn the positive side, the voice actors are pretty talented.

There really is no choice. The illusion of choice is what is most prevelent. There are no two ways a story plays out, only two "choices" and one outcome regardless. So do not expect a telltale game to every REALLY give you choice that can CHANGE the story. That being said, and taking the game for what it really is, here are my further thoughts\n\nWould I recommend this game? If you love Game of Thrones yes, absolutely. For 6 episodes 30 dollars is reasonable with the first episode ccoming in at around 2 hours long, if you play slow and do everything possible. I really enjoy the stories characters who are well voice acted and engaging. It helps drive the story and you care for your characters and the people who you are playing and "protecting" I still think Wolf Among Us is the best thing Telltale has done and I hoped that GoT would offer ACTUAL CHOICE. Alas it is just another Telltale Interactive story. It does feel a bit rushed, and honestly Telltale can't get away with the Cell shaded "style" forever. They need to create a better engine that looks better and runs better, no blurring, jaggies or other graphical blemishes. That being said its not about graphics or ACTUAL choice its about a well crafted story that is enjoyable to play and experiance.\n\nIf you like interactive stories, and well crafted and acted ones at that. Game of Thrones is for you. The series could be one of Telltales best if they start offering more ACTUAL choice and deepen the story which I am sure they will, it can be a fantastic "season" of Game of Thrones.\n","December 3, 2014","true","14.4"," 237 of 311 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","237","311","4","7"

The voice acting is good. The animation is beautiful. The story is okay.\n\nMy problem with it is that the game is sold on the idea that you can take part in the politics of Game of Thrones when, in truth, you can't.\n\nObviously your choices couldn't have a larger impact on GRRM's story, and I never thought they would. But I was sold on the idea that I would be responsible for the rise or fall of a minor house. And the initial episode was reasonably good set up for that aside from one really important choice ultimately having no impact.  But the episodes following the first have become more and more like a plot railroad in a tabletop game.\n\nYour choices don't matter. And in a game whose main enticement is the idea that you can play politics, not having your decisions matter defeats the point of making a game rather than writing a book. It's simply false advertising.\n\nAnd for all those people whose response is "It's a Telltale game" (ie all choice is always an illusion), I say that yes, I have played and watched Telltale games before, and that in a line up with Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones is the worst game for not having your choices matter. Count up all your previous irritations and multiply them by 10. Despite the limited choices, I still love Wolf Among Us as a noir mystery. A mystery only has one solution, after all, so ultimately being linear doesn't bother me a bit. And while Walking Dead always has the same ending, you do have some choice in the matter of the lives and deaths of your companion characters. It feels like a real struggle for survival with real consequences for who you have at your side at the end.\n\nGame of Thrones, on the other hand, feels like even when you plan well and make good choices, it's ultimately pointless because the game will arbitrarily decide that your choices don't change the path of the story or the arc of the characters one iota. I will finish playing this game, but if I could go back in time and stop myself from buying this game, I would. I've got better things to do with $30. Heck, I've got better things to do with $10. So unless this goes on sale for $5, the price of a matinee movie, skip it.\n","July 23, 2015","false","21.9"," 104 of 122 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","104","122","4","0"

This game particularily hit a home with me as I am a lover of the show and the books, anything around this time really so maybe that has clouded my judgement here a bit. Anyways The pros and cons have always been a good thing to list off here\n\nThe Pros:\n- Very Rich Story with a promising future and keeps the gamer entertained all the way through\n- Episode 1 was alot longer than i expected and matched the pace of the show making it a fullfilled feeling at the end\n- Seeing alot of the characters from the show keep their personalities and even sounded like the characters from the show hit home to me\n- The weight of my choices making me want to go back for more than just 2 times so adds alot of replay value\n- The fact this game is not afraid to kill of a character to progress the story further is a nice feeling and matches the books and show\n- The graphics to me felt alittle wonky at points but has a pastel feel to it\n\nThe Cons:\n- The controls (Keyboard and Mouse) could feel a bit wonky at certain points like moving the mouse while walking\n- The Graphics to certain people may turn some people's heads because it seems like a downgrade from the previous games but to me that doesnt matter\n\nSo as i finished the first act i cant wait for more and i will of course update my review as more gets released. I am particularily really happy with the ending of the first act and HIGHLY reccommend giving this game a try i think its a steal for the price listed 29.99 and offering more than some 60$ games out there. very simple yet ever so complicated","December 2, 2014","true","10.7"," 356 of 488 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","356","488","8","24"

They proved themselves with Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, and now Telltale and Game of Thrones seems to be a match made in heaven. This game tells an original and very compelling story and, while it does give the "illusion" of choice in a way (follows a central story with different paths to follow), in true Game of Thrones fashion many of the choices presented will have you second guessing yourself constantly while the game keeps you on edge wondering what it will throw at you next. This is especially true for anyone intimately familiar with the show and books, as there will be many moments where you will attempt to make your decisions based on knowledge of the characters and setting from the source material. Also does not disappoint in sudden and game-changing plot twists that Game of Thrones is well known for.\n\nIf you have no prior experience with Game of Thrones, this game will be quite useless to you. However, being in that position I would have to highly recommend the TV series and/or books; as a whole this set of works is one of the best that literature and TV have seen in a long time.","December 25, 2014","true","18.5"," 123 of 155 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","123","155","8","0"

In GoT - ATGS you follow the story of the House Forrester, a relatively small Northern house who reside in Ironrath. The lord of House Forrester was killed on the night of the Red Wedding and as you play through this game you will see how House Forrester struggles to survive in Westeros' new political climate brought on by the death of the King in the North.\n\nDo not expect this game to be an introduction to the world of Westeros, the game begins on the night of the Red Wedding (Season 3 Episode 9) and there is no explanation of events that have taken place. This game is meant only for those who have seen the show and/or read the books.\n\nThis review has been written based only on the first three episodes which are currently the only ones available\n\n+Telltale have stepped away from their usual cel-shaded graphics and have opted for a watercolour art style which looks nice but doesn't come without issues (more on that later)\n+As is expected from Telltale the voice acting is fantastic and they even have some of the actors from the show in the game\n+Despite the game focusing on a relatively unimportant house we still get to see some of the show's main characters such as Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Danaerys Targaryen\n+Relatively interesting plot\n+As is expected from Game of Thrones there is more than one protagonist followed by the narrative though they are all members of the House Forrester\n+It's easy to relate to the main playable characters and they're very likeable\n+Some nice fight sequences which I really enjoyed playing\n+Some shocking deaths and it capture the brutality of GoT well\n+Decisions have to be made in a matter of seconds, puts a lot of pressure on the player\n+Provides more content to enjoy for Game of Thrones fans which can never be a bad thing\n+Good atmosphere and the first episode specifically has a lot of tension\n+Nice music which fits the game very well\n+Six planned episodes instead of Telltale's usal five\n\n+/-You follow a small and, in the grand scheme of things, a unimportant house. Don't get me wrong the story is interesting and it's nice to follow a lesser known house but personally I feel like the politics of Game of Thrones between the larger houses which is what makes GoT so great (in my opionion) is completely lost as House Forrester only interacts properly with one other house which is again quite small\n\n-Your choices have very little to no impact on what happens in the game\n-For some reason there's a lot of blurring with the new art style which is not only distracting but also makes it hard to see at some points\n-Despite it happening during episode 3 we don't get to see Jofferey's death which is rather disappointing(Season 4 spoiler)\n-Controls feel pretty clunky\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nGame of Thrones - A Telltale Game Series provides a good story in an excellent universe and manages to, for the most part, capture the spirit of GoT. This is in no way TellTale's best game but it's still a must buy for fans of the TV show and/or the books.\n\nEl K.","April 17, 2015","true","13.3"," 156 of 205 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","156","205","12","4"

The pacing is a lot like the books, with chapters that alternate between several "point of view" characters. Although there is some outright action and combat, many of the decisions you are called upon to make rely more on diplomacy and tact than your martial skills, and as the series is constantly showing, decisions have consequences.\n\nThe artwork for the game is really striking, from the trademark opening sequence familiar in the HBO series to the locations where the action is set. Some are places that we've been in the show (which is maybe a little too convenient honestly but still fun to visit), and some are new to the video game but everything still fits seemlessly in the world George R. R. Martin has established and the HBO series has visualized.\n\nThough the main characters are new to the game, members of a small Northern house mentioned only briefly in the books or show, they do (again, conveniently) interact with a handful of characters familiar to viewers of the show. Happily, all of these are voiced by the same actors who play the roles on HBO and so the voice acting in the game is one of the strongest parts of a game that already comes in strong with its story, music, artwork, characters, and design.\n\nIf you're looking for a quality gaming experience and good serialized story set in a rich and well-envisioned world, Telltale games comes strong in its first offering in the Game of Thrones series.\n\nI can't wait to play the next episode!","December 2, 2014","true","13.2"," 142 of 196 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","142","196","3","13"

Martin's A Song of Ice And Fire book series and Telltale's other titles The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, I was really looking forward to this title. However, I've found myself more and more disappointed with each episode I've played. I wanted to reserve judgment until the first season was complete, but playing the game seems more like a chore that I have to force myself to complete.\n\nThe first, and perhaps the most obvious negative, are the graphical capabilities. Telltale's games were never very impressive in the graphical department, but the Walking Dead was at least adequate, and The Wolf Among Us had some great art direction and used a bright, attractive set of colors. This game, however, fails to reach even a mediocre level. It has a similar style to The Walking Dead, but the textures are far muddier and at a lower resolution. The colors are unattractive; the artists seemed to rely on only a mixture of earth tones. It's not inspired artistically, and it's inadequate technically. Perhaps the artists felt too constrained by being forced to live up to the style of the HBO series. Whatever the reason, the game looks very poor, and it strongly affects the experience in a way that I didn't expect it to.\n\nThis leads me into the bigger problem with the series: Everything in the game seems grating and unpleasant. I play video games for entertainment and escapism, and playing this game is simply not an enjoyable experience. The beauty of A Song Of Ice And Fire is that things feel real despite it being set in a fantastical world. People are human and make choices that often best serve their own interests. It's somewhat cynical, but events occur that feel believable, which is an incredible accomplishment when you're reading about people living through decade-long winters and dragons. Terrible things sometimes happen to good people in the real world, and A Song Of Ice And Fire reflects that. The good guys don't always win, but when they do, it's special. The tragedies make the heroic moments all the more enjoyable. You find yourself grinning from ear to ear and pumping your first when a character you love finds good fortune or acts heroically and things go well. It's all about the payoff.\n\nThe problem with this game is that so far, throughout the three episodes of this series, only torturously terrible things have happened. There has not been a single moment of triumph. It actually damages any feeling of suspense or tension the designers are trying for, because I've so far been taught by the game that no matter what decisions I make, something awful is sure to happen because of them. Im fact, I'm not even positive that you can avoid any of the terrible occurences from taking place, as I've replayed some sections and made different choices and had nothing change. The same people still die, the same people get angry with me.\n\nAbout halfway through the third episode I found myself deliberately making the most aggressive choices possible despite their likelihood of leading to poor situations for the characters, and when I stopped to consider why, I realized that the game had trained my thought process to expect the worst, and thus attempt to get it over as quickly as possible. This is a very bad thing for a game, and playing through these episodes feels utterly masochistic. Literally nothing good has happened to any of these characters through three episodes. They die, they become grievously wounded, they're insulted constantly, etc. It's all absolutely punishing with zero payoff, and my desire to continue playing wanes with each chapter Telltale releases.\n\nIn conclusion: What makes A Song Of Ice And Fire so enjoyable despite its bleakness are the monumental triumphs of characters you've grown to love in the face of so much violence and despair. The writers of this game series simply do not seem to understand this, and as a result playing this game is an incredibly unpleasant experience. Everything about it is unremarkable at best, and ugly and unattractive at worst, from its graphics, to its characters, to its plot.\n\nAs the first season of this series is yet to be completely released, I will edit this review upon my completion of it. If I can manage to force myself to complete it, that is.","April 13, 2015","false","11.3"," 696 of 1,055 people (66%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","66","696","1","42","31"

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, I would suggest a "play video", or actually skipping it altogether.\n\nThe story is extremely immersive and intriguing. I have to give props to their good writers and excellent voice acting.  This is also concretely set in the Game of Thrones world, and feels natural there, not in any way forced.\n\nThe major downwside of this is the game is a game of choices.  The problem is almost always the choice makes no difference at all.  Some times you get a line of dialog, sometimes its completely ignored, and a few times the plot makes no sense based on your choice.  This slightly (ok majorly) takes away from the gamplay and turns it into a movie you're forced to take action in.  This honestly is what brings me to recommend watching a "lets play" video versus buying it.   Since its all the same anyway. I'm ok with certain plot points being fixed, it should be about the road to getting there and the road should feel personal, which it doesn't at all.\n\nFrom a plot prespective this takes place during the second to thrid seasons of the tv program.  While its does feel well set in the game of thrones world, it honestly didn't feel like enhanced the world, the tv show, or anything really.  The last episode I was hoping was going to bring at least part of the story to some sort of conclusion while leaving room for more.  Instead, nothing felt concluded, and I just had more questions.  It felt very shallow to me.\n\nSo this is completely out now.  However I think its worth noting.  I personally would suggest not paying for any tale tale game till the game is complete for two reasons.  One you get all the episodes and don't have to wait (that way theres no production issues you end up waiting longer for, and it should be noted that from the relase date of episode 1 to the release date of episode 6 was more than 11 months.   Thats quite a hefty wait for 2 hours of content per episode)  The second reason is its often at a discount price.","June 16, 2015","false","22.6"," 149 of 209 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","149","209","4","0"

But overall, the No impressions felt stronger to me than the positive one.\n\nThe game is clearly playing like 6 GoT TV episodes. Many of the protagonists die and the world of Westeros is a ♥♥♥♥ed up and grim place. So overall, if you enjoy the TV series, you may likely enjoy the story of the game. It is dense, good storytelling, and you actually experience Westeros for yourself. Kinda.\n\nBut here comes the deal. I played other similar games, like "Life is Strange", and the one thing that also hinders the game is the fact that it is based on a TV series. Especially because Telltale made IMVPO a grave mistake by involving major TV characters as vital characters in the game. If they were just cameo characters, it would not matter so much. But if you face Ramsay Bolton, it is like having an adversary playing in God Mode cheat. You know as someone who watched the TV series, you simply can't harm him. Those TV characters are like Gods, because for the same of the TV series they have to remain untouched and unharmed. You if you have anyone of them before you, you know you will pick the short end of the straw, no matter what. And it takes quite a bit of the uncertainty of a story-driven game, since you know what sort of character Ramsay or Cersei are.\n\nSecond, whereas in "Life is Strange" I had the feeling to have choice and impact, in GoT I had the feeling my decisions matters not at all. Whether I was friendly or hostile, helpful or aggressive - the outcome was always the same. I felt I could not influence or change the story at all, like I was on rails and the disaster was destined to happen no matter what. It does really feel bad, when you take lead of a character in a situation where your character is railroaded to die, no matter what you do, and what YOU think you would do, is not possible for the story-line. The deicisions I had in "Life is strange", made sense, because it was a modern setting and you acted reasonably within that setting. However, here, I often thought "I would have done something completely different". Only you can't. I felt artificially restricted into decisions and actions that were far from anything I would do.\n\nGoT just makes for a very bad world to put a story-driven Telltale sort of game in.\n\nFinally. The gore. I know GoT the TV series is gory at times. But I realized it is one thing to passively watch gore in TV, and being actively in a game where gore, torture and mutilation happens. I endure it in the TV series, but as part of a game, where I usually identify myself with the characters I lead, it is was just a few levels too much, and IMO unnecessary. In video games where you lead your characters, the feeling to be "inside" just put a psychological pressure on me, I found no longer "entertaining". They should not have showed everything in such detail in a video game.\n\nBottom line: as interesting as the story was, I felt too less playing a game, and way too much watching a film where my choices didn't really have any impact. And for a game, that is too less.","September 10, 2015","false","10.3"," 62 of 75 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","62","75","0","0"

I expected that going into this game. This is based of an established canon. Of course you can't affect the course of the show/books.\n\nHowever, this takes the pointlkessness of your actions to a new level. I was excited when I saw you were playing as characters of a lesser house. That would make sense. The game could show you some of the conflicts going on behind the scenes in the fight for the iron throne that don't make the cut for the TV show.\n\nBut TellTale didn't do that. They couldn't resist bringing in the cast from the Tv show which ultimately hurts the game. Because you already know the outcome of those character's life. It gives all the TV show characters "plot armor". Have the chance to kill one of them? Well, you know you can't. They aren't dead in the show, so you can't kill them here.\n\nAnd it goes far beyond that. It's a running joke that your decisions don't matter in TellTale games. But they suceed when they create a convincing illusion of choice. But this game doesn't do that.\n\nLet's say you get the mission to kill a guy. Everyone is telling you you're going to kill a guy. You arrive and start to beat him. You have a choice here. Be a sadist and really abuse him, or show restraint. Now if you have no plans for mercy, you might beat him and beat him until he's dead. But the game doesn't let you. Out of nowhere you have to let him live. And I'm not talking about some unexpected, his friends come to the rescue situation. I'm talking all of your allies are gung-ho, we're killing this guy, you start to torture him thinking, "why not? I'm going to kill him anyway." and then ouit of nowhere they go, "Actually, let's not kill him." and that's it. You get no choice in the matter.\n\nWhich brings us to the next issue, lack of continuity. As said before, regardless of your actions you're driving to a single resolution. But the game doesn't even acknowledge you actions on that road. You can permanantly maim a character in one episode, and in the next episode he'll return right as rain.\n\nI can't recommend this game to the average gamer or even to TellTale fans. Only hardcore Game of Thrones fans might enjoy this for some of the background characters/supporting lore it adds. And even they will probably leave disappointed.","April 26","false","14.0"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","48","56","0","1"

Regardless of the way you play the large majority of scenarios, you will end up at virtually the same result. This is of course excluding a few major choices in character death/survival. Yes, this was also the case in the games I mentioned above, but it seems much more obvious in this title. The game tends to trap you in situations where you can't possibly deviate from the prescribed path, no matter the choices you make. If this doesn't bother you, then disregard this point entirely. This was more my personal problem with the game than an objective flaw, as they did not technically claim the game to operate otherwise.\n\nOne of the reasons I adored The Wolf Among Us as much as I did was the complexity of the story. The plot legitimately felt like a mystery, where various outcomes were not only possible, but very hard to predict. I was regularly surprised by the game, and put real thought into my decisions because of my attachment to certain characters - a result of the story's complexity. Game of Thrones feels stale in comparison, and I mean that to apply to both characters and plot. Having played the 5 currently released episodes of the game, I couldn't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about a single character in the damn thing. They're all unoriginal archetypes, many of whom seem to be slightly modified versions of characters from the Song of Ice and Fire series. This leads me to another issue with the game, which is the smothering reliance on known characters from the series (Jon, Tyrion, Cersei, etc.) to manipulate the plot. When I picked up the game, (thankfully on sale) I was hoping for a fun side story within the world of Westeros, not merely a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of the best known characters from the show (and I say the show rather than the book series because of the character models). A few mentions and even an interaction here and there would've been a fun addition to the game. However, when every supposedly unique character must interact with one of the OGs to progress in their storyline, it gets a little dull.\n\nThe above summarizes, probably somewhat incoherently, my main gripes with Game of Thrones. Additionally, you should be aware that some of the graphics of this game are obviously less detailed than its predecessors. It's not surprising that some corners were cut here considering the amount of thought that seems to have gone into the rest of the game. Yes, these Telltale titles have a unique art style; one that I like, in fact. This one kind of hides behind the "unique art style" as an excuse for some ugly graphics. Seeing Rodrik's fairly detailed character model interact with people and objects is much more bearable when his scabbard is made of more than a single pixel. You get the idea. Not all of the game looks like this, but when any of it does, it tends to ♥♥♥♥ all over the rest of it.\n\nSo, this game is decent, as a game. As a Telltale game, it is disappointing. No way around it. I strove to find the bright spots in the game but they're far outnumbered by its problems. If you've never played The Wolf Among Us, you'll probably say "Eh, this was OK." But that's as far as I'd go. Again, I wish I could rate this game up, but the fact is that it's a sloppy, visually unappealing game with its corners cut to ribbons. I get it, they wanted to get on the Game of Thrones hype train before people stopped posting on Tumblr about Kit Harington. That would be all well and good, except that this game is on Steam for $29.99. You'd be better off just going and watching the damn show than paying this much for the Telltale Game of Thrones Ultimate Experience.","October 3, 2015","false","8.5"," 59 of 75 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","59","75","2","0"

The game is structured in episodes but when you buy the game you buy all episodes (even if they are not yet released).\n\nThe new characters that you meet and play feel like they really belong in the world of GoT (Game of Thrones) and you will meet and interact with a lot of characters from the TV series (ex. Cercei).\nThey kept the WOW factor also in the game and they made me play a second playthrough to see how the story changes if I take another path.\n\nI really think it is a MUST for fans of the books and TV series, but for those that have no clue about the world of GoT, before buying the game first familiarize yourself with GoT so you can enjoy at maximum the game experience!\n\n10/10","December 11, 2014","true","20.4"," 75 of 107 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","75","107","2","17"

This is a typical Telltale game with limited interactivity to the story but still managing to keep you involved with the characters and involving you in the action. It links directly to the TV series using some of the actors in situations that could have logically occurred parallel to the main story. The characters you follow are different members of the same family in a house we haven't seen before. They have to weigh allegiance with the Starks against the new powers in the region. The game looks great and the characters do too, although I wasn't sure about the Giant Dwarf Tyrion next to Cersei in one of the scenes!\nThis is on a par with the Walking Dead Series and Wolf Among us, which are my favourite Telltale games thus far.

A great story, unique characters and amazing visuals with professional voice acting from the actors/ actresses off the TV show, this game is a must play for fans of the series. However as much as I do love this game, I can't recommend it at this price. Please wait until it's at least 50% off. It will take you approximately 12 hours to complete all 6 chapters.\n\nReview:  Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series  starts off with  The Red Wedding , so if you're unfamiliar with the show/books, (Although the game follows the TV show.) I'd recommend starting there. We're then presented with one of the main protagonists of the story, Gared Tuttle, a squire to Lord Forrester. Players who have read the books know that House Forrester does exist (Only as a very minor house: Mentioned once,) but most informination is entirely made up for the purpose of the game. The story of House Forrester parallels that of House Stark, which is the reason why House Forrester was used to portray the story. However the reason for this is they're going to expect you to have  watched or read  the show/ books, therefore knowing what happens to the Starks. To combat this, they made up House Forrester to tell the same story  but  during the first playthrough, you don't know this, which does make the game enjoyable but it is easy to figure out the direction of the story after you realise the parallels. Despite this the story still has some suprising and unique twists of its own and keeps things fresh with the prospect of the north grove.\n\nThe game is split into 6 chapters, and will take you approximately 2 hours to complete each one. Each chapter will usually take you to the same locations: King's Landing, The Wall, North of the Wall, Meereen and Ironrath. You will get a total of 7 achievements from playing each chapter, with a grand total of 48 achievements at the end of the game. The game is almost completely linear, apart from where you may walk around to talk to characters or collect a vital object for later on in the story.\n\nUnlike The Walking Dead and The Wolf among us by TTG, GoT is very involved with the plot and characters of the show and books, so ultimately, you won't have a choice as the characters paths are already carved. So think of this game as a novel of sorts, a behind the scenes of the larger houses and an insight into the smaller houses. Although the outcome of the choices you are presented with are mainly the same, it's  how  you do them that matters. Your choices may mean, for example, if you will have an extra man fighting by your side or one less which could turn the tide of battle.\nA common complaint I see about the game is "little character development" and a "massive cliffhanger". This is because the game was  always  intended to have a second season, hence the massive cliffhanger at the end. They use the same technique on the show to ensure you watch the next season, and the season after that. I suppose the character development will be spread out across the Seasons. (If there are more than two.) Another complaint is the lack of achievement, which I can only guess was a result of their choices and not the game itself as I felt like I had achieved  something.\n\nThe graphics in this game definitely leans on the artistic side of things, reminiscent of renaissance art, which suits the atmosphere of the game. The audio is nothing special, but it serves its job well by adding to the intensity of the game. Voice acting is  There is more dialogue and choices than combat, which allows players to think more cunningly, and in my opinion is more enjoyable in story rich games. Another gameplay feature I enjoyed is that the characters can't all be fooled easily by the same thing, you would need to think about the character and what would work for  them.\n\nWhilst the game is far from perfect, it's not as bad as some of the reviews are making it out to be. It's a nice game to play at the end of the day, or in-between seasons of Game of Thrones. However as previously mentioned, it is  not  worth the price it's at, I recommend the price of £10 maximum. Despite this it is an enjoyable game for fans to delve in to.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","May 15","true","12.7"," 48 of 64 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","48","64","9","4"

Should I start with half the characters never affecting the story? Or canon characters from the Tv series showing up just so they can make a cameo even if the story suffers from it. Game of Thrones game by Telltale starts off by introducing house Forrester, a noncanon house made for the game. If you are a fan of the books or Tv series you can immediately see the resemblance to House Stark in House Forrester. Many of the characters in House Forrester are mirrored versions of characters from House Stark. While the characters themselves aren't bad they lack a certain amount of importance in their own game. Every character is overshadowed by canon characters making appearances and pushing the story. To make matters worse every canon character is invulnerable and unmovable in the game. Which is absolutely frustrating as canon characters seem to push the narrative more often than noncanon characters. One will always know how a scene will play-out when one of the canon characters is involved.\n\nLet's jump into the story shall we. The Forester house is a banner-man house for the Staks. It is implied in the story that the Forresters are a lesser house which means they aren't vying for the Throne but just to keep their house in order. This is a great place to set a story in the Game of Thrones universe. Instead of having to have a hand in the major players the story can explore the houses that have to deal with the fallout of the great house feuds. Unfortunately, that isn't the case in fact the Forester house is noticed by every single canon character that it becomes ridiculous. How the hell is the Forester house even on the Lannister radar? Why the hell would the future Queen select her personal handmadien be from such a small house? Why do all the canon characters know about House Forester? Well how else are they going to get screen time in a game they really have no place in being. The game sacrifices it's own story so canon characters can show up and throw their weight around; unsurprisingly the story suffers from it.\n\nNormally I would jump into talking about game play but since this is a Telltale game it's more of a mini-tv series and less of a game. So I'm just going to talk about the decision making mecanic. If you have ever played a Tell-Tale game before then you know that your choice won't change the major plot. Yet, in most Tell-Tale games although the major events will always happen, how you get to them or how characters approach them is tailored to your decisions. The Walking Dead games made this work by making you raise a character, Clementine, who couldn't impact the story but absorbed every decision you made. Game of Thrones lacks that, in fact the game tries to make you feel clever but since the main events are unavoidable you just feel cheated by the whole experience. This is compounded further by the end of the game when you realize only half the characters interacted with each other and the other half were on their own little story lines that never came back to the original plot. Did I mention the game has no ending? It's just a cliffhanger that I'm SURE will be resolved when the second season comes out. I felt so cheated at the end of this "game" the least they could have done was tie up loose ends and give the player some sort of payoff in the story, but they didn't.\n\nGo read a book instead.","April 30","false","11.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

You get to meet and talk to a few of the main characters from the show, as well as see some beautiful landscapes that weren't detailed in it.\n\nYou also have many QTEs and action in the game, so you won't just sit back bored with just the mouse in hand clicking from one scene to the other.\n\nThe point where this game fails, is the choice system. Telltale has gone against their own motto "This game is shaped by how you play it. your choices matter" in such way that is painful to play it. You won't have much joy in it, as no matter your choices, the worst will happen. The game becomes a choice of "who you want less to die"; you can't save someone without some else dying; you can't reach mutual agremeents with someone, just deals that suit them and dishonour you/your house; If you start to like a character, the game will make its best to drag him in the mud then kill him... and so on. Telltale tried to keep up R.R. Martin's way of writing, but failed miserably by creating too few good outcomes, and too many bad ones (even the good outcomes come at a high price).\n\nFinal Point: Personally, I hated this game while I was playing it.

Without them Telltale just wallows in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing, making the characters puppets to contrived conflicts and cheap twists. Game of Thrones is no exception and with this newest episode it’s completely fallen into dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥y.  The game takes place after Season 3 of the show, so if you’re not up to date show or book-wise steer clear because it’s full of spoilers. What first promised to be an interesting tale of subterfuge and medieval shenanigans devolves into grimdark torture porn. Great bleak as hell games like Nier, LISA, Silent Hill 2, Red Dead Redemption, Rule of Rose,and Telltale's own Walking Dead Season 1 all had humanity to them, some light at the end of the tunnel or at least  they showed the strength of human will or something similar to make them meaningful; they also all had characters that were sympathetic and human and you cared what happened to them as they made their way through hell. Game of Thrones has none of that.\n\nGame of Thrones is just endless misery through and through and Telltale goes out of their way to make it as grimdark as possible, characters and plot be damned. The characters are just punching bags and none of your choices have meaning. Walking Dead Season 1 had your relationships with the characters matter and all the characters were human, they may have been ♥♥♥♥ups and/or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they still felt real and when people died it was a shock and genuinely sad. GoT is the exact opposite of that, it’s the point that I’m just numb to all this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because none of it matters and it just will get worse because Telltale will just retcon ♥♥♥♥ in their own story just to make it miserable as possible.  At this point it also feels almost sickly voyeuristic, there is little humanity here, little joy, just suffering, and if they are any it’s quickly shot and buried. Ultimately its all the same flaws Walking Dead Season 2 had only worse and it didn't have Clem and a certain other character to save it.\n\nI’m still seeing this trainwreck to the end, but I recommend skipping this miserable ♥♥♥♥♥how and getting DONTNOD’S Life is Strange instead, a game with meaningful choices and actually impactful consequences as well actual humanity and genuine heart. I’m also done playing Telltale games because their competitors like previously mentioned DONTNOD, Cardboard Computer, WadjetEye Games, Fullbright, and hopefully Campo Santo are doing a far better job at adventure games than they are.","July 21, 2015","false","10.4"," 60 of 94 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","60","94","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/330840/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5490 products in account","So I've been saying for years I can't imagine how Telltale Games can top The Walking Dead Season 1, they put out some amazing games in the time period since that game released.  The wolf among us, (amazing), Walking Dead season 2 (stupendous), and a few other projects that have all been top notch adventure games (albeit shorter than I'd have liked, then again time flies when you're having fun).  With that said, I was fully prepared to play another outstanding game when I purchased Game of Thrones, (much like The Walking dead I wasn't a fan of the television show or comics/books prior to buying the game.... needless to say I'm a fan now) I had never watch a single episode of Game of Thrones, nor partook in any of the R.R Martin books, although I have heard amazing things about both..\n\nI was a bit nervous before I began playing, thinking I'd be totally lost, as the game seems to take place after the third season of Game of Thrones (don't worry you don't need to be an avid fan to enjoy the games, you may miss out on a few cameos, and a little backstory on some characters but it's certainly not necessary at all) yet I never felt like I was missing out, the game does a great job of keep non GOT fans abreast to what's going on.\n\nThe story - the game starts off at a place called "The Twins" at an event called "The Red wedding".  These events aren't really talked about in the game much at all, you can easily do a quick google search which will give you a great summery of what caused these events to transpire and have all the grisly details.  You start as a character known as Gared Tuttle, a squire for Lord Gregor Forrester.  After a few conversation choices, and a surprise promotion Gared is on his way to fetch wine, accompanied by another squire who does nothing but complain..   Be an ♥♥♥♥, or play it cool.. the choice is yours, after fetching or nearly fetching the wine Gared notices the Fray soldiers who have been stationed with the Forrester army are mounting up for war.  After trying and failing to quickly get back to his lord, the Fray army begins their assult.\n\nGared is tasked with making his way back toward the Forrester camp, along the way you're met with various QTE events and a few conversation choices, you see Gregor's son Rodrik Forrester, you stand by helpless while he gets slaughtered by Fray soldiers, rushing away and toward the Lord you encounter a few additional conversation choices, until you're eventually back with the Lord, he's gravely wounded and decides to make a hasty retreat with Gared at his side.  The next scene plays out with Gerad and the Lord in the middle of a forest, Gregor confides in Gared, and offers him the Forresters Lord sword.  You can try to argue but either way Gared is heading back to Ironrath alone..\n\nThe game starts off exciting and continues that way until the last minute of the final episode..\n\nThe Gameplay -  Unlike previous Telltale game releases GOT's see's you control 5 separate characters throughout the story.  Those are Gared Tuttle, Ethan Forrester, Mira Forrester, Asher Forrester, and (A mystery Forrester)!!!  Another change was the addition of a 6th episode, most previous Telltale games have had 5 Episodes.  The rest is fairly straight forward, conversation, QTE events, some easily solved puzzles, and of course the choices.  The meat and potatoes of any Telltale games, your choices, these are the choices which divide paths, which decide who lives and who dies, and generally give the illusion that the player choices matter.  (in all honesty the player choices matter is kind of over blown in most telltale games, as normally if you have to choose to save one character over another, the surviving character typically only last an episode or two longer before they meet their demise.)\n\nIs it worth it????  In all honesty I'd say this question is easily answered with a resounding yes.  I'd put this game slightly below The Walking dead season 1 in terms of how much I enjoyed it.  Game of Thrones kept me on the edge of my seat, and continually kept me wanting to help save the Forresters.  I felt emotionally invested in the characters and every blow they felt, I felt.  Every tear they shed and blood droplet they spilled I felt it as well.  Telltale games didn't disappoint me with another amazing story driven game.  The art work is beautiful, like a living oil painting, the characters are unforgettable, the voice acting as always is top notch and when the credits roll you'll find yourself wishing you could go into hibernation mode until the second season releases..\n\nSo without question I'd recommend buying this game, enjoying it and getting yourself ready for the sequel which has been confirmed by Telltale games.   NOW with that said, if you disliked previous TellTale games, such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, MineCraft Storymode, or Borderlands a Telltale game, I'd probably avoid this game as the gameplay and style is nearly identical, aside from a different art style.\n\nPro's  - Amazing Story\nBeautiful art work\nGreat voice acting\nLikable characters\n\nCon's - Some pretty big technical issues\nSome odd save glitches repoted by some people\nSome of your choices get reversed in the next episode (IE the opposite choice is used in the following episode.)\n\nMost of the cons are present in other Telltale games, you'd figure after all the games they made using the same engine they would have worked them out by this point, but those issues aside (which IMO can be a pretty big nuisance, especially if you're looking to get a certain ending but it fails because the game shows you let the opposite person live, or choose the opposite path etc etc etc.)","March 7","true","28.6"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","39","57","0","3"

It does not work well when you have "control" of the story and are constantly kicked in the teeth at every turn. Of course, I say "control" in quotations because like all TellTale games, there is very little to zero player control in the story. Sure, we can make choices in the game but they don't affect anything other than a dialogue line here or there at best. The outcome is still the same. As an example from recent memory, with a minor spoiler, the Whitehills are breaking into the Forrester keep, killing all the peasants, and the player is presented with an option to save the peasants or reinforce the gate to stop the enemy soldiers from pouring in. Regardless of what you choose, the same thing happens; you don't make it 20 feet before you're stopped.\n\nBy far, my biggest complaint with this game has to be the fact that throughout the entire 6 episodes of this game, virtually anything that can go wrong for the player, does go wrong. You are kicked in the teeth at every turn and there's nothing you can do to actually stop it. Furthermore, this game features a whopping 5 protagonists that the player controls. Two of them have no actual effect on the grander Forrester story, 1 of them dies very early in the game with no way to stop it, and the player is forced to choose which of the remaining two lives. In the end, only 2 of the protagonists survive the end of the game (3 if you choose to enter one into slavery), and one of the two surviving protags has had no bearing on the story as a whole. His survival is clearly a lead in for a season 2, which I for one will never purchase. This game is an exercise in futility of the highest degree. Video games are supposed to be fun experiences but this game is almost nothing but frustration the entire time. As I said, virtually everything that can go wrong, does, and no matter what the player chooses or tries to do, there's no way to win. I don't know who at TellTale thought it would be a good idea to make the player suffer through a story playing as House Stark 2.0, but it is not fun. It's like trying to play basketball against a professional team and your entire team is made of midgets.\n\n2/10, would not recommend.","November 29, 2015","false","13.1"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","35","50","4","0"

Martins success phantasy world, we take part while experiencing the fate of House Forrester,  a smaller northern noble house, which leads the production of ironwood, an important production material for different kind of arms and armor. In the wake of the "Red Wedding" the house, falls into disarray, facing not only their old enemies the Whitehill clan, which are in league with the cruel Boltons. But Telltales Game of Thrones story also reaches from the southern Kingdoms over Kings Landing up to the Northern Wall and beyond.\n\nNaturally this includes quite some of the popular characters from books and tv series, which are spoken by the actors themselves.\nThis is only one of the points, which give Telltales game a great atmosphere, so it fits nicely into the rest of the setting.\nThe story itself, which quite sometimes offers surprises, in what the haunted northern House has to endure in their struggle for existence, also does not suffer in comparison. No one is safe in the harsh world of Westeros.\n\nWhile regarding music and synchronization there are few points to criticise, the graphic is dark comic, not really very detailful, but ocassionally quite beautiful still.\nThe gameplay meanwhile is the -nowadays- usual Telltale style... quite few actual puzzles or classical adventure interactions, while the story is mostly dialogue driven, supported by the occasional quick time event (the valar morghulis death screen can happen quite often here) and told by cut scenes.\nDuring the six episodes the player also has naturally quite some decisions to choose from, which influence the way the story goes more or less - naturally more often less, but nearing the end it get´s more pregnant.\n\nSpeaking of the end, this is also one of the main complaints, one can bring up here. Since Telltale is at the moment developing a second seasons, they left quite some open ends in their finale. This can dampen the effect for players, who naturally want a finished storyline.\n\nConclusio: For fans of Game of Thrones the love, with which the lore and drama is presented will bring much fun i guess. As long as you are not bothered by Telltales kind of presentation and the partly open end, it should be a clear recommendation.\n\nPoint Scale 8/10 - Very good\n\nPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog#curation - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 81 of 133 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","81","133","2","13"

The comparisons I make are between the Telltale Games of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.\n\nThoughts:\nThere is something about the way Telltale Games designs their games, and at the heart of them, are excellent storytelling. They find a way to get you to gravitate towards a character or despite another, but they go one step beyond TV or comics by giving you the key to the storytelling. Everything is in your hands, and this Game of Thrones is the very same. They introduce a house not currently covered by the HBO show, but keep some familiar faces to ease the transition. The art style is similar to their other series, but with differences that make Game of Thrones different from the other three.\n\nNow about the game:\nThe controls take a couple to several scenes to get used to, but similar to season two of the Walking Dead, with much more reactionary sequences. Button mashing and quick QTEs :)\nVoice acting is quite good, with very familiar voices (and faces") if you watch the show.\nFree roam is similar to other series by Telltale, with slow walking and good interaction with other characters.\nSome of the scenes have weird face movements when characters are speaking, but it is few and far between.\nPleased with the control of multiple characters, a difference between The Walking Dead that is welcomed.\n\nI am very happy with the new installment and glad I can finally write a review.\n\nTL;DR - would recommend, if graphics are more important to you, then stay away; great storytelling reminds you how well made a game is.","December 4, 2014","true","10.2"," 42 of 64 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","42","64","0","1"

The interface is still a bit clunky, the field of view isn't optimal, and some little frustrating cliches such as two soldiers pausing to smile each other IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT...you can guess what happens next. The different POV's are a nice touch but as an avid fan of ASOIAF it feels a little too convenient that House Forrester is in so many vital locations throughout the story. I would have preferred a story that didn't necessarily have to involve many main characters from the series, since it can verge on feeling forced.\n\nOn the plus side the voice acting is much better than previous Game of Thrones video games, the artwork is decent, and the world is consistent with the show so far. The choices so far haven't really been heartwrenching yet, but you can tell theres going to some major stuff going down later. Most of the choices so far have been the superficial type we saw a lot in other Telltale games, but I'm fine with having a good plot and being able to affect some details here and there. All in all Episode 1 is an 8/10, it's done a good job setting the scene and introudcing some likeable (and hateable!) characters. Hopefully future episodes can capitalize on the build-up.\n\nAll in all an intriguing setup for an immersive if a touch heavyhanded story. I would definitely recommend a buy if you have any interest in the ASOIAF story.

To be honest I didn’t even knew what ‘tell-tale games’ were all about. About the game, the characters are displayed brilliantly and have interesting storylines.\n\nFurthermore they are connected brilliantly to the main characters and story we all know from the TV-series (and books). Some say it doesn’t matter what choices you make in the game. This is partly true, but only for the first season. Without giving away a lot of spoilers I can say that every decision you make in season one can bounce back on you in the second season of this tell-tale game series. Also the complaints about getting no achievements in this game are completely biased, why should one play a tell-tale game series for the sole purpose of getting an achievement? I mean you can’t be a pro in this GoT tell-tale series, either you choose for war or diplomacy, which one you choose usually doesn’t matter as with GoT death lurks around every corner!\n\nThe graphics of this game are not extremely brilliant, but the style in which this game is made is brilliant! It looks like a living painting of the Renaissance!

The story is tailored to how you play." which is an utter lie. No matter what choice you make you will get the same results in the end. Sure there are different scenes depending on the choices you make that you wouldn't see if you had not made the same choices. Ultimately however, what you do has no impact on that happens in the story, nor can any of the events be altered by your choices. Not only are the choices you make irrelevant some of the events in this game defy logic and the laws of nature.\n\n! SPOILERS AHEAD !\n\nAs an example in the first episode if you choose to meet Ramsey Snow at the gate and leave his guards on the other side they will still teleport into the great hall. In episode 5 if you choose not to take Arthur's men with you and instead lave them at Ironwrath Ramsey will still flay him, regardless of your choice to take him with or leave him with his men.\n\nNot only are game events illogical, characters within the game also make irrational choices contrary to their character, and to the context of the world. This is the most obvious when you are betrayed by Duncan or Royland, which makes no sense considering Duncan was the only person Lord Forrester trusted with the secret about the north grove, and everyone is going on and on about how honorable Ser Royland is.\n\nIn short if you enjoy being Masochistic this game is perfect for you. If you enjoy a well written story with compelling, REAL characters this is just a waste of time and money, out of all the games in my steam library I regret buying this one the most.

In many seemingly pivotal decisions, every single option has the same result. For example, I reset an episode and tried everything the complete opposite. No difference. They really rub it in your face that you "chose wrong", too, even though the result is the same for every option.\n\nGame of Thrones is a successful fiction because it's highly realistic fantasy. Characters are complicated, with motivations, things they care deeply about. They feel like real people. This game is kind of a crapshoot. About half the characters feel real and fleshed out, the other half feel completely flat and shallow like cardboard cutouts--mustache twirling villains and all. It's a weird jarring mix.\n\nThere's a few characters from the TV show/books, which is cool, with one exception. Ramsay Snow. You're pitted against him multiple times, and you know full well he's narratively invincible, that nothing you do could possibly harm him, because he's protected by story canon. It was a terrible decision to make him a recurring villain. One of the key selling points of the Game of Thrones fiction is that no one feels safe. Anyone could die at any time. Good people can get beheaded, monsters can be poisoned, etc. Making a character 100% safe is a terrible idea, and pitting you against that invincible character is a game-breakingly bad idea.\n\nThis sort of magic-wand solution to plot happens quite a bit. There's obviously an expected "path" the player is supposed to follow, and if you don't choose those options they just shove you right back onto the main path as quickly and crudely as possible.\n\nMake some tough choices to get key information about an ambush? You still get caught in the ambush.\n\nYou get the ♥♥♥♥ kicked out of you just like that for the entire game, and then it's over. They seem to hint that a few choices will effect the next season, but I won't be playing it.\n\nIf you still really want to get this game, just know that you could spam click randomly through every dialog and story choice in the game and still see the same plot everyone else did.\n\nRating: D+\n\nEDIT: I really have to complain about one more thing because it's been bugging me that I didn't include it. I'll have to spoiler this since it would be too hard to explain otherwise.\n\nAsher is this insanely badass warrior who fights with falcata (a sort of sickle-shaped sword) and handaxe. Rodrick is a man who came back from the brink of death, permanently crippled and can barely walk. He uses his father's greatsword...adequately.\n\nAt one point late in the story you have to pick who lives and who dies, Asher or Rodrick. I picked Rodrick, for my own reasons. Later there's a battle and I lost horribly, and thought: damn, I bet Asher would have kicked ♥♥♥. So I went back and tried it the other way.\n\nThis is where it gets bad. They give Asher the family greatsword so they can just reuse the same exact animations for the entire battle. They literally just changed the character model and reused the scene.

They did so with mixed results. Early parts of the game are compelling, but the story fizzles out in the final two episodes. There are FAR too many major plotlines left unresolved at end game. As a self-contained story this game completely fails, and that's the most disappointing thing: there is enough story here to bring closure AND keep the player enticed for a sequal.\n\nInstead we need to wait a year and pay another US$20 for season 2. Unless you are a hardcore 'Game Of Thrones' fan, I don't think this game has much value to it. If you're interested, wait for a sale.\n\nAdditional Spoiler Free Thoughts:\nIn playing the ensemble cast of House Forrester you are presented with choices that are supposedly important, but typically do not result in much more than an extra line of dialogue later in the game. Your pick between being bold or clever rarely results in much variation to the core story. In other words, despite your pick of options the same results will happen no matter what. X person is angry with you, Y figure accuses you of a crime, etc.\n\nAnd as a final thought, the 'traitor' sub-plot was very poorly done, and in some cases becomes self-contradictory.","November 17, 2015","false","21.9"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","28","41","2","0"

But I'm a fan of other Telltale games so it seemed like an easy decision when I found this game on sale.\n\nIf I could describe the game in one word it would be: disappointing. Telltale was just out of their element here. Unlike many of their other titles, which generally steer clear of the source material's main plot, the GoT game meshes directly with the events of the HBO show. This is where the game really fails because a) so many of the tie-ins, be they character interactions or events, feel forced and unnatural, and b) it takes away a lot of the decision making drama, because you know that you can't actually accomplish anything that would interfere more than tangentially with any of the characters for the show.\n\nNot to mention, the original characters and storylines just aren't that great. The Forresters feel like a discount Stark family, and most of the major plot points are predictable and/or wink-and-nudge references to the show. The whole experience feels more like bad fanfiction than a Telltale game.","December 3, 2015","false","12.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","0"

That's absolutely fine. Sam and Max did it, Monkey Island did it, The Wolf Amoung Us, The Walking Dead Season 1, and Back To The Future all did it, and it worked out pretty damn fine.\n\nBut, don't tell me that choices matter in the game when they all just bottleneck back to the same terrible things happening to you.\n\nAlso, they called a Skin Changer a Warg. He was not a Warg, Wargs bond to wolves. All poodles are dogs but not all dogs are poodles.\n\nJust..another tiny detail that made me think they didn't exactly do their homework on this one, and were really just trying to cash in on the hype train of Game of Thrones. The seemingly endless tie ins and parallels to the show just seem really shoe-horned in, too, and further support this theory.\n\nAnd making a main antagonist of about half of the season be a character in the show that is completely without anyway of being defeated? Like, we know he's got plot armor, can you maybe stop dangling that ♥♥♥♥ in front of our faces, because it's frankly infruriating.\n\nReally, I love Telltale's stuff most of the time. Walking Dead season 1 is one of the few games that I've played that's actually brought me to tears, and that really speaks volumes about how strong the writing was in that game.\n\nBy the end of Episode 6 of this game, however, I was like "♥♥♥♥ it, I don't care what happens to these people, I'm going to die, anyway, I might as well make some terrible decisions and run this baby into the ground."\n\nI feel like Telltale is better than this, and it's honestly the first game of theirs that I've played that has disappointed me.","January 31","false","14.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Every choice feels important, even if a lot of them just provide different paths to the same conclusion.  The exception is when big characters from the show come around.  As a fan, it's cool to see them and helps the world feel more authentic.  But the interactions with them feel forced, and ultimately hurt the story.  Part of the fun is the whole "anything can happen at any time" suspense that you get from Game of Thrones, and interacting with show characters is the complete opposite.  You as a show-watcher know what is going to happen to them, which drives home the fact that your interactions with them don't really matter.\n\nBut all that would still be fine if not for the ending.  For all the story this game spends hours building up, the ending resolves practically none of it.  It's a huge slap in the face that basically amounts to "What happens next?  Buy Season 2 to find out!"  Cliffhangers are something you can get away with on a TV show.  In a game like this, they just make the whole thing feel unfinished.\n\nFor a story-based game, I thought there would be at least SOME story resolution.  Maybe in Season 2, but I'm not holding my breath.  Don't waste your money.","May 18","false","13.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

SPOILER ALERT !!**\n\nWell. My choices didn't matter. Sorry, that probably means yours won't either. No matter what, there is no winning, no positive turnout, and no general satisfaction of completion or "Oh I did well." I can understand how Telltale is simply trying to lure someone into purchasing another $25-30 or more worth of game at the end, but it isn't satisfying. With the amount of wait time between each season, and now the amount of wait time just for some closure, it isn't worth it. Either watch a letsplayer try their luck and be satisfied with the story, or simply wait until all of the seasons are available, or better yet, just avoid it. I enjoy Telltale's games, but of all the ones, there was no closure in this one. Only "Oh great, no matter what I choose, I lose."\n\nWhile it is completely littered with Game of Thrones references, as another reviewer put it, there is simply too much solid "You can't do anything because this character is part of the actual story" junk. For example, Bolton can just do whatver he wants, Margery is untouchable and thusly influencing her is a waste of time, Cersei always wins, and no matter what there is nothing but death and disappointment. Oh but don't worry, even though you lost the game and all of the worthwhile characters were killed, there is going to be a second one! So don't you worry, there is going to be more masochistic slaughter where your choices most likely won't matter!\n\nWhen you think it's bad, it gets worse by some ironic loophole that all of the villains can get through but god forbid you get one. When you think it's worse, it becomes all hell and someone dies inevitably.\n\nIt's not worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cornbredx/recommended/330840/","cornbredx","CornBRED-X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cornbredx/","421 products in account","So, to start off, I generally like these kinds of games. I like playing games for story when that's the kind of game I'm playing. I don't have a problem with Telltale's way of making the dialogue choices the majority of gameplay and challenge.\n\nIn this game, though, all that falls flat. It isn't until maybe episode 4 that the story even gets interesting and by then I've already made up my mind how I want this to go for everybody. Interestingly, by the percentages at the end, most people did too it seems.\n\nThe story in this is more brutal than the show. Don't get invested in anybody. Most of the episodes are so poorly written; they seemed to feel they had to crank it up to 11 to compete with the amazing way the show can be so unpredictable they ended up becoming even more predictable than the show is now. So, you may as well not care. The pacing is really bad, too, because they try to be like the show and tell multiple stories, but fail to make any of them gel properly. It feels like disjointed bits rather than a cohesive whole.\n\nIt does eventually come to a point when all ways seem to collide, but it's done in a way that doesn't feel necessary. Actually, the way it turned out for me is probably for the best. I hoped it would be even more apocolyptic- because of certain aspects they try to force into the story (like they always do but I think it's done the worst in this) certain things dont happen to certain people and do to others. So it wasn't completely the way I had hoped to steer the ship.\n\nI'm trying to not spoil too much which is why I'm being so coy. Story is key in these games, and I felt most of these episodes are poorly written and seem to misunderstand the show a bit. Maybe if we kill someone every episode we'll be as good as the show? No. No it just comes off as trying too hard to be modern day edgy (for me).\n\nI can't say much else. This is already a bad review, but I didn't like most of this game. I did however like my ending. It summed up how I feel about this game. It's dead. It's a shame they are doing another of these because the way it turned out for me I don't really see a need to play it anymore.\n\nIt's done, and I'm glad.\n\nI'd tell you not to get this, but based on the fact that they're doing another season suggests you probably already did.\nThere's other problems too. Sometimes the game doesn't notice the choice you picked. Sometimes you somehow pick a choice you didn't intend because the option meant something else than you understood. In this more so than other Telltale games I've played it looks dull as rocks. There's a bunch of other stuff too.\n\nI don't recommend you play this. Even if it's cheap. It's not really worth it even for the story. It's just dull, and doesn't turn out well. Save 11 hours and play something else.","December 8, 2015","false","11.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","2"

I am also a big fan of the Song of Ice and Fire, I really am. But this story was a bit over the top. You might enjoy it if you are a true emotional masochist, because plainly put it is a story of downfall of a single Westerosi house. Nothing more, nothing less. Things get from bad to worse. People die. Physical and psychological torture goes rampant in every chapter. Every turn of the plot is teeming with helplessness and despair. And no, it does not get better. Ever. Basically all that the player is left with are grim choices, which of the characters are going to be butchered next; are they going to be hit in the face a little or a lot; and how much they are going to be humiliated morally. Sometimes you don’t get to choose at all, but they still pass away in the most horrible ways. No matter what you do, everything just goes to hell anyway, leaving you with the feelings of helplessness, anger and frustration throughout the game. You can guess the ending. It’s stark (pun intended), despite all expectations to see at least a glimmer of hope. Oh, and there is a huge cliffhanger at the end, so don't expect the feeling of resolution and relief that should be there once you finish the game.\n\nSome of the script solutions made by the Telltale writers are also very questionable. SPOILERS AHEAD. I know Ramsey Snow is a psychopath, but murdering a vassal lord in front of everyone? Isn’t that a bit too much even for the likes of Ramsey? The argument behind the family traitor line is extremely weak – “you ruined the house through your weakness, so I have decided to ruin it even further through my plotting”, as Royland put it. Really, Royland? And Daenerys, refusing to help Asher for killing one slave master even though he had helped secure the city. Is that a fair deal? All too often you can feel the characters are being deliberately cornered so they would HAVE to make the tough choices in the next chapter.\n\nThe controls are crappy. The mouse cursor moves with a delay, which makes it difficult to select the right answer within the limited timeframe. Moreover, the time starts running out BEFORE the other character finishes speaking. There were so many times I had to reload the game because I selected the wrong answer due to the floating cursor. The controls in the fighting scenes are hard to grasp too. Sometimes the fight just goes on, and sometimes you are required to press a random key at random moments. Sometimes pressing a key before the icon on the screen disappears fails to produce any results. I just don’t get it. The system has to be more precise. Or is it made to frustrate players like everything else in the game? It could be considered a great success then.\n\nI guess the only thing that was really nice were the familiar and memorable voices of the characters from the TV series performed by the same actors. Applause for that.\n\nMy overall impression of the game was very mediocre. The controls have been poor in all the games of Telltale, but the writing has been mostly good or great. Still you can’t keep beating the dead horse of dark worlds, tough moral choices and bad endings. It gets predictable and boring. I doubt that making the scripts even darker and hopeless – like they did with Game of Thrones – is the right path.","January 13","false","14.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

I've been a big fan of the book series for a long time and liked the first season of The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, so I was interested to see how this would turn out but still had modest expectations based on season 2 of TWD and the end of TWAU.  Take note the game fully expects you to have knowledge of the series coming in and doesn't work well as a stand-alone experience.\n\nIt has all the typical railroading you'd come to expect from a Telltale game and the writing and characters aren't good enough to counter it.  It tries to do too many things and ends up not doing any one thing particularly thing well.  It wants to make the the main cast important by having them meet up with a bunch of major characters from the source material and suffers from it since it feels so forced.  It tries to take a handle on the book POV style and have a bunch of viewpoint characters but you end up splitting a 90-minute episode between four different groups and none of them feel fleshed out.  The main cast is also supposed to be the not-Starks to a puzzling degree and would of been much better off with some personality.\n\nThe visual style is really sub-par and character models are all over the place in quality.  There are jaggies everywhere and backgrounds and any type of detail work stands out in how poor they look.  I thought Telltale did a great job with TWAU  stylistically so it's disappointing to see them put out such a bland-looking and technically ugly game.\n\nIt's still the same old Telltale engine and gameplay where you're going to be hitting q and e a lot with the occasional "hold down the forward button to walk for five seconds" segment.  No simple puzzles or anything.  Telltale also desperately needs to work a line-skipping function into their games.\n\nFinally, it's not a self-contained story and I'm sure a second season will be announced soon, so don't expect this game to serve as a stand-alone experience.  I probably won't bother since I have a lot of doubts whether Telltale is capable of any type of nuanced writing at this point.  Most of the game just feels like they're trying to get a reaction by having stuff happen.\n\nIn short, Telltale's AGoT is more of  the same, but unlike their recent adaptions, AGoT expects you to have knowledge of the series coming in so it doesn't even work well as a potential attraction for non-fans.  A "maybe" purchase if you dig their narrative games and a not recommended if you're on the fence.","November 17, 2015","false","11.6"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","0"

But, this game isn't about your characters dying or how they die, its about the choices you make that develop your characters and expand the story. You can be brave, you can be merciless, or you can be a coward, there is no right way to play the game, it is up to you to choose what is right and what is wrong. My only critique for this game is that no matter what you do Ironwrath falls. I personally chose to keep Rodrik alive rather than Asher because of his relationship with Elaena, but her status remains "undetermined" which is very unfortunate and disappointing to me. Overall I think this game has a very compelling story and I would rate it a 10/10.

Here is why.\n\nGame of Thrones, is a gigantic source to adapt. I'm not even talking about the books here, only the TV series and as someone who have not read the books I don't hold anything against the series or Telltale's game adaptation because it chooses a different path than the books.\n\nThe problem is, this game is not for those who already know the TV series and invested in it deeply (the game's timeline is deep in the TV series' timeline, starts with the Red Wedding). For those who are not yet there with the TV series, it absolutely ruins a sh*tload of spoilers, but at the same time it's utterly boring for those who are well past this and watched the TV series far futher already. Remsey kills someone you happen to like in this game, you want revenge? Too bad, you know already that Remsey is untouchable and will survive no matter what, simply because you have seen months if not years ahead of the GoT timeline already in TV. If you didn't, you either don't know anyone / understand anything happening in the world of Game of Thrones because you are thrown in the middle of it, but many important stuff are ruined for you in case you start watching the series.\n\nNow, I wouldn't be against that, but Telltale's game engine really shows how badly aged and primitive it is, because of the content it adapts.\n* It worked with Walking Dead, because it came up with all new characters that we didn't and couldn't compare to anything.\n* It worked with Wolf Among Us, because it's literally a living tale that is by it's nature supposed to look cartoonish.\n* It worked with Tales from the Borderlands, because the original source looks exactly like that (+ TT is far better at bringing characters to life than Gearbox ever will be).\n\nBut it doesn't work with Game of Thrones for me, at all. All the well known, loved and hated characters from the TV series are like puppets made of wood, with horribly simplicistic robotic movements and emotions, and the whole wold around them as we know it, dirty, shiny of gold, warm of fire-, blood and love, dark and full of death, is just so... sterile, blank and empty here. I simply cannot get invested with the new characters either (with the exception of a few) because Telltale was(?) kind of forced to copy the idea of a family spreading across the world (e.g. Starks, Lennisters) just so they could show their version of EVERY major location from the TV series.\n\nI can't get invested in a character if his or her every moment just screams he or she doesn't exist because that person is interesting or important, that character so painfully obviously exists only to "put someone there too, because we want to use and recreate that location from the TV series too". It's like everyone has a dozen noname unimportant relatives that are only there for the sole reason to start a storyline in the other corner of the world too, so Telltale can say "we have the Wall! We have those desert cities too! Oh and here is this or that from the TV series!", and the REAL PROBLEM is that almost everyone who are supposed to be the focus here, house Forrester, are just B tier fire and forget sidecharacters in different games. And there are many of them even, to cut the story to many tiny pieces and throw them to many corners of the world.\n\nIf you have multiple seasons of a TV series to do that, it's an excellent opportunity for fantastic world building.\nIf you have roughly 6x2 hours to not only try to do something similar, but copy as many of that world from the TV series, it cannot be helped but most of it will be shallow. But here it's not only supposed to do the world building here, it is supposed to build up about 15 characters for us to care about at the same time, SEPARATED to about 5-6 far away locations... it's not enough time, simple as that. And it really feels like it, because everything is so shallow, rushed and thin.\n\nI wanted to like this game so much. I love Telltale's work, I love Game of Thrones, and I love good adventure games. And I came to the conclusion that I cannot recommend this game if:\n* If you are not yet at the red wedding in the series\n* If you are just at the red wedding in the series (because if you stop there to play the game, you cannot know what will it spoil for you from the series)\n* If you are way past the red wedding, because most of the needlessly forced characters in the game who are (just like the locations) clearly there only to show "LOOK HE/SHE IS HERE TOO FROM THE TV SERIES! HOW COOL IS THAT" and all their lines and everything about them just feel like "desperate-forced-merchendise".\n* If you don't know anything about Game of Thrones.\n\nNow where does that leave us? I cannot find any... way, to recommend it, anyhow.\n\nAdd that the low quality engine really shows it's downsides here that weren't a problem at all with other material (first I saw Remsey I didn't even recognize him and after that he was shallow and empty too, because you know he is untouchable, and because everything the ACTORS fantasticly do in the source material, is translated here with a primitive engine that makes them... feel dead).","April 6","false","3.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

True to Game of Thrones' culture, you are faced with impossible and painful choices that can lead to unexpected outcomes. While the story itself is interesting, the choices you make do not seem to change anything in the game (as others have noted). Additionally, it has been quite some time since the latest episode has been released, leaving me wondering why I paid for a half-finished game. Hopefully the reason it's taking so long is that Telltale wants the next episode to be much better than the previous ones, though I doubt that will happen. Overall, this has been the least engaging Telltale game I've played.\n\nIn sum, this is not a must-buy game. If you really love Game of Thrones and are willing to spend the money, then why not? If you're not a huge GoT fan or are expecting something as engaging as The Walking Dead or Tales from the Borderland, don't buy this game.","October 9, 2015","false","12.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The plot is illogical and full of holes; the characters frequently pull random 180s; their actions have no motivation; and nothing good ever happens - the sole theme is "if you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention." The story's sole strength is its modelling ability of "How not to write a story."\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is no better. The heart of the gameplay is the "choice" system but the choices are never organic. Situations are horribly contrived to force in a choice but it's clear your choice will hold no meaning. Your characters discover an ambush and you must choose a strategy to counter it? Fear not! You character will walk blindly into the ambush completely unaware no matter what you do! The game offers little gameplay beyond this, except a endless series of dreadful quicktime events.\n\nThe final episode was (fortunately) incredibly short and offered no resolution to anything, but a series of cliffhangers for season 2. But it's hard to find a reason to care what happens to any of the characters. The story's complete drivel and the game just isn't fun.","November 27, 2015","false","15.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","2"

And it took them about halfe a Year for this last Episode? I don't understand it.\n\nBUT if you like Game of Thrones and you want to see something more of what the TV-Show and the books explain and you like the lore, then I can recomend it to you, but be warned, you may be dissapointed afterwards, but you'll see a intresting Story.

So the story canon is taken from there. You don't get to play as characters from the show, but instead as five different members of the House Forrester. You get to interact with some of the show's cast. For example Cersei and Tyrion, all the familiar characters are modeled and voiced by the real actors. The voice acting is ofcourse great by actors in the show, but everyone else does their job well too. Character models look decent, but there is plenty of clunky animation and blurry backgrounds. They were going after watercolored look, but didn't quite pull it off.\n\nJust like earlier Telltale games, it's heavy on narrative and light on gameplay. You get to make choices in dialogue quite often, but rarely it seemed to have long lasting effects. Story does justice to the tv-show by being brutal, dark and full of surprises. Combat is done by quick time events and doesn't really bring anything new or refreshing to the table.\n\nIf you are fan of the show (and books) or a fan of telltale games, you might want to give the game a chance. Im fan of both, so I got enjoyment out of it. The story takes place at the end of 3rd season in the show, so there will be some spoilers. All stories in the game won't fully conclude in this first season.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omegilla/recommended/330840/","Omegilla","Now the Real Fight Begins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omegilla/","89 products in account","Preface: My binary negative recommendation that is the only choice Steam allows is not meant to say this game does not have things to offer; only that I feel it does have several failings on what its promised to us as consumers.\n\nI will firstly state as well this is the first (Technicly second, I've also purchased Telltale's borderlands which came out just previously, less then a month ago from the date this was released and to which I have similar feelings in regards to this game.) Telltale game I've played and thus I cannot say I am entirely familiar if this has been the trend with all Telltale games so far, or if this is something new, so take that for what you will.\n\nThis game promises player choice on a meaningful level. Above all this is supposedly the staple to Telltale. You can enjoy the story of this game, I would say, and it is certainly something for those initiated in the world of "A Song of Ice and Fire" would like, and you really have to be initiated to understand. For example, the reveal of attending the Red Wedding creates some cinematic dread  at the start of things. But back to the point, choice. Its something alot of games like to promise and most of them fail to provide. Telltales falls into that percentile of games that fail to do so. But not just simple failure. The illusion of choice is a very thin veil in this game.\n\nSo thin that by the end of the Squire's story I already felt as though I were seeing past the veil. You can tell by how the events play out that there is really only one way things can really go. One of the very first choices you make as the Squire is, infact, entirely pointless. I won't say what the choice is, but it will, I assure anyone who reads this, that it will not matter.\n\nAnd if you haven't seen past the veil by the end of this first episode, which would be surprisingly ignorant of anyone I think, you will get it by the end, as you cannot avoid the ending the game gives you. Which is odd, because probably some of the most seemingly important choices are made with the character on whom this ending concerns. Yet nothing is altered with it.\n\nAnd that is truly the darkest betrayal of a game like this, promising you to be given the chance to be a Gamer of Thrones. As someone who has read all the books before the TV series kicked off, theres nothing more that I wanted then to have a chance to step into this ring to make a change. And anyone whos watched the TV show would get the same desire too. And this game based in this world, promising to be a game of meaningful choices is promising just that, and wiht this first episode it has dropped the ball in my opinion.\n\nAnd considering the fact that this game offers nothing else then dialogue to choose and QTEs, your left really with little. The story is enjoyable to follow and with the hope of improvement with future episodes I would say I will follow this rabbit hole to its pit, but for others who have yet to buy but are interested in the prospect, I would say wait. If I could go back in time with this knowledge, I would personally wait for this. Read reviews of the series as a whole and if its good, then I'd buy, or even if its still just the same as this first episode, I'd buy on the eventual steep discount that would arise at some point, because the story will no doubt still be worth it all.\n\nWith all said and done this wasn't an unenjoyable ride but it fails to keep its promises so far with only the hope things will improve. And considering the fact the book series itself is not even finished, I feel that even if Telltale wanted to offer more impacting choices, it simply couldn't be done. This is still a world Martin has not finished even writing. And with that fact alone, I have to wonder if this game was a mistake to try and make.","December 23, 2014","false","14.3"," 179 of 326 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","179","326","4","17"

Never have I clenched my butt so much throughout an episodic story-driven game.\n\nIt helps (a lot) to be knowledgeable on the series/GoT universe, be it watching the TV show or reading the books; but you can still enjoy the game as its own story. The characters, the plot-twists, and the semi-illusion of control over the decisions one can make are all executed extremely well.\n\n\n“When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.”\nUp until the release of this game, you could only watch as beloved and hated characters play this "game of thrones", but now you can truly feel like a part of it, making the decisions yourself gives you a sense of presence in the medieval dystopian fantasy world. However, this isn’t the best aspect of the game; in my opinion the best thing about this game is the writing. Like I said in the opening line, this game had me on the edge of my seat every single episode, something that I was surprised it was able to pull off. I became immersed with each character’s storyline, each character’s successes and failures, it felt so authentic.\n\nThe portrayal of the main characters in the series was excellent. Cersei, Danaerys, Ramsay, Margaery; the way each of these played into the Forrester's storyline was seamless. I hate Ramsay, love Khaleesi, and admire Margaery just as much in this game as I do in the TV show. BUT they weren’t represented well enough to steal the thunder from the true stars of the game: House Forrester. Mira, Rodrik, Asher, Gared and all the others were all incredible characters to play as. I became so engrossed with each character’s personality that I actually made decisions based on what I thought they’d choose, not what I’d choose.\n\nWith that said, I tried to keep everything under control in the game, which proved much harder than I thought. Every antagonistic character made it extremely hard for me to feel satisfied with any given situation, which I think is fairly befitting for GoT.\nEach episode that I played was more unnerving than the last, ultimately leading to reactions I never thought I’d have (like screaming out of surprise, hands over mouth and genuine cringing). Right as you think something’s going well or in the direction that you planned, the game hits your with some rock hard reality and pins your back down onto the ground.\nI appreciate that, because what’s the fun in playing a game where everything goes as you want it to without a challenge?\n\nThe stress, the sadness, the happiness, and every emotion in between is what you’ll go through when playing this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're already familiar with the GoT world, but I recommend it to those looking for an entry into the complicated world of  A Song of Ice and Fire .","November 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","33","55","2","5"

I need to give them props for not cheaping out on the voice acting.  The game has some main characters from the show, and they are voiced by the real actors.  Those characters being Tyrion and Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Margaery Tyrell, Daenerys Targaryen, and Ramsay Bolton.  It’s fun getting to interact with the familiar characters, and the game does a good job of recreating the personalities of each one, with the exception of possibly Margaery who seemed pretty bland.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it’s a Telltale game so the gameplay is obviously very decision/story based.  The game follows 4 plot lines, all of different members of House Forrester (Bannermen of House Stark).  The different settings being King’s Landing, Ironrath (the seat of House Forrester), The Wall, and Meereen.  Although there are 4 separate plot lines, they all have a similar goal in mind, which is to save House Forrester.  As I played through the first few episodes, I was given the false impression that what I did in one storyline would affect another.  But after awhile I began to realize the 4 story lines are very separate, and very linear.  But I still had hopes that at the end, the 4 paths would converge and the decisions I made on each path would affect how good the ending would be for me.  That however was not at all the case.  Only 2 of stories come together at the end and guess what... what I did in both didn’t really matter.\n\nRegarding the plot, the reason I and many others love GoT, is because it doesn’t always have a cookie cutter happy ending, and it keeps us guessing.  That being said, GRRM knows that there needs to be a balance of highs and lows so that you appreciate each one as they come.  But this game dwells in the lows from the get go, and you are only ever given the occasional ounce of hope before it is immediately crushed.  At the end of the game I was left feeling that through all my efforts, I had accomplished absolutely nothing.  And worse, there was nothing I could have done about it.\n\nTl;dr: “Game of Thrones - Telltale” where the plot is super depressing and the decisions don’t matter.","May 6","false","14.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Spoiler alert: when it gave me the choice to stab Ramsey or not, I had to choose not to because I knew that absolutely nothing would happen because he's alive in the show. For a telltale game, this game seriously lacks in story. For example, 85% of the characters that get killed off seemed like they were barely thought out. This game had alot of cheap deaths in it. Now lets get on to graphics. I can count more than 10 times that I have seen either really bad graphics, or just something completely broken. And before I have somebody climb up my ♥♥♥ saying "oh it's a telltale game, graphics/gameplay isnt the point" just hear me out. There have been numerous times where I have seen floating swords, sheathes with no swords in them (like when the gold cloaks are walking around) or just stuff that is seriously out of place or just broken.

Hey, me too! Wouldn't you love to immerse yourself in the lore and roleplay as characters in said world, especially since your GoT D&D group has conflicting schedules and can never meet... damn you guys! *shakes fist* Ahem, anyway, if you want those things, this may or may not be the game for you. Telltale got the tone right and the voice actors are wonderful, but that's about it.\n\nYou play as members of House Forrester, who are basically Bargin Bin Starks. They have the potential to be interesting, but too often I catch many similarities between Forrester and Stark (Lady Forrester being the biggest offender, she's practically Carbon Copy Catelyn. Ryon is like Rickon, who is the extra kid that serves no purose. And there's Gared Tuttle, who reminds me a lot of Jon Snow.) Of them all, I enjoyed playing as Gared, Ethan, and, to a lesser extent, Mira.\n\nMy biggest issue with Mira's story is that half the time she seems smart and the other half she's made to be stupid. I get that she's no Varys or Littlefinger, but the girl has no sense of tact or wit. She discovers something and two seconds later she's forced to confront someone with said discovery and does so with complete lack of subtlety. For example, when you find out about Lyman Lannister, you go straight to him and tell him about how Andros betrayed him. Lyman confronts Andros and then Andros confronts Mira. You know what would have been better? An anonymous letter or getting someone else to tell Lyman. Telltale has Mira play 'the game of thrones' very poorly.\n\nAs with any game rich in choices, sometimes I found myself wishing for better options. Like at a certain point as Mira, you can either lie or tell the truth to your friend's possible betrothed about her family, but there is no third neutral option (and the possible third option is handwaved as 'tell me the truth, no waffling', even though it IS true and you're forced to choose between honesty and duplicity). The game is littered with situations where I wondered why I didn't get an (in my opinion) obvious option that fits the world, especially having read the books/watched the show.\n\nBut what does that matter? Absolutely nothing, because your choices don't matter. Ethan dies even if you submit to or defy Ramsey. Roderick beds Elaena if you're cold to her or receptive. Gared is going to be executed and has to desert the Night's Watch, loyal or not. Mira always loses favour with Margaery. There's always a traitor in House Forrester. The list goes on and on. All your choices are basically window dressing and (as of episode 5) don't affect anything in the long run. It's 'the illusion of choice', not real choice. It is possible for a game to force you to play out the main story 'on rails', but still have your choices be impactful, but GoT is not one of those games.\n\nThe story has the potential to be good. Unfortunately, House Forrester is constantly shoved into the dirt again and again, no matter what you do. Everything seems hopeless and bleak and made me a bit depressed. Small victories would be nice and keep the player optimistic that House Forrester will pull through. As of right now, it seems like we're being led to a deus ex machina resolution that will be pulled out of thin air minutes before the end. I'm not cool with that.","October 13, 2015","false","11.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But In this game it feels that any choice you have isn't really a choice, you are being forced into situations in which your choices are leading you in the other direction. This game forces you into situations which due to your choices you shouldn't be in.\n\n\nLike most telltale games most of the choices don't end making much difference in the end. Sure your allies and friends change but in this particular game it feels to forced and that we are being pushed into the story line.\n\n\nThings in Episode 3 that feel to pushed.\n\n\nGared/The wall - You can tell your uncle that you can't help him because you just took your vowels. Yet the game forces you into situations where you have to do something bad, theres no "STOP" or "Walk away" option, which basically forces you into a situation where you have to escape from the nights watch ( as seen in teaser for the next episode). So your decision not to help your uncle is just invalid and void.\n\n\nForrester Castle - You can plan on being subtle and not aggravating the whitehills until help comes from either asher or alena. You know fight them when you have a army behind you. But your Mother and Sister both start trouble in which you have to step in or your mother and sister both say something like " They can't do this" and then expect you not to retaliate. The NPC's are pushing you into giving in and making a stand and fighting.\n\n\nKingslanding - This was the most boring, yes it had the death of king Joffrey but didn't show anything. I just think it's boring due to it being mostly about politics.\n\n`\nAsher - This was good but it  was the shortest story line for this episode. by the looks of it, your friend is going to cause trouble which causes complications on getting an army .\n\nBasically everyone you control is working together to achieve one goal. yet the NPC'S are purposely causing trouble which any real life or other game wouldn't cause. Theyre just there to force you onto the path the game is on.\nIt just feels because your choices don't really matter you can't change events i could just watch this online of someone else play it because my personal choices won't change the game at al.\n\nit is a fun game and its cool seeing Game of thrones characters in it, but this is no doubt the worst telltale game that i have played so far.

The first Episode was extremely well done and I am hopeful they will keep it up in the remaining 5 episodes.\nThey use the same old engine so the graphics are not very good, lots of Aliasing, I noticed some clipping errors and animations sometimes seem week. The oilpainty artstyle works suprisingly well though. The gameplay is the typical TTG clicking dialogue, walking around looking at objects and the occasional QTE fights. Very basic, it's a game you'll play for story, if you want good mechanical gameplay look somewhere else. It's basic but does it's job. Voiceacting is just superb, Ramsey's excellent performance stood out the most for me.\n\nFor people who have never watched the TV Show (at least the first 3 seasons) I can not easily recommend this game as it heavily refers to events happening in the Show (and books) as well as many characters. You will most likely feel a bit lost since it's not a game that introduces you to the franchise and characters (unlike the walking dead). You might still enjoy it but you will lose out on a lot of references and parts of the story.","December 2, 2014","true","13.7"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","23","38","0","0"

As usual, you're presented with choices.  But you don't have enough information to make a meaningful judgment about which choice is best or what the mechanical consequences might be, or if you'll have the opportunity to change your mind later.  There's a time limit, so by the time you're done reading all the choices, you don't have any time left to think about your decision.  It's very stressful at first, and then you realize that none of your choices mattered anyway, because you're going to be going through the exact same sequence of scenes no matter what.  End then at that point, you realize that nothing you do in the game matters at all, and there is literally no reason why this is a video game and not just an animated miniseries.\n\nThis particular game is even less interactive than other TellTale games.  In Wolf Among Us, at least you got to investigate crime scenes from time to time, even if the outcome was always the same.  There's nothing like that here.  Just meaningless TellTale choices and the occasional combat scene composed of a series of quicktime/Simon Says events.\n\nThe only thing I'd praise this game for is the cool-looking hand-painted art style.  The character models look pretty appealing, and it's neat to see the cast members from the show sculpted in 3D.","February 25","false","9.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Since it is Game of Thrones. Out of three of those, I only felt worthless. Not by the game, but from Telltale. Oh, did I mention, the game doesn't even have an ending.\n\nNo matter what I or you decide, the story always ended up the same. I agree, I die. If I disobey, me and my family member dies.

I actually sighed and yelled out loud, "Oh, not this ♥♥♥♥♥ again." Every time I had to play her. And I have never hated a character in any other game that wasn't an NPC. All she talked about was herself and her family. People tried to help her, but the game forcefully made you defy them.\n\nThis game took me about six months to finish, just because I just got bored.

On the one hand, it matches the Game of Thrones pattern of characters dying before their arcs complete to satisfaction and of plot threads being likewise murdered before they have a chance to resolve the audience's interest in them properly. How much you dislike this here will probably be similar to how much you dislike it in Game of Thorones (the book or the show). For my part, I find it very frustrating; I'm well accustomed to books where characters I care about are treated harshly or unfairly. Where surprises occur, where characters I care about suffer harm. What I dislike more substantially is when my attention and investment and interest feels like it is wasted ... not because my favorite characters died but because the story being told about them often ends as abrubtly as their life or trails off into the distance akwardly. It is the lack of resolution, the lack of narrative focus, that frustrates me. Though, again, this seems to suit many people just fine; this is a very popular series in other mediums.\n\nBeyond that ... normally I'm quite comfortable accepting Tell Tale's illusion of choice; I don't play these games in the belief that I can "change the story" and I don't expect Tell Tale to deliver the expereicne of a "true" branching narrative while also engaging me with a choreent authored story for a reasonable price. I expect any choisces to be more about flavor and interactive investment than actually "chaning" the path of the story. In Wolf Among Us, Walking Dead and Tales from the Borderlands (the lattermost especially) I found this plenty satisfying. Here, the authored story didn't hang together quite well enough and the illusion of choice, consequence and effect was SO fragile and transparent that even though I found myself agreeing with the familiar criticism of these types of games with respect to Game of Thrones--why am I playing this as a *game* in the first place? Why isn't it just a movie? And, unlike others I listed, I feel that it doesn't function very well at all as that "just a movie."\n\nI'm not sure exactly why I feel that familiar reaction in response to this game, whereas I don't in response to other games in this genre and other Telltale games in particular. I didn't enjoy the experience enough to really dig into it with more useful analysis, so I'm left with a somewhat vague understanding of why I didn't like it.","December 25, 2015","false","10.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

In the mid-game you start developing plans and it looks like your great turn around is coming. Then lol nope you get screwed some more. Then at the finale when all your plans have failed and you're weaker than ever with the final fight upon you... you get completely stomped.\n\nI know it's necessary to build tension by showing the protagonists in a weakened state to build tension for the finale. How will they win? How is it possible to come back from everything that's happened? It makes the payoff at the end so much sweeter. Think Sam's final speech in Lord of the Rings to see what I mean\n\nBut even by episode 3 everyone was saying this is gonna end with the protagonists getting wrecked. And I was thinking how wrong they were, because these episodes existed to build tension for the finale surely. But how wrong was I.\n\nThe truth is, season 1 exists to build tension for season 2. I've no doubt the payoff comes in season 2, but season 1 is just a masochist simulator. I suppose it wouldnt be so bad if it all came out at once so you could just keep playing til you got to the point where you finally get your hard earned victory, but not only did I have to wait 2-3 months between episodes, but it's probably gonna be 2 years before season 2 even begins, plus another year for the finale. Along with the year they spent releasing episodes thats 4 years of getting wrecked for the payoff. Why did anyone think this was a good idea?\n\nI know game devs treat gamers like 4 year old ADHD kids that need constant explosions and action or they'll get distracted, but I think TellTale is going too far the other way. In 4 years I could take a degree in game design and make my own game and make a lot of money without getting a sore bum!","March 15","false","14.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

As a result it is in your mind that there is absolutely nothing you can do about them in game.\n\nThe story itself is ok, and may be enough to warrant buying this game if you are a rabid Game of Thrones fan.

I really, really want to. But I just can't, because I know that no matter what my rating is the outcome will be the same.\n\nThat sums this game up. I love Telltale games. I love Game of Thrones. This series started out amazingly, but by about half way through it turned into an outright depressing affair. Because in this game, your choices really do not matter. Not at all. Whenever you think you might win, in comes Ramsey Snow with his cloak of "Nothing bad can happen to me or else this game will no longer be canon" and the story takes a turn for the worst. This was fine the first time, but when it happens again and again...I reached a point in the fourth fifth episode when I was really struggling to go on. No matter what I did, the good guys die and the bad guys win. Even if the arrival at that outcome makes no sense whatsoever, that was what happened. Again, and again, and again.\n\nI know that this is Game of Thrones, and people will die. But even in Game of Thrones, there is hope that someone might survive. In Telltale's game, nobody wins. Your choices do not matter, and no matter what you do there is no winning in this game. This is a shame, because it started as a masterpiece and had the potential to remain one. This game was an emotional rollercoaster, but once I arrived at the end (which is a set-up for a 2nd season, in case you were wondering), it really began to hit me how disappointing this game was.\n\nIn conclusion, this is by no means a bad game. However, it is by all means a disappointing one.","February 21","false","11.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maulth/recommended/330840/","Maulth","[FYAD] Maulth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maulth/","390 products in account","First and foremost, let me start off by saying that there will be spoilers throughout this review. If you’re even remotely interested in keeping the story for when you run through Episode 1 yourself, I’d suggest waiting to read this. If you’ve watched season three of the HBO T.V. series or read “A Feast For Crows”, you’re probably OK reading through this as there will not be many surprises.\n\nThe last three to four years have produced quite a few shoddy games based in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. The abysmal RTS, and the better-but-not-great attempt at an RPG. It’s also pretty widely known that I’ve been a gigantic fan of George RR Martin since middle school, that being over ten years ago now. I’ve read and reread that entirety of the book series quite a few times, and have dabbled in the various communities that have sprung up to discuss the legitimacy of various children, hierarchy of families, and the events of Westeros. With that being said, I’m usually a giant stickler that a game stay true to the lore, or spirit of writing, that comes across in dialogue and plot. Telltale games did an absolutely phenomenal job at erasing the damage that the previous games had inflicted upon me.\n\nA bit of a background on the political landscape that the game takes place in. Eddard Stark has been murdered at the hands of Joffery Baratheon. The North has risen under the banner of his son, Rob Stark. The rest of the realm, save Dorne, is in turmoil at the hands of the various men who have attempted to claim that they are the One True King of Westeros. The game begins with you playing the role of a young squire in service to House Forrester. Specifically, you are the squire of Gregor Forrester, the lord of the lands and titles of House Forrester. You are camped out at The Twins, the home of House Frey, and the downfall of Rob Stark, King of the North.\n\nThe Red Wedding is just about to take place, and with it, the fall of The King in the North.\n\nGame-play & Mechanics\n\nAt first, I wasn’t thrilled with the game-play. The game is more of a visual story than a real attempt at wandering around Westeros, leveling up a character, or anything you expect in a typical adventure style game. This was my first foray into a story-based Telltale game, however, and from everything I’ve read about their other titles, this seems to be fairly commonplace. The longer I played, the more I came to like the system. The quick time events were fairly clever, if not a bit confusing at first, and lead to a couple of deaths before I truly figured them out. Several times throughout the story there were invisible walls that kept you from exploring other areas of the game. I first noticed this inside Fort Ironrath, the home of House Forrester, but on my second play-through noticed it more in the wooded areas and places you’d expect a bit more openness. While it was a bit annoying and killed the immersion a bit, Telltale did a good job of adding in other areas that were there solely to be explored, such as the tower in Fort Ironrath. It had no purpose other than to venture to the top, and watch your citizens go about their daily lives.\n\nThe ability to inspect most things in the game coupled with the deeper meaning that a lot of the objects held was a trait that I liked very much. A great example of this was procuring the Sentinel bracer as Ethan Forrester. This opened up new dialogue with your uncle, your mother, and the candidates for Sentinel, as well as your siblings. You could even have unique dialogue or description options just by looking at something prior to talking to someone. I’m not one to stave off excess description, and Telltale did a fine job supplying me with things to study and read.\n\nThough the few shortcomings that I’ve noted here were not game-breaking or ridiculously unpleasant, ultimately at the end of the episode I would say that the mechanics and game-play were the one true weakness of the title. The quick time events weren’t repetitive, but you did find yourself wishing for more things to do. More interaction outside of the plot/story. For example, I would have loved to been able to, as a squire, help Rodrick or Gregor don their armor, or suit up for battle. Or, upon my return to Ironrath, to have a brief time where I could fight with the other squires in the courtyard during training. Even having the ability to fight a wooden practice dummy would have been engaging enough to dispel this complaint.\n\nDialogue & Voice Acting\n\nThe voices in this game were a bit surprising to me. It’s not very often you get to hear the voices of a very prominently placed TV show like “Game of Thrones” make their way into a video game, or, I should say, a video game you want to play. I could poke a stick at the other titles stemming from A Song of Ice and Fire, but it’d be a bit redundant. The voice acting was pleasant, well manicured, and did a very nice job making the story both alluring and compelling. I did not have any real complaints about any portion of the acting bit of the first episode.\n\nStory & Plot\nUpon receiving a review copy of Telltale’s apparent successful foray into Martins mind, I was extremely worried. The story was the most important piece to such a grand undertaking, and George Martin left plenty of pitfalls and snares along the way to destroy even the most solid of attempts at creating parallel dialogues and sub-plots within the Game of Thrones. My first instinct proved to be false, however, because worry was not needed. The way that Telltale managed to fashion a seemingly unmentioned house, portion of the North, and still remain realistic and true to George RR Martins characters still has me astounded. Throughout my two times through the story, I found no major plot holes, and was even impressed with the timing in which they had the events of House Forrester unfold. Telltale did an excellent job of staying true to the characters set forth by Martin, particularly Ramsay Snow and Cersei Lannister. Ethan Forrester was also a welcome addition to a story line that had a hidden dagger in the dark. True to his style, the ending twist had me up and out of my seat before I knew what I was doing, something that had not happened since I had read “A Storm of Swords”. All-in-all, this is a story that, so far, I can genuinely say belongs in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\nGraphics\nThough the least important, in my opinion, criteria for measuring the depth of a game, Telltale’s A Game of Thrones Episode one did not fall short. The quick time events had great animations, with nothing too jittery or glitchy. The limited amount of landscape you were able to see had quite a bit of detail, particularly playing as Ethan Forrester in the courtyard of Ironrath, and playing as the young squire Gared during his journey North as he is hiding from Ramsay Snow. Though not the games strongest point, I would venture to say that a lot of thought and talent went into the seemingly hand painted environments and impressive looking quick time events.\n\nIn Conclusion\nIt’s not very often that, as gamers, we are given the opportunity to buy a story and watch as it unfolds around us. Here lately it seems we are bombarded with launch day DLC, or essentially paying money to beta test developers games. With Telltale’s A Game of Thrones, we are given more than that. We are given the ability to play an interactive story with incredible lore that has, in my mind, stayed true to the spirit of George RR Martins works. Right now, the game is retailing for just $30 on the Steam store. While this review only covers the very first episode, there are a confirmed six planned in all, and by purchasing Telltale’s latest work, you receive access to all the episodes as they launch. If you enjoy the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, and can enjoy an Episodic point and click adventure, this title is well worth the money.\n\nIron from Ice, my friends.","February 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

The graphics are very unimpressive, the QTE's constantly break any immersion the game may have and the gimmick of the characters from aSoIaF wares off quickly once you realise they have infinite plot armour.\n\nMy main problem with the game is the fact that ever since it was released a year ago, there has been a game-breaking bug for anyone who has a Radeon R9 285 card resulting in thick black edges around all the characters and objects in the game. After 7 months of TellTale "looking for the root cause of the problem" a work-around involving forcing the game to run with outdated drivers was found by the community. However, to anyone who's upgraded to Windows 10 this fix now results in the game opening with a white screen and not responding; thus I can't even play the finale to this game because TellTale has been ignoring this bug since release...","December 2, 2015","false","11.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/recommended/330840/","lord-zor","Zor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/","463 products in account","Dull characters, infuriating arbitrary events, and a cliff hanger ending are a few of the reasons why you should skip Game of Thrones - A Telltale Games Series.\n\nAs you can tell by the above statement, I don't think highly of this game.  In fact, I think it's one of the worst Telltale point and click adventure games.  I know that is harsh, so let me explain.\n\nTo start off, a majority of the characters in this game are dull and generic. This is mainly caused by two factors.  First, throughout the game you are usually switching between 3 to 4 player characters in any given episode. This overly board focus results in a lack of depth and detail for the main and supporting cast. You'll learn people's names and role in the game, but beyond that, there isn't much to any of them.  Personally, I never found myself emotional connecting with any of the characters, since they all felt underdeveloped.  The second factor is that named characters from the television show are constantly showing up in the game.  Which sounds cool in theory, except for the fact that it follows it source matter to the letter. Nothing you do with any of the named characters matters, since what happens to them and what they are planning to do has already occurred on the TV show. So whenever they show up in the game you know that you're about to either have something horrible happen to your characters that you can't do anything about, or you're about to hear one of them give you a lecture on something. Dull and generic characters are bad for any game, but in an story driven game such as this one, they ruin it.\n\nThe next problem with this game are its arbitrary events, as mention above, this game follows the TV show and uses the events and themes from it. This results in large portions of your choices being undermined by pre-existing story lines or the writers' desire to make it more like the TV show. Am not trying to imply that your choices would otherwise matter if there wasn't source material, since nearly all Telltale games are design so that only a handful of your choices affect anything at all.  More of that the story that you are trying to tell yourself through the choices you make for the characters, is constantly falling apart because the game want to tell you a different story.  With most other Telltale games, it feels like you are guiding the main character(s) and making them into what you want them to be.  However, with this one, I often felt like I was being told a story about characters which results in the feeling that I didn't have control over them or the game at all.  This lack of control and the feeling that events were constantly happening to me, and not a result from me, made me not care about a majority of the cast. And when I say I didn't care about them, I mean that I didn't see them as characters I wanted to spend any time with. After a few episode I started to intentional choose harmful options and failing quick time events, in order to see what would happen.  I felt that I had such little control over what was happening, that I actively started to rebel against the game's design, and well... that is a horrible mark against a game, when a player decide that trying to break a game is more fun than playing it.\n\nLastly, this game has a cliff hanger ending. I know developers of well... everything like books, tv, or video games in this case, want to serialize their products in order to make more money, but to have a cliff hanger ending in a episodic game feel like a sin. It's one thing to leave the door open for more adventures, but it's a whole different beast to leave the main story unresolved.  And that is what this game does. You have two overarching quests in this game, and by the end, you are further from one than you were at the start, and the other one results in a lot of questions and few unsatisfactory answer.\n\nOverall, this game is bad. I would say that if you're into Game of Thrones (the tv series) than you might like this, but you would have to be really, into it. For everyone else, looking for a good point and click adventure game, I strongly recommend you skip this title.","December 3, 2015","false","10.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Ironwood ormanları tüm Westeros'taki en sağlam ahşapın kaynağıdır.\n\nDizide bahsedilmeyen ve kitaplarda sadece adı geçen bu ailenin ele alınması gayet zekice. Bunun sebebi oyuncunun ,seride geçen hiçbir büyük olaya karışmadan ve zaman akışını engellemeden Game of Thrones evrenine girmesini sağlıyor.\n\nOyun herkesin üzüldüğü bir bölüm olan Red Wedding sırasında Frey'lerin Forresterlara ve diğer sancaktarlara saldırmasıyla başlıyor.Kuzeye sadık olan Forrester ailesi Starkların geriye kalan son Lordununda öldürülmesiyle Kuzeyin Yeni Koruyucusu olan Boltonlara sadık mı olacak yoksa Starklara sadık kalmaya devam mı edecek?\n\nBölüm 1 : Iron From Ice\nÖnceki Telltale oyunlardan alıştığımızın dışında bu bölümde, oyunda birden fazla karakteri oynadığımızı görüyoruz.\nGenç Forrester Lordu Ethan Forrester\nEn büyük abla Mira Forrester, King's Landing'de Margaery Tyrell'in handmaidenı.\nSon olarak bir köylünün çocuğu ve Lord Gregor Forrester'ın squierı olan Gared Tuttle.\n\nDizide gördüğünüz karakterlerle etkileşime girebiliyorsunuz. Örnek olarak Cersei ,Tyrion Lannister ve Ramsay Snow. Hepsi kendi aktörleri tarafından seslendirilmiş şekilde oyun evrenindede karşımıza çıkıyorlar.\n\nBölüm yaklaşık 2 saatte bitiyor ve bir bölüm değilde sadece giriş kısmı olarak gözüküyor. Gayet standart.\n\nBölüm 2 : The Lost Lords\nİlk bölümden sonra dahada istikrarsız hale gelmiş bulunmakta Forrester ailesi ve bu istikrarsızık oyuncuya doğru kararlı alması için baskı yapıyor ve karakteri daha çok hissetmemizi sağlıyor.\nBölümde bir savaş sahnesi var ve zevkli bir arbalet eğitiminden geçiyoruz.\n\nÇok spoiler vermek istemiyorum o yüzden kabataslak üzerinden geçeceğim.Bu bölümde Forrester Ailesinin iki yeni yüzüyle daha tanışıyoruz.Bölümün adından da anlaşılabilir.\nİlki Asher Forrester, ailenin ikinci en büyük oğlu şu an Essos'ta paralı asker olarak sürgünde.\nİkinci olanı kendiniz görmeniz daha iyi olacaktır sizin için, bölümün en büyük sürprizi kendisi çünkü.\n\nÇoğunluk olarak Ironrath ve Kings Landing'de geçen oyuna Mereen, Essos ve Castle Black'de eklenmiş oldu bu bölüm ile.Tabikide Castle Black'te serinin en sevilen piçi Jon Snow'la ,tamamiyle Kit Harington tarafından seslendirilmiş şekilde tanışıyoruz.\n\nİkinci bölüm bizi hikayenin daha derinlerine indiriyor ve yeni karakterlerle ,karakter ağacınında köklerini genişletiyor.\n\nBölüm 3 : The Sword in the Darkness\nBu bölümdeki sürprizler önceki oyuna nazarana daha az kalmış fakat bu bölüme geldiyseniz zaten çoktan Forrester ailesini yeterince tanımışsınız demektir. Sürprizler oyunun ortasında çokta gerekli değil.\n\nBu oyunda gerçekten serinin önemli kısımlarını farklı açılardan görüyoruz ,bu bölümde ise Purple Wedding'deyiz yani Joffrey'in zehirlendiği nikahtayız fakat Mira'nın ,Joffrey'in ne yiyip içtiğinden daha büyük problemleri var.

I think it was a mistake, though - Telltale games don't really let you affect much plot-wise with your decisions, so they work best when you can at least empathize with your character.  That becomes much harder to do when you're given so many different perspectives, some of which are short-lived, and odds are you'll find you dislike at least one of the characters and want to just get their chapters over with.\n\nThat said, there's a lot of good points to the game.  Some very good voice acting, as with all Telltale games.  The writing is solid, if not inspired, and it's easy to like some of the characters.  The games a bit buggy at parts - at one point I spared the life of an enemy, only to have the next chapter tell me that I'd killed him - but that's just a bit annoying...   Not a dealbreaker.\n\nWhat made me a touch angry, though?  The game tells me that I can play this to determine the fate of House Forrester.  This is a bald-faced lie - everything is left on a cliffhanger, so that they can get those sweet, sweet sequel bucks.  In fact, by episode five I was starting to wonder how a couple of plot threads would relate to the central dilemma of the game, and surprise...  They don't.  At least until the next six episodes.\n\nThis is particularly bad in that the villains of the piece continually go out of their way to hurt and humiliate the characters you're supposed to care about.  I'm sure that the writing team approached plenty of scenes thinking "what can these guys say or do that would be the most horrible in this context?"  I kind of assumed this was setting things up for their eventual comeuppance to be that much more satisfying.  Hah, no - all that grovelling and humiliation comes with no payoff whatsoever.\n\nI was left with a distinct feeling of "Why the hell did I bother with all this?"  Maybe I just lack the masochistic streak that Telltale was expecting me to have.  If I have to be railroaded into your plot with little to no control, at least make sure the rails lead to a satisfying destination.\n\nIf you're cool with that, you'll probably really like this game.  Personally, I would have rather had a proper ending, with the main plot threads resolved and a satisfying payoff for all the horrible events that took place.  Really, guys, it IS possible to have an ending with a decent story resolution, AND follow it up with a sequel.  Plenty of books and movies manage it.  You just have to try a bit harder.","January 10","false","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/levathan/recommended/330840/","levathan","levathan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/levathan/","130 products in account","Man was I hyped for this Game! A fan of Telltale since "The Walking Dead" as well as huge fan of both the books and the series of GoT, I really looked forward to it.\n\nBased on my experience with Telltale Games I was expecting a really great story, where I would have to make difficult decisions, being immersed into the story and really get to life it with all the characters. Being within the GoT Realm as a huge bonus on top.\n\nBut, sadly, I have to say - this has fallen really short on much of what I expected.\n\nBiggest let down is what made the other TT games so great - the impact fo the decisions you make.\nI once felt that my decision actually had an impact on the story, but apart from that, nothing you do really makes much of a difference. Or feels like it does.  Hence, it was a nice interactive "movie" to "play", but nothing more. It does look like there is a 2nd Season around, but I am not yet sure if I buy, and for which price. Most likely only if it's in some kind of sale.\n\n\nPro:\n- I do love the art style, going into a different directions than the TT games I played so far - it really fits the world I think\n- The story was nicely done, and one could expect a similar story happening in the original stories of Mr. Martin himself. Perhaps not as sophisticated, but still - a good story\n\nCon:\n- The decisions you have to make seldom feel important or impactful - and neither do they actually have a big impact. At one point you'll have to decide who survives, but that's pretty much it in regards to heavy impact. Granted, there might be a couple that will play out differently depending on your choice, but within the whole presentation it really never fells like it.\n- The Game does not feel polished at all. Eye and mouth movements seem of at times, there are some potentially buggy scenes (Encountered one myself, but was fixed with a save reload), and the art styles sometimes really clashes with the animated scenes.\n- Worse, the expressions on faces do change within a conversation seemingly without any correlation to what you said before, will say now, and how conversations with the same person played out eralier in the game. There are smiles, where noone said anything funny or nice at all. There are weird looks, even though your character just said something cheerful and the response tells you it worked - not those looks though.\n- implementing known characters from the books and the series was a really nice touch, but in the end they overdid it, adding to the feeling that your decisions won't matter much.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nWell, if you are TT and GoT fan - give it a try for sure. If you are neither, this game won't change your mind.\nIf you get it in a sale, you'll get a nice story of roughly 10-12 hours.","January 20","false","17.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have read all the books and love the show. When this was announced I was so excited as a telltale game set in the Game of Thrones world sounded like a perfect fit. Unfortunately I was completely wrong.\n\nThe first episode captured the right feeling, but as we got to the end of the season the biggest flaw of the game started to show, your choices do not matter in a game about choices. Telltale seem to believe that to make this authentic, everything has to go wrong. Although this is true in the show, it all happens for a reason. There is no reason for most of the mindless abuse that the game throws at you. Characters die before you even get a chance to care about them and there is almost always no way to prevent their deaths.\n\nThese new characters from House Forrester seem interesting until you realise why. They are incredibly similar to the characters from House Stark. There is a girl out of her league in Kings Landing (basically Sansa), a young boy trying to be lord over a castle (Bran/Robb) and an honourable outcast who goes to the wall (Jon). The only character who truly interested me was Asher as he was a unique character and very well written.\n\nThe character's we knew from the show initially made you start to care about the characters from the game. However, their inclusion, especially Ramsay Bolton's, as the antagonists made you realise you can't win as nothing can really change.\n\nThe obvious set up for a sequel was also incredibly frustrating. It caused the ending to be unsatisfying as there was barely any payoff to any of my decisions and some things I had done seemed completely pointless (including one playable character's entire storyline).\n\nI so wanted to enjoy telltale's Game of Thrones but I cannot recommend to even the biggest Game of Thrones fan.","February 24","false","13.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have a hard time as is with most of the TellTale Games as they don't do much for me. Your decisions never feel meaningful, and you feel more like you are on the rails of someone ELSE'S story, not your own. All of the action scenes in the game are QTEs based on the same six keys, and there's no originality in any of it.\n\nWhere I feel the game could have shined, but flopped was the original stories of the Forresters. GoT is a grand, robust story with tons of lore and rich history where, quite literally, anything is possible. Instead of blending the Forresters in with that, they are given by far the most bland history and nearly zero importance within the realm. They don't ever feel like they have any presence, and none of them ever get interesting.\n\nThis is not to say the game is bad technically; it plays well (controls are easy enough, that is), looks good, sounds great, and the likenesses of characters in the show are nearly spot on. Also shout out to the VAs for coming back to reprise their role in this game. If you're looking for some fan service, or an excuse to nab yourself some sweet Jon Snow wallpaper, this is the game for you.

Not that I am really invested in the story or the decisions I've made thus far, but just the fact that this game seems to not give you much of a resolution in the long run. I am well aware that the television show does favor relentless brutality of killing off characters, but here the set up is just peculiar. The game opens up with several subplots similar to that of the television show, and introduces several houses of characters completely native to this game. So far, I've grown really attached to the Forrester family, but I should know better because, it goes south from there! Some other chracters from the television show give fans that warm fuzzy feeling of confort or discomfort based on whether or not you have read the books or followed the show. What irritates me is how they put your chracter in situations where you would think you can create an outcome parallel to that of the show seeing how some involve already established chracters. The problem is that the writers did not agree and make it seemingly impossible for you to create a new possibility to change the direction of the series. In other words, your decisions are futile. That's right! Not one of these serious choices you make benefits that story all that much seeing how the game ends with a resounding cliffhanger that seems unwaranted. I also don't appreciate how in some hostile encounters where the dialogue decisions take place you have little to no time to react. I feel like other games made by TellTale had a much nicer pace and narrative to their stories. Here, it feels rushed and I tend to forget specific details that are not brought up again until the next episode becuase there is so much going on at once. My friend and I played through one of the episodes and interacted with this one character where he wanted to show her up by shooting a rabbit with a bow and arrow. The game didn't give him my time to adjust his shot since the controls completely changed up on him but having him hold down the left mouse button and release. The graphics are about on the same level as The Walking Dead games, but that's its only saving grace. Hardcore fans of the books and/or television show will get some entertainment out of the dialogue and interactions with the show's characters, but even then it is not enough for me to recommend anyone this game.","May 27","false","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It started off great -- You are put in charge of House Forrester, whose current situation closely mirrors that of the Starks in the tv show/novels.  You get to be present for key events from Martin's series and see some exotic locales.  The characters you play as are interesting and likeable.  The despair-heavy plot was what I expected from a game set in the ASOIAF universe and I looked forward to getting even with my enemies in later chapters.\n\nIt quickly became apparent, however, that none of the decisions really meant anything.  For example, during a dicussion with one character later in the game, every conversation option basically ends with being called a "fool" and failing in your mission.  If this 5-minute chunk of dialogue really meant nothing, then why are we forced to play it?  After I picked up on this, the feeling of powerlessness persisted through the entire game and ultimately made me regret playing it.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Viewpoint Characters - The characters are quite likeable and human.  It was refreshing to find that some characters don't fit the usualy tropes -- there are introverted characters forced into leadership roles and sellswords as honorable as they are brutal.\n\n2.  Art - Despite what other reviewers have mentioned, I found the scenery to be engaging.  When you're in King's Landing, you can hear sea gulls and the sea breeze.  When you're across the Narrow Sea, you feel almost in another world.  This was actually one of the things I liked most about the game.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  Choice System - As other reviewers have mentioned, the choice system feels rigged.  There is definitely a main "path" which is impossible to deviate from.  Prepare your defenses?  A whole bunch of enemy soldiers walk through your gates anyway.  Swallow your pride and submit to your enemies?  They still do terrible things to you.  Take pains to rescue someone?  Impossible to get them back anyway.\n\n2.  Save Structure - There is a rewind option, so Telltale obviously wants you to be able to go back and "fix" what you perceive as mistakes, but there are only 6 save points per chapter.  At one point, I messed something up toward the end of one of these save blocks and had to replay about 10 minutes of gameplay just to correct it.  And after fixing said mistake, surprise -- The outcome was the same anyway.\n\n3.  Unskippable Dialogue - I can understand why Telltale wants to force the story on you the first time around, but couldn't this be an option for future playthroughs?  It seems a relatively minor feature to include that would boost replayability significantly.\n\n4.  Literary Armor - Certain characters from the novels/show are obviously bulletproof.  I found this guiding my "choices" in more than a few situations.  I found it odd that decisions could involve these characters as it narrowed my choices even further (why try to affect a character when you know exactly what they're going to do?).\n\n5.  Unrealistic Characters - One of my biggest complaints with Telltale's TWD games was that characters were often borderline-neurotic for the sake of plot points.  This feels magnified here, almost to the point of absurdity.  The villians of the story are basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ robots who will stop at nothing until you are humiliated and defeated, even when it serves them no purpose.  Characters in King's Landing are all obsessed with "playing the game" to the point where they behave like soap opera characters incapable of compassion and friendship.\n\n6.  No Ending - The ending of this game disappointed me more than any game I've ever played, save Mass Effect 3.  It felt unrealistic and unrewarding.  Pretty much just a vehicle for setting up the next game.\n\nUltimately, I feel that Telltale went too far in invoking the "rules" of GRRM's series and in doing so took out all feeling of accomplishment necessary in a game.  The plot provides virtually no pay off for even your most well-thought out decisions and is basically, as other reviewers have said, a depression simulator.  To me, this game is essentially a visual novel with quicktime events set in the ASOIAF universe.","January 3","false","14.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Those who play these kinds of games come to learn that it's not about how the situation ends up but about how the story is told to you. Do you want to get stabbed because you were petulant, because you were brave or because you were stupid? Dependent on which I choose changed my feeling towards a senario, if you acted in the interest of protecting someone then you're more likely to feel righteous indignation at being murdered. However if I get killed because I stamped my feet and demanded things from an obviously dangerous individual then I'm not going to be all that surprised I was killed, maybe just annoyed.\n\nIt's an interactive story supposed to provoke emotions, not a game which you 'beat' by trying to keep everyone alive.\n\nAs of right now I've only played the first episode and I can officially say that I'm rather traumatised by the events that transpired. However I should have expected as much from a game with the title Game of Thrones. I shall not underestimate the next episode!\n\nInteresting story so far, great dialogue.

Yes, your choices don't matter.  And yes, the Old Gods just keep on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on House Forrester throughout the entire game.  But unlike the Walking Dead, the story in Telltale's Game of Thrones is embedded within another story - the Song of Ice and Fire - which brings with it it's own characters and plot - all of which force the player and House Forrester to take a back seat, leaving you helpless and powerless time and time again.  House Forrester has several unique aspects - the seat of their power is gorgious.  Their second outcast son is easily the most interesting to play.  But soon you realize the rest of House Forrester is just a copy of the characters of House Stark - not much thought went in to making these characters unique or memorible,  I suppose it was just easier to copy from the source material.  The story constantly forces the player to select the better of two horrible options and then punishes the player for making a choice - no matter what the player picked - with a story that constantly reminds you you don't matter and your choices don't matter.

'Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series' is more of an interactive movie than a traditional game, where you watch the drama unfold and are prompted to make dialogue choices during conversations or complete quick-time events during action sequences. These sequences are however interspersed with small RPG like gameplay sections where you can walk around in a small area to interact with objects/people and obtain some lore related information or extra conversations or complete a mini-quest before moving into the next sequence of the story.\n\nWhile this may not be everyone's style of gameplay it definitely does work for this title and you find yourself being pulled headlong into a tale of honour, intrigue and betrayal from within a few moments of the game starting. Most importantly, this story, the characters and the lore holds true to the Game of Thrones world and playing this game is almost the equivalent of being sucked into the show/books through the screen.\n\nUnfortunately, for a game that is all about your choices, they seem to have little apparent impact on how this season of the story plays out. That said, by the end (without any spoilers) the game looks to be in a position where your choices will likely have a noticeable impact during the next season.\n\nThis leads to the other downside to this game. It is designed to be a series of seasons, each released in chapters, so you'll be left with a fair amount of loose ends at the end of this season that will require an unknown number of seasons to be purchased and potentially quite a while of waiting time before you can see the whole story played  out to the end.\n\nOn the technical side, the graphics are pretty good but I found that occasionally things could look a bit fuzzy around the edges of faces and the like, though nothing that ruined the immersion. The voice acting is fantastic and thankfully includes having the actual actors from the show voicing their respective characters. The game also auto-saves as you go through so you rarely have to replay much if you fail a quick-time but you can use the built in rewind feature if you do wish to go back and redo a section (or several) of the game.\n\nThe only bug I encountered during the entire game was that the quick-time events didn't always acknowledge the mouse input but simply using the keyboard instead worked fine (this may or may not have been fixed since I played it).\n\nSo final judgement? I found this game to be beautifully designed and a brilliant addition to the Game of Thrones world. If you are a fan of the show or even the books* then this is definitely something you want to give a go. If you haven't seen the show or read the books you may find yourself a bit confused, at least at the beginning, as it follows off from a particular event in the show/books before expanding out into its own original story and does assume some familiarity with certain characters and events. Even so, if you are a fan of fantasy/medieval games then you will probably enjoy this game. I highly recommend it.\n\n*For the record, I have seen all the TV episodes and read all the books.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:An emotional and gripping story\nGreat voice acting\nWorthy of the GoT brand\nKeeps you engaged with little effortNeutral:Graphics are decent but can get a bit fuzzy sometimes\nGame style may not be for everyone (though I highly encourage people to try it if that's all that's holding you back)\nAssumes some familiarity with the GoT world (yet still playable without prior knowledge)Negatives:Choices made don't seem to have too much impact on how the story unfolds at this point (promising impact on the next season though)\nIs designed to be a series, leaving a lot of lose ends that require you to buy the next season to continue the story\nQuick-time events don't always respond to mouse movement (but no problems with keyboard)\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFind this review helpful?\nJoin Immortis Gaming for more reviews, cheap game deals, bundles and giveaways!","January 14","true","17.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I found this game to be beautifully designed and a brilliant addition to the Game of Thrones world. If you are a fan of the show or even the books* then this is definitely something you want to give a go. If you haven't seen the show or read the books you may find yourself a bit confused, at least at the beginning, as it follows off from a particular event in the show/books before expanding out into its own original story and does assume some familiarity with certain characters and events. Even so, if you are a fan of fantasy/medieval games then you will probably enjoy this game. I highly recommend it.\n\n*For the record, I have seen all the TV episodes and read all the books.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:An emotional and gripping story\nGreat voice acting\nWorthy of the GoT brand\nKeeps you engaged with little effortNeutral:Graphics are decent but can get a bit fuzzy sometimes\nGame style may not be for everyone (though I highly encourage people to try it if that's all that's holding you back)\nAssumes some familiarity with the GoT world (yet still playable without prior knowledge)Negatives:Choices made don't seem to have too much impact on how the story unfolds at this point (promising impact on the next season though)\nIs designed to be a series, leaving a lot of lose ends that require you to buy the next season to continue the story\nQuick-time events don't always respond to mouse movement (but no problems with keyboard)\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFind this review helpful?\nJoin Immortis Gaming for more reviews, cheap game deals, bundles and giveaways!","January 14","true","17.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I suppose if they were recreating how an inexperienced person in King's Landing would be totally lost amidst the web of secrets and intrigues spun around and using them, but Mira is described as smart and a natural when it comes to scheming amongst top-tier schemers.\n\n- I was reading a wiki with plot synopses to see what sort of bits I may have missed on my one playthrough and amusingly almost every paragraph has a sentence with the words "Regardless if you choose..., " or "Even if you choose X over Y action, Z character conveniently comes along and makes Y happen anyway."  That basically sums up the TellTale experience.\n\n- On a technical level as well I had preceisely the same issues I had with The Walking Dead S. 1., and the Wolf Among Us: Not only did my choices matter little by design of the game, but my progress was not properly tracked and I would watch the "Previously on..." montage tell me about a bunch of decisions I never made thereby messing with the continuity of the game I held in my head.\n\n- The game looks okay and I'm not altogether bothered by the characters who move and emote like wooden dolls, but I imagine it might distract some people.\n\n- The unskippable GoT intro was bothersome too.  It may have been jarring change in aesthetic, but maybe they should have just plopped in the actual TV version.  The current one looks like a 1990s 3D job.\n\n- I think a more focused approach may have been better.  Martin has hundreds of pages with which to weave his tales, but these sorts of episodic games don't appear equipped to handle so many characters and locales satisfyingly.  I'm contstantly reminded of hte Walking Dead's docus on a small group of survivors whose relationships strengthen and weaken.  As a result, while the decisions don't affect the plot that much, the decisions took on a hugely personal edge: E.g., When making a small decision on what to do with Duck in his final moments.\n\n- I'm sorry TellTale and co.  I know that a massive amount of work goes into these games and for what it's worth I did play it all the way through and wasn't completely dissatisfied.  There were some moments like standing up to Gryff tha really worked, but there's a lot that springs to mind crowding out the good parts.  I'd say this ranks quite a bit below Worlf Among Us, and without question below Walkding Dead S. 1.","April 7","false","12.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I'll be honest I enjoyed this, it had twists and turns as to be expected. What I mean is I went in expecting Game of Thrones, and for what it's worth, that's what I got. It's a dreary, almost hopeless story of betrayal with a tense atmosphere. All done in Telltale's signature style, except when it comes to choices. This is were I feel the major point of contention comes into play.\n\nWhat many people have noted is that your choices don't have significant impact on the overall story of the game, whilst I agree with this I did not go into this game expecting such. I went in expect the same feeling of dread, that what I want might not happen, exactly why I enjoy the TV show so much, because I am not in control. This is why I want to call out Telltale themselves for how they advertised this. The way they advertised it, people assumed that our choices would have impact just like previous games from Telltale, had they openly stated that it was a game much more in line of their older games, Sam & Max for example, then it would have been less of an insult for the game to be more linear.\n\nSo in summary, I'll quickly mention now, the graphics seem less impressive than previous Telltale games, but the soundtrack gets an A+. If you're interested in getting this, maybe as a fan of the show or books then I recommend you do not go into this expecting choices to matter significantly, also that you have watched up to at least Season 3 of the TV show. But I guess if you're a fan of the franchise you've most likely already done that.\n\n\nOh, and I have never hated myself more.","November 17, 2015","true","13.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","3"

Despite having no knowledge of the world or characters therein I found myself caring very deeply about all of them. Telltale NAILS IT once again. Although there is nothing, absolutely nothing to celebrate. Just when you feel as though you've finally grasped the situation, just when you've finally been coerced into thinking you've gained the upper hand. This game makes you decide between making a horrific decision or making a terrible decision. One bad thing after another. I've truly never felt so angered, bewildered and ..hopeless at what a harrowing experience this was constantly brewing a growing, undeniable lust for vengeance against the Whitehills.\n\nIn traditional telltale fashion, this is episodic and gives you the stats of other players major decisions. Surprisingly, this is may be the first telltale game in which the majority of my own decisions were that which aligned with the minority of players. Maybe one of the more polarizing group of decisions that I've seen inside of a telltale game.\n\nNow, on the subject of how much your choices truly affect the outcome. This is an adventure game. Its pulling you toward a specific already written ending. I'm not saying all the decisions are worthless, quite the contrary, what I am saying is even though its mostly been decided already; The details and the journey you take to get there become your own story. Who did this? What did 'they' say at that specific point and who was there at the end? That becomes what matters.\n\nThe game has a really unique and beautiful, sort of, cel-shaded painted over aesthetic that I really like. I really really liked this game and is easily one of my favorites in the telltale style adventure games. I hope they continue with it into season 2.\n\nWould cry again/10\n\nIron from Ice!","November 17, 2015","true","15.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

This 6-episode long story parallels with the TV series from the end of season 3 till early season 5.\n\nChecking the trailers  and pictures one can already guess how much detail Telltale has put into this. It is just superb - we have all our favourite characters returning from the show including Cersei, Tyrion and Ramsay Bolton or even Jon Snow. You recognise the actors from the show and shiver when hearing their texts are spoken by the same voice actors. I particularly liked the oil painting effect that was applied to many backgrounds - it is something very neat and makes the game look pretty cool.\n\nThe formula is the usual considering it is yet another Telltale adventure: you mainly pick responses when in dialogues and you also have fight sequences. QTE events now occur more often than in previous Telltale titles and also expect the game to be very violent. I mean VERY violent. And expect a lot of sacrifices - if you hated Martin for some of the things that transpired on the TV show you'll hate him even more for some of the choices you have to face in this game. I believe so far this game has offered the toughest choices of all the Telltale titles.\n\nIt is an emotional ride that superbly accompanies the TV show. A must for all GoT fans but remember to prepare yourself for the game - if you think you have seen everything you'll be mistaken as the game has some nasty surprises for you. The game has a nice story build-up but once reaches its conclusion it does not really offer a satisfactory ending.

This game has taken my breath away, some of the choices you are required to make are downright difficult, even knowing other parts of the storyline you simply can't tailor you responses to suit. In true Game of Thrones fashion, the carpet is pulled from beneath your feet the moment you feel comfortable. The story is compelling, emotional (yes I might have shed a tear at the end of episode two...) and gripping. The excitement of interacting with characters we love, hate and otherwise admire is something that made me giggle like a school girl in places and gasp when the unexpected twists and turns take place.\n\nThis isn't a game, this is a journey.\n\nI highly recommend this series to anyone, Game of Thrones fan or not as it offers interaction and imersion like nothing else I have played. Of course it is a benefit to have seen the Game of Thrones TV show to understand the backstories and surrounding plots.\n\nI should also noted that at present I have just finished Episode 3 so am only halfway through the story but I have to admit, I don't see my opinion of this game changing anytime soon!","October 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm glad I gave it a chance however, because it is a very good game. Not a great one, mind you, but a good game nonetheless. I'd wait for episode six to come out to judge it as a whole, but until then, here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Canon characters all have original voice acting and are well-written and excellently realized\n- Twists and turns to match the ones seen in the show\n- Pacing keeps you on your toes\n- Not as grimdark as some reviewers make it seem. Yes, it's bloody and heartbreaking, but there are glimmers of hope and innocence mixed in there to balance it out\n\nCons:\n- Watercolor style leads to some very frayed edges on both characters and objects, which can be distracting\n- Some of the main characters are a little bit dull compared to others\n- Dialogue has a tendency to get cut off at certain parts, but not enough to really impact the game (cut lines will still be visible as subtitles)\n\nAll in all, it's worth a look. I got invested in the main characters more easily than I'd thought, so if you have even the semblance of human empathy, you should too.","October 18, 2015","true","18.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nothing terribly different from other Telltale series.\n\nGraphics - The same, virtually, as any other series by them. Some of the characters facial animations look downright silly and took away from some of the dramatic moments for me, but I understand that is simply the art style here, and for the most part I do enjoy that.\n\nGameplay - Again, the same. Dialouge choices affecting how other characters perceive you and QTEs for action sequences, however they can sometimes be challenging and long, but not frustrating as you are given checkpoints DURING the sequences. If you die at the end of a sequence you will not be made to start completely over.\n\nSound - The sound effects are good, they enhance the scenes a lot for me, however I am not much of an audiophile so I would not be the best to ask here. I can tell you at least that they are not bad.\n\nMisc. - At the end of each episode you are given stats showing the percentage of players who made a certain choice during the major decisions of that episode, which is cool to see and compare to your own choices. The game uses a family that is barely mentioned in the books, so for pretty much everyone it is a fresh experience in this familiar world.\n\n9/10","September 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I started at 10pm and by the time I looked up from my monitor it was 3:30am. This game is really fun and is a bit different from the other TT Games I have played the combat is fun, the dialouge makes you feel for the characters and when there is confrontation you really feel it in the music changes the "camera" and definitely your gut.\n\nThe only con in this game, and most of TTG's new titles is not being able to select dialouge with 1234 not a big deal since they give you time but I just really liked that in TWD S1\n\nEpisode 1: 9/10 I had alot of fun. It was an introductory episode so this one is a must.\n\nEpisode 2: 9/10 Things fall apart... The struggle and strife in this episode makes it a must play.\n\nEpisode 3: 7/10 Not quite as fun but is essential for the storytelling.\n\nEpisode 4: 10/10 So it begins... Play please...\n\nEpisode 5: 11/10 Honestly broke my standard for this game. This episode is a culmination of all you have worked for in this game.\n\nEpisode 6: 10/10 The finale was good. It contains the final blows for the season and is a must play. My only regret was my mouse freaking out and choosing something that wasn't in my plan. Sets up nicely for a second season, which has already been "picked up". I will be playing it from the release of episode 1.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, but be careful cause when you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.

Mainly because I find it to be an unfinished product with an unsatisfying conclusion with a cliffhanger.\n\nThe illusion of choice you're given in these games was, unfortunately, to be expected. Wanting wildly different branching paths that reward multiple playthroughs is apparently a utopic wish, because the game has a set linear path in the end, and as much as Telltale may want you to think otherwise, the game doesn't offer different experiences with different choices.\n\nSure, you'll get a different response and some minor changes may occur, but in the end, things are still going to stay the same. I honestly think that Telltale should at the very least advertise the game the way it truly is: a linear story with a few ultimately meaningless choices set in a rich universe with some good characters and twists, but incomplete.\n\nHaving some famous TV characters show up in the game was a neat touch, but knowing that the game is set in HBO's Seasons 3 and 4, with the show having finished Season 5 with 6 coming in a few months, people who have watched the series will undoubtedly realize that some of these characters have literal plot armor, which further diminishes your "choice" in the matter when dealing with them.\n\nThe finale didn't feel like a finale, it felt like the prelude to the actual finale. Instead, we're told we have to wait for Season 2. I'm okay with having a few loose ends to keep the story going after the season's story arc's over and done with, but that's the problem, it never felt resolved.\n\nAnd I know Telltale can do better. The Walking Dead's Season 1 was perfect, you had both closure, and loose ends that allowed the story to carry onto Season 2. Game of Thrones simply has you waiting for Season 2 to find the closure you should have had in Season 1, and that I can't accept.","January 22","false","27.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are several interactions with the events and characters from the series, and kudos to Telltale for getting members of the show's cast to provide voice acting for their characters. However, the main characters' family is a blatant House Stark clone with a bunch of Kings Landing structures (like the advisory council and the [s]Hand of the King[/s] Sentinel) weighing it down, which annoyed me. Also, with so many characters running around (five player-protagonists, each with a separate cast of NPCs), I never really developed the emotional attachments required for the obligatory Game of Thrones gut-punches to really be effective, leaving me at the end of each episode just feeling generically depressed. This is not a game you play to enjoy.\n\nGameplay is where it starts to fall apart. Although a necessary evil to explore the various regions shown in the show, having five player-protagonists and frequently cutting between them was something I disliked. It turned each episode into a set of loosely-related sequences instead of a more coherent single narrative. I found it difficult to keep track of each character's actions and NPC interactions, so each character failed to find a consistent 'voice' (although now that the episodes are all out, new players won't have the two-month gaps to contend with). The incresing reliance on quick-time events compared to previous Telltale titles also annoyed me, as did the ending blatantly not resolving anything in favour of leading into the upcoming second season. I do like how Telltale continues to play with and subvert their gameplay mechanisms, whether its taunting me with move commands when I can't, or informing me after successfully dodging some interrogating questions that “[?] Jon Snow knows nothing”.\n\nGraphics is another letdown. They had big problems bringing in the characters from the live-action show and rendering them in the 'Telltale style', with some of the character models just not fitting in (they did improve across the series, but Cersei's battering-ram forehead and Margaery's pixellated alabaster skin still jarred). The 'out-of-focus painting' style for the background art also failed to mesh well with the art style of the foreground and the characters. The attempt to replicate the show's title sequence was just plain clunky.\n\nThe music is pleasant but broadly unrememberable (although Talia's funeral song gave me chills). Voice acting was good, although in later episodes, conversations didn't seem to balance as well (the relative volumes and tones sounded like two people each talking at a wall, and yes I know that's how voice-recording works, but they usually hide it better). Some of the lines of dialogue were missing, particularly in the (otherwise quite well done) end of series decision recap.\n\nOverall, if you're a really big fan of the franchise or of Telltale's work, the game may be worth considering at a discount and with a cheerful palate-cleanser on standby. Less committed fans or drive-by punters should probably steer clear.","December 30, 2015","false","15.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nothing terribly different from other Telltale series.\n\nGraphics - The same, virtually, as any other series by them. Some of the characters facial animations look downright silly and took away from some of the dramatic moments for me, but I understand that is simply the art style here, and for the most part I do enjoy that.\n\nGameplay - Again, the same. Dialouge choices affecting how other characters perceive you and QTEs for action sequences, however they can sometimes be challenging and long, but not frustrating as you are given checkpoints DURING the sequences. If you die at the end of a sequence you will not be made to start completely over.\n\nSound - The sound effects are good, they enhance the scenes a lot for me, however I am not much of an audiophile so I would not be the best to ask here. I can tell you at least that they are not bad.\n\nMisc. - At the end of each episode you are given stats showing the percentage of players who made a certain choice during the major decisions of that episode, which is cool to see and compare to your own choices. The game uses a family that is barely mentioned in the books, so for pretty much everyone it is a fresh experience in this familiar world.\n\n9/10","September 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I started at 10pm and by the time I looked up from my monitor it was 3:30am. This game is really fun and is a bit different from the other TT Games I have played the combat is fun, the dialouge makes you feel for the characters and when there is confrontation you really feel it in the music changes the "camera" and definitely your gut.\n\nThe only con in this game, and most of TTG's new titles is not being able to select dialouge with 1234 not a big deal since they give you time but I just really liked that in TWD S1\n\nEpisode 1: 9/10 I had alot of fun. It was an introductory episode so this one is a must.\n\nEpisode 2: 9/10 Things fall apart... The struggle and strife in this episode makes it a must play.\n\nEpisode 3: 7/10 Not quite as fun but is essential for the storytelling.\n\nEpisode 4: 10/10 So it begins... Play please...\n\nEpisode 5: 11/10 Honestly broke my standard for this game. This episode is a culmination of all you have worked for in this game.\n\nEpisode 6: 10/10 The finale was good. It contains the final blows for the season and is a must play. My only regret was my mouse freaking out and choosing something that wasn't in my plan. Sets up nicely for a second season, which has already been "picked up". I will be playing it from the release of episode 1.\n\nI strongly recommend this game, but be careful cause when you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.

With The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, Telltale nailed the feel, the narrative and the general tone of the original works. Not this time though, as they completely misunderstood what made the books (and TV series I guess) good or enjoyable, thinking that unfairness, frustration and characters dying and having the worst outcome in every situation is what makes GoT fun. You cannot succeed, you cannot win and no matter how cunning, how tough, how smart or how remarkably stupid you act, the outcome is ALWAYS going to be the same. This game goes as far as to have major plot twists happen in the exact same manner even if the characters that are supposed to carry that out are dead, just having someone else do it instead.\n\nAs far as the characters go, the game attempts to retake the book's formula of having the story told from every character's perspective, and it would've worked amazingly if the characters weren't either a rip off or a mix between the original Stark family. I mean, really, they even look alike.  The villains and secondaries aren't much better though, when Telltale thinks "unpredictable" is the same as "incoherent", and no matter how good you are in figuring them out, they'll just act randomly and have the plot continue.\n\nGameplay is pretty much non-existent, even for Telltale's standards. This game focuses heavily in dialogue, choices and interactions between characters, leaving exploration and investigation somewhat behind, and the usual QT events for the action parts. However good the intentions were, when psychology, diplomacy, bluffs, etc. are the only tools you have, but the story will NEVER branch into different outcomes... well, you can guess.\n\nAnd that's the worst part by far. When you have almost no gameplay and a heavy plot with several wannabe cliffhangers and plot twists, the player needs to feel involved. For the most part, Telltale's GoT feels as if you were reading a poorly written fanfic of the original books with the characters acting in your screen. As a player, you have ZERO power over the events. Dialogue hardly ever changes, as you're going to be completely screwed up anyway.\n\nIf you play this game, get ready to have a pretty big cast of characters tell you it was your decisions that led the entire plot into a complete bloodshed, disaster and chaos no matter what you choose to do.\n\nOn a side note, though the animations are pretty crappy overall, general art work, environment and assets are pretty damn good.

Nothing revealing tho.\n\nIt's ok, I guess. I love Game of Thrones but this game is just as every other game about GoT: Dull, boring and average or below average. I trusted that TellTale could make a decend GoT game after I played Wolf Amongst Us which was a masterpiece. This on the other hand... is not. It's average.\n\nIt certainly has some GoT-ish aspects. Voice actors from the show are used poorly and the overall "you choose what happens in the game" feel is gone. When those major characters from the show are all the time messing around, you know that anything significant can't happen. The whole game feels just like playground for children. Only the last episode gave you the feel that your actions can made something important to happen, but otherwise I didn't feel the freedom of choice. It felt like whatever you do will make you lose in some way. It has the GoT-ish feeling that everyone can die, but only sometimes. Sometimes you just know that something is not going to happen. Only the ending was really surprising.\n\nThe story as a whole was a kinda messy and confusing. The whole point of the story ended up very lamely and the possibility of 2nd season was way too obvious. It feels like Telltale is only milking from GoT's popularity by doing this kind of games.\n\nOther telltale's games are fine, good or amazing but this is so far the worst of them. I really wanted to like this game but it's just not possible. The game could have been better and I hope that season 2 does something better. This game is not worth its price but if you catch it from a sale, it's certainly nice to play trough. Just don't expect it to be amazing because it feels like it's a bad fanfiction.","January 12","false","12.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Telltale have got the doomed and desperate feel of the series/book, but this game will disappoint. I enjoyed the ride until the last episode, it was enjoyable and I was attached to many of the characters and that’s why the last episode was so terrible.\n\nI understand main characters especially a good one dying in a terrible fashion it is after all Game of Thrones but when no matter what choice you make they still end up on the chopping block (well maybe only one choice in twenty and then some), nah. Then the other characters die, after literally every decision you make having no impact and watching everyone (except for those scripted into the main story, Mr Ramsey) die despite specifically taking precautions. This also includes actions you take to save your house, from recruiting mercenaries and making certain sacrifices (literally doing everything asked of you to save the house).\n\nSome interesting side stories that give you some more background behind some of the main events of the book/series are good. It was nice to have some extra interactions with characters from the series and certain scenes were great playing through. The different characters all had some nice traits and played in different ways which is what made it a great ride. But when you feel as though the ending is pre-determined NO MATTER what choice you make you kind of feel slightly cheated.

Sigh.\n\nI've played most of the Telltale games to date and this one ranks at the bottom.\nIt's NOT a bad game, it's just woefully underwhelming compared to the rest I've played.\n\nFirst, very few of your choices in this story really make any difference. Same person dies every time, just different circumstances, blah, blah, blah. You can try to do this or that, but your "team"(House Forrester) get rekted either way. While I admit this does fit the deary narrative of GoT, I feel it destroys any sense of player control over the outcome.\n\nSecond, while it's great to have major characters from GoT involved, some of them... are a bit too involved. And this leads to problems, especially with player choice as formerly mentionly. Actual characters from GoT will have plot armor and no matter what choices you make, they will always do the same things and always screw your own characters over. Because the plot demands you as the player can never do anything that might drastically impact them.\nHonestly I think game works best when it leaves out the actual GoT characters and just sticks to the originals in the game.\n\nBeyond the story and choice issues, the graphics were suprisingly not as well done as in other Telltale games. Frequently I noticed lip desyncing, texture tearing and objects and characters just popping up out of nowhere.\n\nI suppose the only thing done well was the music which fitted in nicely with the already present themes from GoT.\n\nI would give this a 5 out of 10. Very average... avergery sort of game.\nGet it if you're a GoT fan, otherwise just pass on it.\n\nIn the meantime, I need to build a wall to stop the spread of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Westeros.","March 3","false","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its a fine story, with excellent voice acting and the typical Telltale Games animation style, but I cannot understand why it is not released as a 'whole' title rather than in individual chapters.  It can only be to maximise profits, and you can't really blame the company for that.  But it led me to leave it aside for months as I had pre-purchased the season pass.  I ended up losing interest, which is a shame as the story peaks well at the season finale.\n\nPersonally, I won't be buying any further installments or other Telltale Games' offerings until they are on VERY special offer, as in, sub - £10/$10 for the 'series'.\n\nI really like the storyline, both for this title and The Wolf Amongst Us.

I have nothing against that formula in theory, but we all know now what to expect from the "every decision you make matters" bit and it's not good enough to base your entire game around anymore.  A good story can help you gloss over that but GoT doesn't measure up in that regard either.\n\nTypically TTG does a great job of taking an established world and building out their own characters that feel completely at home there but wholly unique and fleshed out (like in Tales of the Borderlands).  But here, all of the main characters feel like a  carbon-copy of the Stark family and their story arcs.  "Oh look, it's not-Jon-Snow doing very Jon-Snow things in that area Jon-Snow usually hangs out in.  Riveting"  Despite TTG's usual adeptness at honing in on what makes a franchise special, it's closer to one of those licensed movie games you'd pick up a decade ago where you literally play out all the things you saw  in the movies.  Because...I guess we just wanted a crappier version of that experience.\n\nI'm actually not sure who this game was made for since those with more knowledge of the show are more likely to be frustrated when they can't use that knowledge to avoid incredibly bad decisions in the game.  It will be like "Do you want to ally with this character?" and the whole time you're going "No, get the ♥♥♥♥ out of there!  ♥♥♥♥ is about to go down with them!!!"  while the game just plows forward regardless.\n\nThe TellTale engine also really shows it's age here.  Often when you see the close up of a character, the background looks like an Impressionist painting - a collage of abstract colors that bleed together.  When you have a higher res model jabbering in front of something straight out of a Monet exhibit, it's just a visual mess.\n\nFinally, the ending.  No direct spoilers here, but after I hit the ending I was livid for days later.  It felt like a complete waste of time, like 4 of the 6 chapters didn't even need to exist.  What had I accomplished?  Why did I need to see half the sub-plots presented?  I felt absolutely robbed of a decent story because some exec prematuraly commisioned a second season and TTG was too lazy to make the game conclude properly.\n\nI will not be buying Season 2 of Game of Thrones.  It will be the first TellTale game I refuse to play.","May 27","false","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For a game that was mainly quicktime events and dialogue options, I had expected it to show more consequences to a lot of choices and branching storytelling. There are a few important moments late in the game, where your choices have an impact, but mostly you are dealing with the illusion of choice.\n\nThe illusion of choice is not bad in itself, unless it is pretty obvious... Which is it... At one point you have a knife to a character's throat, and he is testing you to see if you would cut it. His hands are far enough away to make sure that there is no way he would be able to actually have any time to stop you, if you decide you want to kill him. But you are not meant to cut his throat, so instead he knocks you on your ♥♥♥ without it even looking like your character attempted to cut his throat. -.-\n\nEach and every episode ends basically the same way, with the family being in a worse situation than when they came in.\n\nThe ending didn't leave me satisfied on any real points so it felt more like half a story-line rather than a full experience, and most choices in the early episodes felt meaningless.\n\nThe voice acting is good though, and house forrester as well as their allies are great characters. House Whitehill and their soldiers though... Comes off as one dimensional bullies, except for one. I guess they tried to capture the epic Stark versus Lannister or Bolton conflict of the show? Maybe? But it just doesn't work. For me it felt like drawing the Red Wedding out for as long as possible with an angry grumpy cowardly bully like Walder Frey as the main enemy. No real chance of truly experience the strategy, complexity, or intrigue of the high or low noble house. Just... Constant knife in the back every episode.\n\nI felt it promised more in the early episodes than it delivered. If you are truly desperate to scratch your game of thrones itch, well it is the best game of thrones game I have seen.

GRANTED it has some cool moments and dialogues but as a whole, it just fails. The main issue i have with this game is that to make it canon (unlike the walking dead series) you cannot "beat" or "eliminate" any of the characters from the series that are still alive... making your choice matter only in minor things, or making you feel as your choice was useless.\n\nFor example SPOILER WARNING HERE, DON'T LOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED ATLEAST CHAPTER 5, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED  Ramsay offers you as rodrik to try to cut his throat by resting his knife PRESSING down his throat (all you need would be a swift movement to cut it... so you think "cool, ima kill yo ♥♥♥" but NOOOO, he just pushes you away giving the excuse "you're a cripple" (when in the former episode you trained with royland using your sword).\nOr that time when playing as MIra you get summoned by Cersei and Margery while escorting you tells you to try to please Cersei, "thinking one thing to say while actually saying another". So ok, you do that (swearing allegiance to the crown and joffrey instead of margery) and what happens next? Margery is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you 'cause you said that. Great. Or that time when you have to leave ironrath playing as rodrik and you have to leave talia home alone and no matter what you tell her, the game on the next episode "previously on" shows rodrik saying even the sentence you didn't chose.\n\nBut the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of them all is the traitor revealing. In a 4 years old little spoiled kid fashion the traitor decides to be one why? 'Cause you didn't choose him as a sentinel LMFAO. And not directly too since that decision was made by ethan which it lasted by the grand total of 1 episode lolol.\n\nNot mentioning there is no real ending as they did confirm a couple of days ago a second season of this game... and ofc there are plot holes here and there (i could even close an eye on it, every story has plot holes, especially when it's so rich in characters that interacts with eachother... it's inevitable).\n\nBut yeah, as i said, too many downs for too few little ups to give it a thumbs up. Granted i enjoyed it as a big fan of Game of Thrones (mainly because they actually booked the actors from the serie to dub their respective characters)... but i really can't recommend it to anyone else.\nIf you want a very good telltale game go play either the first season of the walking dead or even better tales from the borderlands.","November 25, 2015","false","11.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is very bad, and all it screams is sequel, also it tries to outdo Game of Thrones's way of kill off characters, it feels so forced and unnecessary, in the end your choices never mattered at all, no matter which style you played- for example: if you treat margaery tyrell like ♥♥♥♥ or good, it does not matter cause she dismisses you as handmaiden anyway another one is save bershka or malcolm from a dragon, if you save malcolm youd be surprised when he stays in Essos and bershka seems to have forgotten it, if you do it the other way around, it still does not matter. The last example of no choice is the sellswords/slave warriors, you get them to fight for you with asher and you are constantly reminded that they ONLY fight for asher and he has their respect.

These are some of my issues with this game, having played all but part of the last episode, which I put down because I just couldn't stand playing any more:\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\n- The obvious plot railroading that results from certain choices.  It's well-known already that Telltale games ultimately always end up in the same basic place regardless of your choices -- that's not my complaint here, as it can be done well (like in Tales from the Borderlands). The problem is that depending on your choices, the consequences simply do not make sense, both in terms of character consistency and logistics. Having this happen once or twice across the series wouldn't be so bad, but it would happen multiple times in some episodes. It was distracting.\n\n- This is related to plot railroading, but is so egregious that it deserves its own section. If you take certain actions, the traitor's motivations make no sense, and leaving you scratching your head in confusion instead of feeling betrayed.\nAnd the writing leads you to believe that the traitor truly believes what they're saying to you, which just ends up being confusing because it contradicts what you've actually seen happening in the story.\n\n- The use of canon characters in certain situations eliminates all tension and makes you roll your eyes instead. Oh, you have the choice to stab or not stab a significant canon character? Oh boy, I wonder what's going to happen here!\n\n- The last minute introduction of two new characters to the story felt shoehorned, random, and like a lazy setup to season 2\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but it ended up really disappointing me, especially after a wondeful first episode.","December 17, 2015","false","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Don't bother with it.\n\nIf you are a fan of the show, the Telltale spinoff might be just what you need to shorten the time until the next season of the TV show starts.\n\nI have to applaud Telltale Games for seamlessly adding their little sidestory to the events seen on television. Cleverly  referencing major events from the show as well as adding fanservice in the form of encounters with known characters to make it part of the world we know from the telly but at the same time offering a strong original cast of characters that could have easily been part of the hit series.\n\nGranted, it starts off a bit slow and wonky, but after the first episode I was hooked and did care about the fate of House Forrester. Much like the show there are plenty of story-arcs going on at once and I have to say that I didn't find any of them to be less interesting than the others - there is always something exciting going on and it is just as unimagniable and horrible as you would expect from the Game of Thrones. In fact, binge-playing the entire season I think it's even MORE bleak and grim than the TV show with so many things going terribly, terribly wrong for the cast (but that may also be the result of poor choices on my end).\n\nI don't know how many of the gruesome fates can be avoided by making different decisions - knowing Telltale, there is probably not much going on in terms of events turning out much differently. But as always, you can decide how your character acts through dialogue - you could be mean and agressive or soft-spoken and just. If anything, the game conveys the illusion of choice splendidly and on more than one occasion I had to sit back and think about my options for a moment - at times it really feels like you are playing the "Game of Thrones" with ever shifting sides, people you trust turning traitor and people you deemed worthless suddenly becoming valuable allies. It may be too subtle for some who wish for more drastic consequences to their choices - but I always enjoyed the small scale and intimacy of the options and their consequences. Sometimes, impressing the queen makes you feel just as good about yourself as deciding the fate of half of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nNaturally, this game isn't without problems - mostly technical in nature. Hopefully, at some point they upgrade their engine and/or work on their animations. I made my peace with the Telltale Games and their shortcomings long ago - if the game provides a gripping storyline and strong characters the rest will be endured and I will still be satisfied. Personally, I would put the first season of Game of Thrones right between The Walking Dead Season 1 (still Telltale's unequaled masterpiece, in my opinion anyways) and Wolf among us. It didn't quite have the emotional impact of TWD S01 - but it had a lot of exciting story arcs going on that I got really invested in - and the atmosphere was just great all around, much praise to the excellent actors who do a brilliant job of bringing these characters to life!\n\nI had the "pleasure" of playing Until Dawn and Life is Strange earlier this year and despite the outdated tech - Game of Thrones DESTRÖYED both of them. It won't convince you of the Telltale style if you aren't already convinced, it won't make you a Game of Thrones superfan or anything if you aren't - but if you like the show it is damn well worth checking out. Just prepare yourself for getting your soul crushed Game of Thrones-style - this isn't exactly a feel-good game!","December 30, 2015","true","10.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In this review, i'm going to tell you why, but as well as some of the Pro's and Cons to this game.\n\n\n\nStory -\n\nPros - For those of you who have played any telltale game, the obvious reason why anyone gets it is cause of its great and interesting story that each game have to offer. Well, Game of thrones fits in that catagory as its rich story is what makes this game so amazing. The story is interesting. but not only that, the plot twists are well thought out, and the story is greatley written. I would say throughout most of the game there wasn't a dull moment. As soon as the player starts, 8/10 times the player will continue.\n\nCons -\nThis being said, the story isn't perfect.\n\nMost of the telltale games take a comic or tv show, take the theme from that paticular tv show or comic, pick a character to be the protagnist, or make their own character depending whether or not its directly based off the show or comic, and bam, you have your game.\n\nThe Walking Dead is the exact game of what I just described. Telltale took the original walking dead comic, made a character, and put that character as a protagnist in The Walking Dead game. Now some of the characters in The walking dead (not entirley sure) do make an appearnce in the comics, (glen, lily). However, you don't need to know those in order to play the game. Nor do you need to watch the show.\n\nIn other words, I never read the comics of the walking dead, or watch teh show, and this game was my game of the year for 2012, yes,  I did know of what the Walking Dead was, but I never knew much about it. All I knew was, "Oh, its show about people shooting zombies."\n\nI never read the comics of The Wolf Among Us, and I found The Wolf Among us to be one of the best games for a story out there.\n\nAlthough I did play Borderlands, I never actually got into it at all, and knew not much of its lore, and Tales From The Borderlands is the best game of 2015 along with Undertale and Fallout 4.\n\nMy point is, you didn't need to know much about these games, and you would 9/10 times enjoy them greatley, reguardless of what you knew about what they were based off of.\n\nNow, you would think the same for Game of thrones, right?\n\nSadly, no. this isn't the case.\n\nYou see, although Game of thrones is a great game, the game expects you to have watched the show, or good sum of it at least. Many of the things aren't explained to you, and half of the characters are actually from the show itself. Sometimes the game throws you into situations and you don't even know whats going because no has even explained to you why you're in this situation in the first place. There are times when you don't even know what to say, and you have no idea what will happen if you say it.\n\nA great example of this is when you play as one of the playable characters, Mira, and you are to talk to Cersei of who you are loyal to. However, you don't even know who this person is, you don't what her objective is in talking with you, the only thing your looking at is the midget elf right beside her.\n\nIn other words, the game expects you to know a good some of the universe before you play this game. In my opnion, I think its a stupid idea, as there was no tell tale game that has ever done this. I never had to watch any of the walking dead episodes or comics or play the borderland games to expirence what greatness they had. I would think the exact same thing for this game.\n\nDialouge/Choices -\n\nAgain, you are sometimes thrown into situations where you have no idea whats going on. but the game expects you to know what you're doing, sometimes this flaws the expirence.\n\nHowever, I will say that the choices you make in this game are greatley important. By this I mean your choices matter, right from the first episode to the end of the game. In other words, I personally think that more telltale games should be like this, as telltale says they do, but they don't really.\n\nGame of thrones makes you think about what you're doing. Most of the time you have no idea what may happen if you choose between various things, and its hard to choose between some of them, as both have very different outcomes. You're thinking that this is a bad thing, but really I think the exact opposite. Having a variety of endings and situations in your game is what makes your game fun, and allows the player to choose what they want by giving them the freedom to do what they believe is from right or wrong.\n\n\nWhen it came to the ending of this game, I was sort of expecting what it gave me, as for every tell tale game, whenever you beat the last episode you'll always feel the lack of it not giving oyu enough, and a feeling of no conclusion to what you just beaten, but, I will say that the ending was very anticipating, and i was at the edge of my seat for most of the episode.\n\n\nI think if it was anything they could improve on, it would be the lack of what this game wants you to know. Someone shouldn't have to have played call of duty advanced warfare to enjoy black ops 3, someone shouldn't have to have played snake eater to enjoy the phantom pain, and I shouldn't have to have watched the Game of thrones show just to understand whats going on in this game.\n\n\nA Season 2 is coming out for this game eventually, but as always, telltales plates are full, so I wouldn't imagine that it will take a while before we get some solid evidence of what we'll see next.\n\n\n\nOverall this game deserves\n\n8.75/10","December 12, 2015","true","25.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are one of them, this is true up to some point.

Not as well put together as some of their others and suffers badly from actually wrapping up very little. Enjoyable to play through, but the ending is desperately disappointing. Tentative recommendation, but be aware that the end of the game is very much sequel-bait and it has a few small annoyances overall.\n\n\nLonger version:\nTelltale's Game of Thrones plays quite analogously to how the books read. Unlike in TWD or TWAU you play as several members of House Forrester, a noble house hailing from the north. As bannermen to the Starks the game opens with you playing as Gared Tuttle, the nephew of the Castellan of Ironrath, seat of House Forrester, and squire to Lord Gregor Forrester himself. You, your Lord and his men are celebrating a wedding. Specifically the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey at the Twins and...well I'm sure anyone who knows ASOIAF can fill in the rest of that.\n\nFrom there the story spirals out into the different members of the house and their efforts to save their house in the aftermath of the fall of the Starks, in the face of their bitter rivals House Whitehill. right the way across Westeros. Gared is sent to the Wall to take the Black amidst rumours of "The North Grove"; the third-born son Ethan Forrester, in the absence of the eldest son (who was also at the wedding) and the second born (exiled), becomes Lord Ethan and has to deal with issues that he is ill-prepared for but must handle; eldest daughter Mira Forrester down in King's Landing as a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell learns to play 'the game' and weaves a political web to help protect her family; meanwhile Asher Forrester, the second born son exiled across the Narrow Sea, gets news of the slaughter at the wedding and resolves to somehow gather an army and return to Westeros to fight for his family.\n\nIts a very compelling story and the jumping between viewpoints works surprisingly well with the scene switches being typically well placed and each part being nicely paced. However it does suffer somewhat for being seemingly even more careless of your actual choices than Telltale games usually are. Some choices you make seem to have literally zero impact, even in terms of extra dialogue or not. If you don't mind that, however, you'll likely find a lot to love about the story and the characters are engaging and endearing.\n\nMore annoying is the actual choosing of decisions and the QTEs themselves. When conversations are going on you cannot see the mouse cursor and, rather than allowing you to choose an option by pressing a number corresponding to that option you MUST click it. Which means all too often when I first started I was sitting back and enjoying a scene when suddenly the game would throw a choice at me with a rapidly decreasing timer; leading to a frantic scramble to hit the space bar to pause the game. The countdown is, in many cases, far too rapid for the procedure of firstly taking in what was said, then reading the options and making a decision on which one, then finding where on the screen the mouse cursor has wandered off to and finally hitting the right option. It was a rather frustrating experience until I got into the habit of regularly pausing the game, which had a rather negative effect on the flow. The QTEs suffer similarly in some cases, for many it was a simple case of pressing the appropriate WASD button and/or using Q and E (although they did tend to rather spring them on you sometimes); but some of them required using the mouse either to click on a highlighted spot fast or to use the mouse to perform some other action, frequently only explaining what you needed to do on that specific screen only. My particular annoyance with this was a brief section in a later episode where you have to use a bow to shoot a rabbit; you have probably less than ten seconds to do it, your mouse is likely off-target, the instructions pop up in the top left corner (if I remember rightly) but if you take the few seconds to read you'll probably miss your chance, and the whole thing required a rather lengthy "hold the button to draw, aim, let go to release" action which is fine if you know its coming but when thrown at you all of a sudden can be a little jarring. Especially since your only piece of archery to that point had been with a crossbow which was literally point and click.\n\nIn terms of looks my only complaint is the 'oil painting' thing they've gone for the backgrounds of scenes. In some cases this is fine and actually feels pretty good but for a few scenes, particularly in King's Landing, it makes the game look ugly in parts. Though on the whole the game does look very good and the characters are well designed.\n\nFinally I come to probably the most damning part of the game: Episode 6 and the ending. Without wanting to give away any spoilers this game suffers BADLY from 'sequelitis'. As the most mild spoiler I can think of: I mentioned "The North Grove" earlier and it is a central part of Gared's story and you do indeed find out more about what it is...however it is never explained WHY its important. Even worse it seems totally isolated and unrelated to the main focus on the struggles of House Forrester. Similarly for Mira's story down in King's Landing; although all of it ties into her trying to help her family the lack of any real connection between that story and the story of the rest of her family leaves the whole thing feeling limp and largely irrelevant outside of one or two minor references. Which was disappointing because I found it to be a quite compelling part of the game. Ultimately anyone hoping that the disparate threads of all the different stories would be tied together at the end for a big climax will be bitterly disappointed.\n\n\nOverall then? I can't help feeling a little cheated by the ending. Personally I'd deliberately waited until the final episode was out before playing this and to play it through and basically be confronted with a "To Be Continued" on so many key issues was a bit of a let down. However on the other hand the simple fact is I DO want to see what happens next because I greatly enjoyed my time with House Forrester and want to continue with all of their stories, for good or ill.\n\nGiven this is Game of Thrones...its most likely going to be ill. But despite that, I still want to see it through to the end. And I guess you can take that as something of an endorsement.","November 17, 2015","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You might as well be watching a film, in which the protagonist enjoys having plot armour for some time before dying and passing his bad luck to the next of kin.\nIt could still make sense, but not with the build-up from all the episodes - you attempt so many plans and plots, but they all fail nonetheless.","December 5, 2015","false","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is however also the weakest telltale entry to date (not including Minecraft since it's too early to make an opinion). This is altogether even sadder due to the fact that they have spent the most development time on this product. How that managed to happen I'll never be able to guess, and it's a shame. You can notice that a lot of thought went into this product, but it just fails to stand next to other telltale entries. It lacks gradual build-up across episodes, but most of all it lacks soul. Going from one episode to another doesn't feel like you are moving forward towards an epic ending - which it did in other telltale games & also life is strange (by the developer Dontnod, which I definitely can recommend), it feels like watching an alright movie.\n\nNot a great movie, not a bad movie, not a boring movie, but a meh-I-suppose-I-can-spend-my-evening-on-this type of movie.","November 15, 2015","false","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Well first off because I get into it lets go ahead and establish that if you're not up to date on HBO's Game of Thrones then you probably shouldn't play this. It will spoil a lot of things. If you don't ever plan on watching it and you want this game, watch it. You'll understand so much.\n\nFirst of it's a Tell Tale Game, so of course it's story driven. And damn if it's not a good story. It's follows loyal bannermen of the Starks, House Forrester. Their lord has died, they're going through some rough times. On top of their people being hungry and them having no army they're under threat from the White Hills who want to take their precious iron wood. And the white hills are backed by the Boltons which are the Wardens of the north. The choices I had to make were making me feel all kinds of ways. And some of them were actually really hard. Don't let anyone fool you and say your choices don't matter in a Telltale game, because they do. The dialouge you get means a lot, the way the characters act means a lot. Of course some things will probably happen, but still the dialouge is what makes it.\n\nIt's like the TV Show, many things are happening at once. You'll follow Gared, Ethan, Rodrik, Mira, and Asher. All of which are the children of Lord Forrester with the exception of Gared; he was a squire. It's just astonishing how so much is going on and it all ties together. Mira is in Kings Landing pulling favors almost like Sansa Stark. Asher is in Essos, Lord Ethan and Rodrik are both in Ironrath, home of the Forresters, and Gared gets sent to the wall.\n\nThe voice acting is terrific. They even brought in actors from the show to voice their characters on the game. If that isn't great I don't know what is. The graphics are the same as Telltale's Walking Dead, nothing much but still a nice feel. Combat for me was a little tricky because I had a ported PS4 controller and I didn't know any xbox buttons, but other than that it's alright. It's not a fighting game of course so don't expect to fight and have fun.\n\nI really don't see many flaws in this game. It's an amazing story driven game and if you enjoy Game of Thrones I would tell you to seriously consider picking it up.\n\ntl;dr\nGreat story driven game, not too many flaws.","October 14, 2015","true","32.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","8"

In this case, make a smart decision and end up in bad situation. Make a foolish decision and end up in the EXACT SAME bad situation. It makes it very hard to care about individual choices when they do not effect the ultimate outcome. This is an especially big problem when the whole point of the game is that it allows you to "choose" what happens.\n\nThe second problem is that the storyteller seem, in true GRRM fashion, to be incapable of writing a satisfying conclusion to a storyline. When only bad things happen to characters no matter what they (or you) do, it instills a sense of hopelessness in the narrative that makes the reader stop caring what happens to the characters.\n\nMaybe this was supposed to be a setup for further games, but I can find better uses for my money. After playing this season to its "conclusion" I honestly don't care what happens to these characters anymore.","November 17, 2015","false","16.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But this? Not so much.Trust me. I really wanted to enjoy this game. I was very excited about this. The game had a really strong start. There were decent characters and the story looked promising, until it started to fall apart.\n\nI've played The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and I know that your choices don't have a massive meaning in Telltale Games. The illusion of choice in this game however is just unbearable. If you've watched tv-series or read the books, you know that George R. R. Martin's fantasy world is filled with desperation, unpleasant surprises and boobs. This game has no boobs though, but it surely knows how to make you feel miserable and it gives you maybe too much "Red Wedding"- moments. I tried everything to get the best, satisfying outcome. There are few meaningful choices that affect the stroy, but most of the time it dosen't matter what you choose. The end results will be always bad for the main characters. Later on, you are not even surprised by any plot twists anymore. They just become too predictable.\n\nAfter episode 5, I started to realise that the writing of this story is somewhat lazy and rushed. Lots of plot holes, especially with that terrible "traitor"-subplot. Having Ramsay Bolton in the game is a terrible idea as he is carrying a big shiny plot armor. You know you cannot harm him, even if the game has the balls to give you the "choice" to try. I personally felt that the game had too many main characters to deal with. It works in the books and in tv-series, but in this game where each episode may take less than 2 hours, 4 main characters that are separated could've been too much. Especially one of the main characters "Mira Forrester" felt completely unnecessary and forced in the game, just so we can have someone in King's Landing. As for the ending... the game just "ends". The story is not finished and the ending is not satisfying. They clearly made it to be prepared for Season 2. Will there be a daylight for Season 2? Seeing Telltale Games getting more and more licenses it actually may take a while.\n\nThe artstyle and graphics in this game look awful. I normally don't complain about graphics, but I loved the art and looks of The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us and especially Tales from the Borderlands. After switching to this, I miss the cartoonish look of previous Telltale Games. The bad lip sync is way too noticable, the terrible anti-aliasing just pinches my eyes and the combat scenes are incredibly clunky. Especially when there are big battles and you notice some dudes fighting in the background, they look like paper dolls banging each other.\n\nThere are some great moments with this game, but overall, it's a massive disappointment for a person who loves George R. R. Martin's fantasy world and Telltale Games. There was so much potential in this, but Iam honestly not sure if Iam going to play Season 2 after this.

After a lot of joyful hours in a setting, as dark and bitter as turkish coffee, the formula can't stand up for itself anymore.\n\nSure. The stories are still enjoyable, but does that justify a lacking "game" in every other aspect?\nI highly doubt that.\n\nBut maybe we should start at the beginning.\nYou play different members of house Forrester, a smaller noble familiy risiding in the very north of Westeros. You fight for influence and survival.\nLike in every other Telltale game you will make decision which  determine their fates. And while the previous games allowed some freedom, or atleast made you believe it, GoT doesn't even try.\nNo matter which decision you make, apart from a few cosmetic changes it all turns out the same. Luckily it gets better towards the end. In a game where you concentrate on the storytelling and makes austerities everywhere else... well you see where this is going. It just doesn't work.\n\nNow you may ask: "But what is lacking?"\nAnd my answer would be simple: "What is not lacking!?"\n\nGameplay is missing completly, what was a fresh take-on in TWD, is now showing it's ugly face. Pressing W from time to time to move forward or doing tedious Quick-Time-Event, which where already boring when they saw light in the 80's with the release of Dragon's Lair, are by no means gameplay or in any way entertaining.\n\nNow, I grant you that, this point is a matter of personal taste, but with a growing fund and a licence as big as GoT, I expected a better looking game. The comic style is charming sure and it was fitting for games like The Wolf Amongst Us.\nBut somehow I didn't feel the vibes in this interactive movie. Because, lets be clear, this is not a game!\n\nLast point of what lacking in this this self advertised adevnture game: Riddles.\nEvery task, riddle or whatever you can do in adventure games you have to find out by yourself. But not here. Everything has just to be clicked in no particular order and the story unfolds. There is simply no challenge.\nLet's make and example.\nYou want to get a super secret Sword of Awesome. But you have to make a jounrey as dangerous and treacherous as humanly possible p.s. Here is a map to guide you. Just click at it and you will eventually get there. See you later.\n\nNow that my rant is over I will give you a short list of positive and negative aspects.

Now, having finished it, I can say that it smashed my expectations and is without a doubt Telltale's best work yet. I have to say that I enjoyed this game's story and characters more than that of the show, which is an impressive feat since GoT is in my top 5 shows of all time. Throughout the course of the chapters I came to really care about house Forrester and in true Game of Thrones fashion, there were plenty of surprises and hard decisions to be made. Those looking for a contained story may be disappointed.

After the intro, the game will shove alot of decisions in your direction, if you like it or not. Some will be easy, others will not.\nI had no problem with the options in the story and the decisions you could make in a conversation.

I noticed that by Chapter 3, I was just picking the most aggressive option, with less consideration to optimising the characters choices as it led to the same outcome anyway.\n\nAnother problem that grated me isn't specific to this game but rather the genre. It's irritating that the game doesn't include options I would like because of either limitations in the game or because the developers didn't think to include them. The lack of meaningful choices, and complete omission of other options doesn't encourage empathy for the characters. Why should I care about this character, when they wouldn't even be in this situation had an option been available to me earlier?\n\nOf the dialogue choices available to me, it seems the player characters have a masochistic habit of paraphrasing the dialogue in such a way as to completely act counter to why I picked that dialogue option. NPCs tend to interpret my dialogue to mean the opposite of my intention, and it's not like I have the option to claify what I meant to make up for my characters stupidity.\nNPCs themselves act as a caricature of one or occasionally two traits. I've never known a character to mindlessly  seek unwinnable war like Ser Royland Degore  or completely ignore the importance of  displaying strength in a feudal society like Duncan Tuttle . You want to strike a balance between these two extremes? Forget about it.\nFor some of the antagonistic NPCs, their habit of acting with only one defining trait and perpetually misinterpreting me makes it impossible to predict their behavior or leverage the conversation in any way, making the endeveor pointless.\n\nSome of the things present in the game are completely nonsensical. For example: (Spoiler: Chapter 2) There's no earthly way the Freys don't check Rodrik is dead after the Red Wedding, notice he's alive when he's dumped on the cart, and even if they don't, it's impossible for Rodrik to survive a 100's of miles cart ride, next to corpses, in a bumpy cart without either bleeding out, starving or dying of thirst. Remember, it's HUNDREDS OF MILES . Another example: (Spoiler: Chapter 2)  House Tyrell has "significant ties" to House Glenmore, a minor house in the middle of nowhere in the North? Getoutta here.

Instead, I can tell you how I experienced this game, and what I think of it as a (Telltale) game. I shall not discuss any story spoilers, and this was written after having played the first episode, Iron From Ice.\n\nIn short: buy it. It's good.\n\nThe story (while confusing at times if you're not familiar with GOT) is immersive and the characters are likeable. You will soon realize that you will not be able to please everyone, and the characters in the game will respond to that. As for game design, I appreciate the fact that they were going for a more realistic look when it comes to the characters. The animations are still rather stiff and occassionally, I would find myself being distracted with the textures in the background (who would switch from sharp to blurry rather frequently).\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the lack of mouse sensitivity, and I did not see an option to change it in the options menu. While I managed to handle it so far, during action scenes or while making quick decisions, this could negatively affect what happens. I doubt it's my computer since all other Telltale games seem to have perfectly normal mouse sensitivity.\n\nBut yes, I look forward to playing the second episode. The first episode did enough to familiarize me with the world, my allies (?) and enemies, and set itself up for an intriguing sounding next episode. This is a good (Telltale) game, and so far my favorite of this year. I've only played 4 Telltale games so far, but perhaps it could eventually knock The Wolf Among Us from its first place.

However, after finishing the first episode, I feel disappointed.\n\nFor fans of the show, the story is a great extension to the Game of Thrones universe. However, so far it is mostly story and not much game. Other than making dialogue choices and a couple of QTEs, not much action is required from the player to figure out how to progress the game and none of the choices appear to have much significance in terms of shaping the story. Part of this could simply be because, unlike other Telltale titles, the episode is split between playing three different characters, and later episodes of the game will hopefully allow for more significant actions to take place now that the introduction is out of the way.\n\nI would recommend this for fans of Game of Thrones who are interested in the greater GoT universe because the story is fabulous and ensnares you emotionally. However, if you're looking for a game that is more than an interactive film, I wouldn't recommend this title so far.","December 21, 2014","false","9.4"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","27","50","3","0"

Not so.\n\nFirst of all, the most important element of any visual novel, the writing, is shoddy, dull, and repetetive. I didn't keep an exact count, but approximately one third of the lines are just variations of "this House is your responsibility now" or "our House is on the line here." Constant flat statements about the core of the story in the manner of a childrens' movie and the main cast of characters are such obvious one-dimensional copies of the Stark family to the point where it's comical. In addition, the dialogue options you're given are often so similar to each other as to feel pointless.\n\nFurthermore, the gameplay, and I use the term in the loosest sense possible, is terribly unengaging. The story is heavily railroaded during the dialogue segments and the actiony bits might as well have done away with the QTE-inputs altogether. Sure, this is how these Telltale games work, but previous titles have managed it much better. In The Walking Dead there were action beats where you could die because you'd forgotten to pick up a shotgun shell in the scene before, and the story progression would take breaks for you scavenge areas for supplies or have conversations with characters that fleshed them out. The Wolf Among Us didn't do much with its action sequences, but there you got to have "detective" scenes where you'd search a place for clues, and future dialogue scenes could change depending on what you found or missed. Game of Thrones does nothing like this. There are two or three scenes where you get to walk around and look at things, but they're frightfully empty of both fluff dialogue and quest objects.\n\nFinally, the graphics are dogshit, there's no way around it. I'm in no way a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but when your game is pretty much a semi-interactive movie, presentation is everything, and Game of Thrones is poorly presented. The models' movements are stilted and awkward, the facial animations of talking characters are badly desynched and characters who aren't talking spend a lot of time staring blankly into space rather than listening to and reacting to what's being said. Worst of all are the textures, which even on High look like they belong in a game from 2004, not 2014. I also found the voice acting to be really hit and miss, which is disappointing considering how on point it was in Wolf Among Us.¨\n\nAll in all, I think this is a bad game which reeks of being rushed out to soon. How the negative reviews on here can be outnumbered ten to one by the positive is a mystery.","January 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Since the release of The Walking Dead Season 1 and I am waiting eagerly for every new release of theirs.\n\nGame Of Thrones, the famous TV Series is getting a game from the amazing developers of Telltale Games. I, for myself never watched Game Of Thrones before. At first I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be drawn into the lore due to lack of knowledge but Telltale taught me otherwise. From the first moment forth I found myself mystically drawn into the world of GOT. I was not in any way familiar with the lore but Telltale managed to set me up for what was actually going on here.\n\nThis being Telltale's second release in two weeks (!) really hits the target of storytelling and immersion with a bullseye.\n\nSince this is an episodic game, I will write a review for the first episode now and expand the review as soon as the other episodes are released.\n\nEPISODE 1:\n\nEpisode 1 does a great job at drawing you in, which is pretty much what a beginning of a story is supposed to do right? Well it does it fairly well at that matter. The soothing britirish-accent of the voice actors really have something in my opinion.\nRemember Tales From The Borderlands that was released a week ago? It was good in my fair and honest opinion. But, and that is the point, it didn't have that Telltale WOW-feeling. It was funny, yes, but it was in no way as good as say, The Walking Dead.\nGOT is serious. Dead serious. Where you laugh in TFTB, you freeze in awe, staring at the screen, praying to the 7 lords of heaven that everything will turn out fine. Most of the time, it doesn't (Telltale loves to torment us). But this is where GOT really shines. The gameplay has little to no changes from TWD and TWAU. But in my opinion, it doesn't need any. I play Telltale Games' games because of the story and the interactivity, seeing my actions actively impact the forthgoing of the game.\nGOT is the kind of game that crashes into your home, slaps you in the face, then tells you it'll be alright, gives you a few loving characters and says "Here my boy/girl, hold them dear, friends are rare here". Then it makes terrible things happen one by one. I often caught myself praying to myself that the next part will turn out fine. Well, it will most likely not. But I love that. The last few moments of Episode one had my chin hit the ground floor and me sit in awe, having watery eyes because of desperation. Do I regret playing it? Not a single bit. This might even make it into my games of the year list. But due to the episodic releases, I guess that'll have to wait until next year.\n\n(Pros/Cons):\n\n+ Amazingly immersive world\n+ Impressive art design\n+ Ability to actively influence the outcome of any given situation\n+ Great Voice Acting\n+ Goes out with a "BOOM" and leaves you begging for more\n\n+/- No real "gameplay". Feels more like an interactive movie\n\n- Minor "beauty-flaws" (Some clipping or sometimes a weird bug in the dialogue audio. Nothing that can really draw you out though)\n- Episode 2 isn't out yet.\n\nSummary:\n\nI can not give my final opinion yet, since I've only roughly seen 1/6 of what Telltale has in store for us with this tile, but what I saw was absolutely fantastic. It of course is completely up to you if you like those kind of games. Everyone has their own ideals for the games that they want to play and that is totally fine, but for me this is absolute game of the year material.\n\nTelltale is love, Telltale is life\n\n-Zenix","December 2, 2014","true","11.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","2"

You'll spend about 2 hours with each episode, putting the game at about €2/hour which is twice of what I usually aim for.

This game is a story being told under the thin veneer of interactivity, but after multiple playthroughs it is clear that your “choices” are all superficial and utterly without consequence.\n\nThe gameplay itself is nothing but quicktime events or choosing from some dialogue options.  The combat is handled through quicktime events, but don’t worry, there is no penalty for dying; you get as many mulligans as you need.  The truth is that this barely feels like a game at all.  90% of this game is spent passively watching people have conversations, and then your character says something (or remains silent, since none of your choices matter anyway silence is a real in-game option) and then the game can go back to playing itself.\n\nEven despite these problems it’s almost worth it.  Almost.  The story IS interesting and well told.  If you want to be told a story that is pretending to be a game maybe you should buy this, you may enjoy it.  Unfortunately for me at least, the fact that none of your choices matter killed any interest I had in the game.  None of your decisions make any difference.

This house (as far as i know) is not canon, so the series of events within the game are not even legitimate within the world of Ice and Fire.\n\nPositives:\nPortrays the affects of the Red Wedding on a minor house, giving a bit more depth to the George R.R. Martin world\nMost of the Gameplay is quite simple, though this can also be seen as being negative\nEntertaining plot throughout the game\n\nNegatives:\nThe choices you make are quite limited, and often don't affect the game at all\nThe writers tried to make a lot of shocking deaths to emulate the TV show, but in my opinion went a bit too verboard and just seemed to want to create as much shock value as possible\nA couple of the Charecters you make choices for are extemely annoying, to the point were instead of wanting the character to stay alive, you end up willingly helping them meet their demise (for me this was Ethan)\nA lot of the choices you are given are the exact same as their counterparts, just rewritten differently\nNot all possible choices are reflected in the dialouge choice list, and I found myself wishing I could have said what I wanted, and that often would have saved lives\n\nAll up, this is a good game if you're heavily invested in the ASOIAF lore, but otherwise I'd just give it a miss","December 20, 2015","false","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I couldn't think of anything that would be a good addition to the Game of Thrones series, but in the end I was seriously surprised. The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense - every decision you make either gets you into some deep ♥♥♥♥ or in even deeper ♥♥♥♥.. If you ask me TTG did another masterpiece, it feels just as punishing and twisting as the series itself. I don't want to tell any more so I can avoid spoiling you guys.\n\nThere are only few downsides. Let's start with the smallest. If you are sensible to blood and/or to painful decisions, don't play this. Ripping someone's heart out is just not a thing everyone is cool with.\nAlso there are minor (!) bugs. For instance characters not being correctly loaded and them readjusting after 1/2s of you seeing them.. Or Eyes doing weird things every now and then. Emphasis on minor because I did not experience a single gamebreaking glitch - not even a single crash. And I'm not even sure whether said bugs only appear due to my weak graphics card. Nevertheless if you buy it, please keep in mind this game (like all TTG story games) focus on the story instead of graphics - some people don't want to buy such games because of the mediocre graphics, although it's one hell of an unique experience .-.\n\n\nAll things considered I think this is a great addition to the GoT series. The price is completely reasonable and it's one of the most unique experiences I ever had in a video game!

The game is more interactive cutscene than game proper, albeit given its strong focus on narrative its the better route. The story is tied into the lore of the Game of Thrones HBO series, and incorporates many of the crucial cast, albeit alongside House Forrestor and the Whitehills the main cast of characters actually seems one dimensional. The ironic twist, and I'll avoid spoilers, is that you are basically introduced to house Forrestor....a house which shares much in common in character personalities with the Starks of Winterfell...yet they explore a different means to an end. Returning to technical standpoint, the game is underwelming in this regard and seems like a budget title given the options (although it clearly wasn't).\n\nAs many have noted, and as is par for Tell Tale games....the plot is on fixed rails, you are given the illusion of choice, but it is an excellent illusion...people seem to struggle with the concept that true freedom in a heavily narrative driven story isn't feasible  in modern games, unless said game exists in an open world (Skyrim seems to be the poster child for this), yet the narrative suffers as a result. You can't have both, you either have a concise and well thought out plot with choice of illusion or an open world free to explore world where the main plot seems somewhat vague (although that being said, Skyrim is one of the few games to actually have some level of tight narrative, albeit fragmented by progression).\n\nIn conclusion I give a full recommendation for this game for both fans of the HBO series and fans of player choice games (ex Dragon Age, Mass Effect etc.), although it definitely does benefit when you have knowledge of the lore of the Game of Thrones universe.\n\n....also obligatory......\n\nIRON FROM ICE!","November 21, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Things were doable. I had confidence. By episodes 3-5 I started becoming frustrated that absolutely nothing I did seemed to have any impact whatsoever. But I kept hoping that it would all turn out in the end. I still had some confidence. When it all went to ♥♥♥♥ in episode 6 I thought to myself "well OK, I guess I made really poor decisions." I wasn't too surprised by this because in GoT you have to be ruthless, and I always try to play the nice "noble" way. However after doing some research I found out that there are only about 4-5 major decisions throughout the entire game that actually matter. And even then, they really don't. At least not in this game, and at this point I don't even want to play the sequel. No matter what decisions you make, the end of the game is 99% written in stone to set up the sequel. This is unforgiveable and as a result it was one of the most frustrating "games" I have ever played, once the illusion of choice wore off. NOTHING you did had any consequences.\n\n***SPOILERS***\nAs Mira, nothing you do in King's Landing ever comes close to helping your family. Even finding out about the conspiracy against your family, trying to make deals with your family's ironwood, trying to get help from Margaery, Tyrion, and even Cersei at one point. Absolutely nothing prevents Mira being brought down and eventually choosing between a false marriage and execution at the end of the game.\n\nAs Gared, he wanders off to the North Grove which is made up to be extremely important, and the power you find there will surely help the Forresters. No. Wrong. We finally get there by episode 6 and you know nothing about it by the end of the game except for that it's run by crazy blood magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of Lord Forrester and it will probably fall eventually. Again, no consequences seen in this game.\n\nAs Asher, you spend your time trying to gather an army for your family and no matter what choices you make, the best you can do is bring back about 6-7 sellswords and yes, still have the gall to call it an "army" as you arrive at Ironwrath. At this point in the game I was just dumbfounded. Yeah, these 6 dudes will surely fight off the entire Whitehill army. Except that the game makes you think you can!! When you're about to get attacked, the plan is to lead the army into your walls and fight them off 300-style, and this will be after killing Ludd, so they will be "scattered" and unorganized. Yes, there was still hope!! No, none of that happens. Even if you try to defend the gate, and after killing Ludd, Ironwrath gets stomped into the ground. Nothing you do saves Ironwrath. Yes, some of the Forresters can survive, but by the end of the game you just feel like you've been ♥♥♥♥ on a thousand times.\n\nBecause of the GoT universe, I was definitely expecting some unfair circumstances to play out. But to this level... You never had a chance. You get ♥♥♥♥ on in every scene. Everyone sees through your lies within 1 second of opening your mouth. Every time you think you've finally triumfed, the next scene has you realise you're just digging your grave deeper, or you just don't ever see the consequences of that decision, they are simply swept under the rug. There is no hope. There never was. A very disappointing game. Go play Wolf Among Us instead.","February 8","false","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unless you very much want the GoT setting, you'd be better off with literally any other of their recent games (I recommend Walking Dead season 1 or the amazing Tales From The Borderlands).\n\nThe lower-than-usual production value hits you in the face the moment you open the game: The menu is extremely laggy, even on my GeForce GTX 970 (the game itself is less choppy but still poorly optimized), and visual glitches are everywhere. I haven't the faintest clue why they didn't allow even basic configurations, such as V-Sync, which could have eliminated most of them.\n\nThe story is very ambitious and has some really good ideas: You're following the scattered and relatively well-written characters of a noble family in trouble, as they band up and try to ensure the family's future from each their own place in the world. I feel for those characters and one thing the game does really well is to face you with extremely tough choices to protect your own and mitigate horrible consequences, from a position where you are an utter underdog and can't rely on the plot to send you a happy ending. In some ways it's not as satisfying as being able to succeed more thoroughly, but I respect the kind of experience and choices they've built.\n\nWhen I still have so great reservations with the game, it's because worst moment of all the other Telltale games just seem so much more common in this one:\n- Those moments when you feel you've done everything right and they have to magically make your character lose all intelligence and/or power of reasonable speech to, outside your control, still conjure a catastrophic ♥♥♥♥up from thin air and put you back on the railroad disaster track (e.g. "killing someone in self defense, as an absolute last resort, and being completely unable to discuss that fact with any other character as they condemn you for murder", "setting an ambush for a vital target, taking precautions to make sure they can't defend themselves and suddenly (without warning or choice) your character turns out to not have locked the door or had a single person guard it".\n- The times when you intended to do one thing and the game interprets it in a completely different way with permanent consequences. (e.g. "someone asks you to play the game well and keep up appearances, but the moment you appease that person's enemy with empty words, the first person interprets it as a mortal insult and loses all trust for you").\n- And those times when you just don't have a choice, for no particular reason (e.g. "Your friend has just done you yet another huge favor at major cost to themselves and understandably announces that this has to end and and they have to cut ties with you now" - why are all my responses variations of being utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and completely ungrateful about it?)\n\nWhile the writing also brings many excellent experiences, they are way too quick to just ignore the characters' personality and/or own intelligence to force a railroaded outcome, or sometimes for no reason at all. I understand that someone may be evil, but when they're a skilled manipulator, capable of warm interactions and forming strong connections with people, there's just no rational or true-to-character reason to let them suddenly go "No, we'll never cooperate, find mutual benefit or even establish any sort of liking in this partnership! (because I'm so bad a person that siding with me is somehow supposed to suck so much that you sacrifice your own happiness forever)".\n\nBeyond this, the entire thing seems to be a build-up for a sequel that I guess will never come. On its own, this game does not provide a conclusion, some plots turn out to never tie with anything else (like how you'd feel if GoT were to end with Dany never leaving her island and getting involved with the rest of the plot) and the expectation of a sequel means that your choices are being warped and railroaded to the very end - though they could have been free to let you better shape your outcome in the last episode.\n\nI like some of the experimentation, audacity and style differences. Still, there are many better Telltale Games you'll want to play before considering this one, and even then be prepared for a lot of frustration mixed in with the experience.","March 14","false","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You immediatly get sucked in the story and you feel a need to protect your house/clan even tho you know nothing of it to begin with. Think twice before you make a decision or you'll sit there with your jaw down on the floor like I did by the end of episode 1.

Do you make decisions, tough decisions? Yes. Do those decisions "matter"? No, the story will go on very much the same way they will no matter what you do. Does that matter? Well, your mileage may vary. Personally I enjoyed Episode 1 very much, it was engaging, well written and it played with my emotions just like all good stories should. And that's just what this is, a story, a visual and interactive story but a story with pretty trappings and little else.\n\nThat said you WILL enjoy this infinitely more if you have seen the show and/or read the books as I have. Is it worth getting if you're not familiar with the material? That depends on how much you like Telltale's format. I found myself tailoring my decisions based on what I already knew was going to happen to the canonical characters, you may find this interesting or distracting, I found it a bit of both.\n\nVisually it is pleasing enough. It has an "oil on canvas in motion" quality to it, but it isn't gorgeous and it isn't perfect. There isn't much action to be had and what little there is in Episode 1 centers around the squire, Gered. Honestly though, if you're getting into this for the visuals or flashy action sequences you're probably barking up the wrong tree. Like I said, this is a story and a damn good one.\n\nMy play time (2.6 as of the writing) is about what you can expect if you take your time, read everything, do everything and ruminate for a bit on the decisions that don't require you to make a snap judgement. If you blow through everything expect to clear it in half the time. But do you skim a good novel? No, you savor it, you may re-read a passage here or there. Personally, I can't wait for Episode 2 but know this isn't for everyone and read well about the mechanics of Game of Thrones before you pull the trigger.","December 7, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

And Telltale is the natural choice to do it at this point. They were probably terrified they'd mess up this hugely popular franchise. They managed not the embarass themselves, but they also didn't create anything amazing.\n\nFocusing on a single family unknown to the books or TV show was a smart move. It allows for guest appearances from the famous characters without depending on them. And using a family from the North was also smart, as it parallels the story of the Starks.\n\nThe early episodes are fun and exciting and made me care about the Forresters. The problems began in later episodes - when the pace should have been picking up I just felt helpless to actually affect anything. The ending is truly awful. It turns out none of your earlier choices matter and most of the last episode is just sequel-bait. The problem with a game like this is that it's the sort of game where your decisions should[/] matter and have a lasting impact. But there's no way to win any of the situations the game presents, even if you replay it with perfect knowledge. You can only lose, and that doesn't feel good. It's not the same as feeling a negative emotion, it's bad in a suspension-of-disbelief meta way.\n\nSo the game is worth playing if you're a GoT or SoIaF or general Telltale fan. But you have to play it for the journey and the experience at the time, not with the ending or the results of your actions in mind.","November 25, 2015","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

When they really don't. No matter what you choose, no matter what happens, you always have more or less the same conclusion. And in this installment, the conclusion is always you getting screwed over. Like, at all times. You always lose, no matter what. The game has a very bad habit throughout everything of doing a terrible job conveying the situation. Throughout the entire game, I was told I didn't have enough men to do anything. Yet, the enemies have plenty of soldiers, and I seem to have enough to drive th eplot forwards.\nAnd, the source material was just too good, and they didn't do anything with it. So many characters from the show were woven in, but only to make them not important in the end. The characters exclusive to the game were nice, but I didn't really buy the game wanting something "Like Game of Thrones" I wanted more or less the same thing. In the end, the plot amounts to nothing more than semi-canon fanfiction. They had so much they could have done with it, and if they took the time to make the games more detailed, perhaps I wouldn't have this big of a gripe. But you can't influence anything! You can't start wars, you can't choose to kill or save certain people, nothing. Everyone meets the same fate at the end, and the game tells you to just suck it. Too be honest, if you want a game that changes to your choices, you're better off playing Dungeons and Dragons.\nOn the flip side, maybe you're not looking for a game. Not a challenge, not a way to accomplish anything, but maybe you're looking for something to entertain yourself with. If you're just looking around for a slightly interactive movie with random quick-time events, Telltale is your place to go, and this game does a great job. I didn't get the atmosphere of Game of Thrones from this game, but it gave off an atmosphere of its own, to be honest. I liked the story, despite it barely being able to call itself a "Game of Thrones" story.\nIn conclusion, if you want a fun thing to do, buy the game. It'll be fun, I assure you, but only if you're really JUST looking for something fun because its intruiging. If you're looking for something to do in the challenging or engaging department, I'd reccomend a Telltale game where choices somewhat matter (Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us) or just saving the money. And who knows, maybe Season 2 will be better.","November 25, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a fun game with a awesome story. A must for any GoT fan and the price isn't bad at all.\nGirl vs Game: Game is awesome but here I'd pick the girl.\n\nPersonal Comment:\nThis is an amazing storyline but the gameplay is very basic. Had awesome fun playing the game but because it is TellTale it is a game you can only play through once. So like all TellTale games not a lot of re-playability. But considering the low price point I really don't mind. Get ready to have your jaw dropped, letting out gasps of air and randomly shouting out very bad words at shocking moments as per the standard GoT style. So make sure your mom and children arent close by while playing this.\n\nOnline gaming:\nN.A.\n\nShort Summary:\nThis game takes place in the world of Game of Thrones. You play as various characters from a newly introduced family, 'The Forresters" that is not part of the Television series. You play in all areas using the different characters such as Kings Landing, The Nights Watch, Winterfell, etc. Most of the characters from the TV show are in the game as well and this gives the game that real GoT feel. The scenery and setting of the game is really stunning and it feels that you are lost in the world of GoT. The game time is a bit short at approximately 2.5 hours per episode which ends up at approximately 15 hours of gameplay.\n\nLearning Curve and Gameplay:\nAs easy as kissing a fat drunk girl/dude and you're the only dude/girl there. The game is played in a 1st person / 3rd person perspective and is basically a point and click game. So it is extremely easy to play this game even if you are completely new to PC gaming.","November 26, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The artwork is fine for TTG games, the voices and the soundtrack are both top notch. The writing gets a bit repetitive after a while but it's okay. Could have been much better but I cannot forgive the last chapters because they are worse than TWD season 2 chapters.\n\n\n\nI don't generally write reviews for games but I think this one deserves it.\nLook, I'm a huge fan of Telltale's (played Wolf among us and TWD season 1 & 2 before playing this title) and I absolutely love the ASoIaF universe. As such, I was thrilled to play with a lesser house trying to survive in this cruel world and I knew that (as with all Telltale's games) you are given an illusion of choice rather than significantly altering the outcome. I'm fine by this if the characters are fleshed out and the dialogue intertaining.\nEpisodes 1 and 2 are pretty good and Episode 3 is probably above average. However the last three episodes (and especially the last one) feel rushed with little to no clarification of what's going on SPOILER SPOILER (especially considering the North Grove/Gared arc). It's just like they were doing stuff for the sake of doing it but without advancing the story further.\nThe season 1 finale was probably the worst game ending I have been through in the last 5+ years of gaming. I wasn't hoping for a happy ending (it's the Game of Thrones after all) but really... it just doesn't feel like a finished product. At this point, I feel cheated, having bought the game during the first episode, waiting a year or so to complete it and now I have to wait season 2 so I can have some answers? This is a ♥♥♥♥ move by TTG imo.\nCompare for instance with TWD season 1 finale: the ending was bittersweet. Yes, it left some questions open (answered by TWD season 2) but it was a satisfying finale. This game just doesn't deliver. It fell short.","November 30, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The artistic style is very easy on the eyes and the game play mechanics are simplistic enough for anyone to pick up and still feel rewarding when you're successful.\n\nIn my opinion, this particular addition to the Telltale Series is by far my favorite. Many may disagree and they entitled to as all the Telltale Games are phenomenal in their own rights but this plays close to my heart for a few reasons. It plays true to the source content with the general vibe, feeling, and flow. The immersion is amazing and reminds you the kind of world ASOIF is.\n\nThis game I'd recommend to any fan of the TV series and books. However, DO NOT play this game until you are up to date with the events of the show or books.

You have to be OK with sitting through some dialogue and scenes where not much happens. You just have to understand that the game is completely atmospheric, and the point is to make you feel connected with the characters. This goes for all TellTale games. While there are some parts of the story where there is not much action, the actions scenes are completely BA and will make it worth it. TellTale is my favorite publisher because their games really make you think and ask yourself, "What would I do in this situation?". If you are worried about buying this game and not liking it because you don't watch the show or read the books, that's OK (neither did I). You don't need to know much, but I would suggest looking up the outline of Game of Thrones online so that you can fully understand things that are said and done in this game.","November 21, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, I liked the Gared narrative the best.\n\nOk, the thumbs up got a little stronger with Episode 5.\nThis episode restored some balance to the game and added a real meaningful choice at the end.

At first I couldn't think of anything that would be a good addition to the Game of Thrones series, but in the end I was seriously surprised. The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense - every decision you make either gets you into some deep ♥♥♥♥ or in even deeper ♥♥♥♥.. If you ask me TTG did another masterpiece, it feels just as punishing and twisting as the series itself. I don't want to tell any more so I can avoid spoiling you guys.\n\nThere are only few downsides. Let's start with the smallest. If you are sensible to blood and/or to painful decisions, don't play this. Ripping someone's heart out is just not a thing everyone is cool with.\nAlso there are minor (!) bugs. For instance characters not being correctly loaded and them readjusting after 1/2s of you seeing them.. Or Eyes doing weird things every now and then. Emphasis on minor because I did not experience a single gamebreaking glitch - not even a single crash. And I'm not even sure whether said bugs only appear due to my weak graphics card. Nevertheless if you buy it, please keep in mind this game (like all TTG story games) focus on the story instead of graphics - some people don't want to buy such games because of the mediocre graphics, although it's one hell of an unique experience .-.\n\n\nAll things considered I think this is a great addition to the GoT series. The price is completely reasonable and it's one of the most unique experiences I ever had in a video game!

Martin's A Game of Thrones series. Immediately you're placed into one of the most heart wrenching events of the book and television series, The Red Wedding. Telltale proves their writing chops once again as in a short span of time they give you everything you need to feel for characters before they're killed off in the most classic manner that Martin would approve of.\n\nThe scenery has a beautiful painted feel to it and the action scenes are high in their intensity. Though short enough as to not fatigue you before coming to a satisfying conclusion. Even the combat feels dirty and visceral which is what I would find to be suitable for the setting.\n\nI completely approve of this title to anyone who is a fan of Telltale games and A Game of Thrones.\n\nPlay your part in the game.","December 2, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only about 3 choices actually matter in the entire game.\n\nWe have a franchise built on plotting, scheming, people making more or less honorable decisions and seeing their actions with the movies/books. So you'd expect things to carry on here too. At least at a basic level, right? Wrong. The game has a fantastic way of ignoring many of your decisions or finding some totally unrealistic way for your enemies to bypass them. Take in mind that some characters, like Ramsey Snow, also have plot immunity, so they can't die, so their influence in the setting is something you can't change at all or even alter.\nThus, you have moments when your enemies enter your fortress against higher forces, you have someone surviving at the end (even two people actually) just to continue the story for one an who knows how for the other when he had been pinned down. We never find out what the North Grove actually does by the way, just getting this out of the way since this is a major point from the very first chapter in the first episode.\n\nThe game also does a lousy job at remembering some decisions. Did you let a crow brother live even if you hate him? Well bad luck, he still died and you're still to blame! Did you tell your sister to take care of herself? Well no, the recap of the last episode remembers you telling her to watch out for traitors.\n\nBut what I disliked most was the ending. It's not a true ending, it's more of a "see you next season". Remember The Walking Dead? Lee died and it was his story, it ended, the next season was about Clementine and how she grew up. Remember The Wolf Among Us? Well, our dear wolf had a case to solve, he solved it. They all had good moments and bad ones, but the story felt at least mostly ended.\n\nWhat was the deal here? Well, seeing what happens with the Forresters and finding about the power at the North Grove. Since the story was left in a tree for many of the Forresters and you didn't find anything about the North Grove besides the fact that there were people there (oh, gee, what a surprise), I found this to be ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention that I don't think there's any true good moment in here. There's disaster after disaster, whenever you think something is going good, surprise, your enemies get super plot powers and everyone on your side is incompetent!\n\nThe game has great visuals, at least I really liked some landscapes and some characters are truly believable in how they act. Pity the other side usually gets superpowers and does miracles since then the whole story goes to ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI do not recoment this game, this is not the standard Telltale has given us before, it's worse. If you like Game of Thrones, get it at a discount.","December 1, 2015","false","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jebreject/recommended/330840/","jebreject","fabuloushouseboat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jebreject/","112 products in account","There are elements of Telltale's Game of Thrones that are good, but overall it's kind of a convoluted mess. The main problem is that it's got the worst narrative elements of the show--having to balance multiple POV characters in varying locales, making it incredibly difficult to feel any particular emotional connection to one character or another. This makes some of the choices you're presented with feel rather empty, and it prevents the game from even approaching the emotional intensity of The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us.\n\nWith regard to choices, a lot of folks seem to be complaining that their choices don't "matter"; that is, they don't change the overall plot. This doesn't really bother me, because I don't expect them to. This is an adventure game afterall. What I do expect is that the choices are difficult and emotionally affecting. As noted above, the narrative structure of the game can work against the choices feeling profound, but there are a number of decisions through the series' six episodes that do really stick with you.\n\nWhile the game does a pretty good job of fully fleshing its POV characters, the villains are one-dimensional and cartoonish, and the guest appearances from series regulars largely feel forced. The game has interesting implications for the GOT?/ASOIAF universe due to some of the events of the last episode, but of course there's always the question of whether the story will even be considered canon. (That said, it does seem to be canon in the universe of the TV show.) Ultimately, I am interested in seeing if the North Grove shows up at any point in either the books or the show.\n\nIt's hard to say whether I recommend this game or not. I feel like it was an interesting experiment on Telltale's part, but it's one that's largely unsuccessful. Hopefully they will learn from their missteps here and the inevitable sequel will not be such a mess. Still, I did enjoy playing it, even as I found the endless POV changes a bit gruelling. I could see fans of the show going either way on it--it expands the show's universe in a potentially important way, but it can be a bit of a slog to play. Telltale diehards will likely be disappointed, but will get a lot out of seeing what works and what doesn't. In the end, it's a pretty big disappointment after the highs of The Walking Dead seasons 1 and 2 and The Wolf Among Us. I wouldn't recommend buying it for full price, but if you catch it in a sale, it's worth your time.","November 20, 2015","false","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not just in terms of theme and fateful moments, almost a trope of their own at this point, but also by stringing you along for as long as possible seemingly without ever reaching a conclusion. It's no surprise then that Telltale is set to release a second season of its Game of Thrones episodic game.\n\nThere is, of course, something to be said for your characters being victims in a world of more powerful and influential figures and authorities. That is fine, up to a point, but it stops being interesting once you reach Idiot Plot levels of restrictions on your actions. As Roger Ebert explained, an Idiot Plot 'is any plot that would be resolved in five minutes if everyone in the story were not an idiot'. Far too often the game offers up dumb choices that are all bad ideas under the circumstances - or leaves out the option of taking the kind of action that would resolve the situation in the character’s favour. Because the game offers no actual gameplay, its dialogue options cannot offer you the means by which to succeed outside of the narrow pre-set path defined by Telltale. Doing so would mean the conflict Telltale has sketched out would never come to pass, and that has to be prevented - even if it means turning your characters into what might well be the least clever House of Westeros. It's often hilarious because the Forresters have mastered the art of failing, but also frustrating and ultimately not very rewarding.\n\nThe graphics are limited, but more crucial in a game like this is that the facial expressions Telltale has managed to create lag far behind what LA Noire was able to accomplish years ago, making the conversations that are the game's only meaningful content unconvincing.\n\nNot recommended.","December 25, 2015","false","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Things were doable. I had confidence. By episodes 3-5 I started becoming frustrated that absolutely nothing I did seemed to have any impact whatsoever. But I kept hoping that it would all turn out in the end. I still had some confidence. When it all went to ♥♥♥♥ in episode 6 I thought to myself "well OK, I guess I made really poor decisions." I wasn't too surprised by this because in GoT you have to be ruthless, and I always try to play the nice "noble" way. However after doing some research I found out that there are only about 4-5 major decisions throughout the entire game that actually matter. And even then, they really don't. At least not in this game, and at this point I don't even want to play the sequel. No matter what decisions you make, the end of the game is 99% written in stone to set up the sequel. This is unforgiveable and as a result it was one of the most frustrating "games" I have ever played, once the illusion of choice wore off. NOTHING you did had any consequences.\n\n***SPOILERS***\nAs Mira, nothing you do in King's Landing ever comes close to helping your family. Even finding out about the conspiracy against your family, trying to make deals with your family's ironwood, trying to get help from Margaery, Tyrion, and even Cersei at one point. Absolutely nothing prevents Mira being brought down and eventually choosing between a false marriage and execution at the end of the game.\n\nAs Gared, he wanders off to the North Grove which is made up to be extremely important, and the power you find there will surely help the Forresters. No. Wrong. We finally get there by episode 6 and you know nothing about it by the end of the game except for that it's run by crazy blood magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of Lord Forrester and it will probably fall eventually. Again, no consequences seen in this game.\n\nAs Asher, you spend your time trying to gather an army for your family and no matter what choices you make, the best you can do is bring back about 6-7 sellswords and yes, still have the gall to call it an "army" as you arrive at Ironwrath. At this point in the game I was just dumbfounded. Yeah, these 6 dudes will surely fight off the entire Whitehill army. Except that the game makes you think you can!! When you're about to get attacked, the plan is to lead the army into your walls and fight them off 300-style, and this will be after killing Ludd, so they will be "scattered" and unorganized. Yes, there was still hope!! No, none of that happens. Even if you try to defend the gate, and after killing Ludd, Ironwrath gets stomped into the ground. Nothing you do saves Ironwrath. Yes, some of the Forresters can survive, but by the end of the game you just feel like you've been ♥♥♥♥ on a thousand times.\n\nBecause of the GoT universe, I was definitely expecting some unfair circumstances to play out. But to this level... You never had a chance. You get ♥♥♥♥ on in every scene. Everyone sees through your lies within 1 second of opening your mouth. Every time you think you've finally triumfed, the next scene has you realise you're just digging your grave deeper, or you just don't ever see the consequences of that decision, they are simply swept under the rug. There is no hope. There never was. A very disappointing game. Go play Wolf Among Us instead.","February 8","false","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I couldn't think of anything that would be a good addition to the Game of Thrones series, but in the end I was seriously surprised. The story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense - every decision you make either gets you into some deep ♥♥♥♥ or in even deeper ♥♥♥♥.. If you ask me TTG did another masterpiece, it feels just as punishing and twisting as the series itself. I don't want to tell any more so I can avoid spoiling you guys.\n\nThere are only few downsides. Let's start with the smallest. If you are sensible to blood and/or to painful decisions, don't play this. Ripping someone's heart out is just not a thing everyone is cool with.\nAlso there are minor (!) bugs. For instance characters not being correctly loaded and them readjusting after 1/2s of you seeing them.. Or Eyes doing weird things every now and then. Emphasis on minor because I did not experience a single gamebreaking glitch - not even a single crash. And I'm not even sure whether said bugs only appear due to my weak graphics card. Nevertheless if you buy it, please keep in mind this game (like all TTG story games) focus on the story instead of graphics - some people don't want to buy such games because of the mediocre graphics, although it's one hell of an unique experience .-.\n\n\nAll things considered I think this is a great addition to the GoT series. The price is completely reasonable and it's one of the most unique experiences I ever had in a video game!

This house (as far as i know) is not canon, so the series of events within the game are not even legitimate within the world of Ice and Fire.\n\nPositives:\nPortrays the affects of the Red Wedding on a minor house, giving a bit more depth to the George R.R.

Not just in terms of theme and fateful moments, almost a trope of their own at this point, but also by stringing you along for as long as possible seemingly without ever reaching a conclusion. It's no surprise then that Telltale is set to release a second season of its Game of Thrones episodic game.\n\nThere is, of course, something to be said for your characters being victims in a world of more powerful and influential figures and authorities. That is fine, up to a point, but it stops being interesting once you reach Idiot Plot levels of restrictions on your actions. As Roger Ebert explained, an Idiot Plot 'is any plot that would be resolved in five minutes if everyone in the story were not an idiot'. Far too often the game offers up dumb choices that are all bad ideas under the circumstances - or leaves out the option of taking the kind of action that would resolve the situation in the character’s favour. Because the game offers no actual gameplay, its dialogue options cannot offer you the means by which to succeed outside of the narrow pre-set path defined by Telltale. Doing so would mean the conflict Telltale has sketched out would never come to pass, and that has to be prevented - even if it means turning your characters into what might well be the least clever House of Westeros. It's often hilarious because the Forresters have mastered the art of failing, but also frustrating and ultimately not very rewarding.\n\nThe graphics are limited, but more crucial in a game like this is that the facial expressions Telltale has managed to create lag far behind what LA Noire was able to accomplish years ago, making the conversations that are the game's only meaningful content unconvincing.\n\nNot recommended.","December 25, 2015","false","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Martin hasn't delayed his book for no reason, because it takes time to accomplish something truely unique. This is just a game about NPCs, even if they're a noble family. Nobody cares about NPCs and that's why this game is not a worthy addition to the lore, if it is even considered such.\n\nThe only really good thing about this game was we combat scenes with Asher Forrester in the later game. Kept me excited, yet the other parts, the politics, were so boring on the other side that it's just a small patch on the otherwise patchwork.\n\nPlease, consider fast forwarding in your future games, even if you don't get to tell the story you intend to deliver. It's sometimes easier, especially when the bloody game crashes after a false save and I have to relive certain scenes over and over again just before I try a rewind on the chapter.\n\nMy final statement: if you are really thirsty for Game of Thrones, you'll get your Valar Morghulis. If you are a fan of good storytelling, even from Telltale, you'd be better off without this game.","February 4","false","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not just in terms of theme and fateful moments, almost a trope of their own at this point, but also by stringing you along for as long as possible seemingly without ever reaching a conclusion. It's no surprise then that Telltale is set to release a second season of its Game of Thrones episodic game.\n\nThere is, of course, something to be said for your characters being victims in a world of more powerful and influential figures and authorities. That is fine, up to a point, but it stops being interesting once you reach Idiot Plot levels of restrictions on your actions. As Roger Ebert explained, an Idiot Plot 'is any plot that would be resolved in five minutes if everyone in the story were not an idiot'. Far too often the game offers up dumb choices that are all bad ideas under the circumstances - or leaves out the option of taking the kind of action that would resolve the situation in the character’s favour. Because the game offers no actual gameplay, its dialogue options cannot offer you the means by which to succeed outside of the narrow pre-set path defined by Telltale. Doing so would mean the conflict Telltale has sketched out would never come to pass, and that has to be prevented - even if it means turning your characters into what might well be the least clever House of Westeros. It's often hilarious because the Forresters have mastered the art of failing, but also frustrating and ultimately not very rewarding.\n\nThe graphics are limited, but more crucial in a game like this is that the facial expressions Telltale has managed to create lag far behind what LA Noire was able to accomplish years ago, making the conversations that are the game's only meaningful content unconvincing.\n\nNot recommended.","December 25, 2015","false","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Things were doable. I had confidence. By episodes 3-5 I started becoming frustrated that absolutely nothing I did seemed to have any impact whatsoever. But I kept hoping that it would all turn out in the end. I still had some confidence. When it all went to ♥♥♥♥ in episode 6 I thought to myself "well OK, I guess I made really poor decisions." I wasn't too surprised by this because in GoT you have to be ruthless, and I always try to play the nice "noble" way. However after doing some research I found out that there are only about 4-5 major decisions throughout the entire game that actually matter. And even then, they really don't. At least not in this game, and at this point I don't even want to play the sequel. No matter what decisions you make, the end of the game is 99% written in stone to set up the sequel. This is unforgiveable and as a result it was one of the most frustrating "games" I have ever played, once the illusion of choice wore off. NOTHING you did had any consequences.\n\n***SPOILERS***\nAs Mira, nothing you do in King's Landing ever comes close to helping your family. Even finding out about the conspiracy against your family, trying to make deals with your family's ironwood, trying to get help from Margaery, Tyrion, and even Cersei at one point. Absolutely nothing prevents Mira being brought down and eventually choosing between a false marriage and execution at the end of the game.\n\nAs Gared, he wanders off to the North Grove which is made up to be extremely important, and the power you find there will surely help the Forresters. No. Wrong. We finally get there by episode 6 and you know nothing about it by the end of the game except for that it's run by crazy blood magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of Lord Forrester and it will probably fall eventually. Again, no consequences seen in this game.\n\nAs Asher, you spend your time trying to gather an army for your family and no matter what choices you make, the best you can do is bring back about 6-7 sellswords and yes, still have the gall to call it an "army" as you arrive at Ironwrath. At this point in the game I was just dumbfounded. Yeah, these 6 dudes will surely fight off the entire Whitehill army. Except that the game makes you think you can!! When you're about to get attacked, the plan is to lead the army into your walls and fight them off 300-style, and this will be after killing Ludd, so they will be "scattered" and unorganized. Yes, there was still hope!! No, none of that happens. Even if you try to defend the gate, and after killing Ludd, Ironwrath gets stomped into the ground. Nothing you do saves Ironwrath. Yes, some of the Forresters can survive, but by the end of the game you just feel like you've been ♥♥♥♥ on a thousand times.\n\nBecause of the GoT universe, I was definitely expecting some unfair circumstances to play out. But to this level... You never had a chance. You get ♥♥♥♥ on in every scene. Everyone sees through your lies within 1 second of opening your mouth. Every time you think you've finally triumfed, the next scene has you realise you're just digging your grave deeper, or you just don't ever see the consequences of that decision, they are simply swept under the rug. There is no hope. There never was. A very disappointing game. Go play Wolf Among Us instead.","February 8","false","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would have recommended if I had written a review then. It is a fun game with good premise, faithful to the TV series (and, in some cases, even better).\n\nThe reason I write a negative review is that the basic premise of the game has turned out to be false: your choices don't matter at all. The whole plot runs on tracks and if you try to leave the railroad, the universe will stretch and bend in most horrific ways to keep you there. The characters will behave irrationally to force a specific outcome, their accomplishments will get ignored, failures will turn out not to be that bad after all.\n\nSome examples (spoilered):\n\n\n1. Didn't manage to secure a betrothal which would give you warriors necessary to fight your antagonist? Your beloved will come anyway, stealing twenty elite soldiers from her father like they were robots that can be hacked.\n2. Succeeded spectacularly in Essos and got rewarded with a chest of gold? It's only enough to hire less than a dozen barechested former gladiators, half of whom die five minutes after reaching Westeros.\n3. Don't want to fight the murderer of your family when on the Wall? He'll attack you himself. It appears that despite everyone being on guard because of Mance Rayder marching on the Castle Black, no one hears two people screaming and hacking each other with swords. Everyone thinks you're guilty, even if it means disbelieving the only witness of the fight that even doesn't like you.\n\nI still want to see how the Season 2 will unfold, but I don't have much hope after what I have seen.","February 13","false","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Spoiler-ish and less of a review, more of a downpour of heart blood.\n\n****\n\nI feel deceived.\n\nIt finally dawned on me in the last episode that everything you do in this game always turns to poop. Up to that point, I had the feeling crossed off as Martinesque harshness and kept hoping that eventually one of the characters I'm rooting for is going to pull through and save the family from ruin, but no. Honourable and ruthless, admirable and abominable, all my tough decisions were harshly punished, never rewarded. I went from assured to hopeful to desperate - and when even my hope for vengeange ran away from me and my disbelieving curses through barred gates and guards with an axe in his back and lived, I altogether stopped caring.\n\nIn a way, it is refreshing to encounter a story that puts you in your place as a lowly human, not an indomitable hero predestined for a happily-ever-after. Just someone trying to scrape by like the rest. I mean, maybe I deserved this for taking flowery endings for granted.\n\nBut it doesn't make for a rewarding experience, when you're told your decisions matter and in reality, you'll be dunked in the dung pile no matter what.

This time they have created an original story based in George R.R. Martin's hugely successful ASOIAF. Telltale have outdone themselves by recreating how HBO's Game of Thones plays out using actors from the TV series as voice actors helping you to immerse yourself in the world of Westeros. They have created what is basically an interactive episode of Game of Thrones by using the exciting situations you would find in the show. They have done a great job of ending on a high note just as the series always does.\n\nIn this game you control different characters from a Northern house, House Forrester. The members of this family are seen in many of Westeros' famous settings allowing you to see everything the world as to offer from Kings Landing to The Wall and Essos. Your rival House, House Whitehill, seeks to claim your family's reknowned resource Ironwood for themselves and you must use anything you have to stop them.\n\nPROS:\n-Original story\n-Relatable and interesting characters\n-Exciting endings\n-Great recreations of the World\n-Actors from the show\n-Exactly like how Game of Thrones would act\n-Great Choices\n\nCONS:\n-It was hard to find any cons to this game. The only thing I can think of is the background graphics. The charaters looked amazing up close but the background graphics, while not a huge problem to me, were washed out unlike the other Telltale titles.\n\nI highly recommend that anyone who is interested in ASOIAF and Game of Thrones should buy this game.

What a joke.\n\nThe game is presented as "choose your own adventure with better graphics," but literally only one thing that you do in the entire game actually matters. You spend HOURS picking minor variences in dialogue while the game constantly insists "Tyrion will remember that," "Margaery will remember that," etc. But they don't remember and it never matters.\n\nFor example: as the current Lord Forrester, the entire family insists that I MUST retain my betrothal to a neighboring house because House Forrester is militarily vulnerable and requires allies. Through your dialogue choices you can keep or lose your betrothal. It seems important at first, but just a couple chapters later your fiance shows up with soldiers even if you failed and she bailed on you, offering, by way of explanation: "Somebody I don't like proposed to me, so I changed my mind."\n\nIt didn't matter.

The game falls short to the superb writing of the book and the great dialog of the show. Even counting with some of the show's actors. The voice acting for the characters original to the game where great but the actors of the show seemed to be just playing along, not really that interested in the game or what was happening in it.\nThe game follows different members of the Forrester family on different quests, a new lord of the house, an exiled brother who must return home, a girl at queen Margaret's service and a squier send north to the wall. But the story never takes off, it always seems like it's leading up to something that never comes and it also falls short to the original game of thrones story where big things are happening all the time and we get to see a LOT of different sides to it.

It is mildly fun, and, unlike many Telltale copycats, every episode has always something to fill it up, to make it a concise story that always has something going on for it.\n\nHowever, this game suffers a lot, and I believe this is something common to the genre (that I find to have an interesting concept, even though being not approachable to me due to all of these limitations nonetheless). The truth is, this is nothing but a linear plot with some dialogue options that bear no major influence to anything in the end; your story is basically the same as the ones other players experience. Apart from some little details that make no considerable changes to the narrative, Game of Thrones is a live-rendered flat story that gives you the possibility of sometimes choosing dialogue and enduring not-at-all creative quick time events.\n\nBelow I expand more on some of my thoughts on this game.\n\nPros:\nBeautifully drawn scenery and backgrounds. It reminds me of a more crude version of Pillars of Eternity’s artwork.\nDecent voice acting. I still noticed something bad going on on a few voice tracks due to bad recording and bad compression. Anyway, not stellar, but a good job still. Oh, and the music is alright.\nVery long episodes (except that last one). I feel satisfied every time I finish a few episodes and find out that it is 5 AM and I should be sleeping because my life starts at 6. If I want to play a story-based game, I don’t want it to only take thirty minutes of my life for every episode. I want it to be filled with a lot of content and stuff happening all the time. This game does this pretty well.\nCons:\nForced plots everywhere. Also, you don’t have the option to do many things only because the game doesn’t want you to.\nAlmost all characters are extremely boring.\nYour choices make no difference. To be short: It doesn’t matter what you choose, the end results in the story are always going to be the same. Few exceptions are made. There are virtually no ramified paths in this story whatsoever.\nMany graphical glitches here and there. Unlike most people, I don’t think the character models in this game are hideous. They’re not stunning, but they get the job done. Still, there were even moments where entire character models didn’t load properly.\nWhat is up with their faces? Why can’t Telltale Games stop their characters from grinning, widening and squeezing their eyelids uncontrollably? And I can’t help but notice how the background characters are just standing there, flat-faced while such theaters occur before them. Most of the time even their postures are all the same.

Overall the experience wasn't on the same level as say Telltale's The Walking Dead Season 1 & 2 but was enjoyable and a good way to spend a few hours every couple of months. Now that the full season has been released I feel obliged to give my experience of the game.\n\nThe game started off really strongly, with the first few episodes having me on my toes just waiting for what happened next but the excitement and compassion I felt for the characters in the story slowly declined as the season progressed. The illusion of choice is still present from previous Telltale games, as is the formula, but this time I was really disappointed to see some of the major choices the game presented me with having little to no major effect on the story, especially when it should have been impactful.\n\nThis leads me to the ending of the game. Here the endings start to verge off from one another, much like at the ending of Season 2 of The Walking Dead, but the cliffhanger it ends on gives no resolution to the entirety of the game. I view this as a blatent money making opportunity on the behalf of Telltale. I do however understand that they are a company and their goal is to make money but I would be happier to purchase a continuation of this season if they had executed the ending better.\n\n(I'll also mention the length of the wait between episode 5 and 6 was ridiculously long, which helped to lose a great deal of tension in the story. at least for me it did)\n\nDespite the ending and the long wait I will give Telltale credit where credit is due:\n- The visuals were fantastically suited to the style of game\n- The story, while slow in places, was pretty enjoyable\n- The cast of characters, both playable and non playable, really made the game for me and were thrilling and never dull\n- Actually getting actors from the show to voice act their character in the game made it feel so much more engaging and authentic\n- The length of each episode, hence the entirety of the game, was very much appriciated and made for an enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall the game has it's ups and downs but still managed to give an authentic feel to the world of Ice and Fire.\nRecommeded for fans of Telltale and/or Game of Thrones\n","November 18, 2015","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I will... need to play this through again. So many choices. So little advice. Tense, edge of your seat action when all you're doing, for the most part, is... responding to dialogue options. Smart writing, every bit on par with the novels or the TV series. Excellent production values. Entertainment for days.\n\nHOWEVER, and I feel I must in good conscience caution you all... if you are the type who try for a "perfect playthrough" where you make all the "right" decisions, this game will be your undoing. Morning may find you huddled over your monitor, your clothing in rags, your nails long and your hair unkempt, chanting to yourself, "but the other option, precious... what if we chooses it?

So many more permutations. What if I choose option 3 this time? Will it be different? Will I find happiness for these characters?\n\nYou will not. This is the world of George R.R.

I'm a great fan of the Song of Ice and Fire. The TV series is quite enjoyable, but the game is great in every inch of it. It is a game for a single run, but the feeling after beating episode is overstanding. Telltale Games always amused me with great games, they are always one run, there is no need to rerun, because you will be probably disapointed with the alternative choices.\nThe story is enojoyable for someone with basic knowledge, but in my opinion it is not noob friendly(fresh starters), because you won't know the characters and when and after what events the game takes place.\nI hope that in the next episodes there will be more "fantasy" stuff added. Although the story is predictable for someone that knows the books or is up-to-date with the TV series, it's amusing.\nGameplay is nice, as always in Telltale Games Series, you are able to sometimes "explore" the place before advancing the story. By the word explore I mean that you can look around you, pick something that might be useful later(next episode maybe). Be aware that this game is something that you mainly watch. This is more like interactive movie.\nThe main thing in this game is that you create the story that you want to see, there will be consequences of your actions, so you need to be prepared, that sometimes "good" answer is not the best one for some moments.\nI recommend you to atleast watch the TV series before playing this game. It will be a better experience for you to know the universe where you are thrown, because the game takes place in 4th season I guess.\nConcluding I want to encourage you, to learn something about the song of ice and fire(game of thrones) before playing this game, because you won't be pleased with it.\nI hope that my review is readable xD.

The story is as close as it gets to a GRRM-level plot, without having the man directly involved himself in the writing.\n\nThere are surprises aplenty, and characterisations, that get you really involved.\n\nStory-wise, my only complaint is that the Forrester family feels like a palette-swap of the Starks at times. They are still their own personalities, but you still have the southron widowed Lady who was married to a honorable, strong northern Lord, etc.\n\nThe graphics are admittedly bad, which at times can be distracting, but overall, a very enjoyable experience that I would recommend playing if you are a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire universe.","March 29, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Never have I clenched my butt so much throughout an episodic story-driven game.\n\nIt helps (a lot) to be knowledgeable on the series/GoT universe, be it watching the TV show or reading the books; but you can still enjoy the game as its own story. The characters, the plot-twists, and the semi-illusion of control over the decisions one can make are all executed extremely well.\n\n\n“When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.”\nUp until the release of this game, you could only watch as beloved and hated characters play this "game of thrones", but now you can truly feel like a part of it, making the decisions yourself gives you a sense of presence in the medieval dystopian fantasy world. However, this isn’t the best aspect of the game; in my opinion the best thing about this game is the writing. Like I said in the opening line, this game had me on the edge of my seat every single episode, something that I was surprised it was able to pull off. I became immersed with each character’s storyline, each character’s successes and failures, it felt so authentic.\n\nThe portrayal of the main characters in the series was excellent. Cersei, Danaerys, Ramsay, Margaery; the way each of these played into the Forrester's storyline was seamless. I hate Ramsay, love Khaleesi, and admire Margaery just as much in this game as I do in the TV show. BUT they weren’t represented well enough to steal the thunder from the true stars of the game: House Forrester. Mira, Rodrik, Asher, Gared and all the others were all incredible characters to play as. I became so engrossed with each character’s personality that I actually made decisions based on what I thought they’d choose, not what I’d choose.\n\nWith that said, I tried to keep everything under control in the game, which proved much harder than I thought. Every antagonistic character made it extremely hard for me to feel satisfied with any given situation, which I think is fairly befitting for GoT.\nEach episode that I played was more unnerving than the last, ultimately leading to reactions I never thought I’d have (like screaming out of surprise, hands over mouth and genuine cringing). Right as you think something’s going well or in the direction that you planned, the game hits your with some rock hard reality and pins your back down onto the ground.\nI appreciate that, because what’s the fun in playing a game where everything goes as you want it to without a challenge?\n\nThe stress, the sadness, the happiness, and every emotion in between is what you’ll go through when playing this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're already familiar with the GoT world, but I recommend it to those looking for an entry into the complicated world of A Song of Ice and Fire .","December 29, 2015","true","47.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There is very little game play. You walk around in a very rigid fashion, looking at very obviously highlighted bits and pieces, while occassionally being forced to mash this button, or press this button to avoid being bludgeoned (I'm never ready for it).\n\nSo why is it good? Because, it's a story (and a good one). Like all recent Telltale titles, the narrative is king...and as a Game of Thrones (and ASOIAF) enthusiast, the game captures brilliantly the messed up world created in the other mediums, and tells a story not before told.

Allow me to explain, and fair warning, this review will contain major spoilers.\n\nOn the game of thrones side, the setting and timing was great. It takes part just after the red wedding, and puts you in the place of a family whos entire life was turned upside down from this. Stroke of genius. In one fell swoop we have our conflict, and fits damn well within lore. But from there we start to slip. we're introdced to the importance or ironwood, our main commodity. We're told how important it is, and because of it just how important our family is. Every character in the game treats us with some level of respect because of this (or at least will lend us an ear), but often in ways that make little sense. We encounter many characters from the books/show, but they feel weird, and often their power doesn't gel with their position. For example, john snow has seemingly way too much sway at the wall for the time period, or Ramsey just outright being untouchable (though this is as much a fault of the show as it is the game. Difference is here I have control)\n\nAnd here is where we get to the telltale side. I understand with these games, to an extent you're always on rails, but it feels agregious here. Far too many times it doesn't matter what you do, the outcome will be the same. And the game isn't even subtle at times about this, with some very weird transitions that left me yelling angrily at the screen (My favourite one being "I made specific safeguards to make sure this DIDN'T happen! Where the ♥♥♥♥ did they go?"). This unfortunately left me feeling cheated, and all my actions cheapened by the end (I even tested it, you big choice at the end of chapter 5 actually maks suprisingly little difference, just a few scenes get swapped around). This may be because I've played a fair few of telltale games, and recognise the formula. But it's never been this obvious to me before. And that's the sad part for me.\n\nAnother major issue is at times you don't understand the weight of certain actions. The biggest example being (and this is a massive spoiler comming, you have been warned) when you finally get to the north grove. You spend 5 bloody chapters finding it, and when you do, all you're told is it has "Power", and all you see is a dozen or so people defending it from wights. I played the final chapter 3 times now, and I have no idea why the north grove is important. I don't understand what the power it has really is, and as such I am incapable of making informed decisions involving it. Now this was the worst example of this, but there are many more in the game.\n\nOverall though, do I recommend this game? Yes. It is a flawed game, no doubts there. And at times you may feel frustrated or cheated. But the story and characters are interesting, the scenarios you're forced to deal with get you genuinely thinking, and when it hits the mark, boy does it hit the mark. Just a bit strange that I feel I recommend this game more the less you know about GoT or telltale.","November 17, 2015","true","14.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Perhaps that is just the setting or maybe it's a reflection of bad storytelling and deliberate railroading disguised as giving you choices. It was filled with loose ends that never got tied up and I feel that it's meant to have a sequel.

Because, it's a story (and a good one). Like all recent Telltale titles, the narrative is king...and as a Game of Thrones (and ASOIAF) enthusiast, the game captures brilliantly the messed up world created in the other mediums, and tells a story not before told.

I do recommend getting it on sale but that's true of any game. If you like Telltale's style definitely give this a try.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nMemorable characters - even the ones you spend very little time with matter to you enough that it will still make an impact to see them go.\n\nEngaging gameplay - following TTG's format and mechanics but not necessarily repetitive, probably the one I've been more strongly forced to pay attention to if I didn't want to miss a command. Makes it much less dull than more forgiving Telltale games.\n\nGood story - no dead moments, makes you want to push forward without needlessly excruciating cliffhangers (though I may be at an advantage for playing it all after the finale was out).\n\nAmazing art style - fits incredibly well with the setting and honestly doesn't clip any more than any other Telltale game does, which is already not that much (for anyone who doesn't demand unattainable perfection).\n\nPotential negative points:\nThere's a lot of character death, it's not a happy story by any means. Not sure what else you'd expect given the source material, though.\n\nThere's quite a lot of gore, might be off-putting even though the art style dulls it quite a bit (at least enough for me, and I'm squeamish).\n\nBeing into the series already means you know who's alive in canon so you know if they're gonna survive which might make a few decisions obvious or seemingly pointless, but it's not the majority and it doesn't ruin the game.\n\nSome choices seem to be bugged.\nOther notes:\n\nI've played other Telltale games I was more invested in that ended up disappointing because they felt pointless in the end, like what you did either didn't matter or like what you thought was going to be important ended up not being brought up again, or a character getting completely ignored or have their development thrown out the window. I didn't get that feeling from this one, and it's refreshing.\n\nBesides, you don't need to know a single thing about the universe to enjoy this and really get invested.\nI've never seen a single episode of the show or read a single page of the books, I just enjoy Telltale's style of storytelling and gameplay enough to give all the more recent games a try.\n\nSome negative reviews say the fact that this builds up to a season 2 is a bad thing, but seeing as we'll actually get one I don't see what the problem is.

This game came out riding in the TV show's wave of popularity. The choices you make don't matter all that much, the final outcomes end up being pretty similar to each other no matter your style of gameplay. Even the dialogue repeats itself most of the time and characters react to you much the same way no matter which side you pick.\n\nIt also felt recycled, even, like every character in the game has its counterpart in the main series, especially after the last episode. Seriously, you can swap the names of characters from this game with the book and you basically know how everything ends. It's not even a spoiler anymore. I think that they put all the effort they could to make you feel that this is a Game of Thrones game that it's too much like a Game of Thrones game, so it ends up being simply boring.

They just can't. They can't keep taking our beloved franchises, turn them into storytelling videogames and make those GOOD. Or can they?\n\nTelltale's (TT) newest installment features the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, more commonly known as Game of Thrones, made popular by HBO's TV series. By now, you should be familiar by the way TT approaches gameplay, artstyle or how their games are split up into a number of Episodes being released in 1-2 month intervals. It should as no surprise that you will only have access to Episode 1 of this season, and by extension this review will focus on only that. This review will be spoiler-free for the actual games, but contain some spoilers from Seasons 1 through 3 for the TV series.\n\nGame of Thrones - A TT Games Series puts focuses on the story of House Forrester, a lesser northern house that served the Starks for centuries and in return enjoyed their protection. When the War of the Five Kings broke out, however, the lands of Westeros became ravaged and the old order was more or less destroyed. The Northmen face their own problems as the Boltons seize power, backed by the Lannisters and King Joffrey.\nWhat makes TT's game special is that it allows you to experience all those major events from a perspective you do not usually get much insight in. You, the protagonist(s), are not a global player in the overarching storyline. You have your own problems to deal with and are very much a subject to the whims of those more powerful than you. This alone makes playing the game worth it for hardcore fans as well, who might fear just "replaying what they already know". While the game needs the main plot to establish its setting, it strays from it enough to develop its own, complex story.\n\nDifferent to other TT games, you get to play as multiple characters, very much in the style of the books and the show. All of these characters, so far, are members or peers of House Forrester, though. And don't worry, you will get to make plenty difficult decisions and, as usual, there is very rarely a black-or-white-dichotomy. Will you do the honourable thing, even if it means hurting those you care for or will you lie and cheat to protect your family? The choice is yours and it remains to be seen how much of an effect they will have on the rest of the season.\n\nA special treat for fans of the show would be the inclusion of major characters from it - designed to match their TV counterparts and voiced by the actual actors. Although it is unlikely that the player's choices will have much of an effect on the main plot, it will be exciting to see how these new characters play into it.\n\nThe only downsides are that, again much in the style of the show, there is much establishing to be done before the plot can really kick off. Because of this, the first episode comes across as a little choppy, with frequent jumps between characters, often throwing you right in the middle of things. Those who know absolutely nothing about Game of Thrones will find themselves overwhelmed by the unexplained yet important things that happen around you. This being said TT's take on Game of Thrones is worth a solid recommendation for hardcore- and casual-fans alike.","December 2, 2014","true","23.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Very excited to see where it goes from hereon out.\n\nPros:\n- The voice acting is real solid and has the show actors voicing their game counterparts.\n- The story is massively engaging and takes place at the same time as the show/books.\n- The characters are well-fleshed out and believable, with House Forrester fitting the game world perfectly.\n- The graphic style is very refreshing and more realistic than the previous Telltale games, without going uncanny.\n- A lot more attention to the sound and music than in earlier TT titles, sounds of pouring wine, cups being put down, birds and other little things make a huge difference in terms of immersing yourself in the game.\n\nCons:\n- That nagging feeling that whether you choose A or B the outcome is still C, but at least the C will be a different color.\n- Some weird character movement/pathing when you click on things to make cutscenes begin, will probably be fixed.\n- The artwork, while absolutely gorgeous, relies a little too heavily on the new "oil painting" style they've developed, making things look unfocused and washed out a bit too much at times.\n\nAll in all a really solid experience, best first episode of any Telltale game to date.

I will... need to play this through again. So many choices. So little advice. Tense, edge of your seat action when all you're doing, for the most part, is... responding to dialogue options. Smart writing, every bit on par with the novels or the TV series. Excellent production values. Entertainment for days.\n\nHOWEVER, and I feel I must in good conscience caution you all... if you are the type who try for a "perfect playthrough" where you make all the "right" decisions, this game will be your undoing. Morning may find you huddled over your monitor, your clothing in rags, your nails long and your hair unkempt, chanting to yourself, "but the other option, precious... what if we chooses it? What if, precious?" Your friends and family will shun you. Neighbors will recoil in horror. Cats and other small animals will back away in fear. But will you turn away? No, you'll say. So many more permutations. What if I choose option 3 this time? Will it be different? Will I find happiness for these characters?\n\nYou will not. This is the world of George R.R.

I'm a great fan of the Song of Ice and Fire. The TV series is quite enjoyable, but the game is great in every inch of it. It is a game for a single run, but the feeling after beating episode is overstanding. Telltale Games always amused me with great games, they are always one run, there is no need to rerun, because you will be probably disapointed with the alternative choices.\nThe story is enojoyable for someone with basic knowledge, but in my opinion it is not noob friendly(fresh starters), because you won't know the characters and when and after what events the game takes place.\nI hope that in the next episodes there will be more "fantasy" stuff added. Although the story is predictable for someone that knows the books or is up-to-date with the TV series, it's amusing.\nGameplay is nice, as always in Telltale Games Series, you are able to sometimes "explore" the place before advancing the story. By the word explore I mean that you can look around you, pick something that might be useful later(next episode maybe). Be aware that this game is something that you mainly watch. This is more like interactive movie.\nThe main thing in this game is that you create the story that you want to see, there will be consequences of your actions, so you need to be prepared, that sometimes "good" answer is not the best one for some moments.\nI recommend you to atleast watch the TV series before playing this game. It will be a better experience for you to know the universe where you are thrown, because the game takes place in 4th season I guess.\nConcluding I want to encourage you, to learn something about the song of ice and fire(game of thrones) before playing this game, because you won't be pleased with it.\nI hope that my review is readable xD.

I do recommend getting it on sale but that's true of any game. If you like Telltale's style definitely give this a try.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nMemorable characters - even the ones you spend very little time with matter to you enough that it will still make an impact to see them go.\n\nEngaging gameplay - following TTG's format and mechanics but not necessarily repetitive, probably the one I've been more strongly forced to pay attention to if I didn't want to miss a command. Makes it much less dull than more forgiving Telltale games.\n\nGood story - no dead moments, makes you want to push forward without needlessly excruciating cliffhangers (though I may be at an advantage for playing it all after the finale was out).\n\nAmazing art style - fits incredibly well with the setting and honestly doesn't clip any more than any other Telltale game does, which is already not that much (for anyone who doesn't demand unattainable perfection).\n\nPotential negative points:\nThere's a lot of character death, it's not a happy story by any means. Not sure what else you'd expect given the source material, though.\n\nThere's quite a lot of gore, might be off-putting even though the art style dulls it quite a bit (at least enough for me, and I'm squeamish).\n\nBeing into the series already means you know who's alive in canon so you know if they're gonna survive which might make a few decisions obvious or seemingly pointless, but it's not the majority and it doesn't ruin the game.\n\nSome choices seem to be bugged.\nOther notes:\n\nI've played other Telltale games I was more invested in that ended up disappointing because they felt pointless in the end, like what you did either didn't matter or like what you thought was going to be important ended up not being brought up again, or a character getting completely ignored or have their development thrown out the window. I didn't get that feeling from this one, and it's refreshing.\n\nBesides, you don't need to know a single thing about the universe to enjoy this and really get invested.\nI've never seen a single episode of the show or read a single page of the books, I just enjoy Telltale's style of storytelling and gameplay enough to give all the more recent games a try.\n\nSome negative reviews say the fact that this builds up to a season 2 is a bad thing, but seeing as we'll actually get one I don't see what the problem is. Better than unresolved eternal cliffhangers, and this one is actually a hopeful one, not just disorientingly open and vague.\n\n\nTL:DR:\n\n7.5/10\n\nPeople need to stop demanding the impossible from choice-based games, this does everything it can to be able to fit in canon and still give you options.\nIt's honestly good, and it will make you angry but definitely in a way that will make you want more.

A review is a personal opinion so bare that in mind.\n\nGame play wise this is standard tell tale, with similar point and click mechanicsa and conversation trees as Walking Dead or the Wolf Among Us. Similaly the graphics and presentation are standard tell tale as well, same pros same cons.\n\nThe main problem for me has been the story of the game. I have played through all of the game apart from the last chapter of the last episode, the reason why I gave up so close to the end was because of the story. Every desicion I have made has lead to a terrible consiquence, I chose to be honest a couple of times, I got slapped for it, I tried to be clever, I got slapped for it, I tried to be brave, I got slapped for it. Just when I thought I was making head way in helping house Forester, there was a twist that through me further into trouble. Now you may be reading this thinking, but of course it is like that, its Game of Thrones, not My Little Pony, I like the books, I liked the show, the difference is I am not making the desicions for the characters in the books, I am not dealing with misery upon misery upon misery, with no end in sight. The worst part is the Ending, which I looked up after I gave up the story.\n\nPersonally I would not recomend this game due to the simple fact that I feel cheated. This is not a story, this is a guilt trip  simulater, every single little desision you make, every word that leaves your mouth leads people to get offended or take advantage. If you want to play a Stark family simulater, then be my guest I will not be coming back for season 2 because, well they have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ season 2.

The first five parts were pretty good. It was a bit disappointing that your decisions don't actually effect anything (at least in the first episode, I never bothered replaying the others) but that's really true of any Telltale games (probably their biggest fault in general) and yet hasn't negatively effected my enjoyment of their other stories.\n\nThe second last episode ended with a tremendously difficult decision which seemed like it should dramatically effect the final chaper and left me feeling excited to see what they would do with it. Then after months of waiting for the final part I had sort of lost my immersion in the story and when I finally did get around to playing it, I found the ending chapter extrodinarily underwelming. The ending left me feeling bored, helpless, and just tired of being a loser. There were no characters which I really bonded with. It all felt like a lot of sacrifice and loss for nothing. I get that GRRM kills a lot of characters in his books and his characters suffer a lot but that is not the single element which makes his stories so compelling and yet it seems to be the only thing the show and this game took away from it. The story has to be gritty and real without simply being depressing.\n\nI love games with a good story and I enjoy the interactive movie style of gameplay.

Don't wanna kill that guy?  Then don't...but OOPS well you get the blame and punishment anyway!

The story is very Game of Thronish and some might not find it fun to be humiliated and killed by your arrogant enemies (despite any choice you make).\n\nAlso Telltale is losing it's grip in this. Most decisions you make do not have effect, but one of the largest choices you make in the game at the end of season 4 (or was it 5) that DO have that effect is just a simple CHOICE between A and B!!!! It could have been the end result of multiple choices you made before in the game.

And it's not only great canon wise. It maintains the very spirit of the books and tv series: You like it, it probably dies. You never know when death comes raining down. The only thing I disliked was that the part that transpired at the Wall was very simmilar to what happens to Jon Snow, although that is over quickly and the rest is original again.

Main characters from the show will apear and you can interact with them (but never play as them) and it even goes as far as to use the shows opening titles sequence. This means as such the game has spoilers from the television show in it, the game takes place through the events of series 4 of the show, so it is best to have watched series 4 before you play.\n\nThe game is seporated out into six episodes this time rather than the ususal five, which is fitting as it is a game of two halves. The first three episodes are done very well with lots of setup which leads to a great mid series finale at the end of the third episode.\n\nThe thing is thats the good parts over, from episode 4 onwards it starts to go down hill and doesn't recover. To be blunt the Forresters are the Starks. From episode 4 to the end you will watch as each Forrester is killed off one by one. The choices you make to try and save people don't matter as the bad guys will win. I realised this part way through episode 5 which made episode 6 a chore to play through. I will give them credit though, they do a good job of giving you hope that maybe you might actually succeed in something before undoing all your plans and again killing off characters.\n\nThe game has four playable characters and you switch between them as they are all in different locations, but come the end I only had one character left. The main plot point that is set up at the begining of episode 1 is meaningless and isn't resolved and has no impact on the story what so ever. You're supposed to find this 'North Grove' and you spend all five episodes searching for it and when you do find it the game ends.\n\nThis is a game where your choices are meaningless, the bad guys will ultimatly always win and deaths are just in there for shock value. This is Telltales worst output so far and I can't recommend it at all. There is a series 2 for whatever reason, everybody's dead so unless they wan't to start off with another new family there isn't much they can do.","January 2","false","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game came out riding in the TV show's wave of popularity. The choices you make don't matter all that much, the final outcomes end up being pretty similar to each other no matter your style of gameplay. Even the dialogue repeats itself most of the time and characters react to you much the same way no matter which side you pick.\n\nIt also felt recycled, even, like every character in the game has its counterpart in the main series, especially after the last episode. Seriously, you can swap the names of characters from this game with the book and you basically know how everything ends. It's not even a spoiler anymore. I think that they put all the effort they could to make you feel that this is a Game of Thrones game that it's too much like a Game of Thrones game, so it ends up being simply boring. Nonetheless, it's an okay title for fans of the genre and the series.

I have played all the other Telltale Games before ( except Jurrasic Park: The Game , dont like the Films so wasnt interested) and i got to say they got better and better. This might explain why my Expectation has been quiet hight especially because i like the Medieval age Fantasy Theme in general and the Game of Thrones Series in particular.\n\nAfter starting The First Episode from Game of Thrones, the first thing i noticed has been the strange Fact that the Graphics is looking much worse then the one in Tales from the Borderlands. The characters are looking much less detailed , much more artificial. The Graphics in generel look much more " blurry " , " flickering edges " and "squishy Textures " often ruins what could have been nice views and the whole thing just feels like a giant step back compared to The Tales of Borderlands. Maybe they have done it to give that Game a " painted " Look , but i got to say its horrible and didnt work for me.\nI could deal with such Problems , because the biggest Point about Telltale Games isnt the Contolls or Graphics, its all about the story that " should" carry you away and make you wondering after hitting the "leave Game " Button how much time you just spend listening to that great Story.\nNot in This Game though , as i said, i am a Fan of Game of Thrones and i m aware that getting into the story and the complex " history " George RR Martin has created for his Game of Thrones Universe can take some time. But although beeing aware about that , i got to say this Telltale Game adaption makes me feeling bored nearly all the time while playing it (so far). I didnt even finish Episode 1 but playing it felt like an eternity and i catch myself looking at the Clock on my Wall quite often while playing.\n\nAs I said , I only played Episode 1 of this specific Telltale Games Story Adventure and normally i dont do reviews in generell and especially not whithout finishing the Game. But whith this Game i am afraid right now , that i couldn`t "soldier through" the hole Thing before getting mad at it an stop playing it entirely. If the following Episode/s are able to catch me and deliver the Telltale Story flow that i love, i will change my Verdict about this Game but so far i could only advice you to buy Tales from Borderlands , The Walking Dead  and The Wolf among us ( in that order) if you want to try a Telltale Game Story Adventure.\n\nNow the only Thing left for me is to excuse myself for my bad English ( rubbish basic German school English...) and if you couldn`t stand it , it might has given you at least something to laugh about ^^.\n\n\n* Update 26.03 *\nThis is simply the worst Telltale Games Game ever to my opinion. They dont even try to hide that the decisions you make got no impact on the Story. An Example....\n\n*little spoiler alert* : At the End of Episode 1, i took the decision to make the Soldiers of a potentially hostile Lord stay out in front of a closed Gate an wait there. I have decided to do so because i was alrdy sure that meeting could only End in a slaughter. But only minutes after deciding all that , suddenly during the Conversation these Soldiers that should be outside the Gate enter the Great Hall. That doesnt make sense , isnt explained and feels like someone just spit in your face. Telling you that it doesnt matter what you decide it wont make any impact on the Story at all.\n\nI played Epsiode 2 because i wanted to know if the only Person missing during that Great Hall meeting might have been a Traitor who has opened the Gate for the Enemy, but no , later hes sitting there in the Council absolutly fine with everybody. At that point i had to stop before getting too angry. Maybe that gets solved later in the Game , but i just got the Feeling that it wont.\n\nI regret spending my Money on this one , and can only recommend this Game to die hard Game of Thrones Fans not beeing offended if the Story didnt Respect your decisions at all. And willing to play only a little side part in that Game of Thrones Story which makes that " unimportant " Feeling even worse.\n\n\n*Update 09.04* :\nI just finished Episode 3 , Had to shout at the Screen a couple of times. Another decision not to kill a specific Character has been already proven pointless again just by watching the " coming next " trailer. In this Game , it doesent matter if you light torches or decide about life and death , the Story will go one like planed, anyway.\nI will be sooooo relieved after finishing the last Episode, close the Game , uninstall it and hopefully forget about its existence or the Fact that i was paying money for it.\n\nJust started Episode 4 , couldnt even take the first minutes. Just like i thought , during a quicktime event i choose to cut someones arm insted of stabbing his chest. Episode 4 starts with the typical "what has happend in last Episode" Trailer and suprise suprise , you see your charater stabbing the other guys cheast , although taking a different decision.............\nThis Game really spits in your Face how worthless you and your decisions are. I was never ever so angry at a Game in my Life , shame on you Telltale , shame on you.

There really isn't a great way to explain how truly meaningless all of your choices are in this game without going into spoiler territory... but basically you'll just find again and again and again that when you're given choices between who to pledge loyalty to, or whether to uphold commitments you've made, or whether to play ruthlessly or with honor... none of it ever matters.

And the Starks are dead.", after the death of its lord and first-born son, the Forresters are terribly weakened, having the fourth-born son (Which is still a kid), Ethan act as the lord of the house, since all of his older simblings are away.\nMuch to the Forresters dismay, their rival family the Whitehills desire the Ironwood, which is their livelihood economically and culturally, and while they do know how to craft ironwood strong, and without wasting any ironwood in failures, the Whiteruns eat at the ironwood trees at an alarming rate, destroying all of the Forrest that they had.\nWorse yet, their lord is a bannerman for the Boltons, the new Wardens of the North.\n\nThis is without doubt a situation where many citizens, even your family will die. What will you make of the few resources that you have after the war to survive the Whitehills? When they take one of your own, will you fight back and take your revenge? Or will you accept to serve them at the risk of being forever their slaves, and the destruction of your ironwood trees?\n\nWill you follow your duty to the Forresters with unwavering will even if it means betraying a friend?

By the end of the final episode, I didn't really care what happened to House Forrester.\n\nBackgroundYou play various characters of House Forrester, a House not really mentioned at all in the novels or the HBO series. They're Northerners, allied with the Starks, but with little power. The family is spread out across the world, so you get to see places you will recognise if you've followed the series at all - King's Landing, Meereen, etc. The timeline you play in is between the Red Wedding until slightly after the Purple Wedding.\n\nPros+ You get to meet familiar faces from the series - John Snow, Tyrion, Cersei, Daenarys, Ramsay\n+ They got the real actors to voice their counterparts in the game\n+ Interesting history behind House Forrester\n+ Characters of House Forrester are pretty well designed and developed overall\n+ Some nice plot twists, but nothing mind-blowing\n\nCons- Your choices don't really matter. Most deaths and events in the final episode are not preventable, no matter what you do in the first 5 episodes.\n- The graphics aren't good, especially the backgrounds. Trees and ground textures look strange and not detailed.\n- The opening theme song/animation, which was so-well done in the HBO series, looks weird and poorly rendered in the game.\n- It's a shame you can't meet more characters from the TV series.\n- Events in the novels/TV limit what the writers can really do for House Forrester. For example, options like trying to attack or offend Ramsay Snow will never turn out well because he's a main character, so you know there's no way to really do much against him.\n- A few story points that are mentioned in the game, especially the North Grove, are never properly explained.","November 18, 2015","false","13.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you've played Walking Dead Season 1, then basically it's the same exact thing except with Game of Thrones as the setting, with the exact same choices as the rest of the Telltale games as of late. It makes you feel like the choices have a big deal but all they do is change some lines of dialog, BUT THE STORY NEVER CHANGES AT ALL DESPITE THEM TELLING YOU IT WILL.\n\nBUT HEY, LET'S MAKE A GAME AND JUST COPY THE STARK FAMILY FOR THE MAIN CHARACTERS BUT LET'S CHANGE THEIR NAMES AND MAKE 90% OF THE THEM VAPID AND SHALLOW. By the time Episode 6 rolled in I just wanted all of them dead, especially the one that resides in King's Landing where they give you a few chances to live, and there wasn't a timer on the dialog choice so they wanted to guilt trip you, but screw it I wanted her dead not because it was honorable, it was because the writing was garbage for her and honestly she deserves to die for being so stupid. Same thing with notcatelyn stark, and really all of them that I didn't hesitate to not save them from dying. Trust me, you'll have sympathy for the notstarks at first, and by the end of it you'll turn into a psychopath that just wants everyone in this game to die in the most horrible way possible.\n\nAlso because the story is set right after the Red Wedding in Season 3 and plays out during Season 4, you already know what happens plot wise in the whole ASOIAF universe, and yes they do have you interact with major characters in the TV show so if you're caught up to date with GOT/ASOIAF books, YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM, like they tried to tempt me Episode 5 into trying to kill Ramsay Bolton and they shame you for not killing him when they had the chance, but SURPRISE, IT'S SEASON 6 ALREADY AND HE'S ALIVE ON THE SHOW SO IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU WON'T KILL HIM AND PROBABLY BAD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO KILL HIM SO WHY BOTHER.\n\nBasically if you want to play a good Telltale game go buy Sam & Max, or Back to the Future, or any of the games that still followed the traditional adventure model before they went to the current system in The Walking Dead because it's just god awful now. If you really want to play a Game of Thrones game, go buy Crusader Kings 2 and download the mod, it has an unforgiving learning curve and still not quite accurate but god it's better than this pile of garbage.","April 28","false","28.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Unfortunately the whole "illusion of choice" thing that Telltale games do doesn't really work as well with a game about political intrigue as it does with something with an inhuman outside threat like zombies, and the emotion you'll most often be feeling is rage and frustration as things go from bad to worse to humiiliating time and again. There really isn't a great way to explain how truly meaningless all of your choices are in this game without going into spoiler territory... but basically you'll just find again and again and again that when you're given choices between who to pledge loyalty to, or whether to uphold commitments you've made, or whether to play ruthlessly or with honor... none of it ever matters. NPCs never have your back, always assume the worst about you, and there is almost never a dialogue choice provided for you to even attempt to protest. And you'll find that the game is rarely graceful in the way it railroads you back into the path of its plot when you attempt to deviate, the game is not shy about having NPCs behave in a completely insane and irrational manner in order to ensure that you're getting betrayed at all the right times.\n\nI've read before that in Telltale games you shouldn't approach them expecting that you can controll outcomes, only control the sort of person that you're playing as, and that's certainly true... but you don't even really have control over that in Game of Thrones, the decision to bounce around between so many different point of view characters means that very few of them are written with the sort of depth that leaves you feeling there's really enough room to to flesh out anything approaching a personality or set of values.\n\nI've read a lot of reddit snark calling this a "submission simulator," and that really is the most apt descriptor possible. Then again, if you can find it on sale.... it'll give you feels, just not the good ones!","November 21, 2015","false","25.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Telltale never fails to disappoint, at least disappoint me, but it can be a bit too straight forward sometimes. Though it must've been difficult to cram so much into a 6 part game, sometimes it feels rushed, other times slow. That has to be my only complaint though, for this is a really nice game. Decent graphics, great voicing, good story. It was even released on my birthday! But be a bit careful before buying it. The game takes place during the middle of the book Storm of Swords, so if you haven't read the two books before it, or caught up to (I think) season 3 of the show, you will probably be confused. I recommend buying it, but you should probably wait for it to go on sale, since it's quite pricey.

This time it's Game of Thrones and we see whether Telltale learned a thing or two from their years of making these interactive games I hesitate to call adventure games but feel comfortable enough stating they have indeed carved their own niche at this point, niche even other developers have decided to dabble in.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to be familiar with ASOIF as such, probably better known as Game of Thrones these days thanks to its namesake TV show,  it certainly helps and game references as well as heavily adheres to visual style of the ongoing series. Perhaps even a bit too much, in my opinion. So much so that House your characters belong to, House Forrester, at times feels like merely a stand-in for better known Starks and all the shenanigans that ensue can certainly be used to draw some clear parallels between the two. Yes, you read that correctly – characters. Taking up after their recent Borderlands game Telltale has opted to once again go for multiple-playable-characters-tied-together scenario, probably in the vein to emulate source material's multiple POVs structure as well. I have to admit I like the idea, but its execution simply wasn't that great because, for the most part, stories don't really tie together until the very end  and even then only for some while a good half still remains standalone without many ties to the rest.  Game is also perfectly content to re-tread a lot of the same ground, beat-by-beat, that was already covered in the books and, by proxy, the show itself. Yes, politicking in King's Landing, for example, is all nice and good but we've seen it all before and done better.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is game could've done its own thing, perhaps following in the footsteps of the Game of Thrones RPG, but it largely chooses not to in order to play on familiar imagery. It was entertaining to see how they played up signature shock factor when certain key characters keeled over, but I can't shake the feeling this was yet another game that suffered from lack of cohesive vision over what to do with it and some events that were built up as major never really amount to anything and end up simply left somewhere on they wayside forgotten because, in now standard formula approach, you dance to whatever tune Telltale ultimately decides they want to play.\n\nI imagine this may come off as exceedingly negative opinion, but I assure you I was really torn on how to thumb the game in the end. It's not a bad game or anything, but following after Tales from the Borderlands it's clear Telltale's heart wasn't in this one and just comes off as a B-grade product in comparison. And I would consider myself a fan of the source material. Telltale simply needs to step up their game at this point or shake up the formula a bit because it's getting stale and this one had none of the personality or atmosphere to really sell it to me.\n\nIt's a Telltale game.","November 18, 2015","false","11.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is definitely my least favorite Telltale game. The main problem with it is that your choices change nothing. There's not even an illusion of choice. Your choices don't even change the dialogue most of the time. It feels very linear and on rails. Every choice felt like the wrong one because the game just thwarts your plans no matter what you do. I didn't feel like I was making any progress. There were so many plot holes it was ridiculous. The ending sucks no matter what you do. There were many choices where you can specifically set a course of action, but that choice gets ignored by the game anyway.\n\nI had a lot of minor gripes with the game as well. There's basically no exploration or puzzles. Waiting an entire year for the whole game to come out really sucks. You completely forget everything so if you play it as it comes out it really hurts the experience. I'm not a fan of the blurry oil painting graphics. Some of the combat sequences were frustrating. There's no Steam cloud saves so I lost all my progress when my computer crashed. Playing so many different characters made it a lot harder to connect with any of them.\n\nSpoilers: Immediately losing Asher or Rodrik as soon as Asher gets to Westeros and they meet up really annoyed me. The traitor reveal scene was really lame in my opinion. It was so predictable and uninspired that it fell completely flat. It didn't make much sense to me and I thought it was really out of character. Mira's entire storyline was basically pointless. I was waiting for Tom the coal boy to help me because he kept saying that there were people who would, but instead I just got executed. I was loyal to Margaery the whole time and she still didn't save me. They killed off so many characters by the end that it was worse than the Starks. The entire North Grove storyline came to nothing. They introduced new characters beyond the wall so late into the storyline that they were completely ineffective.\n\nSeason 2 was just announced. I really hope they do a better job.

It's another interactive narrative experience just like the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, but this time, it's centered around the Game of Thrones universe. For those watching the TV show, the game starts right at the end of season 3, at the red wedding. You know what I'm talking about.\n\nThat said, I really liked the first episode for Telltale Games Game of Thrones. It captured the essence of the show quite well in all aspects of the narrative, and even if you're not a big fan of video games in general, this is a must play for those who like the Game of Thrones books or TV Show. You play from the perspective of 3 different characters with very distinct roles. They all know each other, but they never actually meet, at least not in this episode. Like the TV Show, it's constantly jumping from character to character giving you these very different perspectives. From the mind games of King's Landing to the war games of the battlefront.\n\nAs I've mentioned before, in terms of gameplay, it happens pretty much as you'd expect. Lots of dialogue and different options which will cause a direct impact on the game. What certain characters think of you, whether they trust you or not, is all up to the way you choose to respond to them.\nFrom time to time, there will also be some action sequences with quick time events which Telltale just doesn't seem to be able to let go. I'm really not a fan of these, I'd much rather be watching a cutscene than doing these quick time events. Pressing keys at the right time, is not what I'd call good gameplay mechanics, and most of them don't even matter, because even if you fail to press a key in the right time, it's barely going to change anything. I wish they'd just drop this feature entirely in the future, or replace with something that would actually be compelling to do, because every time I see these button prompts, I can feel my eyes suddenly rolling upwards, it's kind of a reflex of mine.\nThe soundtrack and voice acting are flawless, or close to that I would say. The actors of the show actually voice their own characters and they do a superb job of it.\n\nVisually, the game is okay. It's not impressive, it's not crazy good looking, it's just okay. I can live with it, but some character models do bother me to an extent. Margery being the worst case, I don't think they were able to capture her face very well. There are good models though, if we look at Cersei and Tyrion, they look spot on, but from time to time, some wierd faces will appear. Also, why the hell did they try to recreate the intro from the TV Show? It's by far the worst looking part of the game. Look at those textures, that is horrible, and was completely unnecessary. This doesn't add anything to the game at all, so it's very weird that they decided to include it.\n\nBut these complaints feel very minor when compared to the good things that the game has in general.\nThere is although something I noticed after playing through the game twice. The game is fine for a single playthrough but when I played the game a second time to see the actual impact of your choices in the story, I was actually very disapointed. You can't change anything major. Characters will talk to you differently, they'll seem to trust you more or less, but there aren't any significant changes in their behavior or any major events. You can't save any character from dying, if they die in one playthrough they'll die in any other, they'll go to the same places, they'll interact with the same people at the end. This was kind of a bummer, but it was something that I only discovered after playing the game twice. I'll tell you this, Telltale is really good at creating the illusion that your choices matter in this episode, but at the end of the day, they really don't change a thing. That's not to say that your actions won't have a more meaningful impact in future episodes, but right now we can't say for sure.\n\nOverall, very positive feelings about this game. Telltale and Game of Thrones go very well together, and I can't wait for the next episode, because as usual, this one ends on kind of a clifhanger, but that much was expected I guess.","December 4, 2014","true","18.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/recommended/330840/","zeroxxx","zeroxxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/","2762 products in account","Game of Thrones is a point+click game which is incredibly similar to The Walking Dead series. If you love TWD, you'll love this. Unlike TWD, however, the lore is much deeper, and so you might be confused if you don't understand or are not familiar with the Game of Thrones TV shows. Much easier for the shows' fans to get into the game.\n\nAnd no, despite this game seemingly is suitable for casuals, it is NOT family games. There are explicit gore and violence, so I don't recommend you to play this with your kids.\n\nThe game sets itself in a medieval era of (fantasy) United Kingdom, or so it looks to me like so. At any rate, there's no UFO, so yeah, but there are Dragons and other magical creatures. There are factions, there is King and Queen, and of course bloody conflicts and wars between landlords. You'll be given chances to control at least four major characters and you'll be rotating around them, one of a time. Sometimes it is annoying to have the game switches the character your control, simply because you want more story revealed from that character.\n\nAnd therein lies the beauty of this game, it is the story. It is capable to disorient you and oftentimes makes you choose an option that you wouldn't have done normally. When I think 'ok gotta be cruel u die sux ♥♥♥' then the game manages to exploit my weak side and so I relent. Sometimes I immediately regret the option I just chose, not so wise, eh?\n\nThe decision you make will alter the reactions of NPCs, but sadly the story will most likely end up the same. This is what I criticize, as I would expect this to have different branches of stories and multiple endings. Just an illusion, I guess.\n\nAt the moment there are only four episodes out of promised six, so I can't give final judgement. But so far, it is able to make me attached to the characters I play and I love the story it narrates. Can't wait for more chapters.\n\nOn a technical side, performance wise, the game runs silky smooth in my toaster (i7 3517u, 6 GB RAM, 635m GT), so no complaints from me. It is designed with console-PC hybrid in mind, so either using controller or KB/M don't yield so much discrepancy in experience. The game is able to detect my Dinput mode Logitech controller as well, as to be expected from Telltale as their TWD games also can.\n\nLastly, as for the recommendation, despite its flaw in to be expected multiple branches of the stories, I'd still give this a solid 9/10. Really enjoying playing this game.","June 26, 2015","true","35.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I love the art style, I like the twisted story and the very interesting characters. It has great voice acting and enough gore effects to keep the family happy. I liked the controls and the speed of the game. Not too hasty, not too slow. The majority of the story lines are constantly interesting and well-written with plenty of (in terms of story unpleasant) surprises.\n\nOverall it has been a great Telltale experience...\n\n... until the end, until the last couple of minutes where the game stops abruptly, the moment all the decisions you were taken seem not have had any impact on the outcome of the game at all, when the twist, the storyline fail to round up properly. Leaving you back hungry, confused and wondering why the heck are they end the game this way? Might be a typical Game of Thrones twist. I don't know... as I said I am not a connaisseur of Games of Thrones, but I am not happy with the form of the happy end\n\nIt is a great story that comes along in a great art style and sufficiant interaction.

I was more than a little disapointed to discover that no matter what I chose, it did not change any of the responses from the characters or the final outcome.  I even whent to the extreme of letting each prompt expire during the entire chapter.  Not one character had a different response and the outcome remaind the same!  If chapter 6 is any indication of the level of detail Telltale Games has put into this game, then I just may have paid $30 for a slow moving movie with bad graphics! grrr\n\nI also would like to mention that I was VERY surprised to discover that I paid $30 for only 1 episode!.  Nowhere in the "About this Game" is it mentioned that I would be subsidizing the development of this game by paying for all 6 episodes but only getting episode 1.  Furthermore, Steam has not provided any readily available information on when the remaining 5 episodes are to be released!  If you look on the SONY Playsation Store, this game is listed as episode 1 only for sale at the same price or less than this package deal from Steam.  Perhaps SONY agrees with me that selling a product before it is released, with no indication to the public that this is taking place, is not good business pratice. hmmm\n\nRant over! ;)\n\nWith all the above said and considering I have already paid.  I am actualy looking forward to the release of the remaining episodes.  Like I said above, I did anjoy the story.  Perhaps Telltale Games will redeam themselves.

It says Game of Thrones, and so you shelled out the cash and already paid for it.  I'm not hardly trying to dissuade you or make you regret the descion, but here you are reading.  As a fan of the books, the handfull of comics, and of course the TV show, this is a black mark on the franchise and on Telltale.  It's not awful, but there sure is a lot of "bad" in it.\n\nWhile some people complain about the "railroaded" plotline, that's not even my problem.  MY problem with the story is how it's presented.  In Walking Dead you control on character, in The Wolf Among Us you control one character.  In THIS you control 3 of them.  You barely get to spend any time with them before they toss another at you making them all feel dull.  The books do this, but for entire chapters, and you can see how they think.  The show does this, but there's still more content in the series than the game.    It's trying to hard to be like the other media for the franchise.\n\nMy biggest problem with the story is that it doesn't make sense.  You have to play it to see, but there are multiple scenes that simply don't follow any logic.\n\nThe animations are poor, but the character modeling is almost insulting.  First of all, when I saw Magaery Tyrell, I started laughing.  She looks hideous.  Secondly, to bring up Telltale's previous work again, WD had a small cast and only reuses zombie models.  TWAU does not reuse a single character model outside of completely faceless silouettes rarely even seen in the game and ALWAYS in the background.  GoT, on the other hand, reuses models constantly to the point where you start wondering if that guy with the pock-marked face you just ran from is the same guy who has a sword on you now and the same guy you run into an hour later.\n\nOverall, it's not good.  If you're desperate for GoT, pick up some HBO box sets or (FOR GOD'S SAKE) read the books.  Otherwise play The Walking Dead (season 1), or The Wolf Among Us.","December 10, 2014","false","25.2"," 41 of 80 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","41","80","3","0"

The main concern so far is that the game will be too surprise filled that it becomes an M. Night Shamalan movie and after the first few you'll be sick of it. If you guys at Telltale have this one played out with twist's and turn's don't make them too drastic. Anyway right now I love it and I am enjoying the cast being there and the fact that they are pretty much keeping with the feel and tone of Game of Thrones IMO. I need to mention that the oil painting style of the game is really cool. I just hope that it will get better, which most telltale games do, but as the T.V. show does, we may not get any real closure until the final episode, and even then it will be a miracle if it wraps everything up.  If you want to know about gameplay, they were good with doing the telltale thing in games, that being a mix of point and click elements, dialouge choices, desicion making on a butt hole clenching level, and quick time events. So basically I think the game will be good, a little hesitant, but I have hopes. Most telltale games usually get better with each new episode such as The Wolf Among Us where there was no real closure in the first episode, but in the end got better and better. Until then I think that everything was amazing for the first episode of six, in numbers i'd say it's a 9/10. In short short words, good, but you may want to hold off if these type's of games do not intrest you, or if you don't follow the show, but if you are one or both i'd say get it.","December 2, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are NOT familiar with the gameplay from the games from Telltale- it simply plays like an interactive movie. Filled with choices on what to say or do. There are also some quick time events here and there. But mostly, there's lots of talking. Just like there is in the show though, so I don't think that's a bad thing for fans of the series. The story is awesome. You'll meet and interact with few characters from the tv series as well some generic ones. The game has few cons though... The graphics aren't too realistic in my opinion. Most of games from Telltale have comic-like graphics, and in GoT it seems like they've struggled to make it look "real", and not really succeeding at it... It also would be great if the choices you make had a bigger impact on the story. And I should also mention that I don't think you can really get into the game if you didn't see the tv series. You'd just end up really confused on what's going on.

There is no middle ground.\n\nKeep that in mind when you play this game.\n\nUnfortunetly, you're not playing for the throne. You're trying to keep your house from ruin and most of all, that somebody still has a pulse when the dust has settled. Hells bells, thats hard enough. Your snap decision a second ago just got somebody killed. That clever retort you just gave to a minor insult? Stupid and costly. I am slowly learning the price of loyalty. The price you pay for never bending a knee. And happily, I am learning how to scheme. This will come in handy in my next work review. ;)\n\nThe Forresters are front and center in this story. So the game of thrones are not yours to play, but I don't mind. The story is good enough to get me invested in the characters, even though their fate do resemble to the original cast a tad to much. And at one point in chapter 2 i tought:\n\n"Zevran! My old mate! How have you been? I haven't seen you since I last was in Ferelden." - Except this elf .. I mean assassin, is female. Just play it, you'll see what I mean.\n\nSo some characters don't feel very original. Nor the plot. But then again, you are in Westeros. And that I do like.\n\nAt times the handeling was a bit clumsy, but I have a feeling I should have been playing with pad and not mouse+keyboard.\n\nI could only change the settings after I started the story. A bit silly, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nI only had trouble at one time, and that was when I was supposed to shoot with a crossbow and aim at the dummy to the right. The windows minimized every time i pulled the trigger. But i think that might have something to do with me having two monitors. I adapted and overcame.\n\nIn sum: You're not playing the characters we know and love/hate. It's a story that focus on one family's plight. It does give you an advantage knowing the lore and having seen the series or read the books. We've only gotten to chapter 2, so expect to suffer untill you finally can get your revenge. And if I'm not wrong, Martin will make that journey grueling.\n\nBut 7 hells ... I will get my revenge.\n\n","March 12, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main concern so far is that the game will be too surprise filled that it becomes an M. Night Shamalan movie and after the first few you'll be sick of it. If you guys at Telltale have this one played out with twist's and turn's don't make them too drastic. Anyway right now I love it and I am enjoying the cast being there and the fact that they are pretty much keeping with the feel and tone of Game of Thrones IMO. I need to mention that the oil painting style of the game is really cool. I just hope that it will get better, which most telltale games do, but as the T.V. show does, we may not get any real closure until the final episode, and even then it will be a miracle if it wraps everything up.  If you want to know about gameplay, they were good with doing the telltale thing in games, that being a mix of point and click elements, dialouge choices, desicion making on a butt hole clenching level, and quick time events. So basically I think the game will be good, a little hesitant, but I have hopes. Most telltale games usually get better with each new episode such as The Wolf Among Us where there was no real closure in the first episode, but in the end got better and better. Until then I think that everything was amazing for the first episode of six, in numbers i'd say it's a 9/10. In short short words, good, but you may want to hold off if these type's of games do not intrest you, or if you don't follow the show, but if you are one or both i'd say get it.","December 2, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of games from Telltale have comic-like graphics, and in GoT it seems like they've struggled to make it look "real", and not really succeeding at it... It also would be great if the choices you make had a bigger impact on the story. And I should also mention that I don't think you can really get into the game if you didn't see the tv series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/330840/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Game of Thrones by TellTale is interactive novel that starts off in one of the most memorable moments of GoT called the Red Wedding. If you haven't watched season 3 of the show or read the third book called Storm of Swords I would highly suggest you don't read this review or play this game. With that out of the way, we start off as a lowly squire for House Forrester named Gared Tuttle. He is out fetching wine for the soldiers in celebration of The North's plan to take Casterly Rock from the Lannisters. Things do not stay cheerful for long as Fray soldiers cut down the army of The North in a vicious sneak attack and your lord is slain before your eyes. In his final words he gives Gared a sword and asks him to return it to its rightful place in the Forrester keep called Ironwrath. He also mysteriously asks of him to tell his uncle “The North Grove must not be lost” which will kick start the main goal of that character. That is a lot of names to take in, which is why those with new to GoT will likely be very lost throughout since they are entering the world near the half way mark of the overall narrative.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice is that the graphics now have this painting like look to them instead of the comic book style of Telltales last two games. It looks alright, not really anything remotely cool looking here but it does the job. The reason I mention the graphics so early on is that you will do a lot of sitting back and just watching in this title. Even compared to Telltales last two games, you can count on a single hand just how many times you will have control of your character and there are no puzzles either which is why I called this an interactive novel in the first sentence. That may be a bad thing to some but in my eyes those were the worst parts of Telltale's games and I'm glad I no longer have to move an extremely slow character around tiny closed off environments all that often. It makes the story move along with far better flow and is much easier to get invested in. Considering you will be controlling four characters in very different situations the better pacing benefits this title a lot. Like other Telltale games they will occasionally throw in a QTE to make sure you are paying attention.\n\nThe characters you play as will be the previously mentioned squire Gared, Ethan Forrester who is the new young lord after his father’s demise, Asher the black sheep of the Forrester family and Mira Forrester who resides in King's Landing as a handmaiden for the soon to be queen Margery Tyrell. All characters want what is best for House Forrester which makes switching around to another characters perspective feel natural since they are all fighting for the same thing, though in different ways. Their House's situation is extremely dire from the get go and Telltale really captured the dark feel of the GoT universe. You never feel safe and being a small barely known House that fought on the defeated side of the war you will constantly get harassed. Most of the time the wiser choice is to just accept it and stay silent but the humiliation you go through is just so much that more likely than not you will not be able to just put up with it even if you know it can cost you everything. Not that you have much left as whenever you think things are bad they somehow get much worse. From start to finish it feels like you are drowning and there is very little hope to be found anywhere.\n\nIt is a very dark game but unlike the show or books this has zero humor in it. That ties in with the biggest flaw in this game which are the choices you make. Telltale has always offered the illusion of choice but in this title there is no illusion. Your choices are meaningless and are foiled by the dumbest reasons just to keep the story the way they are trying to tell it. For instance in one scene you are going to get murdered by a Lannister guard but a small boy defends you and is being drowned for it. You have the choice to kill the guard or run away. If you run away you later meet the boy again who is now angry with you for leaving him to his fate and said he found a nearby rock while being drowned to kill the guard with. There is just no believable way such a small skinny lad could have pulled that off against a rather high ranking guard while being drowned in the position he was. It just feels like cheap and lazy story writing to pin that murder on you either way that you choose to handle things. That insultingly improbable way of negating your choices carries on toward the whole game and some are far more unbelievable than what I choose as an example.\n\nWith the lack of humor and the already dire situation with convenient plot armor keeping you from doing anything about it, it feels like the game is screwing the player instead of a dark, dangerous world where your plans don't always work out. It's a shame too as there are quite a few important characters of the GoT universe like Ramsay Bolton, Cerci Lannister and Jon Snow all with their original actors from the show. It would have been awesome to see if you could outwit the more dangerous of characters by using what we know from the show but instead we get the choice of picking the bad choice and getting shafted by the character for it or picking the sensible choice and getting shafted by the game itself for it. If Telltale were spread thin due to all of the games they are working on I feel it would have been far better to have a few actual choices rather than a ton of poorly veiled meaningless ones. From all this criticism you may be guessing that the story is garbage but the sad part is that it is not. It is a rather interesting tale with that spans from Westeros to quite a bit of Essos. You can't help but root for the Forresters and hope they get back on their feet.\n\nThey did an excellent job with getting you to despise the villains even if they are the typical absurdly evil type. All the new characters are pretty interesting, well voiced and quite likable. None feel like they are out of place in the GoT universe and are just as likely to die as anyone else. Well other than the show's cameo characters featured here who are too important to the plot of the show to kill off in a video game. Strangely enough for the GoT universe there is no nudity anywhere in this game, though I guess in the situations are characters are in they don't feel like baby making. All in all this is a game that will only appeal to fans of the Game of Thrones looking to see their favorite characters and see some famous locations like Castle Black, King's Landing and Mareen. There is a good story here but the pretentiousness of the frequent, useless choices did negatively impact the narrative. And the ending is a very unsatisfying set up for another season that had no closure at all. This is a title you can safely skip even if you are a fan of the source material. It's not a bad game but it does feel like a rushed plothole filled mess that only the biggest of fans that can't get enough of Game of Thrones will likely enjoy.","December 19, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are not familiar and caught up with the show, you can safely skip this one.\n\nIf you're a fan of the show (like me) however, you might find some satisfaction in this title. The important thing to note is that the whole "your choices matter" thing is really not this game's strong suit. Yes, you do get to make decisions, but usually these decisions give the same result. None of the Telltale games truly "change" all that much in the grand scheme of things depending on your choices, but they usually manage to either distract you, or conceal the illusion of choice enough to convince you that you make an impact. I rarely felt like my choices mattered in this game, with the most outrageous example being a scene where i picked a dialogue option that got me killed and had me thinking "oh my god! What have I done! How will this impact the other characters? How will i defend my house now?" only to get a game over screen and restart at the point right before i made that dialogue choice, so I could pick one of "the right ones". You, as a player, have very little impact on the story most of the time, and that is a real shame.\n\nThat being said, the game does tell a good story, with strong characters, excellent voice acting, and decent amount of variety. It also fleshes out the world of Westeros a bit (particularly Kings Landing, the north past The Wall, and to some extent Meereen), and from what I can tell the story here is actually canon with the HBO series, which is kind of neat. Characters from the show are also tastefully used. And by that I mean that they are not just shoe-horned in for some free star-power. They all have some sort of function in the grand scheme of things, and the characters all behave like they do in the TV-series. They even have the same voices, with the actors of the show reprising their roles in this game. As you may have guessed, these characters are also "plot-shielded" pretty bad, but i still think the game is stronger with them, than it would have been without them.\n\nI would recommend this game to fellow Game of Thrones fans who are looking for more tales in Westeros while we wait for the next season of the TV-series. The choices are often meaningless and mundane, but the story told here is good enough to satisfy any fan of the show. Just make sure you get it on sale and not at full price!","December 19, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spheretje/recommended/330840/","spheretje","Sphere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spheretje/","327 products in account","An interesting take on the Game of Thrones world.\nYou play as members of House Forrester, who are bannermen to House Stark, and the game starts just before the red wedding. Several members of the cast of the TV show lend their voices to their characters in the game, which gives a certain amount of credibility and believability.\n\nYour choices whilst playing the game do affect somethings, but like all Telltale games there are times when choice is just an illusion and what's going to happen will happen no matter what you do. The game follows the general feel and atmosphere of the TV show, except it sometimes takes it even a step further when it comes to killing off characters. This can be hard to accept with your choices not always mattering, and you can feel you're just along for the ride and there's nothing you could of done to save characters you've grown attached to.\n\nDespite this, it's nice to delve back into Game of Thrones while the TV show is on break, and Telltale always do a good job of creating engaging stories and characters. There's a good balance to the game, with times when you're in a political situation trying to make shrewd, difficult decisions, and other times when the swords are swinging and you have to press action button after action button.\n\nWith all episodes of season one now released, I would recommend picking it up when it's next on sale, and if you like Game of Thrones and Telltale games in general.","December 16, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iDobo1/recommended/330840/","iDobo1","D0B0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iDobo1/","125 products in account","Heres the thing about TellTale's Game of Thrones series:\n\nIt has some serious issues, although there are some great moments throughout the interesting, yet predictable story.\n\n\nThe presentation is absolutely awful. The sound, textures, animations (oh god, the animations are laughable) really take me away from the story. I won't spoil anything, but there is a funeral scene where I was laughing in my chair because of the crying animations. This game looks like someone's gcse art coursework. Muddy textures everywhere, I don't care if it is the "TellTale style", it looks like there was one talented artist and his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blind pet dog designing the game. Some character models, such as Asher, Ramsey, Dany and Gared look really good, but then you get a scene with Margery or Mira or Beskah or Rodrik and you want to throw up. The poor textures stand out massively and as I said earlier take you away from the story.\n\nThe story is interesting, but because it is game of thrones, you know what is gonna happen. I called it from episode one. It has an interesting story, but I don't think the dialogue options affect the story that much and some of the options just make no sense when you have built up a character to be a certain way. I liked the cameos from characters from the show, but they weren't long enough. I got to see Tyrion for about 15 minutes to discuss a trade deal between the crown and house forrester, how interesting!\n\nThe "gameplay" is so pointless. Whenever there were QTE's I cringed. So pointless and add absolutely nothing to the game. It would be much better if it was one long cutscene.\n\nSo to conclude, I liked the story, because I like game of thrones, basically everything else about the game is bad, and for some reason it would often launch in 480p windowed mode. Whatever, I'm reccommending the game if you like game of thrones, not if you don't or are apathetic to it","November 29, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now don't get me wrong, the game is good. But choices mean little to nothing and not much is resolved in the finale. Mainly they used the popularity of the game as an excuse to not finish the story and instead announcing Season 2, which hopefully will fill the numorous plot holes that was left behind. But it still has the Telltale charm...you give a crap about the characters. The illusion of choice is just that-an illusion-but it is still fun nonetheless.\n\nPros:\n-Characters/Character Arcs\n-It genuinely hurts to be a jerk\n-Choices can be extremely difficult, making them realistic\n-Intriguing plot line\n-Manages to maintain flow throughout multiple character switches\n-Telltale still goes for the feels\n-Game. Of. Thrones.\n\nCons:\n-Episode 6\n-Little choices matter\n-Graphically unsound\n\nFinal Score: 7/10 - Good","November 25, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
