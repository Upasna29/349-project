Just move the mouse.  No powerups, No character creation, no inventory, just old school arcade gaming goodness!  There is not even the use of a mouse button required except to choose what level and difficulty you want to play on.  The gameplay itself is just dodging your automatic stream of bullets reflection all over the increasingly more challenging level designs.  This game offers you 60 levels with 3 difficulty levels each to master!  Don't shoot yourself!  LOL!!\n\nMy video linked above demonstates this game pretty well I believe.  Give it a view, and make up your mind!\n\nMy rating at this point: 88% and a "Must-Buy" for any old school arcade/action game fans who enjoy a game that is super simple to learn but difficult to master!  Easily worth it's price tag!","April 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 46 of 64 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","46","64","4","1"

Partly “arcade”, perhaps. Certainly largely “puzzle”, certainly, for reasons to soon be explained. It begins with Tier 0, of seemingly 6 tiers (0-5) of 10 scenarios each. Each scenario consists of a named layout, or game field to try to beat, each with three skill levels: Normal (1 star), Hard (2 stars) and Impossible (5 stars!). That’s important, so I’ll clarify. Impossible counts 5 TIMES as much as Normal, and 2 and a half times as much as Hard. Each tier ends with a boss scenario that has to be defeated to move to the next tier. But it’s not that simple. To even access each boss, a cumulative number of stars must be acquired. On Tier 0 this is a very easy proposition. Few of the Normal skill level puzzles are difficult at early levels. Some early level scenarios are almost stupid easy, all the way through Impossible. This led me to believe my money had been poorly spent. I was hasty.\n\nEach scenario requires the player to use the mouse to move a cursor forward, shooting a stream of bullets to the rear. Once 100 bullets have been fired, the scenario has been defeated at that skill level. That number of stars, 1, 2 or 5, is added to the total. What makes this game interesting is the fascinating differences in the scenarios, and the ways the bullets react to the walls and barriers they encounter in each.  Imagine invisible walls (Glass Ceiling), or backgrounds of which more than 50% are opaque (Hourglass.) Or in many cases, lines that can be followed, or must be followed, or a combination. Barriers to the bullets, barriers to the player. “Wormhole” type walls. Bullets that fly off walls they strike, or that shoot back at the player at high speeds. Fortunately, the bullets do eventually shrink or fade away, and it’s simply necessary to avoid them long enough. It generally seems to be OK to hit them, just not for them to hit you. And, oh yes, the boss levels are harder.\n\nThe reason I called this a puzzle game is that any scenario can conceivably be difficult, if the proper logic is not applied. From what I’ve seen, many levels aren’t just impossible in name, but in action, without determining and applying that specific logic. With it, some of them almost instantly become the described “stupid easy”. And that is very fortunate, because it doesn’t take long until the cumulative number of stars required to access the next boss, thereby giving one the chance to open the next tier, grows almost exponentially.\n\nAdmittedly, this isn’t typically my kind of game, where the movement of the cursor is so precise. I have very little experience, so the difficulty I describe may be mine alone. The math, however, is not. After 2 hours I have a total of 9 Impossible, 11 Hard and 9 Normal, for a total of 76 stars. I need 4 more stars to access the third level boss, and I’m stumped. (Perhaps YouTube is an admission of failure, but I have a cash investment here. PC is a new port, so no telling if that’s even an option.) Here’s the problem. To access the 4th level boss, assuming that level is even more difficult and I may have to accept Normal wins on every 4th level scenario prior to the boss, it will be necessary to have beat skill level Impossible on almost EVERY preceding puzzle on all 3 prior levels. And I can’t imagine that will be easy for anyone.\n\nAgain, I’m wondering if my money was poorly spent.\n\nA very hard, very frustrating game, at least for me. But certainly interesting intellectually. And very satisfying when that “trick” suddenly comes to light, and victory is so very simple. Hopefully, that possibility continues throughout “Don’t Shoot Yourself!”\n","April 13, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/332880/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","This game was fun to an extent. However there is very little variation in the levels which led to me getting bored nearer the end of the game.\n\nThe concept of the game is great and very unique. You play as a small shape that shoots bullets from behind as it moves along. It does this at a constant rate. To finish the level you have to simply do what it says in the title of the game and "don't shoot yourself". You have to successfully manouvere the areas presented to you and avoid 100 bullets. If you win you send out a blue bullet that destroys the outer area and releases you free.\n\nThis concept is very fun for first 20 levels or so but dies out after a while. The problem with the game comes from the fact that it doesn't do enough to engage you throughout the game by adding more obstacles to new levels. In later levels you do have obstacles such as changing walls, portals and things that shoot bullets back at you. Although this does add to the gameplay it doesn't feel like it makes much of an addition into the way the game is played. You still continue on as you was before just flying about aimlessly. It seems to make no difference to the way in which you control the character or play the game.\n\nAnother problem is that the game was quite obviously designed with touch controls on a mobile device in mind. It doesn't translate well to pc. As much so that you get glitches that make it impossible to use some elements of the game. At one point of the game it introduces to you portals that can teleport you from one side of the level to the other. This sounds great in concept but when translated to pc controls with the mouse it breaks. This is because your character is bounded to travel where your mouse pointer is located on the screen. So when you go through the portal the character gets confused and tries to go back to your mouse pointer location as quickly as possible leaving you zooming through the field of flying bullets with no control whatsoever over your character. This problem made me have to avoid using portals completely making the game significantly harder to play.\n\nEach level has 3 sets of difficulty ratings. It has "normal", "hard" and "impossible which give 1,3 and 5 stars respectively for completing it. The way the difficulty is raised is by the speed of which the bullets are emitted from your character and travel around the screen. This does add an extra challenge to gameplay for people, like me, that found the original difficulty of the game to be too easy. It is also needed to complete a certain amount of stars to unlock boss levels and move on to the next tier of levels. This addition is welcomed and makes for a much longer and more enjoyable experience.\n\nI also want to comment on the graphics and sountrack of the game. The graphics style is very nice looking and presents itself well in a simplistic but very colourful manor. The whole game sticks to this graphics style and I believe it benefits well from it. The soundtrack is very well implemented as well and leaves for a very calming and relaxing experience and is very nice to listen to,\n\nSo in summary I did really enjoy the game for a while, but I feel it does need a lot of improvement to be worth a full price purchase. Currently I would say you should consider waiting for a sale or a bundle to buy this game but I would definitely recommend playing it at this stage.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided an review copy by the developer before the full release of the game.","April 11, 2015","true","1.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Initially I was expecting the game to end after around 20 levels, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the game continues to grow in complexity and charm as it continues. There's a ton of really neat mechanics in the game like curving bullets, maps that evolve as you play, and even a level with a crazy squiggly line.\n\nOne thing that felt a bit odd to me was that the transition screen says to "Swipe right" to go to the next screen. That's something that I think could be adjusted to "Click the arrow" to move to the next screen. I know a lot of people are hesitant of games that are mobile ports, which this game is, and small things like that just remind you of it.\n\nHowever the game is solid. From a gameplay perspective it doesn't really remind me of a mobile game. It's super enjoyable and I would definitely recommend grabbing it.","August 14, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
