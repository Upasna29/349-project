So why not buy the sequel? Because it was priced ten times more and - reviews aside - it seemed doubtful I would enjoy a game where I tediously drove a truck down highways avoiding traffic hauling cargo. At least, I thought,  the first game would give me an idea if I could even stomach the genre. And if it did, well only then would I consider paying the price for the sequel.\n\nI was surprised out how engaging this game was. Perhaps because it stood in such stark contrast to all my other driving games (the Need For Speed series, Burnout Paradise, and similar), but there was something very relaxing  and enjoyable about driving between the lanes, making a point not to speed (much) and slam into other cars. It was almost zenlike. The graphics might not be particularly impressive but they got the point across, and the AI of the other cars was pleasantly non-aggressive. Figuring out the best routes to take and what cargos to deliver was not particularly challenging but it was relaxing, and a welcome change from the ordinary.\n\nSadly, that's not enough to sustain the game, at least not for me. Having advanced three tiers and played over twenty hours, the lack of variety is increasingly noticeable. All the highways and cities more or less look the same and the challenge is flat throughout. So while it was a wonderful ride up to this point, it wasn't enough to keep me playing until the nominal "end" of the simulation. However, it /was/ enough to get me interested in the sequel, which apparently adds extra content and gameplay. And since that was the whole point of my playing this game in the first place, I consider it time and money well spent.","November 27, 2013","true","16.5"," 81 of 85 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","81","85","0","0"

ETS1 was a great idea and has been improved with the release of ETS2.  Pros and cons of this game...\n\nPros: Graphics not bad for its day and you can play a short run in 10-15 mins.  While getting in accidents, speeding, and running red lights gets you penalized, you can also play the jerk driver cutting other drivers off and hogging two lanes (which is almost a necessity if driving via keyboard).  Hint for new players--get your hazardous cargo cert ASAP so you can make more money faster.\n\nCons: A careful study of the road map shows this game was unfinished.  Back roads all over Poland, a few in Germany, and none anywhere else.  When driving around, you see several overpasses that were likely intended to be used for backroads, but were left unconnected to anything.  There are also loads of no-go zones in the cities, where AI vehicles can drive, but you cannot.  Another minor complaint; the physics of the truck in a cloverleaf turn allow for too much drift and jackknifing the truck is easy to do, even at low speeds.  I have learned to go real slow through these.\n\nI am looking forward to playing ETS2, but if you have an older PC and/or a light wallet, you should give this game a whirl.","November 14, 2014","true","97.2"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","64","67","4","0"

Although there is less cities to drive to, I still enjoy it. I love the feeling to be able to drive properly, and have played 20 hours within 2 days due to being obsessed. I'm not saying the game is perfect, hell, the second game might not even be perfect (can't buy it since I have a Mac) however it still is fun.\n\n\nI am quite big on graphics, and I have to admit this isn't so bad. The trucks/cars both look great and so does the interior of the trucks. You can either drive on manual or automatic which adds realism, and so does the various types of weather, time, and the rules of the road. Sound doesn't seem to be much of a problem, it has realistic car, weather, truck and engine noises.\n\nHaving to deliver more and more in order to gain more money, does take a lot of time. But this leads to the game being more addictive and actually worth it. However, if driving back and forth for a while isn't really your thing, this can become a problem, though I ensure it wont be when you actually try it out, and even better, unlock more places.\n\n\nOne thing that has annoyed me while driving around on here is how stupid the other drivers are. They either go the wrong way, beep at me when I am not doing anything wrong, and/or randomly brake when there was no need to which leads me into hitting them, which leads to me having to pay for hitting them. Adding pedestrians or animals would also be something which would make the game better (no I do not want to run them over)\n\nAnother thing is how the cities are extremely small, and only have up to 5-6 roads, which is bad for when you want to explore other places other than the highway. The sound is good, but not so great. It sounds like I'm driving ontop of the truck rather than inside (might be because the windows are always open for some reason) and the radio does not sound like it's actually coming out of a radio in the truck.\n\n\nHonestly, I love this game even though it has some flaws which I have to live with, however those are probably fixed in ETS2. I recommend this game if you either have a older computer, have a Mac and cannot buy the second one (which is my case) or have a few cash left or is low on cash to spend it on this. An overall 6/10 from me.","December 21, 2014","true","26.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","0"

( I cut my teeth on a green screen IBM bootleg copy of Pilot trainer circa 1988 )  I have often been skeptical of the 'ground runners.'  Trains, racing cars and boats all have the same singular fundementle flaw on the virtual stage.  Primarily that no matter how much you REALLY want it to be true, you are NOT going to get a realistic perspective view of ... well ... ANYTHING.  Land and city scapes will always be a generic  reflection of what you just saw and are about to see again.  SO; having established my rational for skepticesm, what am I doing here?  To put it plainly.  I'm cheap and my entertainment budget can be bought.  In short for $20 I got the whole euro-truken-paint joben collection.  You should too, hopefully here is why....\n\nPro # 1.\n\nIt's Europe and there isn't a freken war going on.  Well okay...  Actually about 2 thirds of Europe.  Sans the Balkans half of Italy and 1/3 of Iberia.  If you like Scandanavia.  You are officially S.O.L.  Rather Ironic in fact, considering that no less than half of the riggs you use in this series are models made in either Sweden or Norway.  Back to the point.  See something of the great old country without having to shoot it, dog fight over it or deal with Hitler or Napoleon.\n\n# 2.\n\nBeautifully simple.  Elegantly addictive.  I honestly went into this game with little if any knowledge of truck driving and after 6 hours that passed by like 30 minutes, I not only know something about the actual life style, I can also add that it was fun doing something curiously different than trying to beat a bunch of crazies to a finish line.\n\nThe one and only con I can come up with, is that the technology of it's day DOES let it down somewhat.  However; as I mentioned before I got the collection so I expect the second edition to be a bit more advanced.  Not only graphic wise but the over all control experience.  This first one is the best to learn on.  If you can get comfy with this one then you can graduate to more complicated challenges.\n\nJim\n","May 30, 2014","true","31.0"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azghouls/recommended/232010/","Azghouls","Azghouls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azghouls/","1719 products in account","SCS Software specialised in making truck simulations from its humble beginnings back in 1997 with Hard Truck. From then on in, it concentrated on the American theater with its successful 18 Wheels of Steel series. This game, Euro Truck Simulator is the first of its kind hauling cargo throughout Europe and whilst it has the same feel as its cousin 18 Wheels of Steel, the simulation experience is not quite there as it does feel a little arcade. And if it wasn't for the career objectives, I probably enter this game into an early retirement.\n\nThe gameplay length is pretty much unlimited as there is no official ‘end’. You can literally go on forever however even the most dedicated truckie sim fan will eventually want to give up. However the game cleverly designed career progression chart, where you need to complete certain tasks to raise the ranks from being a novice to the master trucker. Five ranks in all and designed in a way to get the maximum usage for this game however it does take some considerable time to become the master. And because there are many feats (achievements) to earn, it provides you more reasons to play it so if it wasn't for those I'd probably give it a flick a lot sooner.\n\nFull review here - http://www.gamespot.com/euro-truck-simulator/user-reviews/2200-12543344/\n\n6 / 10","September 24, 2014","true","41.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The best way to play is to throw on a podcast or your own music and cruise around doing jobs. Some of the best features include how easy it is to run (I'm playing it on my laptop instead of my PC and it still runs nicely and looks decent), plenty of areas to work with, a fair variety of trucks, and lots of different things to ship around.\nHowever, many of the areas are locked behind pretty big prices, making it pretty difficult to expand beyond your few cities you have access to when you begin. As well, some of the well-paying jobs are locked behind inspections that are expensive.\nOverall, if you're looking for a pretty fun and relaxing game that you can pour some hours into then I'd say get it on sale. You will be investing a lot of time so keep that in mind.

Things like truck upgrades, unlocking new territories, and hazmat licenses are expensive relative to the amount you get paid for driving. You will be doing a lot of time-consuming long hauls to get a halfway decent truck and open up a few countries.\n\nMy recommendation would be to load some music files or even audiobooks into the game folder so that you can listen to them through the truck radio, or at least have something going in real life while you play. Otherwise you might get bored before too long just sitting there forever keeping your truck in the lanes... since you're not actually getting paid for it and all. But if you can find a way to multitask it can be a relaxing and fun time.","September 4, 2015","true","29.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You need some kind of wheel for nice smooth turns, otherwilse curves will just be a bunch of corners. It's also difficult to drive a straight line. I am using a vintage UltraRacer PC handheld wheel and it works great.\n\nGraphics are very good, and the game doesn't miss a frame on my system:\n\ni7 6700 4GHz\nnVidia GTX 960 using DirectX\n32GB RAM\n4K resolution\n\nThe challenge of this game is having patience. You have to make quite a few runs to advance your certification and to expand into other countires. I don't mind this since I prefer games a bit more on the relaxing side.\n\nWhile realizing that most drivers are idiots, my only wish is for a little more realism on the part of the AI traffic. A car or truck will stop short in front of you for no apparent reason. Don't tailgate and you'll be ok.\n\nI recommend this game if you are into simulation. I must emphasize again though. DON'T buy this game if you have no intention of using a WHEEL. You'll only end up complaining and writing a negative review for a game that deserves better.","October 25, 2015","true","83.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Coming from a left side steering country and different sides of traffic along with the all new environment and different language, I don't feel really confident in driving in Europe. One day, I have to drive... So instead of driving an actual car and tried it on the road, I picked up this game. I drove in the Europe highway, coming and out of the different city, enjoying the scenery, listening to the local radio, bumping to the car next to me... After a while I got more confident. But does it help me with my actual driving on the road? Well of course not, instead I just rent a car and start driving even though it scares me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time in this simulator.","April 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

The world is massive, I find my self playing for a few hours, end up getting tired and then sleeping for about 10 mins! This game is uber realistic! My only complaint would be there is no truck modifications you can buy like rockets or a spider drone! But from that, the territory you are in is realistic, the road and buildings are based upon real places.

The driving feels far too heavy to be enjoyable, even for a simulator, and there are so, so many bugs in the physics engine and the AI's control of their vehicles for me to avoid running out of money while transporting goods.\n\nThe AI change lanes as fast as the cars on the freeways in GTA: San Andreas did - i.e. faster than your lumbering starter truck could ever hope to. They do so even when you are in the lane, which forces you to slam on the brakes lest you rear end them, leaving their car totally uninjured (i mean, really? we had destructable car models years and years ago) and immobile in the middle of the freeway. This often causes pileups as although your brakes are terrible, the AI's brakes are worse.\n\nThe character model is horribly dated, even for 2008 - while your truck is quite a pretty piece of graphics, the character driving it has a grand total of three different animations - "turn left, turn right, not turning", and they jar horribly if you're viewing the vehicle from the front.\n\nIt appears to be very, very quickly churned out by a junior company for a driving school, not a full fledged trucking game which I hoped.\n\nI heard the sequel is better.\n\n","March 13, 2014","false","2.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The genre in itself is very specific, so if you don't enjoy those types of games, this is not for you.\nYou drive around in a Semi across Europe, delivering goods to companies and flashing out your company.\nPersonally, I play this game to destress, as I really like driving in real life, and driving across Europe while listening to the radio helps me relax.\n\nI think the biggest gripe when buying this is the fact that ETS2 exists, this game's newer, prettier and in general better brother. And I would suggest buying that instead. ETS2's cities are much more fleshed out, same with the roads and props.\n\nTLDR: a dated, but still good truck driving simulator.","June 19, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unless you really like trucks, then it's the most amazing thing since sliced bread. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.\nHere is what I think of it.\n\nThe controls aren't great\nIf you perfer the inside view and have it on low graphics you can't see anything when the sun is shining your way\nIt's extremely hard to not crash into anybody\nIt's pretty hard to control all together\nYou can hardly see what you need to on most of the camera views (ie, Red lights, other cars, ect)\nAnd In the one place you SHOULD see the important things (gas, speed ect) you can't. That being the inside view. I myself perfer to have a simulator feel like you are actually in the scenerio, this game being truck driving I'd imagine you would be inside the truck when driving it. Maybe it was just because I had low graphics on? I don't know.\n\nSorry for going on a minor rant at the end but yes. Thats my review. What I'd rate it? 3/10.

No easy way to see achieves... (culled) ...and even more: engine does not stop when you stops on gear.\nLags: when I try turn head to look at mirrors this game becomes laggy.

Impossibly bad controls, gravity-free physics (seriously, you tap the key to turn and your truck swerves violently across four lanes of traffic). I also couldn't get any music to play (that could've been an error of mine though, to be fair).\n\nIt could be me, not being a PC gamer by default, but it seems you need at least three hands to operate fluidly. You need one for directional control, one for the mouse, and at least another hand for the wipers, horn, lights, gears, etc.\n\nI loved the idea, it seems like it SHOULD be one of those games that is relaxing to play, no real rush, quite pretty in its own way... but no. It's infuriating. The slightest twitch makes you lose your trailer, or gain an offence.\n\nI overturned my trailer (which was detatched from my truck) at one point, paid out almost 1800 Euros for help, and despite my money going (leaving me with no money for petrol), my trailer remained on its side until I rammed it back up the right away (which of course gained me offenses etc).\n\n2 might be better.

Nothing happens during the game except some small car axcidents (and do not expect them to be phisically real)\n- All the entertainment is to crash others on the road or listen to your-own-prepared radio (with OGG files)\n- You cannot use lots of buttons available in the track\n- No CB radio - come on!\n- You should stick to the law (speed, lights), but in the end you just pay the bills for not driving correctly.

The game consists of maneuvering a huge, slow behemoth of a vehicle through drab, repetitive highways and crowded, narrow city streets while observing all the rules of the road and remembering to fill up with gas and stop for sleep. If you can tolerate repeating that task over and over until you've earned sufficient money, you get to buy a bigger, shinier rig so that you can -- drumroll please -- continue doing the same thing some more!\n\nTrust me, it is precisely as monotonous as it sounds.

With what I'm going to tell you is, if you have the time and patience to play then this is your type of game. Not all of us have patience for a slow-moving truck, but that's pretty much the same for reality and this simulator grants you anything that is implemented. There are various ways to control your truck and how to drive it too. You can have a top, side, forward, bumper view when it comes to driving from place-to-place.\n\nSurely though be careful if you do play this game. There are downfalls where if you have many accidents you will be charged and if you do not meet the estimated amount to pay for your damages then it's game over and have to start over with a new truck. That's what I learned anyways, I made so many bad turns and signals that crossing the wrong way towards oncoming traffic also gives you a fine! I was, however, waiting to see if you would be chased down by an officer for slamming into other cars various times and nothing happened yet. xD","December 2, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game consists of maneuvering a huge, slow behemoth of a vehicle through drab, repetitive highways and crowded, narrow city streets while observing all the rules of the road and remembering to fill up with gas and stop for sleep. If you can tolerate repeating that task over and over until you've earned sufficient money, you get to buy a bigger, shinier rig so that you can -- drumroll please -- continue doing the same thing some more!\n\nTrust me, it is precisely as monotonous as it sounds.

It takes a little to get the hang of it but it is surprisingly addictive. Yes, it does get boring but overall its a fun game to play. Is it worth it when it ISN'T on sale? Eh.... not really.

And I have to say, I it's not as bad as I thought it would be. In Euro Truck Simulator you are thrust into the shoes of a truck driver in his own buisness. It takes a little to get the hang of it but it is surprisingly addictive. Yes, it does get boring but overall its a fun game to play. Is it worth it when it ISN'T on sale? Eh.... not really. If you really want it just get it, but if you can wait, wait until it gets cheaper.

Controllers are not turned on by default, and need tweaking to the settings to get working smoothly. The mini-map is awkward to follow with symbols regularly being obscured. The tutorial, for instance, instructs you to navigate to a symbol on the map which you won't be able to see, as it is hidden under another symbol. Warnings and dialog boxes are enormous and obscure your view, and menus can't be controlled with a controller or keyboard, only with the mouse. More importantly, the game-world lacks variety.\n\nCheers to the developers for trying something out that is different and potentially quite enjoyable, but I wouldn't actually pay money for what feels like an unfinished "concept" game.","July 18, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always seen this and i thought it was interesting since its the first entry in the series. Recently they had it in a humble bundle so i seen it and said it was the perfect time to pick it up.\n\nSo i could only play about 20 minutes of, which 15 of those where trying to set up the control system for my controller. Its bad compared to ETS2, it may be one of the worst games i have ever played. I dont even know where to start.\n\nFirst i was a using  controller but for the life of me i couldn't  turn down the steering senstivite as much as i did in the options menu it had no affect in the actually game. Than i couldnt place look left to right on any joysticks i had to use the mouse which usually isnt annoying but when you have a controller in one hand and having to move foward to move the mouse gets annoying pretty fast. I guess you can say thats a first world problem\n\nThe gps menu is horrible, i could follow it and all but its just bad i would rather just get a paper map.\n\nThe graphics are decent not the best but ok at least to me.\n\nThe settings to adjust the controls are there but they are very clunky.\n\nI would say more but i only played about 20 minutes till i said ♥♥♥♥ it.\n\nThe one thing I am glad that SCS did was learn from the mistakes of this game and make a great game with ETS2. The good thing is ETS2 is cheap enough to get for those looking not to spend a lot. Which i highly suggest, skip this altogether dont even think about just get ETS2.\n\n(Worst game ever maybe a little too far because there have been some horrible games out there)\n","February 28, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drive around, looking at environment as you try to do your best on deliveries; small goals with small challenges, that were momentarily rewarding.  The biggest problem I've found has been a lack of detailed roads and customization in your truck.  I'm not saying go crazy, but I never found any ways you could modify or trick out your truck at a small fee.  If they are there, it would have been nice to have the tutorial point you in that direction; this also kinda illustrates the problem with your truck/sleepiness/cargo status.  Didn't really make it clear what the ramifications are of not sleeping, following road rules, etc.\n\nBeyond that, its moderately interesting.  I feel like only a select few types of people would get enough enjoyment out of this to legitimize the full price, but at $2.50, might be worth a pick up if you're curious.","February 28, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like ETS2 but more simplified and to the point. Unlike in ETS2, you start with buying a truck, unlike the quick jobs in the sequel. A lot of things are different. All you have for roads are motorways, city streets, and buildup areas. There's no country roads, but I like it because it is simplified and more direct. One thing I don't like about this game is that the steering is way too jerky; there's no accelerated steering, meaning the longer you push the button, the more you steer. This problem can be fixed with a controller probably, but I haven't tried that yet. Also, dat menu music. It gets catchy, and I like it!\n\nAll in all, if you like ETS2, but if you are poor as ♥♥♥♥ or have a crappy computer, this is the game for you. It captures the essence of ETS2 and puts it in a package that is small enough for everyone to like.\n\nAlso, get this game whilst it's on sale. I got this game for $2 USD; dat's cheap!","April 6, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to do the same, don't do it with this version. Go for Euro Truck Simulator 2. In-fact, once Euro Truck Simulator 2 becomes, oh, seven years old or so, replace that recommendation with Euro Truck Simulator 3, or whatever nonsense they've added after "Euro Truck Simulator". These games incite cackles from friends, and a quick jaunt is fun enough, but, considering the appeal is already pretty low, you don't want to have outdated graphics on-top of it. And, if you haven't reached driving age yet, maybe just ignore my review altogether. I can see how this might be fun for someone that hasn't yet experienced the torture of sitting behind a wheel for hours-on-end.","December 4, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having a outdated laptop that can't run much, the older game runs like gold on any computer of the recent 4 years or more. I experience some drops in frame rate here or there but not enough to say it is a problem.\n\nThe game itself is quite simple. Drive from here to there. Pick your haul and your destination. It is a simple concept that can have you sink hours into the game. Since this was the first of its kind, there number of options is limited and few compared to the sequel. You can't make your own company, and there is no RPG style leveling system. You just haul to get enough cash to upgrade your rig.\n\nFor what the game is, I adore it alot and plan to keep playing it. There is a steep curve in progress from your starting rig to a better one, but aside from that there is plenty of things to do. I can almost compare this to my time spent on Eve Online as a freighter for ore and other goods. I even play some Southern Rock on my ipod while I play this game.\n\nThis is a game that you want to kill time with. Is ETS2 better? Well, of course it is a sequel. However, if you want a simpler version or you have a sub-par gaming computer, buy this. If you are up for a more complex and demanding game, buy the sequel.","December 29, 2013","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the moment you are transplanted into the cab of a powerful European Truck (not to be confused with those wussy American trucks) you will be hooked!  Speaking of hooking, trailer hitching is so realistic!  I had to wipe the beads of sweat off my brow after the furious 10 second leadup to pressing T to connect the trailer.  It was VERY INTENSE.\nMy first route from Rome to Milan was almost cut short by a blue fiat that cut into my lane.  Thankfully, the braking is very realistic and I was able to stop the massive truck on a dime.  I still hit the car, resulting in a small fine and no visible damage to my truck, which is again the utmost in realistic simulation action.\nEurope is painstakingly mapped, featuring realistic rocks and trees and two or more roads per country that connect both of the major cities.  And you have the choice of delivering meat, cheese, milk, and other important European commodities.  Such diversity of experience.  It is an endless source of wonderment that represents the pinnacle of modern video gaming.","March 18, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had almost no fuel left and the drop off point was straight ahead... I was shouting and chanting and I made it. I was given £500 for the trip and then £200 was taken off of my total due to taking 3 days longer than I was meant to. "Ok" I said to myself as I scrolled down the list of money added and taken off my trip. -£100 for incorrect light usage... -£150 for driving on the wrong side of the road... and finally -£100 for going through red traffic lights and crashing... I had lost £50 from this journey. I felt awful. I took the next load of items and began to drive off... Then I ran out of petrol. Another was of money lost. This time it was £1000.

If you want to do the same, don't do it with this version. Go for Euro Truck Simulator 2. In-fact, once Euro Truck Simulator 2 becomes, oh, seven years old or so, replace that recommendation with Euro Truck Simulator 3, or whatever nonsense they've added after "Euro Truck Simulator". These games incite cackles from friends, and a quick jaunt is fun enough, but, considering the appeal is already pretty low, you don't want to have outdated graphics on-top of it. And, if you haven't reached driving age yet, maybe just ignore my review altogether.

I had almost no fuel left and the drop off point was straight ahead... I was shouting and chanting and I made it. I was given £500 for the trip and then £200 was taken off of my total due to taking 3 days longer than I was meant to. "Ok" I said to myself as I scrolled down the list of money added and taken off my trip. -£100 for incorrect light usage... -£150 for driving on the wrong side of the road... and finally -£100 for going through red traffic lights and crashing... I had lost £50 from this journey. I felt awful. I took the next load of items and began to drive off... Then I ran out of petrol. Another was of money lost. This time it was £1000.

Expand your area of influence by purchasing rights to a country neighboring yours, and choose carefully between paying for upgrades for your truck or buying a new and better one.\n\nSo why would I say such good things about it and give a "NO"? Simple: Everything Euro Truck Simulator does, ETS2 does twice as well. And then ETS2 does a lot of things the original does not. Such as having an in-game radio allowing you to listen to Euro Truck Radio.

But what I do have a bit of an issue with is the AI...  The AI in Euro Truck Simulator drives aggressively.  They honk if you're not going top speed the moment a light changes, they constantly want to pull in front of you (and then apply their brakes), they want to apply their brakes also if you happen to change lanes and are now behind them.\n\nI was driving southbound from Belgium to Paris, and checked my map, I needed to make the next right turn.  But there was a merge from another highway onto the same highway I was on before the right hand turn.  Oh boy.  So another truck hauling wood turns in from the right and for whatever reason doesn't merge, but he makes sure to keep SAME SPEED.  I speed up, he speeds up.  I slow down, he slows down.  What an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  So I brake rapidly and pull into the lane behind him at 60, he slams his foot on the brakes, and bam, rear ended him because this guy did not want me to get where I was going with my cheese.\n\nYelling profanity and quit the game.\n\n10/10, will truck drive again later.","April 16, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also pretty relazing, driving through the countryside. However, one thing that I'd like to point out, is that there is no auto-save. I was hoping there would be some kind of backup save system, but there isn't. Not to say that this is really a bad thing, but just remember to save fairly frequently. My computer just crashed, and I lost all my progress since last night, which is a total of about 7 hours...

But the trucks look way better strangly in the first one. This game requires more skill than its sequel, instead of gps's like the first you use the map, wich is more hard in some cases but i would recomend this game.
