Bring out the pitchforks!!\nThe developer is VERY involved in the forums, and many of the bugs/fixes/changes adressed there have been taken care of.\nThe developer promised to work on a modding extension after the release.\nBattlecam!! It has been implemented and works great, with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling. Great!\n\nCONS:\nGameplay feels a little light, specially if you compare it to old school tbs games like Silent Storm, JA2 or Fallout tactics. Hopefully the tank play will compensate that.\nIn order to make the gameplay more fluid, prone/kneel/stand positions have been changed to a more fluid "kneel while standing still, stand while running/shooting for cover - no prone" mechanics. More fluid, but also lighter.\nWhat I LIKE:\n\nSetting.\nGraphics and game concept.\nGame mechanics.\nFull ballistics engine.\nDestroyable enviroment (promised by developers, not yet implemented).\nInteractive fauna.\nGraphical display of Action Points, both in the small valve like dial, and in the movement line, where it shows you in easy to read green-amber-red tones how far your character can move before running out of AP.\nPart of the game is developed in  Blender, which is Free and Open Source Software, and it's released for linux.","October 3, 2014","true","12.8"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","47","50","0","1"

Its a beta, so don't expect all those features to be implemented just yet. When you expect a game in its Beta build to be fantastic, youll only end up disapointed.\n\nTake Kenshi as an example. I've been following Kenshi for years, ever since version .2. It was a terrible game back then, with no base building, no crafting, just a bunch of dudes swinging swords. But I didnt not immediately dismiss it, saying the music was terrible (because there was no music), or the AI was the dumbest I had ever seen (because it was) or the fact the it was incredibly ugly (God was it ugly). No, because I did not expect a complete game. I liked what the premise of the game was, so I backed the developer so they could further expand the game into what they wanted it to be.\n\nThat being said, the game still needs to have a little bit of work done. But as it is in Beta .3, I can forgive many of the faults I find in it. The music is ok. Not great, but not terrible. The only major complaint I have had thus far is the damn whistleing. And when the biggest fault you can find in a game is the fact they sometimes whistle the begining of the Indian Jones theme song, It cant be that bad of a game.","June 2, 2014","true","1.0"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","43","54","0","0"

How would have gone the history, if some historical events had not been like the ones which had taken place? What if the USA had still been a colony of Great Britain? For people who like me loves history it can be very attractive try to find out the answers to such questions. This game will try to answer some of them. And as soon as it tells us about the Great War we also will find a lot of new about this epoch.\nSpeaking about the gameplay. This game is a tactic game, I don't play a lot of games of such genre, but it took me a little time to understand the mechanics of Steam Squad, so I feel pleasure in it. As soon as this is an early access, there are still a lot of things, which one can improve. But the guys make a great progress from version to version, so I hope the release version could be great.\nI liked the style of the game, the historical backend, the authenticity of the epoch, the game engine, the music.\nThe things I think the guys should work on is the AI. It could be better.","December 9, 2014","true","2.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I like graphics and the story very much. The game is stable although it is yet an early beta and I had a lot of fun playing the first mission. According to developers, they are going to add vehicles and cannons soon. I'm waiting for these additions and wish to developers a good luck with all new features.","May 12, 2015","true","70.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmorph/recommended/290870/","nightmorph","NightMorph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmorph/","489 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Recommended Title-\nSteam Squad is a "Steampunk" Turn Based Strategy game, currently available as early access  (in Beta - currently v0.371b)\n\nWhilst the game is based on "The Great War", it's historical content does not include the Entente and Central Powers forces per se, but the British and "Exotic Asian" (Han) forces instead, this dynamic is interesting - and refreshing and sets a very plausible scene.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330512716\n\nThe main character in the story is a British Captain - Ken Whitehall, and his troop of "Gentlemen", whom are battling the "Han". The storyline follows Ken and his men, through different missions as they undertake the battle and stop the march of the Han.\n\nVersions:\n\n0.31 June 2014\n0.32 July 2014\n0.371b October 2014\n0.40b November 2014\n0.41b December 2014\nView latest changelog\n\nThe graphics in Steam Squad are still being developed, they are similar to Men of War in it's current state. The artwork is interesting and fun, with of course a steampunk look.\n\nThe Gameplay is the typical turn based type, where you get to move your troops into position, fire at the enemy and then end the turn,waiting for the enemy to make their move. As always, placement of the troops is important, as the Han are very good shooters!\n\nSteam Squad will include tanks, artillery and other "steam" powered instuments of war ,which will be drivable. This increases the playability value - and turns this game from a typical strategy shooter. Destructable environments are currently not included, but will be at a later date.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=331276120\n\nThere is no ability to control the camera - other than panning (zoom is not enabled), and the camera does not focus on the enemy when they take their turn. I believe that some camera tweaks are being worked on and will be released in a later version. The camera view is dimetric.\n\n**Update v 0.371**  The camera now follows the actions of the player and npcs. It also includes the zoom function. These improvements have made a big difference to gameplay.\n\nThe UI looks great, but again, some work needs to be done on this to make it more polished and easier to use. Having said that, it does not stop you being able to have an enjoyable game.\n\n**Update v 0.371**\nThere have been tweaks made to the UI, both in the main menu, mission selection, and gameplay screens.\n\n\nThe music is ok, the  background effects lack the atmosphere of explosions and gun fire. . more needs to be done with improving the audio emmersion.\n\nOverall, Steam Squad performs very well, and is not a walk in the park to play. It's an early beta, so expect that there are going to be things that are missing, don't work, or need improvement. The developer - Bretwalda Games - is constantly working on Steam Squad with an further update v 0.371 just released.\n\nI think that there is plenty of room for Great War era games such as this, in a overly populated Second World War gaming universe.\n\nI recommend Steam Squad, even in it's current Beta build, it shows great potential, and whilst Bretwalda Games are a relatively new company on the scene, the quality of their work, and commitment to ensuring that the comunity voice is heard equates to what I hope is a very successful game.\n\nDefinately a strategy title to add to the collection at under $10 doleros, if you don't mind putting up with a few annoyances along the beta journey, until release. And help support smaller develop studio's.\n\n7/10","October 24, 2014","true","19.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Finally after recent updates - being able to equip its own squad and use heavy machinery, decided to go for into playing in it. If to summarize its pros and contras, here they are:\nDifficult to accomplish missions if you do not play accurately and smart. Soldiers are killed with 1-2 shots or grenade and you have just few of them - like it when it is hard :-)\nGood looking and high quality graphics, music, game mechanics etc;\nUpdates are coming every week and as it have been told by developers it is scheduled to be ready in full this summer already. Feels like it is progressing fast to be finalized;\nCons:\nStill too few missions :-( and only one is so far with tanks and artillery;\nQuite many of the iconic symbols of Great War are missing - barbed wire, gas, cavalry attacks...or at least I did not see it yet - did not find info from developers if they plan to have it","May 27","true","21.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I don't really know what an early access beta is supposed to look like, but I can't imagine this is it. Played the first scenario (I guess). There was no tutorial. There was no explanation of the campaign. It is quite obvious that English is a second language.  I am hoping the game will get the attention it needs I really like the concept, but right now if I could I'd ask for my money back.","June 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"

The screen pan is really awful. Game play is far too slow. There's no way of telling whether you're damaging the enemy until a soldier dies.
