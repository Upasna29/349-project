(well, free-ish)\n\nHate reading? Watch this review in video form!\n\nPros:\n_Fun, engaging gameplay that focuses on action.\n_Good looking units and maps.\n_Diverse arrays of unit types with different playstyle.\n_Short matches that are easy to get into.\n_Decent launch.\n_It's free.\n_Less hardcore than Starcraft 2.\n\nCons:\n_A little Pay-2-Win (read more below)\n_Might not be super competitive in the long run compare to some of its contemporaries.\n_Less hardcore than Starcraft 2.\n\nTry it if:\n_You're a fan of RTS.\n_You're NOT a fan of RTS but looking for a nice entry point into the genre.\n_If you like RTS but not the base building.\n_If you have time to try out a free game.\n\nPass it if:\n_You want a deeper, more classical RTS experience.\n_If you're not a fan of RTS in any shape or form.\n_If you want something ultra competitive.\n\nNow, for more details...\n\nThe gameplay hook: Remember World in Conflict? This game is sort of like that. There's no base building or resource gathering. Rather, they give you a handful of units you get to control, and you have to work with other commanders to win. The game is won by capturing and holding points. What ends up happening is a constant rotation to try to catch people at key points and fight them. The maps are designed around this too. There are plenty of vantage points and hiding spot to set up for ambushes. The game is a constant stream of skirmishes and fights. It's fun.\n\nOn the topic of Pay-2-Win: The game IS Pay-2-Win, make no mistake about that. There are units that you can buy with real money, as well as a variety of perks. With that said, everything in the game that affects gameplay can be EARN with in-game currency as well. So in theory, you can just play the game without spending a single cent on anything. But the fact that it's possible could become an issue in the long run. The game somewhat mitigate this however, but locking perks behind EXP that you HAVE to earn by playing the game instead of paying. A good decision on their part.\n\nThe final words: Overall, I think it's a fun game when it comes to it's raw gameplay, and while it's a bit P2W in nature, it's absolutely free to try. So you won't lose anything but some time. It's deffinitely worth a try.\n\nThanks for reading!\nIf you liked the review, consider hitting the thumbs up so more people can see it, and join my Steam group in order to be notified everytime I review something, as well as meeting and interacting with new people.\n\nSubscribe to my Youtube channel, where I cover new, obscure games in video format. It really does help me out a lot morale-wise to have people watching content I put together.\n\nOn that note, follow me on Twitter, too!\n\nMy name has been Bob, thank you for your time.","November 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 234 of 275 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","234","275","9","1"

Look at their downvotes!\n\nThe Good, the Bad, the Ugly:\n\nThe Good:\n-Fun, tactical gameplay\n-Short, yet exciting games (no 45+ minute LoL or Dota matches here!)\n-Interesting units\n-Easy to pick up and play, but lots of depth for mastery\n-Free maps! Petroglph updates the game regularly.\n\nBad:\n-Units are horribly unbalanced.\n-Unit AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Tell a unit to move when being fired upon, and often it will sit in place, turning in place, causing it to die. VERY frustrating. Units don't know how to turn around and take another route with one is blocked.\n\nUgly:\n-EXTREMELY Pay 2 Win\n-Buy your way to more perks, better units, and more supplies\n\nWant to buy your way to victory? I wrote a guide to show you how!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/399660/discussions/0/496881136906919716/\n\n\nExamples of others confirming Pay 2 Win:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/399660/discussions/0/496880503056797754/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/399660/discussions/0/496880503060516882/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/399660/discussions/0/496880503064162304/\n\n\nSome people asked for clarification on the Pay 2 Win aspect:\n\nWhile you CAN earn everything in game through gameplay, the amount of time it takes to grind out a SINGLE unit tree (there are over a dozen) would take about 80+ hours of gameplay, assuming you're an above average player and you don't pay for any "Premium" time. Whereas a brand new player can unlock everything buy stacking boosts resulting in EIGHT TIMES FASTER PROGRESS AND 8x MORE IN GAME CURRENCY.\n\nIf you have all 5 perks maxed out and all the unit skills unlocked, you will DOMINATE a player who hasn't unlocked said battalion perks and skills. There is NOTHING wrong with allowing players to pay to unlock things faster, ala Battlefield 4 Battlepacks, but requiring players to grind this much for HUGE gameplay advantages is unethical, IMHO.\n\n"Perks" are similar to CoD's perks. There are perks to take less damage, units move faster, do more damage, etc etc. There are dozens avalible. These aren't tiny amounts, we're talking 20%+ increases to default values. This is a SIGNIFIGANT gameplay advantage, but takes dozens of hours for a free player to unlock, ASSUMING you're above average and win 3/5 games (against people who are paying for the above mentioned advantages against you)\n\nI have played ALL previous iterations of this game, including the original "Victory Command" before they pulled it from Steam, and once they finally released it, I played the Beta of this game from Day 1. I gave a lot of feedback directly to the devs via their forum, and they failed to respond to my and other players concerns about game balance, placing profits ahead of players.\n\nOverall, this IS a good game, at it's core, but I cannot recommend any game that is "F2P" but requires a substantial financial investment to win unless you're willing to put as many hours into it as you would a WoW character.\n\nBefore someone says, "What do you expect"? Ever heard of Smite? AMAZING MOBA that is completely free with only COMSMETIC upgrades you can pay for. BB could have gone this route, but they decided to make a P2W game instead. If this changes in the future, I will update my review to reflect it.","November 4, 2015","false","14.1"," 116 of 173 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","116","173","4","5"

Notably they also removed PvE mode, making any PvE supply grind unavailable.\n\n\nI nearly maxed a battalion(last tier) and noticed how my supplies were dwindling increasingly constantly as I gained the progress, as I recall somewhat even with premium time active it dwindled in the end, after finally noticing a ~50 or so quite systematic supply loss per game I quit as I realised things would only get much worse in the end.\n\nNotably I neither used supplies actively in games through abilities nor was I using maximum supplies for a battalion bonuses, so I was already not at all using the supplies to the extent they are designed to be consumed.\n\n\nDon't waste your time, it had some good ideas, but a very bad exectution involving P2W.","January 2","false","61.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The gameplay of a tight-knit RTS.\nThe teamwork of a summer camp tug-o-war match.The tactics of a fast-paced strategy game.\n\nDon't let some of the negative reviews sway you, (a good look and you can mostly tell they're short rage posts anyways)\nthis is a great F2P game.\n\nThe gameplay feels like a standard RTS, the way you order your units around, but there's no base building, and you are limited to what units you start with. Lose a unit, and it's gone. You don't get it back.\nThis makes things like zerging impossible, as you can't just spawn a steady stream of guys to throw at an enemy. Each one of your units is one life, and each one lost weakens you that much more. Likewise, each one the enemy loses weakens them.\n\nBattleBattalions is built around a Rock-Paper-Scissors style damage system. This is something important to understand when going into the game. The rocket trooper beats tank, tank beats machine gun buggy, and the buggy beats the rocket trooper.  If you're playing with the troopers and come across a group of buggies, you're best off getting the heck out of there rather than trying to stand and fight. You'll find you do significantly less damage against them, and they do bonus damage against you.\nAside from the basic units, there are several other styles of forces to suit your play style, each with a different balance or type of armor and weapon. Knowing what you're strong or weak against will make a big difference.\n\nAnother important note is that a lot of people seem to think this is a deathmatch. It's NOT. The base of the game is capture point control. Yes, you CAN win the game by eliminating the entire enemy team, but that only happens about 1% of the time.\nTeam play is VERY important in the game. Coordinating with teammates can make or break a game for you, and I've seen countless games where one well coordinated team utterly crushed a team that didn't work together. Support your team, and play for the win -not the kills-, and you'll do a lot better.\n(btw I played the game a LOT off of Steam. Don't let my Steam game time fool you.)\n\nThe game overall is solid, and well polished, A lot of things behave and sound the way you'd want them to in a normal RTS. Petroglyph's pedigree shows here.\nThere's a variety of different units, as well as a progression tree for each one. You can also start mixing and matching as you unlock things.\n\n\nEverything that's important is unlockable for in game currency, and the only things that are real-money exclusives are the cosmetics, taunts, and premium access.\n\n\nI HIGHLY recommend checking out some of the tutorial or community videos on the game to learn a bit about it before playing.\nI myself have made a couple you can find here:  Battle Battalions Quick Tutorial\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n\n- Solid, well polished gameplay.\n- Great Teamplay\n- Short, intense matches that usually last 7-15 minutes.\n- AI/PVE mode for practicing or trying out new battalions.\n- Non-P2W, money is for cosmetics, taunts, and premium.\n- It's NOT another friggin' mobile F2P\n- Developers, while quiet, are actually listening to the community.\n\nCons:\n\n- Matchmaker sometimes needs to be poked with a stick.\n- Progression on a battalion can get grind heavy.\n- The cosmetic items available for purchase are a bit weak, atm.\n- No in-game tutorial for new players.\n- The golden turd taunt just costs a ridiculous amount of money. No, seriously. (I know it's a joke)\n\nOverall I'm quite enjoying the game, even though I tend to shy away from more intense PVP games. It feels like a real game, not a hashed up early access thing missing it's legs and half of it's head, like so many other "f2p" games on Steam. It may not be for everyone, but give it a shot and you might find you like it.\n\nI also have to give credit to Petroglyph for still honoring all the people that bought into the Victory Command packages, and giving them the equivalent in BB. A classy move.","November 4, 2015","true","102.9"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","40","62","0","4"

I like games that I have a very long term goal, that is possible if you play enough... such as for example the seriously 2.0 achievement from gears of war 2. A very rare thing to have, but something to show off if you like the game a lot.\n\nThe tutorial... well it is a bit of a confusing game at first, but once you pick it up, it is very fun.\nThough the solo queing experience isn't very fun, if you are playing with a single friend it is like an addiction. Problem with that is you can only have one friend playing with you currently as there is probably a bit of lack of playerbase for enough people for 5v5 PvP games. Though it can still be fun with up to 4 other friends in coop.\n\nAnyone starting out, don't get discouraged because the game is a little confusing.\nMy advice to everyone new is look though some gameplay footage, probably grind out or buy all the units, try them all (for the love of got in coop) and stick with it until you max it.\n\nI know this is a bunch of negative stuff, sorry. I really like the rest Exp system that encourages playing multiple units. The devs are very interactive and extremely friendly. As far as I know, it seems they know what they want their game. There is a reconnect feature, there is coop for the casual players, there is even solo games that allow you tot test stuff.\nFor the most part the community is fairly nice with of course the negative person... probably just a little frustrated after losing some units due to a a bit of unlucky positioning or lack of teamte response.\nWith enough community, maybe a custom lobby system, and replay system (some time in the future hopefully). I think this game could be a great ESL game.","November 3, 2015","true","133.2"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","28","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmgctrl/recommended/399660/","dmgctrl","Damage Control","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmgctrl/","41 products in account","I will only include a comparison between Victory Command and Battle Battalions; and yes you should play this game.\n\nPros;\n- Units no longer have the old ridiculous lore backgrounds stories but a proper explanation of their abilities.\n- Since perks are scattered between battalions, you have to unlock at least 5-6 squad to build your desired perk set. This forces players to play with other battalions as well and I think it is somewhat good.\n- Global Experience conversion and utilization is fantastic\n- A very broad store which allows you to customize your units to its extent. Skins, taunts, portraits etc.\n- Updated unit responses ( I favor this alot )\n- An enhanced research tree\n\nCons;\n- I started to believe this game seriously requires a forced tutorial. Make a forced to play tutorial with rewards (gold, credit, supply, global exp etc.)\n- Suffers from playerbase being small, very long quenes in week, but this will surely eliminated when this game gets the popularity it deserves.\n- I found myself in a game with 4 crusader squad as I was playing hellfire.\n- You can still witness some vehicles sway away like a fish would do.\n- Activate-able perks doesn't appeal me\n- Although I'm aware that people make games to make profit, which is totally understandable, but I found store prices quite expensive. As now I'm awaiting discounts.\n- Requires advertising, I bet there are people who still await victory command be back online.\n\nLike in VC, I rate BB 8/10 worth to try.","November 30, 2015","true","61.3"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","9"

You can view a detailed tutorial at Battle Battalions - Quick Tutorial\nBattalions (Units) can be divided into 3 main categories - Armoured (Blue) / Light Vehicles (Brown) / Infantry (Green)\nEach individual unit can be used to counter one other type of unit and is weak against another. (Or itself, like Skirmishers, an Infantry unit that is strong against Infantry)\nPros:\nNot Pay to Win. 40+ hours of gameplay has allowed me to unlock 7/12 battalion types and multiple Perks, not including the original 3 given. I have not spent any money yet. Only cosmetics (Unit skins/Taunts) require real money payment.\nStarting 3 battalions cover 3 major basic roles in the game (Zone Control/Scout/Damage)\nEasy to learn, but with a lot of loopholes that allow for strategies\nAll necessary details about unit abilities, strengths and weaknesses are clearly described and listed in-game\nExperienced players only have a slight boost to their unit abilities, but it is not major. (4 Perk Skirmisher Infantry Battalion still completely die to being burned by the flamethrower of a 2 Perk Dreadfire battalion =D)\nImmediate action without having to build bases\nShort waiting time of about 5mins for each match\nUnit balance of the current battalions are good. Each has their strengths and weaknesses. (For example, shooting a Rifle against an Armoured Tank isn't effective, in game or in real life)\nBattalion Abilities - You can still kill other player's units when all your units are dead! (Artillery Barrage, anyone?)\nCons:\nAs mentioned earlier, this game is very difficult to master. It can be very frustrating to newcomers, especially when the battle situation can change in a matter of seconds.\nNo reinforcements during battles. Losing a unit means it is gone from the match for good. (Life is precious)\nIt takes some time and effort to purchase and develop new units, which you will be rewarded for (3 Perk Hornet Battalion should generally beat a 1 Perk Hornet Battalion. I stress should because I have seen otherwise =/)\nWaiting time may vary, depending on the unit types you use. (Non-standard unit types like Sniper Battalion etc. will take longer as generally only 1 set can be in one match, I think, and it is popular. Core Battalions like Dune Runner and Juggernaut Battalions have shorter waiting times.)\nNo base building or resource management normally present in full RTS games.\nBattalion match-ups can be quite interesting. (Sniper vs Full Armoured/Light Vehicle Team =), which the Sniper's team won)\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, this is a very smooth and well-developed RTS game which can be played for short periods of time with each match taking about 20 minutes. So far, I have not seen any bugs or issues, and the game has not crashed at all. On the other hand, there are quite a lot of well-thought-of functions (Players who disconnect in the middle of the match can rejoin the game once they re-connect / Players who have died can still affect the battle while spectating). I am greatly enjoying my time playing Battle Battalions.\n\nI would highly recommend that you try this game out for a while and see if it interests you.\n\nP.S. For all Shattered Galaxy Fans, this is probably an alternative game most similar in concept to Shattered Galaxy at the moment.

Ignore the bad reviews and try it if you like RTS and/or Moba games or ever played with toy soldiers or table top games.\n\nPlayers get to command 1 of 3 battalions initially. These are Jeeps x 12, Tanks x 4 or Rocket troops x18. There are 15 battalions in total all of which can be unlocked without spending a cent. You get a crazy amount of customisation options from 6 perk slots with potentially 100 perks to chose from, Special abilities, and even mixing in units from other Battalions you own.\nUnlocking the battlions you want is quite quick as F2P. Getting all the perks you really want can be time comsuming as they may be spread through the progression trees of multiple battalions.\n\nI think the large amount of bad reviews must be due to people not understanding the games damage mechanics. Rock,paper, scissors (RPS) forms the basis of how effective your units will be vs other units. The game makes this very clear but it does not stop countless noobs going "TANKS! HELL YEAHS!" and then getting ripped apart by rocket troops, rage quitting and writing a bad review.\nMap awareness is crucial to avoiding horrible encounters. That said every unit can be air evacced after a few second delay to your base where your units heal quickly. This has no cool down. You press 'q'. Units depending on their abilities may have other ways to counter bad situations also. The game is played by 2 teams of 5 players (or bots if you have no cahones) which means there will more than likely be someone(s) who you should hunt on the other team and someone(s) you should avoid. Tanks can kill troops, and most troops don't do much to tanks it is just inefficient unless your tanks are flame throwing tanks. Your Attack has an RPS and so does your armour. Many things can help mitigate the RPS like cover, perks, range, shooting the back of tanks, AoE to grouped units etc etc. In other words if used correcttly your rock could defeat somebodies paper.\nYou don't need to fire a single shot to win the game as there are 3 primary objectives on each map that accumulate points for you if your team hold more than the enemy. There are many secondary objectives providing worthwhile bonuses when controlled also. All maps are very well designed and that is one of the strengths of troop battalions.\n\nWhen new it can be a good idea to follow somebody who would wreck the enemies you should avoid. This way you can cover each other and both be much more effective in a fire fight.\nGame is loads of funs, very slick, very free, can only last 20 mins maximum, simple and deep. Get it before stock runs out!\n\n8.34 out of 10.72.

A Simple yet great concept with a lot of depth. I've played this in its various beta stages and have yet to get bored of it. Units are well balanced (If you know what you are doing), gameplay rewards you for forward thinking and smart play and yet you don't have to micro-manage quite as much as other strategy games and can instead focus on strategy. This also makes this game very lag-resistant, so if you're connectively challenged and can't play other competitive games because of it, definitely check this out.","November 4, 2015","true","20.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

It does have the option (like all free-to-play games) to buy and unlock things immediately.  Which to newcomers might appear as a big disadvantage. But its not, the thing you have to remember is the game has extreme balancing. So if you try to attack a unit which you don't matchup against you will get smoked very quickly.  Its very simple, the game even tells you before the match starts which units you should attack and which you should avoid.\n\nAs you play the game and unlock new traits and abilities you'll be able to customize your batallions more and allow you for more adaptability.  Also by level 3 you get gifted 10k in credits which is enough to buy any new batallion.\n\nIf you like mobas, and the combat of an rts then you should like this game.\n\nThere are of course a few things which need to be improved but I'm sure with time and player base they will.\n-Auto pathing is a bit weak, doesn't adjust to team and enemy units that are blocking a path.\n-Matchmaking is a bit off since the player base isn't large enough to match all new players with new players.\n\nThose are the only two complaints I have with the game at the moment.","November 6, 2015","true","164.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Battle Battalions (Victory Command) is basically a simplified RTS, you command a battalion (a group of units) based on whatever type they are, like a variety of tanks and armor, or infantry squads like snipers, soldiers, etc.   In the standard pvp mode you group up with 4 other players and attempt to capture points and objective locations on the map. Whenever all of your units are defeated you are "out" and likewise, if you team loses all of there units or the enemy team collects all the objective points from teh captures, you lose the match.\n\nThe combat itself is pretty rock paper scissors, anti armor kills tanks, light vehicles and snipers shred infantry, that sort of thing, so there is lots of counter play and picking your battles.  If there are any real differences besides some of the ui tweaks, or the name change between this and victory command I cant see them at first glance.\n\nOverall the gameplay in Battle Battalions feel there, but I don't have high hopes for the game considering the fate of the (now dead) predecessor, Victory Command.  However that being said if anything I said above interests you, go for it and play, if you like the game you might end up helping it keep going!","November 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

I saw people moaning about how long they were waiting in queue but i was still prepared to wait and learn.When playing it was quite enjoyable if not slightly one sided to battalions with units and perks unlocked on the other team. However after playing for a couple of weeks i have to say this game is doomed.The main reason ?  Well,once you enter pvp battle you wait until some more players are ready,then wait,then wait again until 2 teams are ready.Shortest wait was 4 minutes,the longest today was 20 mins. Once ready you enter another screen where players confirm they are "ready" to play and then they dont which means all players go back to waiting in another queue......for another possible 10,15,20 mins to play.How stupid.....   This im guessing is because there are not many people on server.Or is it because now they have added matchmaking so you play people nearly to your own skill there arent that many people matched.When i want to play a game i dont expect to have to wait this long to even start a game. I think (my opinion) most people give up after 10 mins and go play something else as i have now done. Of the 16 hrs i have recorded for this game i think ive only actually played for about 2 hours.

I had wondered where this game had crawled off to. It's ok for free to play I'd recommend it if you throw no money at it. you can get just about all the units in the game with the ingame currency. your account lvls up and grants you cash shop currency every few to several lvls. pvp you lvl your battlions faster. The pve is good way to get your feet wet and learn how your battlions work while getting rewards.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect for any RTS  simple easy to work, the path finding is just as dumb or as smart as most other RTS games. Like End of Nations it relies more on your commander abilities it seems . you can runaway whenever you want and it's encouraged as your units die that's it no respawns unlike End of Nations or Shattered Galaxy\n\nThe game uses RPS which is not that uncommon just other games don't bother to metion it like it's a feature, it's like saying you gain XP in an RPG and lvl up on the box of the game. It's all ground vs ground combat infantry,  light vehicles, meduim, and heavy. the infantry is good at taking certain tanks, and can move in infantry only paths. Few vehicles are good at killing them like the dreadfire  tank (flamethrower tank personal favorite, Die in a Fire!). Then have heavy tanks that rip them a new one. When you down to one unit left it get enhanced and bigger likea hero unit in End of nation or Blizzard RTS games. Seems to do abit more damage and move a little faster, but i don't know for sure.\n\nThe odd issues i have so far are that the teleport runaway  seems work differently for unit types, infantry teleport near instantly compared to the dreadfires . oh i'm shooting fire at this infantry group they all geting hit? teleport in 10 seconf. while if i try to get the hell out of dodge with my tanks i lose like 1-2 of them and feels like nearly a minute to port away. also if your unit is good at killing somethig it doesn't feel like it is.  Also some odd ball things happen from time to time for example having a line of tanks hold a road an and infantry runs in and pushed your tanks out of the way. WTF are they feeding them?\n\nOveral it's ok not great not awesome, but it's not the worst rts game ever either. it's ok game if you just wanna blow some stuff up and have alittle fun.\n\nWeird things: Cash shop expense items are mostly goofy kill icons that get left behind when you kill a unit with some sort of sound effect "taunts" basically, You know teabag, turkey, poop. the cash shop has the premuim stuff gain xp and money faster like subscription type games. goofy paint jobs, account portraits.\n\nThey really need a Maybe button for reviews.","November 22, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This results in a reverse of the DOTA formula whereby instead of killing creeps and players to level up, you kill to deny your foes from their full potential and slowly eliminate them from the game.\n\nI like the idea but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.\nTroops level up after enough usage and this is your long term progression outside of combat whilst in combat there is no 'store' like most MOBAs have. But what does progression and leveling up mean? I couldn't tell you.\n\nThe game is very opaque in explanations and there was no wiki for it that I could find either. This left a lot of the games systems completely unexplained to me so I simply ignored them.\nIf you add features to a game and a player can do well even when completely ignoring them then why even bother adding them in the first place? Speaking of ignoring, this game features a cash shop because of course it does although  it may even possibly contain multiple cash shops because I counted five seperate currencies. five.\n\nI'm not going to bother talking about how convoluted those 5 currencies are because I'm not even sure my attempt at explaining them would make sense but you can convert some currencies into others and everything has its own unique currency because...Well just because. Normally that would be a little niggle, a slight annoyance but nothing more. However if you are the type to spend money on cash shop games then the cash shop in this game is just confusing so feel free to buy a currency, with no idea of what it does or what to spend it on.\n\nThe game has a lot of bad ideas cramped into a good concept and speaking of bad ideas, you can't kick players or vote kick players, nor can you even report them. This means joining games and idling is a fantastic way to grind all 5 currencies with zero effort. I highly recommend it too since the amount of everything you need to progress is insane!\n\nAfter 11 hours I am now lv2. I have no idea what being lv2 means but that is an indication about how long it takes to get things done.\n\nOverall I'd say wait andsee if the dev team can get their ♥♥♥♥ together. The game as it stands now is a mess but given a few updates it might get better and it shouldn't take much either. A better explanation of how things work or a streamlined system for upgrades and leveling up would improve the experience.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","November 6, 2015","false","11.1"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","23","45","3","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/recommended/399660/","waywardRTS","wayward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/","95 products in account","Battle Battalions is first and foremost a game about territory and teamwork. Each player’s forces confine them to a role within the match, broken up roughly along 3 main categories, or classes: Tanks, Light Vehicles and Infantry. Each individual Battalion (players can only bring 1 Battalion into battle at a time) is comprised of roughly 1-18 individual units of the same type (players can unlock the ability to mix and match multiple units within a battalion), with a variety of passive attributes. For instance, infantry units tend to be able to access more areas of the map than Light Vehicles or Tanks, though some Light Vehicles have the ability to enter Infantry-only areas. Light Vehicles are a broad category, tending to be faster but easier to kill than tanks. There are a wide variety of armor and weapons types that units may have, and many opportunities for counter-play exist within the system.\n\nAt the core, players must coordinate their physical location on game’s map to take and hold the points of interest while scaring off or eliminating enemy Battalions. And I don’t use ‘eliminating’ lightly – players are entirely unable to replenish units in a match: if you launch into a match with 4 heavy tanks, you can never get more and if one dies, it’s gone for the rest of the match! This makes any combat situation fraught with tension, as it’s quite possible to be entirely wiped out in a bad encounter, or slowly whittled down by enterprising opponents whose Battalions are designed to take out your own.\n\nIs Battle Battalions worth a try? Well, as they say, there’s no accounting for taste. I’ve been a long-time supporter of Petroglyph’s vision, especially with this formula, pioneered by End of Nations. Battle Battalions is a frenetic, fun and zany 5v5 tactical brawler. It’s cartoony and its attempts to create a squad-based tactics game are brave, laudable and for the most part well realized. It is the result of years of iteration and listening to player feedback, and it shows.\n\nThe store is a slight stumbling block, but the game itself is addictive and fun both for the individual and the organized team. It remains to be seen what market there is for such a game, but Petroglyph believes enough in this concept to have tried it four times in sequence, and I’m intruiged enough to join them for this ride yet again. I do hope that they continue to grow this game by adding new unit types, map types and advanced features like destructible terrain objects (e.g. bridges) and will be engaging Petroglyph to continue to iterate and innovate to prove to the world that this team-tactics format has lasting value.\n\nThanks for your time, and I hope to encounter you as an ally on the battlefield.","January 3","true","9.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

After playing it i decided i had to write a review so that I could give the game justice. For one reason or another the game has a mixed rating atm which it does not deserve at all. I hate to see this because I know that this rating will discourage people who will like this game from not trying it out.  I'll say three things and if you like these things at least give this a try.\n\n1. If you like and RTS game that has clear counters and is more focused on you individual control of the units and your own skill you will like this game.\n2. If you like working with allies to play a domination style themed game where teamwork and communitcation lead you to victory you will like this game.\n3. If you like customization of you own style is varied enough to where you wont often see many people play the same way you do, but similar enough to where no one gets a "dominate advantage playing one thing" then you will like this game.\n\nAll in all, the rating for this game just doesnt get the justice it deserves.\n\n-note for some reason it says I have less that an hour played, but I actually have about 100.

My units keep getting killed by random artillery strikes that give no warning. That and strange rockets that home in through solid objects like mountains, from whereever I cant even see. This game has the smallest view distance of any ive ever seen, and the spy drones hardly help... I never know where to go because I have no idea where the enemy units mine are designed to kill are, and commonly run into the ones I shouldnt. Im not eduacated on this but as far as I know, this is a reskin of Dota 2. It's nothing like a RTS I would imagine for example Supreme Commander, Company of Heroes, Halo Wars. For that I would say giving this the title of RTS is a bit misleading. If im correct, calling it a amoeba would be better (I spell that right?). Not into games like these personally and the microtransactions certainly dont help. Begginers get rekt (unless you live and sleep this genre) and team coordination sucks.\n\nGet this game if you like Dota 2, afterall it's free. Don't if your like me and want a strategy game that doesnt run on sheer luck.

However there is only one mode, capture the point / king of the hill mode.\n\nPros:\n- graphics are decent\n- detailed statistics for every match\n- there are various types of troops and each of them have special skills\n- pve and pvp\n- you can research better equipment (just like in WoT)\n- some achievements look nice i guess\n- you can play "Coop" as single player with bot team vs bot team. However im not sure how to trigger the single player option as it starts randomly after trying to find a match\n\nNeutral:\n- During match, killed units dont respawn (acctualy pretty good idea for this game)\n- You cant mix units, or make custom squads (there are heavy squads with 4 units, medium squads with 6/12 units and infantry squads with 18 units. You cant mix any of those, you cant have f.e. 6 infantry units and 2 heavy tanks,instead you must use only one type)\n\nCons:\n- no one is playing it (i suppose if you can persuade any of your friends into this it could work)\n- first thing that comes in front of your face when you start the game is.... "PURCHASE COINS"\nIm not sure if this game is p2w however there is alot of stuff to buy with real money (i couldnt test this because i never got to face other players and various types of squads, however the silencer tank squad seems pretty powerful)\n- developers abandoned it aswell","May 13","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
