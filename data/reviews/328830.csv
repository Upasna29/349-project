Initially the game wasn't great, the menu navigation and UI wasn't amazing, but after playing around with it for a while you get the hang of it and are able to move between sections easily. Whilst the graphics aren't great I don't think that's what this game is about. The in game player base is awesome with great depth. The match mechanics are okay, not a big fan but if you get the hang of the plays and what not it can be quite fun.\n\nSo yeah that's a broad look at the game. The killers for me however are more minute.\n\nThere's a few big problems IMO. First and foremost is the unrealistic simulated games. You can have a team of 'World Class' players and lose to a team of 'Nationals'. Look I know Rugby and I know you can't count anyone out and what not but this lead to a lot of head scratching from me.\n\nSome players are not up to date; e.g. Duane Vermeulan was argueably the best player in the world this year and he's rated as 'International'. So yeah there's a few cases like that, some players over rated and other underated. Which once again left me scratching my head.\n\nSometimes I felt as though my team simply sucked for no reason. I would have an awesome back line, they would have a crap one, set my tactics to play a more expansive game, and strangely, I lost. More head scratching...\n\nOverall though it's a fun game to play, if you're not a rugby fan, don't buy this unless it's on sale, I don't feel like you'll get $40 worth of satisfaction. I'll continue to play this game and learn more about the mechanics (still learning!).\n\nCons\n- Confusing/clustered UI\n- Unrealistic results\n- Some players not up to date\n- Bad graphics\n- One or two crashes\n- Players brought up through the 'Colts' and 'Academy' when selected for international duty don't have a name unless edited\n\nPros\n- In depth teams\n- Aweosme development of your players through your teams system\n- Accurate coaching system\n\n\n\n\n\n","December 10, 2014","true","56.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I'm Welsh. 11/10.\n\n\nOn a serious note though, this has all the potential to be another championship manager success. It's early in development, the graphics aren't pretty and there are a few flaws here and there but if you try to imagine just how many features there actually ARE in this game then the laws of probability say that's always going to happen on a first series game. Hell, even Football Manager 15 still has bugs and I can't begin to even imagine their budget compared.\n\nWhat we have here is ladies and gentleman is a fantastic glimmer of hope that we finally have a lose your life game for people who support a REAL game, Rugby Union. No diving. No tears. No hooligans.\n\nThe developers are supportive, listen and reply, and I am hoping that this could be the platform for something great. If they incorporated a similar match engine from a game like 'Rugby Dynasty', an online MMO (check it out, it's incredible) then I would probably NEVER leave this game.\n\nBravo developers.

The basic premise is pretty solid, and the functionality is pretty in depth so it should keep you engaged for a pretty long time. Particular highlights include the colts system - being able to bring young players through and shape them into world class players is what will keep me playing in the long term, and the player stats are generally not too bad, with the editor there for those which are questionable.\n\nFor me the biggest negative is the interface, which is frankly a bit of a mess and needs some serious thought going into it. The game really doesn't flow very well, and there is a pretty steep learning curve to be overcome.\n\nI've also noticed that the number of knock ons and penalties in a game is incredibly high, not sure if I'm doing something wrong but surely you shouldn't have to manually give a command to make players release the ball at every ruck, I'm currently seeing about 10 penalties against me per game for this and its beyond frustrating.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, as it is a very strong first effort which will only get better with incremental updates and I hope the developers will listen to the feedback they receive\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","13.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Having been disappointed with previous management titles released this year, I decided to purchase RUTM 2015 to see if this title could deliver and so far I have really enjoyed playing it.\n\nAs with any management game, it requires a couple of hours to familiarise with the UI and screen layout - And like others have commented, this seemed a little clunky at first, but given time I was able to get used to it without any problems.\n\nThe number of leagues and players is very impressive. Rugby fans will be pleased to know that both Northern and Southern Hemispheres are both represented, and there is even an editor that allows for players to customise their teams and alter the names of any unlicensed leagues, teams and players.\n\nThe match engine is intuitive and allows players to engage with their team and issue orders during a match. Adding Team Calls is a neat feature that can really help to change the outcome of a game.\n\nThe youth development and academy system is also something that I am particularly fond of, and it allows players to create a self-sufficient team that doesn’t cost a ridiculous amount to establish.\n\nI think RUTM 2015 has been a promising addition to the management genre and has set the bar for other Rugby games to follow.  If you are a Rugby fan I am sure you will enjoy this game.\n\nPositive Aspects:\n\n* Great player database and leagues to choose from – both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n* Different match engine approach with Team Calls and issuing orders.\n* Great Youth and Academy system, allows smaller teams to be built up over time.\n* In game editor which allows for plenty of customisation.\n* Lots of tactical options and statistics for players to tweak.\n\nNegative Aspects:\n\n* Slightly clunky UI and menu system.\n* 3D match engine graphics could be improved upon.\n","December 10, 2014","true","94.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

I felt that this was one I would have to try. Especially glad I did so now it has been updated for he 2016 season.\n\nDespite the clumsy interface that is not very user friendly, this game has some real plus sides. A lot of leagues, and a surprisingly extensive player database. I am enjoying the game with the recent 2016 season update which brings a fully updated player roster with real life transfers to the game and has the newly promoted teams.\n\nAnother great feature of the game is the Nations Cup game which allows you not only to control a national team and go head to head against all other Rugby countries throughout the world.\n\nTo break it down quite simply I thoroughly recommend this game to any Union fan. Sure it has the drawback of a clumsy interface but after a while you get used to it and it definitely doesn't detract from how enjoyable and in depth game this is. The extensive database and realism are huge pluses in this game.","December 21, 2015","true","35.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Despite being under no pressure.\n\nWhen your own fly-half kicks the chase is always horrendous and if their 15 runs at you he will normally do very well.\n\nTHis is a real pain as the second issue is that turn-overs from rucks are extremely rare and I have Sam Warburton playing 7 every game!!!!!!  I have also on instances driven the oppostion back from my 22 to theirs without gaining possession The issue with this is that the computer can have possession for almost an entire 1/2 especially if you win it back to just knock on! More turnovers are essential.\n\nThe game also doesn't notice things like the touch line when running or when a player is blatantly isolated.\n\nFor some reason when it gets to 80 or 40 mins even if you are 5m out from opp try line your fly half will kick the ball dead.  Not useful when you are on 3 trys and need the 4th for a bonus point.\n\nWhen players make a clean break through the line they will often stop and pass to a heavily marked player rather than continuing themselves (this has cost me several games/bonus points)  or they will not give the ball when there is a ridiculous overlap that is guarenteed a score.\n\nIt is very intermittent as to whether a player will try to but the ball down between the sticks after crossing the line unapposed,\n\nThere also seem to be some really basic back moves that seem to end up with a try.  Especially as some defenders run all sorts of crazy lines that completely miss all the attackers.\n\nFinally the back row never break off the scrum.  This ties into the point above, especially during a blindside move as it creates a ridiculous overlap.\n\nSO in conclusion this is a very good game and I do enjoy it greatly.\n\nHowever with the bugs/glitches mentioned above I don't believe it is currently worth it's premium price as the bugs glitches do somewhat ruin it, especially when games are tight and you feel like the computer is just cheating you.\n\nEdit: So as mentioned above the dev has issued an update that introduces more turnovers etc to the game that does give it a better feel.  There are still of course other bugs present still but the developer is continuing to update the game and is committed.  If you are considering purchasing this game, stop considering and start buying you will get a lot out of it!","December 18, 2014","true","31.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","6"

Forwards don't seem to be very athletic in the game (this does not represent modern rugby).\n\nThe game has depth in terms of leagues although there are problems with All Black, Wallaby and Bok clubs as all the players who play in Super 15 franchises ONLY play Super Rugby, not in any of the national leagues.  The national leagues from these three countries are not great as these players are missing and made up mediocre players make up the unions.  The unions that play in the Super 15 are totally seperate and this will be an issue if the game is to develop in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, among expats from these countries and among European fans who follow the excellent rugby from these countries.

Some elements are poorly implemented, for example having two equally competent physios is ignored by the auto-assign function, and you have to manually assign new injured players to either if you want your second physio to be used at all. the simulation is fair, with some issues. fights break out in nearly every game, which doesn't really reflect the modern game. sure it happens, but not nearly every game. It's not too hard a management game, you can see if your offer will be accepted or not, you just need to hit a certain level of agreement (dictated by the level of your club's Agent), so getting in better players isn't too hard.\n\nI don't mind the graphics. It's harsh to compare these games to the football managers of gaming, because it's early days. with enough support and dedication, this could be a cracking series, and good for rugby representation in gaming, and that's worth £30 to me","September 13, 2015","true","77.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
