In a way, that's the point.  Your character was not a happy man, and this is a dark moment.\n\nSeveral design choices are structured to make you uncomfortable.  The whispery narration volume forces you to strain to hear it over the jarring background sounds.  Background images subtly shake out of sync with foreground images, leaving you feeling queasy.  Puzzles include no context or clear goals whatsoever, leaving you disoriented.  The game opens with the most difficult puzzle, which adds an element of frustration on top of that.\n\nBut, again, that's the point.  All of it matches up perfectly with the dark story, the dark art style, the tense ambient noises.  Most likely, you've read this far because you enjoy art games that go to dark places.  This one does.  If, having read all that, you're still curious, this is probably the game for you.\n","May 14","true","1.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

I was even more hyped when the developer gave me a key to beta test the game. The art looked (and still looks) fantastic and creepy. It is a very unique game but feels a bit too amateur. It is really short, 20 minutes maximum, and still those minutes are filled with meaningless explorations. The narration is interesting, but its volume is so low that you will be literaly struggling to hear what's being said. I would love to see more from this game, and from the developers. I will be playing The Lady in the near future for sure.\n\nFor the time being, this game is a 4/10. I really want to change my review to something positive, and I hope I will.","May 3","false","8.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memulator/recommended/433750/","memulator","weed3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memulator/","245 products in account","The Grandfather is a short puzzle game that will most likely last you 30-45 minutes.\n\nFirst of all, the narrators voice is way to low, she is almost barely audible the first time you hear her. I suggest getting this fixed. Let it be known that this was the only issue in the game, I did not encounter any other bugs or issues so it's definetly a stable and well made game.\n\nThe Grandfather is a wonderfully illustrated horror game that tells you about a sad miserable grandfather who has never been loved by anyone, including his wife who enjoys torturing him emotionally by giving him the scariest version of the stink eye ever.\n\nOne night after going to sleep in his bed, separated from his wife's (wow that woman is a total ♥♥♥♥♥), he wakes up, none of his body parts present OR attatched to his body! Only his head, which also can float, he begins his venture to find his body parts, what he ends up with though, is better than what a paint brush could ever do.\n\nThe puzzles in The Grandfather were, honestly, not very difficult. Maybe I got stuck two times trough the whole game, the puzzles felt sort of meaningless as I just clicked at things, but they were fun to figure out when figuring out was needed.\n\nThe game was made in Unity 5 (which I highly suggest to any devs who are starting out, for real, get it, it's free) which most people enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at, however thanks to games like Firewatch, The Forest and the development hell beaut' Raindrop it's slowly getting a better reputation after it got slaughtered by the billions of Slender clones.\n\nThe Grandfather though, it's weird, it has this ugly yet pretty, cool looking style that gets accompanied by some nicely done lighting. It also has these short segments that are first person where you walk forward, these are also very nice. The illustrations of The Grandfather are done by the talented SaintYak, the art is very well done and characters have a nice artstyle going on, objects in puzzles look sort of sketch'y like if they were drawn quickly, really adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game.\n\nThere isn't really any music in The Grandfather, if there is then it's some sort of saw being played on, it's very weird and sounds kind of creepy... Or funny. Other than that there is omnious ambient noise going off most of the time, which works and fits the rooms you solve puzzles in. Whatever is there of soundwork is interesting and adds to The Grandfather's already creepy atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, I pretty much enjoyed The Grandfather, it was way cheaper than I expected it to be and it totally came out of nowhere as I forgot it's release date, I hope it does well and that more people will try out this little enjoyable, creepy game.\n\nI give The Grandfather a 8/10","May 3","true","0.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","17","23","4","1"

Be prepared for some elements to not make sense or even feel random. Also be prepared for an interesting exploration of ideas and a fairly strong story, though, which helps balance out the sheer weirdness of the imagery/gameplay.\n\nVisually, the game is amazing. The audio ties the strangeness together with almost alien sound effects. Initially, the voice over was too quiet, but apparently that issue has been addressed already, so good to see the devs responding quickly and positively to relevant feedback without compromising anything vital to the game's creativity.\n\nThe game play is fairly straightforward puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not always logical and the game does not hold players' hands at all. I found myself clicking on random things in random order to progress at least once, which was the only time I became frustrated.\n\nThe game lasts about half and hour or so, and the conclusion to the story is satisfying. This game probably won't blow your mind, but it will take you to places that no other game can. If you can stand a bit of confusion and frustration while valuing unique experiences, then this is the game for you.","May 4","true","0.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Very original. It felt like playing in an early David Lynch film, namely the dream sequence from Eraserhead. I liked the sense of dread that the art and music create, and the switch between the 3D and 2D environments gave it some depth as well. Overall, it's a cool little game that's not expensive and worth the experience.","May 21","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game shares a similar atmosphere with a dark narrative and a gritty art style. The story is decent, and the puzzles are fairly challenging, but only because they lack intuition. My only complaint is the game is extremely short (I beat it in a half an hour). But in any event, it's pretty good if you are into these games and at $3 it's worth the price. I would really like to see what else these devs could create with more support, and that in and of itself is worth the cost of admission.","May 20","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a really nice art style, but as others have mentioned, the narration is very quiet. The puzzles are fun, but they don't seem to progress.

I loved that, i really loved that.\n\nBut then the game itself... i dont know... you have to do some things in different rooms. Sometimes things are totalli random and you dont even know what to do. Once i went on clicking randomly till something happened, then I just got stuck because I didnt really know what to do. Things were too random.  And I am disappointed because i really wanted to know how the story would have ended.\n\nThe story itself was really really crepy and absolutely weird but... I wanted to know... sadly probably i will never.","May 4","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"
