Play online or even local coop online!\n- Build your own place to survive. You will spend some time before getting a good camp. With the most recent update, you can set a camp attack and defend it from zombies waves!\n- Kovac. This character is hilarious!\n- Various recipes for crafting. Literally everything is used for crafting, even junk you can melt in a foundry. No leftover.\n- Missions : you will go on several missions to gain xp and loot. You can increase the level of the mission for a “high risk, high reward” gameplay but you can also decrease it if you want to go on an easy way.\n- Battle gameplay. Use melee weapons or guns but don’t get outrun nor outnumbered otherwise you will have a bad time. You need to aim your enemy and keep it in sight for a critical shot. The faster you can get it, the better.\n- Post-apo weapons : you see that they are really made of what you used to craft them!\n- Finishing moves. It feels so good !\n- Flying pets!\n- Season events: we got thanksgiving or christmas missions and specific loots!\n- You can customize your character from the inventory at any time. (Topless character against zombies ftw!)\n\nCons :\n- It’s still early access. Some things are unfinished but as the time goes, we have less and less missing features.\n- Environnement is repetitive. It’s either swamps or city with the same look.\n- Some resources are hard to find, even quest related ones.\n- In order to craft/upgrade specific weapons or buildings, you will need to grind levels or farm resources.\n- The hunger and thirst does not penalize you enough. Having 0% hunger/thirst penalize you in combat (You will hit like a fly and your aim will be awfully slow) but your health will remain unchanged so it cuts the “survival” a half.\n- If you play in public, be prepared : you obviously have player killers, robbers and griefers. So I recommend playing with friends only for the best coop experience. (On the contrary, if you search for a “pvp” like gameplay style, go for it!)\n\nThe game is on the right path and has improved a lot since its launch so if you like zombies, crafting and survival in hostile and desolate territory, buy it, you’ll enjoy the journey. And of course, with friends. The more, the merrier! (With the notable exception of your resources.)","March 22","true","319.2"," 192 of 207 people (93%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","93","192","207","21","4"

So if you're using keyboard & mouse, it could be a little ambiguous when you first start the game. Just remind these keys below, then you won't have any significant problem during the play.\n\nX - Open Crafting & Inventory Menu\nC - Open Construction Menu\nSPACE - 'Next' in Dialogue\nESC - 'Skip' in Dialogue\n\nFirst GlanceI saw some negative reviews here, so I was a bit unsure whether I should purchase this game or not. However, most of the reviews are about miscellaneous minor bugs. I don't mind much about them because I believe Devs will try their best to fix those bugs as they did in HTS1.\n\nI had to purchase the game only based on HTS1, and my concern was mainly about the quality of the content itself. As of the moment, I think this game is fairly worth to invest.\n\nNow in HTS2, you can explore 2nd, 3rd story buildings in the field. You can make various weapons, armors, modules, portions, foods, and many more. And these items can be obtained only in Foundry, Chemistry Lab, Workshop, and etc, which all comprise the whole level system. There are some new types of animals using different moves which forces you to use different tactics. Also the way of proceeding quest lines has completely changed.\n\nHTS2 has some unique essentials, and they didn't just duplicate the former version of the game. They know what they are doing, and I feel somewhat obligated to support them. I just want to see how the next 3rd, 4th HTS goes. Most people who enjoyed HTS1 will understand what I mean.","December 9, 2015","true","18.8"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","49","57","3","1"

This strange man gives you tasks to help him help you and along the way you will find loot such as weapons, gear, armor, food and items to craft with. Set up a camp to help you store your unused items that are only weighing you down to continue forth and gather more materials to help you survive against terrifying zombies that are hoarding areas and building all for themselves. Build the best weapon to create the most devastating hits, and clear out your path to get to you objective safely.\n\nGet to know the game > Great wasteland/broken down villages and buildings\n> Crafting your own items from looting killed zombies or just things laying around\n> Play the story with a friend\n> Free roaming is just as fun as the story\n> Different weapons and armor stats increase or decrease\n> Brutal devastating hits\n> Break doors down to get inside houses\n> Gives a cool old school retro aspect of the year your in\n> Intense sistuations\n\nPros & Cons ++  Pros\n+ Great graphics\n+ Co-op\n+ Free roam\n+ Customization\n+ Detailed story\n+ Gore\n+ Easy controls\n+ Realistic\n+ Suspenseful\n+ Controller compatible\n\n-- Cons\n- User interface is uneasy to control (learn)\n- Slow at times\n\nSummary - Non Spoiler You are a surviver that gets help from another surviver that knows a lot about how to survive and guides you through missions and quests. He teaches you how to get things done. Along the way while doing these tasks or even just free roaming, you may find loot. You can find loot just about everywhere. Find items to help you craft better weapons and armor and increase your stats to help you survive longer. You can also craft a camp to help you store away items that you don’t need right away. Items have weight and can weigh you down and make you slower. Being over encumbered and becoming slower will greatly increase your percentage of death. Zombies may seem slow but do not take them for advantage, they will come from all directions, around corners and in hordes. You must make common decisions whether or not you should just stay and fight them off so you can reach your objective or quickly run and hide it out or find a safer way. This is not, just your usual zombie game where you can just plow your way though 100‘s of pounds of rotting meat. This game is realistic when it come to violence and you must proceed with caution. Be very strategic about you go about killing these monsters if you do not have the right medical equipment on hand.\n\nPersonal Opinion This is a great game and will be getting more to play with friends! The great graphics and story line are amazing and cant wait to live the zombie struggle in co-op mode! It makes it a hundred times better that I can craft my own camp that I can share with my friends and store away items that I don’t need that moment. The fact that its a free roam add to that great feeling of abandonment and the only way to survive is craft eat and drink! This is one of those good wasteland survival games but with a whole different view and great compatibility with the users.\n\nFinal recommendation: I deffenetly recommend this game to others! This game is great to play with friends so you may destroy countless zombies together and achieve survival with your buddy! I rate this game 8.5 mainly because the menus are a little hard to control and not many options to optimize your game. Not a big fan of the birds eye view, which they did a fantastic job of doing by the way, but makes it a little...distracting at first. I did not find a lot of cons about this game. Overall it just mainly needs a user friendly interface to let the user get in and out of the menus easier and quicker.\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","November 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","48","56","0","4"

Keyboard controls have largely been ignored with game prompts only showing as xbox controller prompts with no keybindings available.\nWhen interacting/talking your character is locked from movement while enemies can still attack.  Nothing quite like having a zombie beat down on you while you try to skip through dialogue with incorrect buttons being shown on screen.\n\nQuests are nothing more than disjointed fetch quests in maps that you get teleported to via dialogue.  Once fetch quest is complete you need to hold a button and choose "Quit" to complete the quest.  Very confusing, but then, most of the game is.\nOn one quest you get sent to a swamp to find 2 different types of flowers, but the flowers were not actual flowers, but loot boxes generic to the games loot system.  Really?   Flowers in a swamp are in loot boxes?\nEven the fetch quests seem lazy.   Sometimes it will ask you find items you already have in your inventory, but it will force you to find them manually on the map to count.   I encountered a quest map where the required items had not been spawned (I tried twice, 40 minutes the first time, then 30 minutes the second time).   They just were not there.\n\nGraphics are sub par but do the job.   The camera view is at a fixed angle, so although you can zoom in  or out, the game uses this strange effect to clip objects blocking view and it can be quite distracting.  I played on "Ultra settings" and textures were terrible and no anti-aliasing at all.   A lot of the textures were just plain ugly, with a stone texture being used for a desktop computer of all things.   Sometimes you'll notice areas where the walls, the shelves, the cabinets and mousepads/computers all use the same rough texture.\n\nCurrently game progression is broken, and there is a point where you can not continue.   A pretty major issue.   What's worse is that progression is broken at two difference quest branches.\n\nOver all this is a pretty rough release at the moment.   Only for die hard players that aren't put off by bug ridden frustrating gameplay with confusing design.\n\nVersion:  Release Build: Oct 29 2015\n-----------------------------------\ni7-4790K @ 4.00Ghz\nMSI GeForce GTX 980 Ti Gaming 6GB\n16GB ram\nASRock Z97 Extreme6\nSamsung 850 EVO Series 1TB SSD\n","October 31, 2015","false","20.6"," 163 of 242 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","163","242","9","8"

We've played this game together for at least 5 hours and we're still find this game as interesting and challenging as the first game.\n\nPros:\n-Character customisation\n-Build your character by using XP to level up abilities according to your own play style-no preset player abilities like the   first game.\n-Nice graphics.\n-No game breaking bugs are found so far.\n-It's getting more interesting when a city or town can be explored and looted.\n-Base building, which can allow players to craft items.\n-The visual of the characters' equipments can be turned off if it's too ugly or it hurts to look at.\n\nCons:\n-When playing local co-op, the camera view of one of the player on the first floor of the building and the second on the ground floor is a mess-I can't see a thing.\n-food is very hard to be found-both my friend and I are currently 0% hunger but with a lot of water.\n-No base capturing like the first one so far.\n-It seems like the players no longer needed to sleep anymore.\n-Lack of proper tutorials to follow-I've to look at the button configuration to figure out what can be done in this game.\n\nNeutral:\n-Monster Hunter style game play - Select a quest and teleport to a place to complete the mission.\n-Leveling up system-each skills need to be upgraded four time in order to aqquire the skill or to increase the level by one.\n\nBugs found:\n-I've found the bug that is - when a player is using finishing move on a zombie, an attack from second player toward the zombie will interrupt the finish. The player still performing finishing move but the zombie is free to attack the player while the player cannot move and being attacked.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHint:\n-Store your can food for crafting after building a Kitchen.

And so begins the list of why\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\n-Much better graphics than the first game, and much bigger areas to explore. No more claustrophobia or "Why cant i mount this ledge or move past this thing" Anything that sensibly could be traversed in reality can now be mounted or jumped off. While inside buildings, you see through a "Hole cut" system where the forground disappears, which is great because now the game can have interiors and other sequences the first didnt have, these all lead to super pleasing environments.\n-Every mission has its own environments and you can replay them all for loot or fun\n-Much more "Walking dead" and much less "Dead island' feel to this game, the forests and cities are much more friendly to my idea of what a zombie game should be like. Night no longer brings creepy lunatics who are afraid of light (At least not constantly, they however can occasionally appear), clearing cities at night is spooky and can make you jump, the amount of zombies is reduced from 1 but they are more lethal and you have to play smarter, which I prefer. In the first game it was always a "How many times can you empty the clip on your nerf gun" feeling, wheras in this one its like "Pick and choose your targets and sneak, and be ready for a zombie behind every door"\n-Kovac.... Just... Kovac\n-After playing till i got a gun, i can confirm they are no longer air powered, long story short, they are handmade guns that sound like guns and take bullets and hurt things, not a supersoaker that magically shoots bolts and nails. and yes, they are loud and will attract walkers, very Walking dead feel to using your gun in this game. The guns are all homemade and as such have "Interesting" appearances, but not "Silly" anymore. The other weapons, bows and such, also got a sexy new look and upgrade that I love.\n\nNow, on to what I DO NOT like so far.\n\n-The menus are an utterly horrendous mess, hopefully this will be fixed later, you have a seperate menu on seperate keys for every single menu you can access, this needs to be replaced with hotkeys to parts of a central menu with subsections.\n-The camp system is cheesy and feels really pointless considering you are camping about 4 feet from Kovac's massive safe bunker, This could really use some expansion and more "Reason" to do it rather than because kovac told you to do it and wont share his bunker, Id prefer having environments to choose from rather than just putting it up in the generic woods you start in, give us options to use that dont make it so its a 20-mile jog to kovacs bunker and by proxy literally 90% of the quests.\n-Farming for materials is what will be the death of this game, the monotomy is toxic, enter mission, look for random drops, find 1 or 2 of your item, redo mission, repeat. This needs to be made more fun.\n\nAnd Last, what I want to see develop as the game moves out of early access.\n\n-The customization menu needs to be much more comprehensive and have many more options. Instead of having "male body A" and "Male body B" have the same look but different pants (I assume this is planned anyway)\n-While I love the fact every mission environment is now its own Cell and you dont have to walk to each of them, having more places to explore when not in missions would be nice, the forest is beautiful but it has like, 4 landmarks to explore.\n-A menu to select already done quests so you dont have to remember/run to the guy who gave it every time you want to redo it for materials.\n-If more areas are added in the future, instead of making us build near the bunker entrances, just let us place one in the environment?\n-Current finishing moves have three choices, 1 and 2 are generic and dont care about the weapon, and 3 is weapon specific (Some weapons have more, such as the bat) but expanding on these and making it so the weapon finishers happen more would be nice! Also, I cant get my arrows back when i use my bow in a finisher, i assume this is a bug.\n-In a game like this, modding support seems like it could be both possible and potentially amazing, Id love to see this happen with custom missions and gear. (I assume this would be possible because the Cells you do missions in Feel like they were created by a mapmaker type software, instead of each being "hand made")\n-I really REALLY like the creepiness some of the night missions give, adding a thicker more terrifying horror element to these missions would be amazing. Im not talking H2S style "Creepers in the dark" Im talking somethat that legitimately will make you sit in a building and not want to open a door, or go back outside or things of that nature. (All the pictures of slenderman on the walls help with the mood!)\n\nAll in all this game is an improvement on the first in almost every regard, and is supposed to just get much better, I look forward to seeing where it goes! Im gonna hop into the beta branch and Put what I find below and try to update it\n\nBETA INFO\n-TO BE LOGGED-\n\nARGUEMENT ADDRESSING SECTION THAT WILL MAKE WHINERS MAD\n\nOpposing Arguement\n-The first one actually had a plot! This one doesnt! BLAH, this one also looks worse!\n\nMy arguement\n-What H2S did you play exactly? I remember running around on islands that all look the same doing quests that had no points with the general goal of leaving at some point. All the quests were "Go get A, bring it to B" in the first and most in the second are similar, except all the quests in 1 were confined to each island wheras in 2 they each have a custom made Cell to pursue them in. This game also has fricken gorgeous environments by comparison to the endless sand of 1.\n\nOpposing Arguement\n-This game is so buggy, ive got stuck on X,Y, and Z objects a thousand times!\n\nMy arguement\n-I have not gotten stuck on a single thing once in all my playtime, cant really help ya there, this game is surprisingly bug free.\n\n\nIf I see other opposing arguements in reviews, I will gladly address them here, also feel free to ask about anything in the comments if you need more data before you buy!","May 4","true","12.6"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","3"

Here are my suggestions:\n\n(1) Controls needs to be customised. In the first one I am so comfortable with the my controls in the first game.\n(2) I prefer the first "How to Survive" maps where you have one big map instead of levels. I would recommend having a forest section, then a city section and so on. The only loading screen we should see if when we first open and load the game or when we die and load a checkpoint.\n(3) No weapons customisation. Maybe because it is an early access game\n(4) No night time creatures like in the first game. I like the night creatures. Some night creatures should be deadly. I would like to see some night creatures/zombies from the movie "I am a Legend (Will Smith)". Night creatures cannot see properly but is attracted to sound.\n(5) First person/Third person view would be nice.\n(6) Walkers/Zombies like noise so when surrounded, it would be nice to distract them either by shooting up a flare, throwing bottles, throwing fireworks/crackers etc. Noise is something that can be improved on\n(7) When a walker/zombie gets too close it would be nice to kick them or push them back\n(8) I see no wildlife/animals. Deer, Wolves, Dogs and Cats would be nice. If there is a circus nearby you can have Lions, Elephants, Tigers etc.\n(9) Multiplayer campaign would be nice. So if you are playing an open campaign, anyone can join and leave your campaign. Max of 4 players is reasonable. So when a person joins, they start from a bunker, shed or safe house  and when they leave you can see the person die.\n(10) It would be nice to build your own bunker/shed/safe house. Even a tree house would be nice.\n(11) In a customised campaign, if you are bitten you will turn into a zombie.\n(12) I would like to see a campaign where you are either the zombie/s or the night creatures. In a Zombie campaign, If you die, you straight away jump into another zombie/night creature nearby. Or you can jump from zombie/night creature  to another  zombie/night creature.\n(13) I don't see the point of having money in this apocalyptic world. I prefer collecting gold or souveniers (sp) and you can trade it for weapons or parts for crafting weapons.\n(14) When in a city it would be nice to climb ladders  and go to the rooftops of buildings, climbing fences and lamp posts would be nice and useful when getting surrouding or running low on ammo.\n(15) It would also be nice to have a clock displayed in the game so that you know what time is it. Unlike the first game you go to inventory and look at the time which is a bit tedious.\n(16) It would be nice to crawl and crouch. Even though you are in a Zombie world, stealth can be applied. Especially if you have a horde of Zombies which you cannot take them all on your own.\n(17) It would be cool to build your own armoured vehicle that can demolish Zombies for good. Put lots of blades (or whatever you want  around your vehicle) and run over them. Of course doing this may attract more Zombies.\n(18) Unlike in the first game where you just cleared a section and when you go back after a while you find the zombies, it would be nice to customise it where it stays clear or have a random zombie generator.\n(20) If you have read this far you will notice there is no 19. That is because I am thristy, hungry and sleepy. I will now need to find some food to eat, water to drink and a place to sleep. Thank you and good day/night Don't let the bed bugs bit.\n","October 30, 2015","true","6.4"," 70 of 105 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","70","105","7","5"

Since this sequel was on sale for 70% off, I figured what the hell and dove in to EA.\n\nI think everything is markedly improved over the original. Progression in the game seems more balanced and well paced. It might be in EA, but it already feels very complete to me. Just needs some love and polish in some places. UI/Menus could be a little better, but they are functional.\nSome people are having some problems getting the game to work properly for various reasons, but I myself have not run into anything that validating/verifying the game files didn't fix.\n\nFor anyone having played the first, the mechanics will be very familiar.\nEat or your melee damage will suffer when you begin to starve.\nDrink or your vital critical hits will charge slower.\nBasically, if you are starving or dehydrated you'll probably die from zombies before you actually starve to death, just because you won't be as effective in killing hordes.\nI've never tested what happens when you get to 0%, though.\n\nCrafting is key.\nThis game takes the crafting to the next level. Your camp level affects everything you do, as you can only level your character to your camp level. Item recipes are locked behind levels of buildings, which you will need to gather many supplies to upgrade, to finally build yourself some decent gear.\nMakes everything you do feel like it pays off once you've made some decent kit for yourself.\nAlso visually rewarding having a little camp to go home to after quests to dump your loot at.\nI've also noticed as I've built up buildings and walls, that zombies don't seem to spawn within my camp, which is good. It's a safe space.\n\nYou can replay any quest any time you feel like at varying difficulties.\nWant to feel like a super bad-♥♥♥ zombie slayer? Knock the level of the quest down -2 and go zombie wrecking. Also good for quick supply runs.\nNeed a challenge? Ramp up the quest level +5 over your level. Serious XP gains if you manage to survive. (Each death is a -10% xp penalty)\nI usually play at +3 for a nice 10% xp bonus with not too much added difficulty.\n\nThe game is funny.\nI enjoy the little humour the game has and some of the quests are just the right amount of silly. It's one of the things that really charmed me in the first game and I'm glad they kept to it. There are enough "try hard serious" zombie games out there, this one is just good fun.\n\nTL;DR\nBasically if you enjoy ARPGs, you'll probably enjoy How to Survive 2.","April 10","true","25.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","3"

This game kept a lot of the mechanics as the first How To Survive, but one aspect is totally different. Its no longer open-world persay. Instead this game focuses on Levels and Missions, meaning if you accept a mission you will be transported to the area the Mission takes place, and when done you pretty much port back to your home camp, to either build the camp up or level your character. It is still early access so this could all change, but as of right now i actually am enjoying this game as much as i enjoyed the first one. I owned How To Survive Storm Warning Edition on Xbox One. Never could finish that game cuz of crashing. Hopefully this game will run a lot smoother.. Id recommend this to even the slightest fan of this genre..\n\nAfter playing this for longer, Ive encountered a number of bug, suchs as my bandages vanishing from the quick bar in the lower left, sometimes when jumping through windows too close to a bed my guy goes trhough the mattress and gets stuck.. That hasnt happened to often and hitting the "back to camp" button fixes it, but you have to restart that level. Ive encountered more, those are just a few to name. Those bugs rarely happen, and they dont effect my view of the game, I still enjoy this and its early access so its expected.. You can't as of right now choose different survivors, there is only one character for now. It only plays in a window mode, which bugs me when the mouse pointer goes to the edges, and im opening random programs. As i said though, none of that effects my enjoyment of this game. Its still a ton of fun right now, and it will only get better when finished..\n\nOkay I take it back, the bugs are becoming a major hinderance. I cannot play the game due to the bandage or wrappings bug.. It vanishes from my quick bar constantly. Mostly when I craft new bandages, enter or exit an area, or just randomly goes away for no reason, and no its not because ive ran out. You have to stock pile those in this game, and I have a ton..

But there are players that simply dont understand that they can change the game with Feedbacks via the Discussion tab. Which the developers care for and answer back in.\n-It will still have alot changes with time Passing and will be worth its Money at 1 point. So its worth to support the developers\n\nCons:\n-It is far from being finished (currently about 25% i would say. I can see the full game release in 9 months, which is a good thing cuz the developers really use the time to work on the game and not just graphics, bugs and a fluent fighting system). If you dont want to help with the developement of this game with Feedbacks and expect to have a nice game that is nearly finished you should stay away from buying it till it has moved into a beta state. Else you will only drag this games Reviews to negative which it doesnt deserve. It is in Developement and i am Still excited to see the end Product !!\n\nIf you havent played How to Survive 1 before u play this game Check out the 1st part and let this sequel bloom !!!","February 19","true","2.5"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

I'm especially pleased with the camera--though I was worried a bit when I didn't have a lot of camera control and we're in a forest... those trees open up in a "viewport" that reminds me of Katamari Damacy when something's blocking the view.\n\nThe crafting and leveling system seems simple enough to not detract from the main action of the game, while having deep enough customization to make things interesting.\n\nThere's not a lot of appearance customization, but that's fine in a game with this angle--many other games with a similar look and feel, like Diablo 3, don't allow customization at all, and you're not going to be focusing on the nuances of your characters face when fighting zombies.\n\nIn fact, I'd be willing to trade away all the facial customization, in favor of more body shape customization. Different body shapes will help in distinguishing teammates in multiplayer games. It's important in first-person team based games like L4D2 and TF2, but it's especially important in a game like this where you need to identify your own character if you lose sight of them in a big zombie pileup.\n\nI haven't had a chance to play multiplayer yet, but I find myself looking forward to it. Definitely a game to keep watch on, even if you don't care for the early access model.

Already I like the setting and atmosphere (Louisiana) a lot better than the boring islands in the first game. H2S2's gameplay is nearly identical to the first game, which is a good thing, although I hope they improve combat just a bit, it still feels a little stiff with melee.\n\nI like the added "camp" (a home base) and its cool to be able to build stuff and defend it. Also, I have noticed my avatar is able to run longer distances before depleting stamina compared to the 1st game. I recommend H2S2 even in its current state.\n\nBut be warned...it doesn't have female avatars yet!!!!...which seems to be the number 1 complaint in the forums...for some reason this game has attracted extremely picky people with entitlement syndrome.

I was really looking forward to this game.  I'm a big fan of the first one mainly because it was so much fun playing coop.   So I was excited to hear HtS2 supported four players!  I have not been dissapointed.   How to Survive 2 offers up a solid coop experience where you get to explore, craft, and kill zombies... again.   Keep in mind the game is in early release so I expect there to be a lot of positive changes.\n\nThe positives:\n-An open world to explore\n- A camp building feature that allows you to build multiple camps any where on the map\n- Lots of new weapons and upgrades: melee, bows, crossbows, pistols, rifles, SMGs etc.\n- Multiple attack types with melee weapons\n- Quests with a good variety of map types\n- Peircing damage!  I love lining up zombies and taking them out with one shot\n- Scaling difficulty based on the level of your camp and player\n\n\nNegatives\n- Invisible zombies.  Yes, it's a bug and I would bet it's on the top of their bug list.  Luckly others in your party can warn you of the impending attack so you can melee or run\n- No melee finishing moves.   I hope they put these back in from H2S.  It was very satisfying\n- The game is a bit unbalanced right now.  You get way more food then you need and a chem lab where you can make buffs you don't need.  I'd like to see them become usefull.\n- A couple of bugged quests.  Again, it's early release.  There are work arounds.\n\nOverall it's totatly worth playing, especially for the cost.","January 20","true","75.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

It is far from being a bad game, it just currently lacks any depth, and needs polishing.\nYou start off in a hub area, where you can select your next mission by talking to a character. After doing that, you will be transported to another small area where you are given a task. This is where the problems start with the game. Each mission feels the same. You walk around picking up random scattered items, or walk somewhere and complete the mission in 5-10 minutes. They feel like cheap fetch quests, and offer little variety.\n\nThis wouldn't be too bad if the gameplay was fun, but it gets repetitive. The combat consists of mashing the same button over and over again. It doesn't feel satisfying. You can also hold the attack button to do a charged attack, or sprint and then attack a zombie but all of these don't really add much. Using a ranged weapon like a bow is a bit different. You aim the weapon at a zombie and a circle will appear on their head. A line goes back and forth which requires that you press the button at the right time for what I'm assuming is more damage. I never really noticed a difference since it seemed to do the same amount of damage whether I got the timing right or not. Perhaps it's because I played on an easier difficulty.\n\nBefore starting a mission you can increase the difficulty which will also allow you to reap a higher xp reward.\n\nThe inventory/crafting/XP system has a lot of problems. First off, you can't create your character. You hit a randomize button and keep doing it until you like the look of your character. The crafting system looks ugly, although it works. My main gripe comes with the leveling up system. If you want to get a new skill, for example, do more damage, then you'll see a 500xp price tag on it. You spend the xp, and still won't level up that skill. That's because you need to level it up in 4 different chunks before actually getting the upgrade. Why? Why not just ask for 2000xp and level up the entire thing at once. It's not a big deal, but adds clutter the leveling system doesn't need. To add to that, in order to be able to upgrade your skill, you need to first upgrade your character, and in order to upgrade your character you need to upgrade your camp. It's a needlessly complicated system.\n\nI personally dislike the PC controls. You can't rebind them, so I was forced to use controller controls as they felt a bit better. Even if you use PC controls, the inventory system will show xbox controls and require that you press "R1" to navigate, or the yellow "Y" button. Even if you use a controller, you'll be forced to navigate the inventory slowly with your analogue stick acting as a mouse cursor. It's all over the place.\n\nOverall, the game feels like it has potential, but it doesn't offer enough variety and needs a lot of polishing as it is. It's in early access currently, so I trust the devs will mend most of these problems, and if that's the case then I might change my review to a positive recommendation.\nConsider checking out my video for a more in-depth look, and perhaps you'll think the game is worth your money.\n\n\nEDIT: They're updating the game, as expected. You now have more control over how your character looks, and can change the controls. However, I still can't recommend the game due to the lack fun gameplay in my opinion.","November 5, 2015","false","2.9"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","45","78","6","3"

But it's still a good game and the developers shouldn't have an issue fixing the bugs and polishing the game-play.\nSo as a summery (no spoilers) you are a survivor looking for refuge, Kovak is here again to help you out and teach you the basics. You're in a forest type area this time, not an island. And I've only played about an 1.5 hrs but the whole layout of the land seems a lot better in my opinion. You can build "trunks" (which you can put your extra items in) and you can build other things (buildings and weapons/medicine) once you get your level up. After Kovak teaches you the basics, he asks that you join him in finding other survivors so you can build a community. So far that's all I've gotten to.\n\nPros:\nShelter building\nGame pad supported and works well\nBetter layout of areas then HTS1\nMovements are good\nMultiple areas to explore (forests, swamps, owns, ect.)\nEven in early access it works pretty good\n\nCons:\nSome things are confusing, like the level up system (You can level this skill up until you level up yourself. You can't level up yourself until you level up your shelter, you can level up your shelter until....ect.)\nA couple game breaking bugs.\nCombat is boring and repetative (personal opinion)\nLong loading times make me not want to take challenges (do I really want to sit through a 2 minute loading screen to do a 1 minute mission and then sit through another 2 minute loading screen to get back?)\nToo easy to get items and building material\n\nTL:DR\nIt needs work but it's still a pretty good game to waste some time on. If you're not sure then wait until it's out of early access or when it goes on sale.","November 5, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Multiplayer? is there really any such beast? I seem to get dumped into a lobby and there are 0 ways to find a game in progress.\nMore event specific missions and less "go fetch" would be nice.

A few suggestions that I have for the final game are as follows.\n\n1) I would like to see the Hungry, Tired, and Thirsty meters in the normal HUD, just like the first game.  Needing to go into my inventory to check those is something that can very easily be over looked.  I might have missed the meters while playing, but if that is the case, then my bad.\n2) I believe it should be one giant map that you can travel to and from all of the different locals, not just teleporting to and from with when you start and finish a quest.\n3) There should be more weapon customization, but that might just be that I haven't been playing that much of the early access that I haven't seen any yet.\n4) The quests should more resemble the way they were in the first game, main line and side quests that are easy to distinguish between what they are, not just random looking quests.\n5) The melee should have the same aiming function as in the original game.\n\nAudio and visual need some improvements as well, but that is to be expected.","November 5, 2015","true","10.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

It has all possibilities to become great.\n\nYou are able to customize the character, but it is boring at the moment. Only good char is the Mayor - more of that!  I would not use customer chars, but few personalized ones, that everyone is able to customise with clothes and armor etc. Good example was first Jagged Alliance - everyone knows Ivan and Mike. It made you cry if they got killed.\n\nAlso about the char movement. Like other hack'n'slash games, char always move like a clock - I think it should be move alive. Stumble, get tired, yell, get angry.. React if fellow gets hit or killed.\n\nMissions are also quite boring - zombies are always standing where they are - no wandering mobs - no random survivors escaping them. All the stuff is also in the same location always - like mission goals.\n\nWeapons: Arrows are cool, but how can you affect f.e. to make a headshot? The accuracy bar should sometimes hit the jackpot, now it is more like a powerbar. Arrows end up where ever when hitting the zombie.\n\nGathering stuff: It needs to be improved. Now hitting the F button makes me want to leave the stuf be. Also inventory is very confusing and bad user interface logically.\n\nFinally about the building. You can build the base, but what is the catch? building is very limited. I would like to build a good old tower defence, now all I got is a bunch of buildings that I have to set on the ground. During the night some zombie has sneaked in and took 500hp from my storage box.\n\nAnyways - direction is good, but to be able to make millions out of this you should make people love it, and feel the pain of survivors. Now all I feel is the pain of the user interfaces.\n\n","November 7, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","5"

The graphics appear identical to the first, which is a bit disappointing, but gameplay is, to me, the first, second, and third most important thing about a game, so I don't mind.\n\nThat said, gameplay is similar as well.

But I noticed that a lot of important loot items in the game are extremely rare, so you pretty much have to do research in order to know where to look or spend an eternity searching. For instance, in order to get a wrench, there's only one known location in the game where you can find it (which makes no sense since it's realistically one of the most common household tools), and the worst part is that it's a hit or miss as to whether or not it'll actually be there. I did later find out that more show up as you pregress in the game, but it's still an issue that shouldn't exist. A lot of items are like that (including copper wire... I mean seriously, copper wire!?!?). I'm currently at lv 11 and I still haven't found a single strand of copper wire yet (I mean, what about all those computers and tvs and other electronics scattered throughout the game?). There's also a bit of grinding for loot by completing certain missions multiple times in order to progress further in camp development which is rather tedious, though not as bad when playing co-op since quest rewards go to each player rather than shared. There's also sections in the game in which we have no access to, I assume it'll either be DLC or the devs just haven't finished those sections yet (both within quests and main map). Aside from that, I did notice some random online latency issues and game freezing for a few seconds at a time during solo and multi-player for no reason at all, nothing too serious, but minor optimizations wouldn't go un-noticed. Melee combat seems to have a memory, so spamming the attack button is definitely never a good idea as it locks you in place while you finish the melee attack combination leaving you vulnerable from the back or sides. So just make sure not to spam the buttons and it'll work just fine.\n\nThe difficulty curve is set up really nicely overall. During quests, you can make them as difficult as you want and be rewarded with more XP if you chose to make them more difficult. I really like how they did that. I also like the camp building process, though I do wish it was a bit easier to do. Graphics are nicer than the first How to Survive, though I have very little accuracy or aim ability while indoors, so that needs a bit of tuning in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first How To Survive game. Sure I mentioned a lot more flaws than features in my review, as I do with most of my reviews, but you already knew what the features were when you read the game's description and watched the videos.","April 14","true","31.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

With that said even at this stage, this is one incredible and fun game. So far I have a little ove 40 hours on this and I have loved every minute of it.   The devs are responsive and darqflame is an outstanding community leader for this game.\n\nPros:\n\nUser selected levels for each challenge - you can up the level for each map for a better challenge or decrease the level if you're just in it to grind mats.\n\nCrafting system - The crafting system in htis game is incredible. It keeps you grinding for certain mats and gives the game that "one more turn" feel.\n\nStats - Each crafted item has a large set of stats and allows you to create a weapon and armor set to fit your gameplay style.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some of the collisions in the game are a bit bad. For instance, zombies seem to get hung up on a curb on a street a little too easily and zombies tend to twitch when killed.\n\n- There is no pause on this game. If you leave your character in game and move away from the game, when you return it is very likely he will be dead or at least thirsty.\n\n- If you Alt-Tab out of game, your character can get stuck in an attacking pose and will continue to attack until you return.\n\nWith this being early access, I feel most of these "cons" will be corrected by the time the games goes into full production. Either way I have enjoyed every hour I have put into this and will be putting many, many more into it before it's done.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game to all.

Let me tell you, when the game will be finished, will be well worth the 20€ they ask now.\n\nFirst of all, multyplayer and even local co-op are NOT IMPLEMENTED yet, but they will come soon (i don't really think those guys will backstab us there, they got a great game in ther hands, would be foolish)\n\nHonestly, I can't wait for MP, single player game is, well, it's good, but you play all the time wondering how it would be with firends covering, using different playstyles, like having a tank, 2 bowman and 1 gunman. Plus, building and leveling camp on your own is possible, but a bit hard and, you know, it's not nice to have a big house and live in it all by yourself all the time.\n\nAbout the game, my main complaints are about difficulty to spot zombies at night and when in shadow (view is fixed half isometric, with walls and vegetation disappearing to let you see. Also, spotting objects is difficult, and the yellow glow sometimes "overlaps" with flashlight or background and it's hard to notice. Btw, items are a little too easy to come by, if u have a bit of patience exploring u can get a pretty nice stash quickly\n\nDifficulty balance is sort of ok, was a little "meh really? just that?" at start, but hey, it was just start. Once you level your char zombies do too, and by lvl 5 you already can tell a BIG difference in zombie variety and fight difficulty.\n\nRealism. Noise DO attract zombies, and sometimes you wish you didn't made that big one go boom so soon, but, since your molerat field of view is less than 10 mt you didn't had any choices (yeah, no zooming out possible, to see, let's say, 50mt radius) I want to see what's ahead of me, cuz in real life i can look across a small pond and see what's there. So maybe add a more zoomed out view, but remove obj glow when your view is too zommed out? Also, aiming will be more difficult that way. Reg zeds can get "headshotted" but takes time and yes, even skill, epsecially when 4-5-6 are closing in fast. Still to implement weigh system, and loot carry capacity. Actually i have everything in my backpack, weigh more than 200kg and i can run jump climb... ok, still early access. UI can also get a good polish, looks a bit... minimal, even less that the one of the 1st H2S\n\nFrom what i saw for now, there is a good deal of crafting, building, planning, gathering and everything, without being too... harvesting. I mean, often while doing "missions" you just found several stuff, often enough to get you by for a good while.\n\nI haven't played much cuz, honestly, i want to discover this game on MP, but from where I got, it looks like there is still a lot more ahead to do, find, try out, and such.\n\nBugs? None yet to report, and no game crashes, my pc is farily old, about 5yo, even if well mainteined, and runs the game fine in 1080, Only crashed first time when i tried to put it fullscreen (btw, inside its folder, there is a autodetect.exe or something like that that allows you to set res and such)\n\nSo yes, imho, if you like what you see, it's probably what you'll get in the end, that's the way i feel it. What did i see? I see a bit of old school action\rpg (diablo 2?) a bit of fallout 1-2 (for graphic, isometric view, theme) a bit of left for dead 2 (4 player MP vs zombies) and surprisingly, not much H2S1 as you'd think. This is more... free, you are no longer on a small, improbable, island, or group of islands. I haven't found the main map borders yet (also cuz going around isn't that healty, especially at night), plus every mission has its own map (or maps? i haven't redone any yet to check if they are randomly generated or not...)\n\nIf you were unsure... go for it.\n\nOh, and btw, Kovak is a plus, that guy is something! :)","January 6","true","22.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

It keeps well within the spirit of the first installment of the series and builds on that success.  I cant help but to feel some kind of "similar feel" to the old fallout games (i do mean the old ones, pre FL3).  Though its by no account a "rip off" or copy of said games.\n\nThe bad:\nIt is currently early access and, though its very playable at this date, my friends and I have had some frustrating times with our online camp. Desyncs, disconnects and crashes.  All of these are known issues and are currently in the works, so its not so much a bad component of the game, rather just something that we need wait for to get sorted.\nRestrictive camera angles:  This does actually add to the gameplay, though there are a few out there who dislike it.  I gather there's actually talk going on about fixing this.  It doesn't ruin the game play in any event.\nAgain, this is early access, so my current frustration with the limitations of some resources will surely be something that will still be tweaked.  Fluids, for one, are quite annoying to keep stock of.  The main source of user-made drinks is berry juice and those shrubs are suprisingly tiring to get hold of (odd how you can't collect rain water in your camp).\nIt lacks the diverse "prey" animals from the first installment.  So far you are restricted to psychotic turkeys (and what a good laugh that level is), but you need to "farm" that instance which gets very boring very soon.  More wildlife is needed and hopefully not 'infected' kinds (fishing? deer hunting? what about those ostriches).\nThe controls may be a bit awkward for newcomers to learn, but once you get into the hang of it, its not so bad.\nInventory:  It becomes very annoying when you have to transfer items from you backpack to your trunk, having to click the "tick" when there's more than one said item in the stack.  It slows you down and becomes a drag.  I'd imagine this is something they'd get to work on as well\n\nThe good;\nIncredibly addictive gameplay.   If you are a fan of "the walking dead' or any one of the survivalist zombie type series/movies then this will be your crack addiction.  It achieves what Day Z, dead rising and all those other quick-fix zombie apoc survival games does not.\nYou get to build a camp with 3 other friends (or alone) which can be tended to without everyone needing to be online at the same time.  Each person can just log on and do his/her part when time permits.  Playing together is obviously way more fun and lets you organise some seriously fun base building operations.\nThe "quests" or missions are rather well polished for something that is still in early access.  This deserves a special mention as mission/quest dynamics are usually the thing that suffers most during early access.  I've come to about level 14 and so far I've had one "somewhat" buggy mission to do (getting a package out of an undead pelican!).\nThe "main map" where you build your camp does appear like there will be exanded areas added to.  This area in itself is brilliant.  It's where you end up foraging for flint, medical herbs and all other kinds of stuff with friends (supply runs!).\n\nNow if they'd just add a persistent city, much like the main area... just wow.\nGreat game!","April 17","true","80.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The only problem is that this game is too easy unless you set the level to your choice of difficulty. The dev's are doing a great job so far but they should clearly state the controls. It gave me icons for the controller instead of the keyboard and after finishing the first quest of killing 5 infected zombies, I couldn't return! The key it displayed didn't return me! I had to go to the menu and press return to camp.\n\nAfter I came back, Kovac still asked me to do the quest again! This was really frustrating! I brought back the items from the mission however there was no way I could know if I finished it. I would like the developers to put a nice sound, a big and clear message that pops up when you finish your mission.

Yes, the controls and game play are still the same. Yes, its the same generic survival story against a zombie outbreak. Yes, the crafting is more of the same, which is still fun to do. Only thing different with the crafting this time is that you build your own base-like camp. Think along the lines on building your own city from the Sim City franchise. As I said in my review of the first game the thing that turned me off from it was the isometric view of the camera and how zoomed out it was no matter how you adjusted it. Well the game still has that isometric look to it but this time around they made it so that even if you are zoomed out all the way you aren't looking at it from an almost top-down look. So do I recommend this game over the first? As it stands right now I absolutley do. I found no bugs or glitches. The game runs smooth and everything is very responsive. The only complaint I have is the loading times are a bit to long for my liking. Is that a gamebreaker or something that will prevent me from playing it again? No, I can learn to live with it. By no means is that a resaon to not buy this game.","April 10","true","4.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

However, after reading some of the over-enthusiastic reviews, I was also a bit disappointed.\n\nBuilding your own camp is pretty cool and works great. Also the new city areas definately add to the fun, because indoors melee weapons are a much better choice than they ever were in HtS 1. But even outdoors melee is much more important now, because there is not that huge overflow of ammo from every second zombie you kill anymore. You will meet some familiar faces from the first game, which is pretty cool too. And the new types of zombies make things a little more interesting.\n\nHowever, there were some things that I don't really like about HtS 2.\n- The instance-based mission system may not be a turn-off for some people, but I really don't like it. You can accept missions in your camp and get teleported to the quest map to do your stuff and then return to the camp. HtS 1 had a much more open world-ish feel to it (it's not really open world but you can run around the islands all you want and don't get teleported somewhere else when you get a quest), which I liked better. Also, there are basically just 3 different types of missions: Kill X amount of zombies, collect Y amount of some resource or find person Z and talk to them.\n- The level system is the worst part about this game though in my opinion. It is a very artificial limitation of progress and doesn't really fit into the game. You have to spend XP to level up your camp first, which does nothing except allow you to upgrade your buildings to the same level. Only after you have upgraded your camp can you level up yourself by spending XP, again changing absolutely nothing, except increasing your mission levels and allowing you to level your skills higher. You spend a large chunk of your XP on leveling up, which does absolutely nothing in itself, except making the zombies stronger (they level up with you or your camp depending on where you are). Meaning by leveling up, you don't become stronger, but actually weaker, because you don't gain anything but the zombies become stronger.\nIn HtS 1 at the beginning you just beat a few zombies up with a stick and at the end you killed massive hordes of zombies with the weapons you had earned by then, feeling absolutely godlike. In HtS 2 however, since the zombies level with you, the zombies are pretty much equally strong all the time, so you will face the same amount of them at any time pretty much all the time. This makes you feel like you are not really progressing that much after you get your first good gun or bow (whatever you prefer). All that changes is that higher damage-numbers pop up above the zombie heads when you hit them (yay ...).\n- There are only very few types of different buildings in the city areas, making all maps feel pretty much the same. Sure this is still EA and I hope they will add more content. Just wanted to point that out.\n- There are not enough missions to level up to max level, so you will have to start grinding missions you have already completed at some point. Again, this is EA and more will hopefully come.\n- The story was MUCH better in HtS 1. Each NPC gives you some quests and they build up around some kind of storyline, but it's not really engaging and the different storylines aren't really connected all so much to each other. I'll wait what future quests add to the game.\n- No boomerang :(\n\nI don't mean to sound to negative, because this game is absolutely worth the money. I just think some people may like the more arcadey, story-driven, open world-ish HtS 1 more than this and could be a bit disappointed that HtS 2 is taking a somewhat different approach. As a final advice: Do play this with friends. It's just so much more fun that way. Gathering all the materials for your base can be a bit tedious when you have to get everything yourself.","April 14","true","25.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Why would I do that? I wanted to write a review based off of my first impression, then come back and update it as I go along. Just an experiment I'd like to try.\n\nFirst day: First Impression:\nSo I own both of the original games. Yes, both. How to Survive and How to Survive Third Person. I thought How to Survive was kind of fun, but had some issues and overall jank that I had hoped would have been addressed in How to Survive Third Person. Unfortuneatly I did not enjoy that version either. So why would I buy How to Survive 2? Because I could see the potential.\n\nHow to Survive 2 is what I had hoped it would be. A true sequel. It takes everything HtS1 did right, gets rid of the things it did wrong, and expands on the original formula.\n\nYes, it's just yet another zombie survival game. So if those games are not your bag or you're sick of them, this game will not suddenly change your mind.\n\nSo far it is damn good at what it has set out to do. What will I think tomorrow?","April 14","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

How To Survive 2. I got this game  from playing the first game alone! On top of watching the video and seeing this one has base building!! And this one also lets you have 4 players in a game instead of just 2. On top of that it looks like this one has even more crafting. So I will list the pro's and cons.\n\nPRO'S,\nYou level up way more stuff. Tons of skills compared to first game.\n- Level up your base, your character and your skills!\n- Base building and upgrading buidlings!\n- Variety of missions you can replay for exp and loot, or continue to other missions if bored of ones you finished.\n- Same art style as first game but better!\n- Kovac is here once again and is a really funny and interesting and witty character.\n- Level of detail on enemies is enhanced a fair amount I think.\n- Lots of melee weapons, bows, crossbows, guns and ammo types.\n- Supports local couch drop in and out play as well as online play!\n\nCONS,\n- Game wasn't made sooner so I could play it lol.\n- Screen was missing left and right side until I found out on their steam forum you have to hold alt+press enter.\n- One key, the ` key at top left for finishing missions was small in the top right so took a while to find it...\n\nSeriously those are the only cons to me. Nothing that will make me go WOAH I'm not playing this any more WOAH!!!! I was happy to see this game and for £3 on promotion at the moment it is well worth it.

While it IS very much a HTS game and feels like one, this one is rather different. First time I played there wasn't much to do and building/crafting was barely in place. But with later updates the game got a lot better paced. So overall a pleasant experience. So as a preliminary review I have some points.\n\nPros:\nBase building.\nCrafting is pretty simple, but more in-depth than many other games\nCo-op is fun, and camp progression makes this work really well\nYou don't HAVE to follow others in a camp, but do your own thing\nGraphics look pretty nice and fits the style of game, with varied weather and day/night cycle\nDifficulty ramps up with progression\nPretty frequent updates, which each one seems to actually do quite a bit\nCons:\nMelee combat feels really clunky. Being able to aim before hitting would be nice\nThe base building can be iffy at times, but seems to be better with each update\nHow you see through walls and floors indoors is weird, just hiding more/all of the walls would be better\nNo graphic settings or such.\nRanged aiming can bug out sometimes and now show the zombie being targeted\nUI can be confusing, with separated menus and functions.\nThe camp progression can have you not focus on your own character skills, and to progress in missions you need camp level, meaning one could become rather weak and starve a lot due to wanting to do new missions. Not sure if separated exp for camp and combat would be good.\nIn overall, I really do like the game and playing it co-op lately, which I feel the game really is made for due to how the camps work. If you like survival games, games with crafting and building etc, you should get this. And do find people to play with.\n\nAnother small note, if you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly from the earlier stage of the game, where I do agree it didn't have much. But many of these negative reviews also stated the game likely would be a fun game later on.","May 16","true","18.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exetertbc/recommended/360170/","exetertbc","Belghast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exetertbc/","507 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHey Folks!  I thought I would pop on here and leave a review for this How to Survive 2.  I had this title given to me by a friend who thought given my love of Zombie titles that I would like it.  Even though I have owned the original for awhile I never actually got around to playing it.  As a result I was not exactly sure what to expect when I started playing it.\n\nI wrote up an impressions piece on my own blog [aggronaut.com] but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  That said the game is very much not finished, but because of that I can't really judge it any more harshly than any other Early Access title.  The price-tag of $20 seems extremely reasonable for the experience, and I have been using this as a game when I don't really have much time to play something deeper.  It allows me to get in, run a few missions... and feel like I have made some progress.\n\nThere is a nostalgic characteristic to the game that reminds me of the way it used to feel to explore maps in the original two fallout games.  For being a top down isometric game... it is strangely suspenseful anytime you explore an area with only the cone of your flashlight to see by.  There were several times I was surprised as zombies lumbered in from directions I was not quite expecting them.  At first the zombies are pretty brain dead, but as you level both your camp and your character... they start mixing in some of the modern track star zombies, and other types like boomers.\n\nMy biggest complaint right now is that there isn't much of a tutorial and I had to rely largely on copious amounts of googling to sort out how various aspects of the game actually work.  The game loaded fast enough that the keyboard screen was not up for long enough for me to memorize the various hotkeys...  and it was only by accident that I realized how to bring that menu back up.  That said... at this stage of the game no game really has a functional tutorial.  It is a game in progress, and so long as you are willing to play a beta product you should enjoy yourself.  If you cannot handle playing a non-finished game... then I would hold off until the official release.\n\nEarly access essentially gives players a way of getting access to a game right now... rather than waiting for it to be finished.  If you are not sold on the concept, then feel free to wait.  However I am having fun and continue to keep poking my head in every so often to see it progress.  My general stance on Early Access is to play extremely lightly until the game gets a little closer to release.  So long as you have all of these things in mind, I think its worth the $20 because the final launch will probably be significantly more.","March 28","true","3.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Better than the original by a long shot, though you really should fix some of the clipping issues in the city areas. I was doing Kovac's quest for getting the supplies to start making bullets, and I went out of a room. I went back into the room through a window and got stuck in a bed. I have no idea how to get out of the bed, but I am enjoying the game. EKO and 505 work well together with this series. I recommend that anyone who likes games like Left 4 Dead 2, Don't Starve, and the original game, get this game now, while in early access.\n\nYes, it's early access, but it's 20% off through the first week, and it's one of the best early access games I've played. Despite its glitches, it's an entertaining zombie game for anyone who likes survival games.\n\nKovac is a fascinating character, and through exploring the 'camp' world, I've discovered that at least one character from the previous game, Kenji, made an appearance. I liked playing Kenji in the original, so it's great that I get to see him again in this game.\n\nUser interface is much cleaner than in the original, but I do think you guys should add a pause menu that actually pauses the game. Kind of frustrating when I pause to get a soda and come back to a horde near me.\n\nAlso, I would like to see support for mods, so that players can add their own weapons, armor, and other things.\n\nAll in all, tl/dr, I give this game 8.5/10.

Ballache,\n- The new aiming system needs picking up and throwing off the nearest cliff and be replaced with the one out of the first game. You go to shoot one walker and it's alright, you have 3 coming for you and you are buggered, might as well just bend over and prepare your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt's not all bad though, for something thats just (I could be wrong) come out of Alpha then bravo. Now the good,\n\n- Building a camp. It's a really nice touch to the game and it works so far. With the first game it was just do missions and do some more then finish it. This adds a bit more for you to think about and do.\n- Customise your character. Yay!\n- Crafting. It plays a bigger roll and has more options than the first game already and this is just the early access.\n- 4 player Co-op (When you can find someone to play with)\n- Crossbows.\n\nOverall the game so far plays well, there is room for improvement but it is to be expected from a game that is Early Access. So if you are looking for a near finished game then avoid this for now because you will end up disapointed and probably asking for a refund but if your like me and don't mind a few bugs here and there then I'd recommend this because if the first game is anything to go by then this will end up being bloody awesome.\n\nUpdate -\n\nSince I did this review the developers have been adding more and more into the game by the day and patched out anything bug related. It's a shame people have been giving this game bad reviews and marking it down because it's a EA release.","October 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","2"

Sometimes u have to repeat the same mission over and over just to get some item for crafting, because in a mission there's only 1 or 2 of that kind of item (like plywood, etc), u may need  a lot of plywood, so will more likely spend more time on collecting those.\n2. Need somethin new stage other than the city and forest\n3. cant type chat or message, feels like a restriction to communicate\n4. more appreciate if we can track who join our camp, so  if somethin happen we can find the culprits and the victim and we can invite em later who has join our camp and make he/she is a good partner.\n5. need friend list system or guild system i guess?\n\nJust my opinion..\nsomehow, i kind of like some elements in hts 1 than hts 2..\nbut overall i like this game..","April 16","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

HOWEVER! being an early access there are some things that could use a tweak. These little hiccups are what influence why I do but don't recommend this game.\n\nIt feels like it could be a game right now if the devs got lazy and published it now. Wouldn't be a good game but it would be a game.\n\nTo begin here are some cons to take into account.\n\n-The only person voiced is Kovac (being in early access its no issue right now but if it hits beta and no voices then yeah, issue.)\n-In combat there is no room for one mistake. Normally running around with a giant hammer would be slow however it is quite unforgiving if you swing half a second early. There have been multiple times my hammer grazed a zombie for no damage only because of how perfect they expect of you to time your shots. With guns theres no issue however seeing as i spray and pray with my machine gun. :)\n\n-Crafting got lame\nPretty much to craft anything you need a specific building in your camp first, and you dont guess anymore (i loved the guessing game in the first one) the blueprints are right there for you to go GRIND for the parts which isn't how I remember the game. Not to mention there is only one model/type/look whatever for each weapon. The only thing that changes if you build another weapon is the stats. my level 30 rifle looks just like the one I had at lvl 5.\n\n-Damage what are you doing?\nOnce again i'll be swingin my hammer and getting eaten but when I do land a blow it does a solid 1500k damage. Now after one hit killing about 5 zombies I go in for another kill and bam. 600 damage? What?\nI figured this had to do with stamina and exhaustion and what not; which it does to an extent. Except i tested this. At full stamina i did 1,500 damage,and then 600 and then 900. huh? damage. go home. your drunk.\n\n-Don't fight 2v1\nYou heard me. If you take on more than one zombie with a melee weapon. Your gonna get hurt, 100% of the time. In the first game if you did a power swing/charge thing whatever you hit all the zombies in front of you then you can dodge the one behind you. Well not anymore, if you swing not only is it slow but it also cripples your legs for whatever reason because you gotta wait a second to move again.\n\n-Repetitive missions and lack of story\nEach mission your either in a town or a swamp either fetching, killing, or finding some dude named Fan. the fetching and killing is okay (being devoted to the borderlands series im used to it) but I mean I just saved a guy from getting eaten and then I find him in the swamp wanting chocolate? then suddenly I have to go back to town to save him again. I mean i get that the dude could have traveled? But it feels lazy and thrown together. (Once again, EARLY ACCESS I get that it just bugs me)\n\n-Zombie dog? or pelican?\nThere are various zombie animals, and they all sound the same. The zombie dogs make the exact same grunting noise as the zombie pelicans. Not much else to state here\n\nGood things to look forward to\n\n-Build to live!\nYou get to build a camp and defend it from the zombie horde. The buildings can all be upgraded and provides different crafting opportunities. I was sad that i couldnt build a turret. :P\n\n-Crafting\nAs I said its pretty lame, but it is nice that I see what I need, I DON'T like how they handed me the blueprint however. maybe give me the blueprint after I figured it out?\n-Why am I here?\nThe concept of the story such as the how and the why you are where you are and such is actually interesting in the sense of to me its a new way to look at a apocolypse.\n"Hey guys its kovac! come join me and we can build a super anti zombie society! However you gotta build your own stuff in your own place. just dont go to far k?"\n-Be yourself\nThere's no pre made characters like Kenji and the other pals from the first game, instead you are, well, you.\n-Zombies kill.\nBased on your story progression decides how hard everyone hits. I blew through the missions like lightning and because of it i was up to my head in zombie bites come mid game because of it. So play it slow kiddies or next thing you know your level 2 heads gonna be on zombie deer antlers with base ball bat between its teeth.\n-Kill with friends\nInstead of the first game where its you and a friend. its you and a friend your friends friend and even your friends friends friends friend (4 player co-op)\n\nPros and Cons Time\n\nPros.\n-The build a camp idea is amazing I love every part of it\n-Crafting is easier but lame\n-Base story is pretty neat but needs more depth\n-KENJI IS BACK!\n-I love the town concept instead of various islands that are jungles\n-You make you. No pre made characters\n-Zombies are challenging and get tougher with main story (not because of combat issues)\n-4 person Co-op\n\nCons\n-Everyone is pulling a Gordan Freeman that or Kovac has a tounge necklace because only he talks\n-Combat? More like timed events! AmIRight?\n-Crafting is basic and blunt\n-Random damage\n-Best way to die is to take on two zombies or more\n-Same mission different map layout (mostly) (not really)\n-Is that a bird or a dog I hear?\n\nOverall I DO recommend this game but more as a hope that the devs get this off the ground, I mean yes its fun but it needs more to keep me coming back so if this game is on sale and youve got the money. sure get it. but dont go out of your way right now.","January 13","true","21.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I only played this for about four hours but its  a buggy mess with potential.  I saw the "2" and thought well they've made one game already and worked out the bugs, right? Nope. same game with local co-op and a number two added to the title.\n\nEdit; ok so maybe the bugs aren't actually bugs but rather poorly implemented character level restrictions. maybe they could add you are not a high enough level to access this characters quests.\nalso I have played for about three hours more after my initial review and have had zero crashes.\n\nOne last note, THE BOW IS SICK! :)","April 7","true","19.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","9"

This one is really something, it has so much more going on from graphics, to craftables, to missions, to just feeling like a good zombie game.

Take Diablo or another overhead action RPG with a fixed camera, set it in a modern zombie apocalypse, add looting, crafting and building a camp to your system of inventory, stats and perks, throw a funny and wily European genius dressed for handling nuclear materials who hosts his own TV show, and throw a few more fetch quests in there. And some local and online co-op. If this sounds like it's already been done, you're right. But it's less monotonous than the standard Diablo clone, and the humorous characters are well-done and really give the game more life. So it's been done but it's still fun. It's a good casual game to pick up with your pal.","April 28","true","1.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Also you have to be careful against stronger enemy types and large groups of zombies which adds to the excitement.\n- Great crafting system.\nYou can make a lot of guns and armour but it doesn't give you them all at once, you have to progress and put XP into the right areas to do so.\n- Good leveling system.\nYou can distribute XP into different areas and lets you adapt whatever playstyle/weapons you like. You can put all XP into character and base level and just make a base if you want but combat gets harder over time.\n- Good balance between combat and building stuff.\nFight zombies to get supplies then make stuff to kill more zombies.\n- Base building is awesome.\nI loved making a camp in this game and it felt awesome to see it finished with guard towers, walls, weapons crafting area, armour crafting area and a cooking area. And later in the game you get traps which I'm looking forward to heaps!\n\nCons:\n- Lacking in story a bit.\nThis game does have a story but the real interest in doing the missions comes from the item rewards rather than wanting to learn more about Kovac or help people. The story is alright but I found myself skipping dialogue a few times to get back to the combat and crafting.\n- Difficult to find food unless in city/town area during a mission.\nI would like it if there was a set mission to go on a supply run just to get food and drink, I found myself repeating other, older missions to do this instead and it gets a little boring.\n- Various issues with online connectivity and screen resolution due to Beta. Understandable of course, but here are some of the issues I've had:\n- My friend kept getting disconnected from me during game and became unplayable online for him.\n- Screen resolution is square and game only plays in a "windowed" mode.\n- Lag issues and frame drops here and there but nothing major yet.\n\n\nOverall I really like this game and it is unfinished so I don't mind all the small issues and I'm sure most of them will get fixed as the game is developed and comes out of Beta.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10\n\nI would definately recommend this game and think it's really good value for money.\n\nAlso just a side note, you can have a pet crow in this game, it's footsteps sound like the zombies ones so it scared me a few times and the "caws" add to the ambience of the game which is really spooky at times.","April 21","true","9.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I'm fine with games taking new directions and trying new things with sequels, but if it weren't for Kovacs soothing voice, I would have thought this was just yet another poorly planned "early access" survival game riding the coat-tails of another game.\n\nThe melee is clunky, unpolished, and sloppy. You can't aim your hits like in the original, and can't store you charged attacks. While there maybe more variety of weapons, they are the shoddy mass produced "modern" weapons (e.g. a bat with nails), instead of the charming Castaway "junk" weaponry that I was fond of from the original. Furthermore crafting is much less organic, with you being forced into a specific required item for a recipe (such as arrows can only be made with a machete, instead of any sharp object like the original.). You're forced into tiny pre-rendered mission specific areas instead of the open world metroidvania style maps of, you guessed it, the original. And you'd think after the success of the Barricade DLC they'd know how to do proper base building, but they even screwed that up. You have to open an entirely different menu just to open up building, and even then I couldn't figure out which key they wanted me to press to place it since all the prompts are in gamepad symbols.\n\nI have always been a fan of the original until recently, when I found out about a game breaking bug that hadn't been fixed in the original since 2014. My pride was stung, but after hearing of the game having a sequel released I was feeling ready to love again. As you can probably tell by the negative recommendation mark above, I wasn't. Everything about this half-♥♥♥♥♥ turd is an insult and devolution to the success of the original.\n\nI curse the developers for a thousand years of dishonour.","December 29, 2015","false","0.8"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","11","23","4","0"

Granted this game is EA, which means there are a lot of bugs and things to work out, but when you delay the release for a week, I expected at least for their to be a functional options to menu to control audio, game controls etc.  If that was not possible to complete in a week, I at elast expected a constant stream of downloads, similar to ARK, as complaints or bug reports were submitted.\n\nFor the price of 15.99, I think I should have waited until this was further developed. I can not continue on the quest because the quest menu does not scroll, Basically, unless I'm in the mood to grind, or replay quest, I can't play until the scroll issue is fixed.\n\nI recommend that you wait until there are more patches and hotfixes out, before you purchase.","November 2, 2015","false","21.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","1"

It may have issues and problems which could interrupt the game progresses and make this game not that enjoyable. Therefore, think carefully before purchasing this game, always be patient and polite if you have encountered any trouble, and feel free to discuss about your troubles with others in the thread.\n\nPlaying How to Survive 1 before start playing How to Survive 2 is recommended.\n\nHow to Survive 2 was released on Oct 29th, 2015. After over 5 months of development, many major features and functions are already implemented.\n\nCompared with How to Survive 1, How to Survive 2 is still having a long way to go. But just thinking about my experience in How to Survive 1, what devs may achieve in How to Survive 2, and what an amazing price for a good game like this, I cannot keep this game out of my door.\n\nAlthough How to Survive 2 is still in Early Access phase, devs are experienced. They've dealt with many things in How to Survive 1, and I am sure that their capabilities and confidence were what brought them to this title. So personally I am thinking highly of the future of How to Survive 2.\n\nBesides, devs and customer support are actively hearing from the community and are very willing to communicate with players on discussions, in order to make How to Survive 2 a more enjoyable game. So feel free to give feedback and suggestions about the game. And again, be patient, and be polite.\n\n+Graphics and optimizations are good\n+Sound effects are good\n+You're able to build your own camp and develop it into a fortress together with your friends. Isn't that wonderful?\n+Balanced skill progression system with depth\n+Various weapons and armor sets, and modules to upgrade your weapons and armors\n+Missions can be replayed with option of setting mission levels, which means stable and controllable source of materials and EXP\n\n-Lack of voice acting for some NPCs\n-Some important but not vital functions are not yet implemented, for example public camp searching tool, wells with clean water, beds so you can sleep and recover your mental status\n-Need more options for character customizations (decorative/cosmetic items)\n-Tutorial is not as detailed as it used to be in How to Survive 1 (which is why I suggest you guys to play How to Survive 1)\n\nAfter all, I can say that How to Survive 2 is worth the $15 full price.\n\nAnd yes, I give this game a thumb-up.","April 22","true","28.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

Read at your own risk.\n\nTL;DR Not an isometric view guy, but this game has me by the balls. 10/10\n\n\nI'm not really a top-down shooter person. Imagine my surprise when I snag this after purchasing something my computer can't run.\n\nHow to Survive 2 is an excellent title, and is preferable of those that are available, and here's why.\n\nStart with a baseball bat, Smash some zombies' face in, then you start to find materials,  materials you can use to begin building a camp.\n\nFrom you camp you build a variety of crafting stations from which you cook food, make weaponry from  bows to wooden firearms, work with metal and turns bits of lead into ammo, Take random junk you find and make armor, and take plants and rocks and make some gunpowder.\n\nThe beauty of this game is freedom. Sure, you need missions to gather food and whatnot, but as for your camp? You have a large woods area and can build your camp literally Anywhere. Want a tunnel to access Kovac more easily? Done. Wanna live out of a train car on abandoned tracks? done. wanna live in a ditch? Also done. You can build, create, and fight waves of zombies, and the beauty is you don't even have to stick to one spot. Bored with your camp? Build a new one!\n\n\nAs for zombies, welll...they're very....varied. There are different types of zombies, and as you progress in levels, more type will present themselves, and in greater numbers. FIrst, they walk...then jog...bows are fine for these, but whaat to do when they run at you, 10 at a time? Haha. Yes, zombies can run, you also have bloated ones that explode, deer, turkeys, pelicans, zombies that only come out at night, and run faster than anything.\n\nAs for a story, it's actually quite interesting. Exploring the woods your camp is set in provides an interesting backstory into the universe. Kovac, Survival enthusiast, assists you in beginning to survive. THe brothers, who live in the woods just away from kovacs tunnels, bicker back and forth, but reward you for your assistance. Kenji, from the first game, has burning hatred for Kovac and his fans, and wants your help in undermining them...and I imagine more will present themselves.\n\nNow, remember, I'm not an isometric person, and I LOVE this game. So yeah, the viewpoint can be daunting for me, but the game itself is way worth it.","April 26","true","58.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I also wish for a larger camp area, I dont know if it grows or not and I hope it does so I can have each building down and build a real settlement. But still, Despite that, This game is amazing.

The upgrading systems are much deeper, including leveling your character, your camp, and your weapons. A new building mechanic has allowed for more crafting options.\n\nThe visuals are sadly, about the same for the last game, and that's comparing it to the 360 version. The same animations for "kill" shots, and they become VERY repetitive. I haven't gotten too too far in the crafting tree, so I'm not entirely sure how many new weapons there are.\n\nSo far for me the shining point of this game is the audio. This has some of the most immersive game sounds I have ever heard. The thunder crashes like its right outside, the crows caw like they are on your balcony. The rain falls evenly and heavy. The goreier parts are riddled with breaking bones and guishing blood. Somehow, those sound realistic as well!\n\nIf ytou enjoyed the first title, this one is not a hug e departure from that, with quite a few "new" features.

I bought it, mixed reviews be damned. The first game was at least worth the playthrough.\n\nThis game, however, lacks a story of any sort.\n\n"Zombie breakout not just on island anymore" end story\n\nAt first, it is pretty fun. smashing a few zombies then popping them with your bow for a while. But then you start to realize the finer points like\n\n"Man, why even bother with melee when range is so much more pwerful?"\n\nor\n\n"Why the ♥♥♥♥ do all melee attacks go through a single button!?!??!?!?!?!!!?!??!!" And what I mean by this is strong and weak attacks are controlled by one button (for a gamepad that is. I don't much care for keyboard gaming). weak attacks are pointless unless you just need to swing it really fast to daze a fast moving zombie, but the damage is super negligable. Also, your strong strike from a stationary postion does the same amount of damage as a much faster swinging strong attack that can be performed while moving.\n\nI realize, that may be a bit confusing if you haven't played the game.\n\nlet me put it this way, if the speed of the swing for a stationary strong attack was 1, then the speed of a moving strong attack is 1.5x faster. Each attack does THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. So, if you do a stationary strong attack, prepare to take damage that could have been easily avoided.\n\nAnother situation is, if you are running and you almost always are running, you will automatically climb obstacles.\n\nSure, you may be fighting 2 or 3 inside a house, and your instincts will make you try to dodge and attack. Too bad you are gonna spend all your time climbing the ♥♥♥♥ing coffee table instead of swinging your weapon!\n\nlevelling in its current state is pointless. You control the speed at which you level up by allocating experience points.\n\nJust don't ♥♥♥♥ing level up past maybe 5. There is little point. The weapons you are able to make don't come close to being effective once you hit about level 15+. Your armor will be awful, too.\n\nyou can build a base, but it adds little. Sure, your base is where you craft ♥♥♥♥ and you are supposed to defend it, but it won't be under attack unless you are actually there. It really is just a distraction. You gotta run all the way across the map to your base every time you want to check whether or not you have the materials to craft a new weapon.\n\nThe quests get really boring quite fast. By the time you finish one person's set of quests, you move on to the next. Then by the third time you are doing that, you realize the quests are the same but with a different story. (think every ♥♥♥♥ing quest in World of Warcraft. Gather this. Turn in. do next quest)\n\nI know this game is still early access, and I will check out the full release, but I doubt it will get better. I doubt there is going to be a real story involved. I think you are just going to be a survivor doing the ♥♥♥♥♥ work of other survivors who offer you nothing. This game would need a massive overhaul to be worth spening the full price. Buy this game when it is 5 dollars and you won't be disappointed.","December 4, 2015","false","118.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","2"

You do small cut-and-paste missions to collect scrap, and these monotone missions doesn't leave you with any feeling of progress other than you being able to craft higher levels of cut-and-paste weapons. You no longer craft a fiber longbow, you craft "The Silencer" or "The Deathblower". ...as if we needed less realism.\n\nThe incredibly oversized "camp map" is the most monotone by far, consisting of mostly trees, trees, and more trees.\n\nAs this game is still in Early Access, I ran into huge shortages of things like planks and sheet metal, that made the game five TIMES as hard to play, because tools I needed (like the saw, or copper wire) was found on later missions.\n\nThe game currently has no ending, the last mission being pretty much just as generic as the first one. So far the story is just about you being Kovac's errand boy, from start to finish.\n\nI'm not CURRENTLY recommending this game at this time, but I'm sure that it will improve. However the question is if it will improve ENOUGH, when the whole MMORPG gameplay seems to stand firmly in the way of a good story.","January 2","false","84.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

You had this bit, this bit and this bit... now depending on which of the next three changed the weapon. Or you replace the first bit and get a whole new set of options!\nNow, it's all levelled hard-craft choices. build 'this item' with 'these stats' and deal with it.\nAmmo is all bullets. Loud and attention-grabbing. so there's another step down.\nUpgrading your gear should make killing enemies easier... not say 'hey, i killed one of you. all rush me!' so it seems to be forcing you back towards the bow and crossbow.\nMelee weapons are much the same. Can't mess up 'hit them until they stay down'.\n\nThe buildings allow for great new recipies, but could do with the option to MOVE ONCE PLACED! My biggest complaint about the base-building is that once it's down, deal with it.\nPut something down wrong? deal with it or destroy it.\nLike many other things, once you've done it, it's stuck.\nI feel that this game could do with some more features (like 'move buildings' or 'define camp area') and will gladly take back any of these comments if they're already on the drawing board and appear later.\n\nI like the option to 'increase the difficulty' of missions. that's great for testing gear, grinding XP or keeping things interesting... but again, with hard-choice crafting, you don't get the customisability and have to carrry alternate options with you instead.\n\nThe inventory system is weight-based, no longer slot based (one of the better choices made) but with one glaring problem...\nYOU NAVIGATE IT WITH A CURSOR!\nWith a mouse, that's perfectly fine and makes sense... with a controller (which is apparently the suggested method of play) a cursor is a nightmare to use!\n\nGenerally, I was far more impressed with the first game than this one.\nWorth a play for fans of the genre (moreso if they havn't played the first) but I can't recomend this game to anyone full-price.","April 27","false","11.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","3"

This is just a shoddy port by lazy developers who also decided that it's a good idea to release a "standalone DLC" where they just put the camera in a different angle, not even refining the textures.\n\nFirst of all, you can't optimize anything. No resolution, no fullscreen, no nothing apart from audio.\nThere are a lot of long,draggy loading screens between "missions" (just get this, get that because why not missions with zombies slapped into them) that just load up a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking level with a few zombies in it, and then take some more time to load another half empty camp map.\nDid you want controls on how to build your camp? Well too bad, because they didn't bother to give you keyboard controls in the tutorial but rather just left you with the controller bindings.\n\nBy the way, after 30 Minutes (which were about 10 minutes of actual gameplay) the game froze and then deleted my safe file.\n\nThank GabeN for Steam Refunds, I'd say pass this one.

I really REALLY tried to play it...  The loading screens aren't the worst and that is saying something.  The loading takes forever!  And the gameplay is really weird and dumb.  I was hoping it would be kinda like where you can choose to either make a house in a city (making zombie spawns a lot higher than woods) into a "settlement" where you and your friends try to survive, or make a camp outside of a city (like woods or elsewhere), but no.  We are given this weird type of game where basically you do missions.  that's really it.  The skill tree (If you can call it that) really sucks.  When you complete a mission, you are given xp, BUT I didn't know that til 6 missions later because it doesn't really tell you, it only expects you to understand it's weird skill based "skill tree?"  And when you are in a city, it's for a mission and it's blocked off.  Sure there is a huge map that you can just roam around but the first how to survive had a great area to explore!  this one is very boring.  My friends (Who I bought this game for btw) Got really bored with this game because of the fact that you can't skip the tutorial.  And the worst part is not having a survival mode.  I really REALLY liked it in the first game but it ain't in this game...  The customization is very limited as well.  Though that doesn't really effect gameplay, I thought it would be something to add so maybe if the developer or anyone reads this they can add more.  There is only one girl to choose from.  Why?  I liked how the first one actually had characters who had there own traits.  Also joining and inviting people was actually frustrating for me and joining other people's quest's was rediculous.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to sit in a 5 minute loading screen ACCEPT A MISSION, then sit in ANOTHER loading screen but it's 10 minutes long to tell me it couldn't connect to server and sends me to the main menu.  I play borderlands 2 and dungeon defenders with my friends and we have perfect connection but this game won't let us play more than half the time.  Again I really tried to like it but I can't.","April 10","false","2.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","1"

Sure there are more options available but to level anything you have to pay in exp points four times. So when it says pay 500 exp to level something in actuallity you have to pay 2000 exp to level it.\nThe menus need to be adjusted for controller support as in when I bring up a menu I would very must like it if the cursor snapped directly to the stuff I can actually use vs having a mouse cursor appear on screen and slowly move it to the things I need to click to in order to end the mission or craft.\nHit detection needs work as well as I have several times, in the brief time I have played, tried a hard swing at melee range zombies to have my hit completely ignored as said zombie score a free hit.\nAlso at one point a zombie became immune to my attacks while on some stairs.

It is way too generic right now, like a early tech demo. The combat is really generic, clunky and slow. The graphics and effects look like they are from 2006 or earlier. There is no way to block or dodge, and some enemies like even dogs early on can't be avoided unless you hit them first. So if there is more than 1 you just swing and hope you don't take a hit, run away a little bit, come back and swing again. They do little dmg, but still your guy shouldn't feel so vulnerable like a girl scout. Sometimes my guy does a long heavy swing when I don't want him to. This happens when I tap mouse 1 more than once sometimes when the actual way you have to do it is to hold it down and charge it up. It always makes me take a unnecessary hit from the enemy. You can't move when doing a heavy charge attack, which leaves you very vulnerable, so I just don't use it hardly at all.\n\nThe graphics even on ultra are really bad and even though I have way more than what this game requires including a gtx 970 with acx 2.0 dual fan cooling, and the game still makes it sound pretty loud. Louder than what it sounds while playing the Battleborn open beta (which really isn't loud at all) and almost as loud as it sounds when running The Division (which is loud). The first game looked pretty decent but this game just looks ugly as hell, every bit of it including effects.\n\nEverything else is very bare and generic as well, including the UI, menu's, dialogue boxes, etc. It's just depressing gray or black boxes with no prompts either (I figured out spacebar was to continue dialogue).\n\nI would be more than happy to give it a thumbs up when it gets more work. Since October of last year when it hit early access it should be further along by now, especially with blockbusters like Battleborn and Doom coming out May 3rd and 13th. Hell I have plenty of games right now I would rather play besides this.\n\n5/10 so far. Very generic like a off-brand dollar store G.I. Joe compared to an actual G.I. Joe with karate chop action.","April 14","false","1.2"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","2"

The first one was so good of capturing that survival element and even though there is more of that here, IT FEELS LIKE A KIDS GAME! The combat has been simplified to the point of killing 15 zombies with the first weapon in the game, The kovac tapes that you used to collect along the beach, that were acctually funny at times, now its "Kovac TV" and it feels cheesy and unfunny, the whole school theme and the Michael Jackson Parody all seem to fit in just such a disarry of @£/%. To the point i stopped watching them and tried to figure it out on my own rather then watch an acctually funny video and learn the games mechanics together then this. Weapons and Armour for are cool, seem too pushed into the players face, in the old one the bow didnt come much later, now you instantly get to craft it and a spiked baseball bat upon start. I loved this franchise but ever since the awful 3rd person copy of the 1st it seems too... childish... if you've played the 1st you will know what i mean but to every one else its okay i guess, base building is cool but not as cool as it sounds, if you want base building get fallout 4, havent played fallout 4 its okay i guess (if you havent played another zombie game its okay i guess).

This review is of early access and I would not recommend getting this game yet as it is still not at a stage where it is an enjoyable experience.\n\nEdit: I originally put this review up just for any friends that would stumble upon it, but I was requested to provide more detailed feedback.\n\nAs I mentioned the controls feel nothing like the previous game, notably when you charge up a melee attack you are stuck in one spot and you are no longer able to hold the attack longer nor release early.\n\nIn the previous game all the areas were interconnected which was more satisfying when exploring and revisiting the area again later would have map revealed. In this game the areas are temporary instances which can be replayed with random changes, which maybe be good for replay but they aren't connected to anything and there is really no reason to bother replaying.\n\nThe difficulty in this game scales up as you increase in level, unlike in the previous game where your  improvements help to make enemies easier, the increasing difficulty completely negates any advantages being of higher level if not making enemies more difficult to deal with.\n\nIt might be fun to play this game multiplayer, but this area is lacking. Multiplayer menus and searching are not intuitive and/or not existant, I am not really sure as I haven't worked it out.\n\nCharacter creation or selection should be the first thing you do in the game. Starting with a generic character and having to find the customisation menu hidden away somewhere, I found that there wasn't any particular attachment to the character. In the previous game even with only 3 character to choose from, I seemed more invested in the character.","February 14","false","13.6"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

When in playing the game now i can see that that vission i had is gone, in real its is a instanced game with very little freedom give to you as a player. The base creation is ok but not needed apart from crafting stuff to me they just should of allowed you to use Kovaks place for saftey and crafting as this sort of base building and crafting is more for a open world game and not somthing that is instanced. After i had played the 6 mission and seen that the next mission was go collect 4 plants for a witch from the swamps i litteraly lost the will to play the game any further, as i had been to the swamps 3 times already and was bored of it.\n\nWarning for youtubers - I have had problems with youtube copyright striking my videos for this game not for music but for sound effects used in the game for instance the ambient sounds fromt eh swamps or the wind blowing in a area. This is getting a tas anoying but this isnt the Devs fault we all know how bad youtubes copyright is.\n\nBuy or Not - at this time i have got to say the game is worth the price tag for it but i wouldnt pay anymore for it, the game istelf is good for fist 4 - 8 hours after that its very repetative. So if your looking for a open world sandbox zombie survival game then this is not for you.","October 30, 2015","false","7.4"," 7 of 23 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","7","23","0","0"

Can't really imagine what group it's appealing too. The content (tut, map etc) was barebones and seemed like a game from the 2000's.  The gameplay (combat, surviving and 'camps') is *not* what is promised, or what it appears to be in the exaggerated screen shots. The combat is point and click, but you have to click exactly after each swing because the game isn't user friendly and doesn't 'queue' up attacks which makes it feel sluggish and bugged. Surviving just entails watching your food and water bar drop % and then right click pixels to fill it up... Yay, fun... The camps are just a glorified bank, that's it. It's also the only real place to dump all your resources into as well; making all that scavenging and looting utterly empty.\n\nSorry How To Survive team, but you should pack up shop and leave it to the innovative people. To continue this game would be to hire a group of people specialised in burrying their own franchise. I mean where is all their energy going??? Must be one hell of a chill job.","May 3","false","1.8"," 0 of 14 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","14","0","0"

As soon as I opened the game I was asked to change my shadow settings. Not anything else. In the main menu I saw no options for keybindings or controls. In the game I had Xbox controls (so I'm obviously confused playing the game as I use keyboard) and then the game crashed.\n\nBest 10 minutes ever spent.
