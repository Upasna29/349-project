I must say, as a classic games enthusiast (and a lover of 90's games) this well-polished strategy game is exactly what I would expect of a well done refurbished classic game. Want a comparison of what this is like? Take Age of Empires and merge it with Warcraft 2 and dash in the 4x-ness of Civilization. You're now probably wondering how these games weren't more popular? That's a great question... see Seven Kingdoms Conquest and you'll get your answer. Seriously though, if you're a fan of indepth RTS's or just classic games, SKAA is a great place to start! Plus I hear there is an active modding community for this game despite it being almost 20 years old!\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZqXphIwOrI","March 22","true","0.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","26","27","4","6"

I started playing it as a child. When Windows XP came out, I was sad to see that Seven Kingdoms was not compatible. I would literally set up my families ancient desk top that ran windows 98 just to play this game. A few months ago, I got seven kingdoms 2 hoping it would be just as good as the original. Saddly many of the game mechanics were over symplified in the later edittion.\n\nSeven Kingdoms is an easy game to learn yet dificult to master. Because of complex underlying mechanics, you can almost beat your enemies just to see half your army defect because you haven't maintained moral. Or your economy can stagnate because your trade agrement was broken.\nThe general gameplay is easy to pick up, but to apreciate the depth of this game, you really need to read the manual.","April 25","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the first game I owned so many years ago and it still feels like the better RTS I've ever played! The mechanics are wonderfully tailored! Not even 19 years make it look old! The graphics are lovely!\n\nFor sure I'll spend some more hundred hours on it!\n\nAnd it runs on Win 10! LOVELY!!!","May 10","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
