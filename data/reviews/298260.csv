Probably teenagers or people hating adventure/indie games.\n\n2) This is a great game in all aspects. I agree it's getting a little frustrating at times and it that it has its bugs, but hey, which adventure game didn't have these things?\nYou have to keep in mind that this is a free game (surprisingly), and it gives you the chance to spend some hours gaming happily (if you like the genre).\n\nThis game is a hybrid of adventure/indie/mystery games. And the voice acting is awesome despite the bad comments i've been seeing around. Reminds me a bit of myst combined with the craziness of stanley parable.\n\nI strongly suggest this game if you 're into mystery/atmospheric games and like playing through a story.\n\n---UPDATE----\nI'm sorry if I offended a general group of people, certainly wasn't aiming for that.\nAbout the teenagers part, i said "probably" and what I was trying to say is that a big percent of the teenagers can't appreciate this game properly, hence the bad reviews about things in this game i found prety interesting and amazing. I never said this game is perfect or doesnt have problems, i just recommended it and found the devs work really good for a free indie game.\nAbout the incoherent jumbled mess of the story,I just love how abstract this game is, it draws you in and u have to think on your own what the hell is going on, just like reading a well-written book.\nIn the forums you can find alot of very logical and good explanations regarding the story, that make sense.","November 17, 2014","true","4.8"," 661 of 788 people (84%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","84","661","788","45","14"

You take control of Anthony, a young man who awakens in an empty bedroom after a long night of partying with his female companion Sam. Soon Anthony is contacted through radio by an angry man named Vinnie and discovers that Sam is missing. Now Anthony has to find Sam and escape the bizarre prison that Vinnie has made for him.\nOnly If is a game designed to trick and toy with you. The solutions to the puzzles are surprisingly creative. You must scan the environment for clues and use different objects to complete different riddles, allowing you to progress.\nThe game is divided into two paths. The first path you can choose is well done. Here the game turns full in a dream-like identity.\nThe second path uses some stealth elements, terribly glitched switch puzzles and environments that never feel fantastic or dream-like.\nTo finish the whole game with both paths takes something between 2 and 3 hours.\nGraphics and voice acting are good, nothing really big to complain about.\nOnly If has some good aspects but also some bad (second path) In my opinion it is still worth playing, it is free, so why not?\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 429 of 512 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","429","512","4","5"

The voice acting is ok too. The storyline is quirky and ok for a short game- even if you have to wait until the end of it to understand anything.\n\nBut so much about this game irritated the hell outta me!\nOk, so I was not expecting this to be an adventure puzzle game where you can actually die a million times. That's not really the games fault, but tagging could be improved. That's not the biggy though, I started small.\n\nThe game kept failing on me! So many times I had to restart the game because it was buggy as hell. I finished the entire game (which took about 4 hours) and my steam playtime showed up as 1 minute. I also received no achievements. None. I understand that some of them got taken away but even the ones that should've showed up just for finishing the game weren't there. I figured that maybe with a 1 minute playtime on my record steam didn't realize that I had even played the game. So I played it again. I followed a walkthrough to the letter this time trying to make sure I didn't miss anything. I got 3 hours on my steam playtime and still no achievements. I hunted through Google to see if their were any fixes, and there were suggestions but none of the 'fixes' actually worked, so that was disappointing. Even if there is a fix hidden somewhere that I'm somehow missing- I'm still unimpressed that the game is broken to the point that I would have to try to find one.\n\nOn top of that, there were various bugs throughout the game, like getting stuck walking up stairs (character would just flicker halfway up) and "press e to pull lever" getting stuck on my screen until level restart (as it completely stopped my ability to do anything else).\n\nThe puzzles were nearly impossibly random and abstract. If you like that sort of thing- go for it- but as a huge adventure game lover (been playing adventure games long before steam even launched) I find this terribly annoying. Most games have some sort of logic to it so you can even begin to attempt to solve the puzzles. If anyone has finished this game without using a walkthrough once I'll eat my hat.\n\nAnd finally- I know I'll get flamed for this but I honestly don't care- The swearing was completely and utterly unnecessary. I know there are some games that make certain characters swear for the sake of making them appear tough, or gangster or whatever character they're going for... but this game has said "want a swear word? TAKE THEM ALL!" I mean come on, there's a point where something goes beyond advancing a character or storyline and dives straight into an immature prebuscent who's discovered swear words for the first time and wants to sound "cool". And that means something coming from a 20-something year old who has grown up with swearing all their life. Sheesh.\n\nWould I recommend this game. NOPE. Move on.\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\nPlease note that achievements are not my sole reason for playing games. You can see this by the fact I rarely get 100% achievements on anything- because I don't see much point. But this is a review and I'm stating problems with the game.","April 15, 2015","false","3.1"," 193 of 268 people (72%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","72","193","268","23","21"

Just to give an example, one time I was crawling through some reeds, clipped through to a part I wasn't supposed to be at, and got stuck. So I had to restart the level and sit through the LONNNNNNGGG cutscene. This is a game where the point is mindscrewery, so ideally the mechanics should not be causing me the most frustration. At the part with all the coulmns, I fell to my death an incredible amount of times. Not because I didn't know where to go, but because I couldn't gauge my jumps. That kind of thing irks me in a bad way.\n\nThe rest of the game irked me in a *good* way through, flinging headscratching puzzles at me with utter contempt. I enjoy beating an opponent that tells me I can't, so this was right up my alley. Good voicework too, with the actors conveying exactly who each character is, even if those characters are revealed to be rather loathesome. I will not reveal the ending, only that I thought about it for quite a while, and I immediately hunted down the end credits music for my iPod.\n\nI guess I recommend it, especially if you like media that's constantly self-dissecting and pulling the rug out from under you. But they REALLY should have playtested it more to smooth out the rough patches. This game should not be so smug in such an unpolished state.\n\nBTW, I definitely recommend choosing the black pawn first.","February 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 73 of 88 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","73","88","7","0"

Even after fully completing the game, I keep contemplating over it. Then, the developer must have achieved what he was striking for: through a series of "fourth wall breaking" scenes and situations, this game made me think on a deeper meaning hidden behind the absurd. As mentioned by the creator: "finding worth in the worthless".\n\nOnly If starts with Anthony going to Sam's party - a girl that he's into as we know. The screen starts to get blurry with music fading on the background. The next thing we know, is that we wake up after a party hard and no one seems to be around. We wander within the mansion and stumble on Vincent, or rather Vinny - who prefers to communicate with us through old radios for some reason. He mocks, insults, and challenges Anthony at every step of his journey, for either finding Sam or getting the hell out of this damned mansion by himself. What will you choose?\n\nThe game holds and utilizes all the possibilities of Unity3D, not marvelous, but pretty enough if used correctly. Yet, what the game aims to be is not beautiful anyway. It aims to be frustrating and enlightening at the same time, and it manages to be both. As a side note, you shouldn't really try this if you have epileptic tendency, because you'll be encountering sharp turns of the camera, sudden flashes and changes of light quite often. Even I got dizzy and a bit nauseated from time to time. The game has an unconventional loading system btw; each time you'd like to load an episode, you have to type in the name of the episode, so be warned. Attention is your friend sometimes; some other times... you'd better gaze elsewhere because you'd lose time out of curiosity. Achievements are a bit glitchy, so you should verify local cache from time to time to make sure they'd pop up when the requirements are met.\n\nWith no subtitles or direct screen commands, you have to listen carefully to understand Vinny, think on it and react as fast as possible. The game keeps both your wits and reflexes sharp. Expect the unexpected. Think outside of the box. Even with the most cliché anecdotes, there is a hidden smart remark, a tongue in cheek mockery with the idea of "common". It is brilliant in a way, and peculiarly annoying and meaningless. Even for that paradox only, I'd recommend the experience.\n\nConsidering it is a free game, there is nothing you'd lose for taking a glance. For me, even writing this review has been a challenge, since the whole idea of the game constrains you from declaring general opinions. Try for yourself. What you'll encounter is nothing you've ever encountered before; that I can promise.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 8","true","7.6"," 69 of 94 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","69","94","0","4"

I have the planets shortest attention span and temper, and I managed to not only play but finish this game. I did get stumped several times, and it's NOT because of faulty controls, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics, or glitches that the developers "ignored" - it was because this is one hell of a good puzzle game. It's somewhat short - it only took several hours *checks phone* roughly 4-5 hours - but it is well worth giving it some patience and, if you get really stumped, checking a walkthrough to get you just over that little stump.\n\nPut Portal and the like out of your head, this isn't a physics puzzler, more of a classic puzzle game where you have to find a part, or follow a convoluted (but interesting) path, etc.\n\nI will say this: when the game wants you to hammer "E" or "space", using a keyboard sucks ♥♥♥. I played the entire thing with my steam controller, and with a slightly modified mapping (I'll upload the map, check it out) it was flawless.

I know this game is supposed to be surreal (think Stanley Parable or Kentucky Route Zero), but the game is extremely confusing and irritating to play. Walkthrough is pretty much needed, as the game doesn't give the player even an inkling of an idea when it comes to solving certain puzzles.\n\nSo you begin the game by going to a party, but your vision fades to white at the door. You wake up in a strange bed with no recollection of past events, so you set to figure out what's happened. Except you're thrown into a weird dream like world that defies logic and natural laws. And you get shouted at by a voice in a radio doing a bad Al Pacino impression.\n\nThe game looks decent enough. The game runs 60 FPS most of the time, but for some odd reason tanks to 30 and even below for no apparent reason. This kind of behavior happened in the second room of the game, but when later revisiting the room in another puzzle, the game ran at 60 FPS again. I have no idea as to why this happens, forced VSync, maybe? There seems to be only very primitive graphical controls with a handful of predetermined levels of graphical fidelity. There should be more detailed graphical options for tweaking things like texture quality, anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, VSync etc.\n\nThe voice acting is susceptible to very annoying changes in audio level. The two types of voices you're going to hear are the main character and a mysterious voice on the radio. The main character seems to be clearly audible most of the time, but sometimes inaudibly mumbles something for no apparent reason. While this mumbling is annoying, the radio voice is even worse. Sometimes when the radio was far away, I couldn't make sense through the low audio level, distortion and unclear voice acting, whereas scenes where the radio was closer caused some clipping. In my case it got to the point of hurting my ears at certain points, especially when the radio voice was practically in my ear. The lack of captions didn't make understanding dialogue any easier.\n\nControlling the character is easy enough in situations that don't require precise platforming. Unfortunately, there is some precise platforming involved in at least one section. The dimensions of how far or high the main character can jump are not really clear, and I fell to my death multiple times by either bumping my head on something or just falling short. The level layout is also very confusing, and many times I had to simply make a leap of faith to see if I could make a jump - and many times that failed. There seem to be also some invisible walls, which at least in one scenario made me think I hit a bug. The way the camera behaves can also be kind of dizzying and sickess inducing at times. Especially crouching while moving can cause some tilting (I guess roll is the correct term) that is exaggerated and very unnatural.\n\nThe worst thing about Only If is the lack of direction. As of writing this review, I've been to seven or so sections. The game gives very little to no hints at all as to what you're supposed to do. Actually, I'd go even further and say that the game even misleads you. It's difficult in a review to point out these sorts of things without spoilers, and I'd like to keep this spoiler free. I'm only going to say that the game wants the player to name a thing at one point. The game primes you by displaying some scenery associated to one thing, but then expects a completely different answer. Also, there's a button mashing sequence that, as far as I can tell, leads only to the main characters death and a level restart.\n\nCreating an experience that is not frustratingly obscure to the player is something I expect from any game, surreal or not. The worst challenges in this game are not just stopping and thinking about all the mechanics of a puzzle, or trial and error, or even memorizing. The challenge at its worst is truly in the realm of "guess the developer logic" type of "puzzling". I simply cannot recommend this game in it's current form.","July 25, 2014","false","1.6"," 235 of 376 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","235","376","2","1"

Combine the thrill you got when you first played the portal series with the highly detailed environment of most of the latest games on the market. I'm going to try and give you a nice easy list of pros and cons to help you decide whether to download this game. And even though i love the game so much, i'll remain as unbiased as i can >:D I understand that no-one wants to really read a novel for a review, so if you quickly want to find out whether its worth it, just read the dot-point titles under each category - that should give you an idea.\n\nPros:\n-Plot > The plot for Only If really grabs you from the start. It's quite the mystery, and im not quite sure why its been tagged horror, but it certainly does have some thriller/suspense elements to it. If i try and give you an idea to the plot, it will all end up being spoilers, so you'll just have to gve it a shot. It can get really intense at times  (a lot of running, and a lot of you getting shot at, stabbed, buried alive under a lagoon, eaten by black misty stuff, falling to your death, being crushed, being chased, being drugged, and a lot of other crazy stuff) , and you have to make sure you know the environment around you if you want to stay alive.\n\n-Environment > The graphics in the game are equivalent to most high end paid games. There is an incredible amount of detail to the world, and you'll find yourself admiring it from the very start. Trust me. They're pretty good.\n\n-Puzzles > There is no doubt you'll find yourself wandering about trying to figure out what on Earth is going on. My only advice is that you listen very carefully to what Vinnie is saying (the man on the radio - its...er...hard to explain). Often the puzzles come in the form of riddles, and they determine how you complete each level. Once again, people complain about not clearly knowing what to do. My response: its a PUZZLE game - that's whats meant to happen :D. Often, Vinnie will have said something that points to an object in the environment you need to interact with in a particular way. Another bit of advice, when a question is asked, you may have to TYPE out your response. As another reviewer said before - when people got stuck in portal levels, noone complained there. (Shout-out to whoever that was). You'll enjoy them, trust me :)\n\n-Achievements > There are a few easter eggs thrown about the game, as well as some pretty funny achievements. If that's your cup of tea, you'll like this. Granted, there aren't many of them, but I guess the fact that some are so darn hard to get makes up for it.\n\n-Voice Acting > I liked the script, and the tonations of the voices. It was clever. Some people don't agree. Up to you to decide...\n\n-Ending > That ending....oh my..... :') Remember not to just turn off the game the moment the credits turn up - you are NOT finished....\n\n-Price > Or lack thereof. Come on people, its freeeeeeee! Just give it a shot. If you feel you wasted a few hours of your life, feel free to leave a comment here and complain about it. I promise to probably not read it ;) But yeah, just do it. It's a decent game for $0. It would still be worth it at around $10-$15+ dollars quite frankly.\n\nCons:\n-Vulgarity > Ok, so there is gratuitous swearing and many references. There is a lot of it. It is everywhere. I really don't recommend this for someone who's under the age of, i dunno, whatever age at which this would be inappropriate. You'll need to be fairly mature. You have been warned.\n\n-Audio >  I found that at some points, the audio volume level would vary.Now this is fairly minor in terms of cons. But you might need to keep fiddling with your volume control at various points so that it doesn't get too soft/loud at times. But really, that should be fine.\n\n-Instructionals > At certain points, you will learn new skills, such as the ability to pick things up, etc. The instruction for this (press ... to do ...) pops up in the middle of the screen in small letters. Now generally you will catch it, but if you're not ready for it, and you miss it - you will have a particularly hard time finishing the level. This only happened in one instance for me (which was the picking up things i mentioned earlier), but i simply went back to the last checkpoint, and then everything was fine.\n\n-Ending > I can see how people might miss the actual ending because the credits show up. So, word of advice. Wait...\n\nSo, there you are. Make your own decision, but know that this really is a game worth playing, even if you don't like this sort of thing. Give it a shot. You've got nothing to lose. It's not even that big of a download from memory, so it won't take long to uninstall if you are dissapointed.

Yes, I'm aware it looks like I didn't actually play the game.  No, I do not intend to see that it gets fixed.\n\nYes/No is a difficult choice to make on this title.  It's sophomoric, but it's free to play.  It's clear the author is still getting his footing, so he's not charging money and that's commendable.  I've seen far worse sold for cash in the steam store, and even then sold for cash under the guise of the Early Access moniker.\n\nI'll get my criticisms out of the way.  It looks better in the video.  In-game, it leaves something to be desired in the details.  Also, no option for Y axis inversion, so those of us who are veterans (also known as "right") are forced to struggle.  Also, there was no easily described method of quitting.  Again, being veteran, the Alt+F4 combination did the job, but a person who didn't know about that would have to find another way of leaving the game, the worst-case being a hard reboot.  You never want your audience to feel like they're being held hostage.  The sound design is good, but the balance is off leaving the voice-over difficult to hear and the voice-over itself is a little overused, venturing hard in to crutch territory.  Lastly, I was expecting something a little more seat-of-your-pants akin to No Time To Explain meets Ether One and it fell short on that scale.  It was borderline psychedelic in places and had a decent sense of atmosphere, but on the whole just didn't feel as finished as I'd like.\n\nOn the bright side, I won't say that I didn't like it.  It was fun.  It was an interesting diversion.  The developer needs more practice, but on the whole, the game told a story and I had a good time.  If it were my game, I wouldn't strive for higher resolution.  There's more to be said for pulling off an artistic vision than for photo-realism.  We know this game isn't real, we don't have to be reminded of that.  I'd experiment more with shader networks, play even more with the bloom filter, use visual tricks to mess with your audience's head just a little bit more.  If you can make them second-guess their perceptions, they'll be drawn in more, little by little, deeper down the rabbit's hole.  In spite of places where the details get a little ugly, there are bright moments where this really is a beautiful game, but they're only moments.  It needs more.  Overall, I'm glad I didn't pay for it, but I like where it's going.  I hope to see more and better from this developer in the future.","July 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 80 of 129 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","80","129","0","2"

It's Free-to-Play but I would honestly pay money to play it.  Only If is very experimental , so I guess it can be easily misunderstood (note: in the Guides section there is an in-depth explanation of the game written by the developer himself, which I highly recommend reading AFTER you play it). But I can appreciate it for what it is at the core of the very short adventure: the game itself is more about the journey rather than the destination. Portraying the concept of something over the achievement of a goal. That's what I like about it; the puzzles may seem odd by themselves but are very intuitive and creative. Rather than be guided by objectives in the corner of your screen or being reminded every few minutes of your goal, the game expects you to listen closely and be patient, then think outside the box (or inside the trash can). Sometimes it's just a matter of literally slowing down and paying attention to your surroundings.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are highly innovative, I enjoyed the use of typing out words as a direct means of communication between you and the game. But it can be frustrating in some ways too. The save feature is unique in that you have to remember the "code word" for the level you last played, then type it on the main menu to continue. However, if you quit the game at any point mid-level, you will unfortunately have to start at the beginning. That's not a big deal though, since the game is short and engrossing enough to make it hard to stop playing. The graphics and level designs are beautiful, the voice acting is incredibly good, the writing is fantastic.  The game explores all the fears and pitfalls of being part of the Millennial generation, admist what appears to be an acid trip gone horribly wrong. The game reminds me of Stanley Parable, since you are all alone, guided only by antagonizing voices.  The message this game delivers is as deep as you make it, which gives it a very personal appeal. But that also makes it very easy to misconstrue or become frustrated or confused by certain aspects.\n\nI won't spoil the ending, of course, but I will say this: After going through everything you have up until this point, the ending seems almost like those hilarious and nonsensical secret "gag endings"...anyone remember the "Dog" ending in Silent Hill 2?  And that's not a complaint, because I thoroughly enjoyed having my mind messed with repeatedly during this game.  In fact, Only If does reference and parody aspects to other games as well.  Maybe that's the true point of the game. It makes you question your own expectations of what an adventure game should really be, and what you will get out of it is determined by how open your mind is to the experience. It even makes you question your own concept of who the antagonist and protagonist should be.. I get this overwhelming sense that the developer put a lot of heart and effort into this, but  it feels more like an overall experiment--not because it's random and meaningless but because this is only the tip of the iceberg. This game is more about showing you what is possible.  And it makes me very excited to see what they come up with next.","September 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Firstly i would like to say that a free game should never be an incentive to give it a go if a game is bad a game is bad regardless of how little or much you had to pay for it.\n\n"Only if" was an experience with not much to take away, no moral of the story, no parable, no lessons just spiteful banter between the main character and the radio persona the wittyist dialogue between the characters is them calling each other c*ck suckers and some joke about r*pe that pewdiepie fans wouldn't even consider funny, however the voice acting is decent and the radio persona becomes an aggresively endearing character as the game progresses. The mechanics of the game are simple and it involves simple puzzles that seem more like exploitation of faults of the games engine rather than genuine, clever puzzles like that in the stanley parable. The visuals are beautiful and vibrant and do well at creating a mysterious setting it just sucks that as soon as you are sucked into this mysterious world your drowned out with a tonne of swearing and cancerous banter that makes the 12 year olds screaming and eating their mics in FPS games look like saints. You basically have to sit through them arguing for the entire experience (save for the garden part which was my fave part) The "twist" ending just aggrivated me, it didn't feel like an ending to me because the game had no structure to begin with just random puzzles that you get thrown in and have to solve before some black mist swallows you. The trial and error method of solving the puzzles is the most effective therefore i call B.S on the clever aspect of the games puzzles.\n\nIn summary this game just isn't worth your time even if it only has 2 hours of game time, it's just an empty experience about some immature brat arguing with a figureless voice in a wierd, pretentious yet broken world. If you want the same experience google dank memes and buy a fedora, watch some incest tagged anime and spout "clever" remarks to your friends about how "incest is wincest." Seriously this is what the game considers a satrical joke!

I've never been so in love with a video game's aesthetic setting of a natural park or floating Grecian pillars or surviving a dilapidated hunting cabin while being hunted by some girl's brother and friend and then within seconds being reminded it was designed by developers that couldn't be bothered by censoring themselves even once. Only If makes no attempt what-so-ever to be light or dark about its own generated humor or violence without every swear word possible; completely ripping the player out of a situation that could have brought truly powerful immersion.\n\nOnly If brings several aspects of modern gaming into a focused setting of humor, terror, confusion, frustration, and sorrow, but never delivers with what could have been a truly astounding and hard-hitting story. The game includes rich textures and breathtaking scenery mixed with interesting in-game and pre-rendered cinematic scenes making the player forget at times the game has no price tag. The game's duration and depth, especially with the richness of dialogue casting a light on what is and what is not reality and the uncertainty with either choice, is surprisingly detailed and explores just the right length of chord for the outlets it opens. Only If forces the player to make a choice, to choose a path for sake singular survival or selfless sacrifice, but eventually fails to take itself seriously once the result of either and both these choices have been explored.\n\nOnly If is one of the hardest games to not recommend, but its overwhelming flaws destroy what could have truly been a knock-out of a first-person adventure story. It blended several modern concepts into one singular medium, with a path as survival puzzling and the other as intense platforming, fusing multiple genre together and allowing them to reign but not overstay their welcome.

The result is a trail and error system that is more punishing than rewarding;  And nothing is more annoying than having to play the same sequence multiple times over when you don't know what the devs intended for you to do.\n\nI hate to give this game a bad review, because there is genuine quality here and it's all free.

It's also been tagged "horror" for reasons that escape me but as that was user-defined, I won't blame the creators. However, the game did still disappoint. I'm glad it's free. I wouldn't want to have spent money on this.\n\nThe recurring thought I had while playing this, which is its main problem, is that throughout, it feels like it's trying to be deep and mysterious, when there clearly is no deep and mysterious message behind any of it. You have something acting pretentious while it's obvious that it's nothing more than an action/comedy, which isn't particularly exciting or funny but is tedious due to the "artsy" or "suspenseful" parts.\n\nMy dislike for the game grew a lot stronger when our protagonist used a homophobic slur. It was already hard to find any reason to care for the generic "party hard YOLO" youth that he seemed to be, nor for the elusive "Sam" character, who was the same generic character only in female form. It strengthened the feeling that the creators are not at all out to make an artsy, creative statement, so why is it constantly acting like they are? I also have to question the decision to make what seems like a branching path, only to force the player to take both in one playthrough anyway. It makes the antagonist's comments on your decision rather empty.\n\nI'm keeping this spoiler-free, so I won't specify the details of the ending but it was about as trite as I expected following all the tedious "puzzles", the sort-of out of place "action scenes"(I say sort-of since the game is only artsy at face value) and frustrating platforming stage that feels the need to glorify drugs for some reason. Oh and if you spy a certain achievement name before getting to the ending, the "twist" isn't exactly shocking. Although it does raise some questions as to why they made that particular joke about the "twist." Seems kind of, how do I put it, ♥♥♥♥ed up?

The mechanics of the game may be junk, but the story is what makes the game so intriguing. You can kind of say that it's like Portal, because the characters are what makes the story here, just like in Portal.\n\nAbout the mechanics though. At the start of the game, you are given a choice. You have to choose between either a black or a white pawn. Personally, i couldn't complete the game without looking at walkthroughs, cause you will end up getting stuck a lot in this game, especially the black pawn route.\n\nWhen choosing the black pawn, the levels afterwards basically revolve around using QTE's, and a lot of escape sequences. The thing about those escape sequences though - you can pretty much fail them instantly if you are not doing exactly what the game wants you to do. It's kind of like those escape sequences from COD, except that there are no "words of wisdom" at the end.\n\nWhen choosing the white pawn, the game actually introduces a really interesting mechanic. Basically, your voice is taken away from you, so instead, you will have to type to answer. Unfortunately, it's only used in two levels, one of which is basically an introduction to the mechanic.\n\nOverall, even despite all those drawbacks, i recommend the game. The story is simply that entertaining.\n\nI actually bet that if it wasn't i would probably uninstall the game after 5 mins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","1"

The game is also very short, I completed a playthrough of all content in 2.3 hours and I'm glad the developer decided not to charge for this game very largely due to that reason.\n\nWhile the voice acting is mediocre at best and the writing is pretty bad, the scenery and overall level design is actually pretty impressive. The puzzles are generally terrible and make no sense at all especially as some of them come with on-screen instructions that are blatant lies; you're told to "press spacebar" when really it wants you to hold it down and immediately after you're told to "press e" when really it wants you to mash it. However, in one of the two paths of the game - black and white - you're required to do a lot of backtracking as part of a larger puzzle, but not in a bad way. This puzzle is surprisingly well designed and apart from an amnesia-like 'hide and wait for the music to stop' moment it is the only legitimately good puzzle of the game.\n\nThe ending of the game isn't really satisfying but it's a fairly comedic one and it definitely is better than many AAA releases' 'kill villain get lady' endings, but then again they're starting to become infamous for being horrible serving only the purpose to taunt you into buying the sequel.\nThe biggest complaint I have about the game albeit being a very subjective one is the overabundance of immersion breaking memes and weeaboo ♥♥♥♥ery, but I at least want to thank the developer for keeping them out of the gameplay and dialogue, I can respect that. The achievements are very xDDD-worthy meme garbage from name to image that often disturb you as they pop up just as you're about to start being actually immersed. Despite all my negativity it was a fairly enjoyable experience, but only because it didn't cost a cent; I would never play let alone recommend this game if I had to pay for it and had the game been much longer I would have dropped it almost certainly, free or not.\nIf the game is an experiment in an aspiring game designer's career they're off to a good one, I would love to try out a more fleshed out experience by this same developer granted they get better voice acting and decent writing, preferably done by someone else entirely.\n\n6/10\nI can't not recommend this game for its modest price of nothing at all. It's something different from generic games and an experience to play and soon after forget.","August 16, 2014","true","2.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I really don't know what add to this.\nI guess they tried to make a game like "Stanley Parable" or "Gone Home": you walk around, solving "puzzles" and understanding more and more the plot. What's the problem here? The plot.\nI couldn't understand a thing, maybe I got 10% of all this. I have no idea of what they planned to make us think, but.. look, I seriously have nothing to work with here.\n\nYou are some guy who goes to a party, and after something happens (apparently they're not good enough to create a party scene) you find yourself in a bedroom. You wake up, and some weird black fog, maybe the same one from Lost, makes you faint again. After a while you meet this not-so-friendly voice from a radio, that will escort you through the game.\n\nAlready after 5 minutes into the game, I saw some major problems: the voice acting was one. I can clearly hear that they were trying pretty hard to make it look like a normal converstation. I admit it, sometimes it kinda worked, but for most of it, it was.. odd. Expecially 'cause the guy from the radio haves this stereotypical black man voice, even tho' probably the voice actor wasn't even a black man (I can't prove it).\nAnother problem were the puzzles: apparently this game haves some kind of puzzles. What's the problem with them? You don't even know where to start. Sometimes they don't even give you a clue, sometimes they throw you random information that you can't use. I had to look up through a walkthrough bunch of time to understand what was goin on.\n\nAfter a very little while, you have to choose what pawn to pick from a chessboard: white or black. From what you choose, you'll get a totally different ending, but also a different "game".\n\nThe white pawn was.. I dunno. Enjoyable, I guess?\nIt was weird, still kinda bad, and had no explanation, but for some weird reason, I enjoyed it. Maybe because the gameplay was still the same one from the intro, easy and weird at the same time. I found myself doing the most weird things during this gameplay. I won't spoil them, but man, that was odd. But you know what? I felt like I was watching one of those B movies. You know the one, the movie that is so terribly written, with horrible acting and impractical montage. The one that you know it's terrible, but you have to finish it, because you're actually enjoying it.\nSame goes for the final of this: weird, totally not self-explaining and almost made no sense. I was kinda happy with it.\n\nThen I played the black pawn ending.\nBy god, why did I had to. I actually didn't even finished it because ITS ♥♥♥♥ING IMPOSSIBLE. I'm not joking around, the game suddently turns from goofy random puzzles to survival "horror". Is like Amnesia, but bad. Really, really bad. And impossible. Expecially 'cause there is a straight line to follow, but guess what, there is NOTHING THAT EXPLAINS YOU WHERE TO GO. And if you don't follow the line? Game over man, start from last checkpoint, that maybe is really far away from where you was. I couldn't finish that ending cause even the playthought was so clueless that didn't gave me any sign of what the hell to do next. I gave up.\n\nThe graphic is pretty good, even thought some texture looks really horrible. Well, it is Unity. And the soundtrack is almost absent, probably some songs got from youtube users.\n\n\nSo, what do we get in the end? A free game on Steam that makes no sense, it's badly written and gives no lession whatsoever. But I enjoyed my time with it.\n\nFinal Score: a Pot/10\n\nTL;DR\n\nIs it bad? Kinda.\nShould I play this? Yes. But just don't pick the black pawn.\n\nPS: ACHIEVEMENT MEMAS LOOOOL :-) please crawl back into your hole.","August 3, 2014","true","1.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

You don't know what your doing and the intructions given are pretty vague. Sadly I was not able to poke around at the objects like I had hoped. If you're someone who likes rummaging and touching objects like in Fallout or Skyrim this game is not for you.\n\nThe story is lackluster at best.

In fact, there are AT LEAST 2 easily discoverable bugs to skip segments of this short game (outsmarting the game developers, what a surprise)...\n\nThe achievements glitched out and I couldn\'t get any other than the achievement that calls me a pervert (thanks for that); I\'m not willing to play through this game within the next few years until I get extremely, extremely drunk. Like, next-level drunk. We\'re talking suicidal-drunk here, because you have to have a deathwish or perhaps a wish to throw time you have relentlessly in a garbage disposal clogged with those knives you regurgitated from earlier.\n\nJust beyond terrible. The beginning hooks you, and makes you think the story is going to go somewhere. It won\'t. It will never. Go buy the Stanley Parable while it\'s on sale so you can finally get a breath of fresh air.\n\nI passionately hate this game, and if you don\'t too, you might as well be ordained a saint for giving this game a good review. Seriously, you\'re one of the most kind-hearted, charitable, and honest people alive to see the goodness in this game. You\'re beyond a saint. You will be the next Mother Theresa if you just stopped playing video games. Go, make a positive difference in the world, and don\'t waste ANY more time on this whatsoever. You don\'t deserve such pain.\n\nIf you can deal with the gameplay mechanics, graphics, and concept/plotline behind this game, I somehow recommend that \"Second Life\" would be a great game for you. At least it has better voice acting.\n\nPS: That reference to the Portal series in the beginning of the game is simply advising that you just go play Portal instead. Even the main character is dreaming he can play Portal instead of being stuck in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nPSS: Before you remove my game review, please fix the ♥♥♥♥ing achievements in this game. I am NOT willing to play this thing again anytime soon, give me my ♥♥♥♥ing achievements you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nTL;DR: 1/10, Dr. Kevorkian is the lead game developer of this game, and wants you to die while playing it (and that\'s why it\'s free).","June 1","false","2.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","2"

Second, I am tempted to give the game a Recommended with Caution rating for absurdly horrible profanity, but the game itself is fun enough to warrant a good rating.\n\nOnly If is a game that is guaranteed to confuse you. It’s sort of like watching what a druggie experiences through their eyes; there are realistic moments, but they are the exception rather than the rule.\n\nA brief preview: you control a man named Anthony who is invited by Sam, a girl he likes, to a party. You walk through the doors into the party house and the next thing you know, you wake up in an unfamiliar bedroom. Sam is nowhere to be found. You open the bedroom door to explore the house and are startled to see…(end of spoiler-free content).\n\nI enjoyed this game tremendously…after I stopped raging at how many times I died. Only If is a puzzle game; there are very difficult sections. Sometimes the furniture, doors, landscape, or even walls change if you look away from them and then back. There are two story paths (White and Black) depending on which decision you make at one point. I recommend starting with the Black path as it leads directly into the White path (if you survive, of course).\n\nLanguage in this game is enough to give it an M rating. Don’t go into this game expecting your virgin ears to survive. It’s mostly random, pointless profanity, but it is humorous at times.\n\nThere is literally no money barrier preventing you from picking this game up immediately. Unless you can’t stand cursing, PLAY THIS GAME! You’ll laugh, yell and be totally confused, but it’s worth it!\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\n- Recommended\nHighly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential\n\nP.S. - When you get stuck enough to rage-quit, use a walkthrough.

It should have been something amazing, but utter failed to be anything close to that.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game simply makes no sense.  It's claimed to be a "surreal" puzzle game; but as so often happens, "surreal" means little more than "random stuff stuck together".  A truly surreal atmosphere should have an internal logic that can be discovered and deciphered.  Some type of coherent theme underlying the seeming chaos.  As others have noted, there is no logic, surreal or otherwise, to this game.  No method to the madness.  Not to the story, what little there is; and certainly not to the mechanics.\n\nThe gameplay starts out as a bog-standard point-and-click adventure - pick things up in one location, then put them down in another - but then drops in a text-entry mechanic without the slightest hint that it even exists, let alone how to use it or what the game is expecting.  Eventually I discovered it with the aid of a walkthrough for the first instance, and managed to figure out out well enough when I encountered it again.  And when I am finally starting to enjoy it, it discards that mechanic and throws in a jumping puzzle.  Wait what?  Even more irritatingly, it then transformed into a platformer; at which point I simply gave up.  (The fact that I loathe platformers did not help one bit).\n\nAnd what was that "millenial" reference about?  And the Inception reference?  Why was that even in there?  And the rest of the dialog, the commentary on self-sacrifice?  What is that about?  It's like the developer is trying to shore up a poorly written game by using pop culture references and pretentious dialog to make it sounds more "deep" and "relevant" than it ever manages to be.\n\nThe game is pertty, I'll give it that.  The voice acting, on the other hand, was irritating.  The main character was wooden at best, but at least I could hear him.  The other character voices are actually quite decently done; but faded in and out badly, and were too easy to lose track of.\n\nIt feels like the developer had a good idea for a game; then didn't quite know what to do with it.  There's a gem of originality here; buried under the pile of same-old-same-old game mechanics and tropes.  I do hope that the gem will eventually shine through in a new game, because it's not terribly visible here.","October 5, 2014","false","0.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","21","37","0","0"

Well I for one think the graphics are quite pretty, actually. The park was especially very relaxing and pleasing to the eye. The controls are quite nice. The voice acting is not bad, though not very fond of how often they throw in swear words unnecssarily. Some of the riddles are good, but I would be lying if I didn't say some were horrid.\n\nMore often than not, I solved riddles by walking around aimlessly, clicking on everything I come by until I get some sort of result. The part where you're able to get shot was frustrating as I couldn't understand what the man on the radio was asking me to do at first (don't like the way he did the accent, honestly), and because he gave me such a tiny amount of time to do it. I also was not completely aware I had to answer the questions I was asked when I was in the park, leaving me wandering around like an idiot for a long time. One of the parts I hated the most would be the place with floating pillars, where you had to do some platforming (and shoot some stuff). It was annoying trying to make all the jumps and figuring out where to go, and the gun's aim isn't very good. But all in all, the most upsetting/disappointing part for me was the ending. It just... didn't make up for everything else. If it had a much better ending, I most probably would've recommended the game. The ending is quite funny, yes, but it is definitely not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be. Quite a flop for me.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a game to waste time or something not so serious to play, I guess this is the game for you. Like I said, even for a short game, I enjoyed this game a bit, but for more than half the time I did not. Good thing it was free, or I would be quite furious.","September 4, 2015","false","1.9"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

However, while the latter is a more tame and humorous game, this game is no joke. It's a very gritty and dark journey, but can be extremely beautiful and insightful when it chooses to be. It's a bit more complicated than its "walking simulator" genre would imply, and it can be quite confusing at times, whether in its design or in the questions it raises. Perhaps the most interesting thing about it is the choice between the black pawn and the white pawn.While the path of the black pawn feels much more real and can be frightening at times in its reality, none of it is actually real. At the same time, while the path of the white pawn is much lighter and more fantastical, it is more or less the true story.It's the odd balance between what is real and what is merely perceived as real that makes this game so appealing. I've seen many people put off by the beginning of the game, but you really should give the whole thing a chance, as it is the furthest thing from disappointing. Additionally, the game is free to download, so there's absolutely no downside to owning and playing it. In the end, would I recommend this game?

Another reviewer mentioned that this game had some influences from The Stanley Parable, and I think that's the closest experience that players can find to this game. The difference for Only If is that the puzzles, such as they are, are a bit more rudimentary, or unpolished. Many solutions are hidden from the player until they explore their environment fully (sometimes even using disappearing objects or disappearing walls to do the job)\n\nOne scene in particular has the player pressing E repeatedly to keep from blacking out or falling into "darkness". But the player isn't given any instructions other than that. So I spent at least 10 tries of trying to explore my environment (as the game encouraged me to do all along) and ending up running head first into a blackout. Eventually I saw that spamming the button and running straight through one particular part seemed to be the only way to succeed at the scene. I'm glad I stuck with the game, because it has some stylish scenes and setpieces, but the frustration was close to souring the whole thing for me.\n\nStory wise, the game tries for a very young, hip aesthetic, with snarky comments from the game's antagonist intended to make the player laugh as they're given ambiguous or frustrating instructions. After a couple of full playthroughs, I was honestly exhausted from all the wisecracks and reloads that the game threw at me, and glad it was finally over. But I enjoyed the genuine surprises the game threw at me as well, so I found it was worth playing, especially since I didn't have to pay for it.","January 30, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'll admit to having had to use a walkthrough at one point because I missed seeing a sign saying "You have to type IRL". I had a pretty negative experience the first time I played this game, but the second time I popped it in and (when I got my first acheivement) I realized - the game was trolling me.\n\nThis game has great ♥♥♥♥ing voice acting, and constantly has you asking "What?" "But why?" and "What in the fuch am I playing?". I have never played a troll game that is so good - there is a lot of lvoe put into the game, and after the first time you complete it you get a lot more of a sense for the game's logic (there's also an explanation from the game devs availible on steam, which is handy for some of the more wtf moments).\n\n6.5/10, would recommend. If only for the game devs obviously being very dank and/or rare, it's worth the price (of nothing, which is a good selling point) and it's worth a couple hours.\nJust remember to take deep breathes and not be ashamed to use community guides (and not to tab out, because then the game breaks itself so that you can't get acheivements).","June 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It more often than not leaves you wondering what you are supposed to be doing instead of making you wonder how you are supposed to do it. Instead of having creative puzzles, it either has Vinnie say something vague or has vague text pop up on the screen. You then take this information and try to figure out what you are supposed to do. Collect something? Type something? Go somewhere? Who knows? Oh, times up, start over. Every time you start over it gives you a hint of what to do or just blatantly says what you need to do. Then there's the lame jumping  sections.\n\nThis game either gives you a puzzle that you have to solve by brute force or it gives you a puzzle then immediately tells you the answer. All that's left for you do to is run around aimlessly or figure out what specific thing it wants you to do to give it the answer it already provided you. The voices are annoying.

Its a beautiful room with a few remnants of the party left over. There's an out of place poster on the wall of an Anime girl with pink looking out for you, reaching out to you. That's only the first of many strange things you'll go through.\n\nFrom there, you open the door beside the poster and enter a dark room with a sparkling crystal blue sphere that leads you through a maze, lighting up black walls with a  blue hue. At the end of the brief maze, there's what looks like a doorway. You ram the door over and over again until the door falls off the hinges and you tumble through to the next room. When you stand up, you realize its not a door, but someone had used an expensive bassinet to keep you in and you have just toppled it.\n\nThere you are, standing in a gorgeous office with fancy chairs, a sofa, wood trim, plants and several cherry wood shelves. Outside the window there's nothing but clouds and a blue sky. There's no ground. Does this mean you're dreaming or does it mean that you're in some sort of purgatory.\n\nThat's when you hear a voice yelling at you, "Get outta my house before I call the cops!" You're disoriented and have no idea what's going on. The voice commands you to look into a mirror, but there's no mirror. After another minute there's a mirror miraculously on an unseen wall that was just vacant.\n\nThe voice orders you to look at a clock, because he tells you that you have just one minute to find a key and get out of the room. The clock has no hands on its face and its only a distraction from the real matter at hand. Finding the key. You look around the room, there's no key. Soon you start hearing what sounds like a plane in the distance, the sound of the plane keeps getting louder and louder. You begin to realize even if you find the key, there's no door to use it on!\n\nThe plane sounds almost on top of the room. Thick black smoke begins to fill the room. Then when you've given up all hope, you find the key hidden where you'd last think to look for it. Now you need to find the door that doesn't exist, but now that you've found the key, the door has appeared. Before the black smoke engulfs you, you run to the door, and leave the room into yet another amazing room inside what's sure to be a mansion.\n\nThere is a chessboard on a coffee table and a small radio on a couch. The voice comes over the radio again, telling you to make a choice. Select a pawn, the white pawn will sacrifice yourself and the white pawn will sacrifice Samantha Graves. This lunatic has forced you to chose. One will lead you down one path, the other down another.\n\nThe choice is up to you, but lets say you pick the black pawn and complete the fiendish puzzle. There doesn't seem to be any time limit until you've finished. That's when you're rewarded with a key that the voice crassly tells you is the size of your genitalia. Smoke begins to fill the room and you hustle to the door, but that's when you're hit from behind and fall to the floor.\n\nWhen you wake up, you're in a crate or a casket. You can hear two voices talking outside  as they drag you along to your doom. They're going to drown you in a lake, dynamite something to bury you under rocks. The game is over now, they're just going to kill you. As the casket begins to fill with water, you see rocks smash through, allowing for your escape into a beautiful woodland in the autumn season. The trees are tall, red and orange. Almost beautiful, if most of them weren't on fire from the dynamite they have used to destroy a windmill.\n\nYou belly crawl your way to safety through burning grass and stand up once the coast is clear. There is no safety, that's when the smoke starts to fill even the outdoor area. You're constantly forced to struggle for any air to breathe before the smoke overtakes you over and over again.\n\nThat's where I'll end this story. Only If is a first person experience that I can best describe as a puzzle game or a scavenger hunt. Its less of a scavenger hunt trying to find things than its a scavenger hunt on what to do. The lunatic commands you when you're in the house, its just a struggle to know exactly what he wants from you. Like "give me something sweet!" So you scour the room looking for candy or even a bottle of honey maybe. There's something on the wall that gives you a clue, type as you would IRL. Well that's because you're supposed to type the word honey.\n\nOnly If is full of things like that and it makes the experience pretty painful and excessively long. Then during the forest fire, you need to go through the black smoke all while rapidly tapping the E button. Over and over again. its easy to die from the smoke, but every failure will respawn you at the start of each section. The only punishment is time wasted over and over again, trying to figure out what to do, until you're lucky enough to do it. I feel like I would have enjoyed the experience more if it wasn't as cryptic.\n\nIt also feels poorly programmed. Since it uses the Unity engine you can setup the key and game pad bindings before you play, but alas, they don't actually do anything to change the controls. So you're stuck with WSAD for movement. You have a laughably small jump (until the end), a run, crouch and use buttons.\n\nThere are of course more traditional features that a game would have. You will get a gun to shoot some emerald pots and have to jump around on a few platforms before you reach the finish.\n\nIt looks beautiful and there's some good lighting, even if the textures don't hold up to close scrutiny. There's a lot of banter between your character and the antagonist along with Samantha Graves. Everyone's character is believable and admirably portrayed, but the real problem is either the sound quality or microphone quality. Its just bad. Sometimes its inaudible, even standing next to the radio, other times its extremely loud and will shatter eardrums when the lunatic starts yelling at you.\n\nThe antagonist knows he can do anything. Make keys appear out of thin air and it plays into the experience a bit, "Here let me blow your mind Anthony! Truckin' Boom!" Then *poof* a key magically appears on the couch. Only If starts getting into the fact that anything can happen, such as starting to slowly tilt a room while black smoke tries to swallow you. Your character handles everything pretty believably and that's disbelieving a lot of what's happening. Especially when compared to the voice that's trying to antagonize him.\n\nThe villain's personality is probably the most unedited character I've ever heard in video game history if not all media. You'll never see him or any of the characters, including yourself, even when you're forced to look into a mirror, you're just not there.\n\nThere were a few errors and glitches here and there, like walking through objects and even falling through a wall out of the house and plummeting forever. You can't save the game so much as you get a one word password, to return where you were. Its an interesting system.\n\nIn conclusion, I just wish that I found more fun or entertainment from Only If. It radically strays from the formula, and some might like how far out of the box you need to think, but I just wanted something more traditional. All the quick deaths felt cheap and it doesn't get cheaper than a free experience.","March 16, 2015","false","2.3"," 52 of 100 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","52","100","10","2"

I was pretty confused when I saw some screenshots of "Only If" in the store page, because it was single player, wasn't riddled with micro-transactions and was a puzzle game. Something I'd not expect from a free to play game.\nThen, a second thought occurred into me: it must be some sort of small project, an experimental one, probably by a "one man team" where they did all the coding, texturing, etc.\nThankfully, I was wrong. I was expecting somewhat outdated graphics, stretched textures, terrible movement, possibly an open world "Get X before Y catches you" sort of formula, average or no music/ambience at all but instead I was presented with gorgeous soundtrack, truly beautiful graphics, a solid storyline which most games lack and great movement (the crouching is a bit odd, but it must be that I'm not used to it).\nI played about 75 minutes (probably because I rushed the thing or found just one ending, if there are more) and only found possibly one bug/glitch of sorts which is the lack of collision on the trees, but I guess it is a signature "feature" of the Unity Engine. I truly enjoyed playing this game and some of the tricks the game presented (not saying any as I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free) made me shout "Why didn't I think of that in the first place?!" or "How in the seven hells can I be this dumb?!". One thing that I think is missed here is probably subtitles, it might be nitpicking or even a personal preference, but sometimes the voices of the characters are shadowed by other sounds, music or even the fact that you might be too far away to hear them clearly. As a result, I lost some of the speech and sometimes wandered randomly not knowing what to do.\nMoreover, I was astounded that this game was free, I wouldn't expect this amount of work for a game distributed free. Great voice acting, great characters (althought an intro of sorts would be nice; but I may have missed it completely) mainly Vinny, which is not the usual neutral-voiced narrator. Instead, he has his wit which I do adore.\nIn conclusion, it is a great game and its well worth the 75 minutes I've spent playing and the 1,34 gigs it occupies in my hard-disk. I have to apologize if this review is kind of messy because I haven't written a review that wasn't longer than five words.

The game creators are very purposeful when they make these puzzles. There weren't any, "Oh, come ON! That's ridiculous. I could never have gotten that," moments. There aren't any times when you absolutely need hints. You just have to keep with it.\n\nThe controls change a bit--it throws brand new puzzles in and give you very brief explanations through things like paintings on the walls.

Like subtitles. Or having a textbox display the text you typed in the continue screen. Simple things like that.\n\nThat said, this game is extremely confusing. You're looking at 50 shades of 'how did I die' and stuff like that. I never got past the windmill. It just took way too long to load from the beginning of that level and having to get thru all those black blobs or whatever they were supposed to be and at the same time being shell shocked as well and can literally drop dead at any second there. However, with random dumb luck, I mananged to 'continue' at the part with the slot machine, no idea how I got there, just typed something random in the continue screen. And from there I managed to beat the game.\n\nI prolly missed a good chunk of this game, no idea how large, but from what I seen, I personally think it's better from where the slot machine part was. You got really abstract puzzles and stuff, and not having to deal with long cutscenes due to dying for unknown reasons every 5 minutes. And hopefully have subtitles, too.

Yes, moreso than damn near any other game I have on steam. Why? Well, for one, it's free, so if you hate it you're out nothing but some bandwidth to download the game and a few minutes of your time. If, like myself, you love it, congrats, you're still out nothing.\n\nWhy do I love this game so much? Great question. The bizarrely titled "Only If" is one of the few, very few videogames I've ever played to truely get an actual, thought provoking reaction out of me. The game made me think. Not through the use of being boring, plodding, pretentious like so many other walking simulators out there try and fail to do. No, this game got a reaction out of me in much the same way that a book like Blood Meridian or something along those lines gets a reaction out of you: it takes the sledgehammer to the face approach of getting your attention. It flat out up and screams at you, look, this is what you should think about. Think about it, okay? And you know what? For me, at least, it worked.\n\nTake the same kind of vibe Guy Ritchie's film Revolver has going, an opening that reminded me a bit of the game Manhunt in its "hide or you will be gunned down like a rabid dog" vibe.  Take a few of the better-done pop-culture references I've ever seen in a videogame, some actually really quite good voice acting from all parties involved, and a seriously good score that flip flops between funky and beautiful, and you've kinda sorta not really got a game like Only If. I've never really seen much like it.\n\nIt has its glitches, yes, though it ran flawlessly on my toaster of a computer. Subtitles would be nice, and the ending slams you in the face with its silliness. But this bad boy's about the journey, not the destination. And what a journey it is.\n\nConsult the guide if you decide to play this and get stuck. There's a very well written one on steam that clears up a few of the murkier objectives in the game. Much easier than ragequitting and the game's final levels really are stunning.\n\nIf you are, as many of the so-called professional gaming journalists are, offended easily, do not play this game, however. It has very coarse language in it, exactly like the store page flat out warns you about before you download it.\n\nIf you have not reached the level of maturity to be able to handle a pair of fictional characters using foul language and a slur or two in a work of fiction that is in no way, shape, or form inspired by real events... You should steer clear of this game. If the british slang term for a cigarette being used as an insult by a fictional teenage frat boy to describe a man that's tried to kill him on several occasions strikes you as something your delicate ears cannot bear hearing... Do not play this game.\n\nHowever. If you think you can handle it, and want something so, so different... Buy the ticket, take the ride. Difference being that this bad boy's ticket's free, and it's hard to beat a ride this good for a ticket that cheap.\n\nOh, and pick the black pawn first.","October 6, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's as if the developers went on a wild acid trip and took us along for the ride. Once the journey begins, you MUST see it through to completion! There are two major path choices that you are introduced to very early on in the game..... without giving too much away, I highly suggest starting with the "bad" path choice, because you will get to experience the game as it was intended, and it works its way into the "good" path eventually, so taking the "wrong" path in this case is the "right" choice, as it takes you through the full game.\n\nThe amount of content here for a free game is mind blowing, THIS is how indie games SHOULD be, it's unique, it's cerebral, it somehow manages to feel a little rough 'n' gritty and yet polished at the same time....... This game really does feel as much like art as it does a game.\n\nI highly recommend you give this game a try if you're into challenging interactive puzzles and trippy distortions of reality......

Otherwise I can't recommend it.\n\nThe dialogue and story is what did this game in for me. Most of it is juvenile, profanity laden yelling and cryptic messages related to the game's puzzles. There are a few points where its obscurity gives the illusion of having depth. The ending, however, reveals a rotten core that could at best be called dark comedy and at worst empty, insulting and pointlessly obscene. Now, I can stomach indecent language and references (Game of Thrones comes to mind) so don't get the idea that I'm writing this negative review because the game offended me.\n\nCompounding the problems the dialogue has are some terrible audio levels that had me constantly adjusting my volume and mediocre voice acting. There were several points where I had trouble understanding what was being said due to the music drowning out the voices or it simply wasn't spoken clearly by the actor. This is particularly bothersome when what's being spoken is important for figuring out a puzzle.\n\nThe puzzles were hit and miss. I did enjoy a few of them. Others were trial and error based or random enough to make solving them feel more like chance than anything clever that I did.\n\nI was impressed with the visuals for a free game. It lacks depth in detail but still manages to be mostly pleasing to the eye.

I'll edit this review when I get to the end, but for now I have to comment on this title's bizarre gameplay.\nOther negative reviewers have basically taken the words out of my mouth... It's certainly not an intuitive game, it's difficult to manuever in and more times than not, it is frustrating instead of enjoyable. Trust me, I really tried to like this game. I would tell myself that the fun was in the exploration, and to an extent, it is. This game is gorgeous. If you accepted the notion that you weren't going to have much success in completing the tasks, you could enjoy it. But one can only do that for so long and for all this game's faults, it's very suspenseful, and you'll be frustrated by your lack of progression.\nI've played a number of games where the game leaves very cryptic clues and you have to figure out what to do next. If you don't like these games, you'll absolutely hate this one, because it's even more cryptic than most. The clues disappear (such as in the room with the bowl you drink from, the paintings turn into verbal clues, but only for a few seconds) or sometimes leave you searching for a long time, or perhaps if you don't follow the directions exactly so, you'll misstep and lose your direction entirely. I barely had the patience for it, and I was interested in the storyline! If the storyline seems too pretentious or you just don't care for it, you won't enjoy this game.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics\n-Suspenseful/compelling story\n-Sometimes makes you think (a little)\n\nCons:\n-Jittery camera\n-Cryptic clues\n-Excessive/nonsensical swearing (And I love to ♥♥♥♥ing swear!)\n-Weird audio effects (hint: don't be too far from the radio or you won't be able to hear it anymore)\n-Achievements don't work\n\nBasically, if you like pretty graphics or maybe want to think a little out of the box, this game might be good for you. But there are other games that can accomplish this without being so broken. Instead, how about watching a decent walkthrough?","July 24, 2015","false","8.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

How immersive, scary, surreal and just basically awesome they were?\n\nWell imagine If Only there were an entire game like that?\nOnly If is it. It is everything that I expected it to be, and everything I didn't expect it to be.\nIt was nothing like the negative comments I had read about it previously, and nothing like the positive comments I had read about it either - It was truly "mind = blown" material.\n\nGiven, the controls are tricky, some of the puzzles were just plain silly, but I felt I could work out everything myself without looking for hints immediately and proceeded to run through the game without any outside assistance. Then I came back for more, and more, exploring the achievements. What other things did this story have in store for me? What at first felt like I had no choice at all, started to slowly reveal it's secrets to me.\n\nThe storyline was captivating, the twists were insane and the puzzles and challenges struck the right balance between not-too-easy-yet-not-too-difficult, and best of all, it was actually hilarious! Couldn't stop laughing, couldn't stop playing...\n\nTo top it all off, the price tag... $0.\n\nThe only major complaint I have with this - I wouldn't even call it a game, I would outright class it as an experience - is that given the fact that it is free, Steam does not allow me to save it in my library and flag it in my favourites as a consequence, and I can't afford the hard drive space to leave it lying around, and don't want to forget about it! In fact, that is not the game's fault really although had they charged $2 or even $5 I would have thought it a bargain and it would have fixed this problem. Even if they had charged $1. In fact, this is one of the main reasons behind writing this review: so I don't forget about this gem!\n\nI can't wait for more games like this, more by this software house and definitely, definitely can't wait to do a playthrough again on a proper computer with the Oculus Rift DK2!\n\nGoes down as one of my all-time favourites.","August 18, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Short and sweet, I really enjoyed it - Only If is a great example of how "free" games should be; a fantastic staple of a fun, exciting journey you "experience" as much as you "play".\n\nIf you like exploration, narrative-driven gameplay with a well-written story, and varying/surprising special effects, you should really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very, very good - the amount of detail in every scene is fantastic; I was pleasantly surprised by the great graphics. The sounds, few music pieces, and ambient noises are appropriate for setting the atmosphere. The execution and design of the levels is extremely well-done - the game is split into two unique paths. The back-and-forth dialogue between the characters is well-scripted and well-executed, and many scenes are full of strong emotion - extremely solid and impressive voice-acting.\n\nThe controls are simple and fun to figure out. There is no real tutorial, however, you are given button prompts from time to time. There is really no learning curve, since the game is more of an experience rather than a true challenge. That being said, there are certain parts that may require trial-and-error (and maybe a few retries).\n\nComparing the two paths - and without spoiling the fun, awesome parts of the game - one is quite obviously more well-developed and full-bodied than the other. If you want to short, sweet, and single playthrough for the game, pick the white pawn path. This one is much better (and a lot more fun) than the other option.\n\nLoading requires you to type in the keyword for each level, as there is no saving option.\n\nFor achievement hunters, this game has 10 very easy achievements. It should be noted that you may have to "verify game cache" if you exit the game and reload, as there seems to be a slight problem in updating the game. If you are not getting achievements (and you know should have), try verifying, exiting, and restarting. It should work now (although you may have do this a few times - whenever you exit the game and load it up again).\n\nOverall, the game is a really fun experience, good for all types of gamers.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 27, 2014","true","2.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

This can cause you to get stuck for a really long time if you don't want to look up walktroughs. But it's also one of the game's charms. A really mysterious and trippy experience where you haven't got a single clue what you're doing. It's even pretty spooky at times.\n\nIt's a free game. So I'd say it's worth trying.

I especially enjoyed watching my gf at the time play through and ask me all these different questions and where to go. I figured it out on my own so it was her turn. Only, she picked an opposite choice leading the game in a whole different direction which made me have to take over for her because she was getting frustrated and I didn't know what to do either.\n\nThe reason I find this fun is because that little segway of choice kind of builds a relation between you and your character. You're now afraid and alone while this mad man who is still faceless through out the WHOLE game is after you and you really don't know why until the very end. But it all leads back into the normal path anyways so that way you can actually continue through the game as if you never did that so in essence that little distraction adds to the game rather than just frustrates and makes you wanna drop it at that point.\n\nThe imagination that went into this was rather fast and the pacing was nice as well but I do have some questions as to really what the hell was going on. I'm sure there is some deeper meaning or maybe even just because hey it looks pretty awesome but a little clarity would be nice.\n\nOverall, its free and I enjoyed it.

While the game mechanics themselves are kind of slightly terrible, the dialogue, environments, dialogue, puzzles, dialogue, ambiance, and dialogue were all very fun and of a good enough quality that I didn't have a dull moment through the whole thing.\n\nThe one complaint I do have is that one of the areas in the Black Pawn Scenario is ruined by the vision blur that happens during blackout resist quick time events. Having to point your character in a certain direction with the mouse, run from some darkness, and simultaneously mash the E button while your entire screen is reduced into an incomprehensible blur is... I don't want to be mean to a free game but that amount of actions expected of the player, all at the same time, is bull pucky.\n\nIt's like... you just try to do that while your reading this. Hold down W+Shift and mash the E button with one hand while also trying to point at an icon on your desktop with your mouse while closing your eyes. Do you see how difficult that is? You're not even playing a game and it's !@#$ing insane! Nothing wrong here, great work team. See you next week when we all travel back in time and suggest to Nintendo that Skyward Sword should use motion controls for aiming Link's sword. Maybe we could make a detour and tell Rare circa 1996 that having Oddjob be shorter than all the other characters is a perfectly okay thing to do. TENOUTTATEN!\n\n... ...\n\nIf you couldn't tell, I didn't like that part.\n\nEverything else was spectacular though. !@#$ing impeccable.\n\n\n\nDear Developer's of Only If\n\nIf you update this game please do the following for the described sequence.\n\n1. Set resisting blacking out to instead be mashing the mouse buttons\n2. Reprogram the blackout visuals to only start darkening if the player fails to resist blacking out. A simple vignette would have the same overall effect.","July 29, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Albeit a little short, close to everything about it was decent quality and extremely creative and aesthetically pleasing. The weird little story was pretty interesting, the ability to choose was a nice little addition, the story that i played included many thoughtful and clever challenges that were accompanied by good voice acting through a comical and abstract storyline. The only few things i saw wrong with it were 1. A little short, 2. The ending i got was a bit.. eh. 3. The gun could've fit the story a little more fluidly. But hey, it was free and only took about an hour and a half for one ending, regardless of how good it was, it is definetly worth trying. And i think it's a very cool little game with good music, clever puzzles and interactions, and interesting theme.","August 17, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You try to solve puzzles, riddles, and find things in the environment to get you to the next "level", and ocasionally run away and hide from danger. It would be interesting, if it worked.\n\n\nHere are some complaints:\n\nI checked the controls before playing (it got that Unity configuration screen on launch), but the game kept throwing new ones at me as I played.\n\nVoices are often too low and mumbly; but if I turn the volume up to be able to hear them, there some sounds that are too loud, and I still can't make what is being said some times.\n\nIt is glitchy, but not in the artsy sense; I kept getting stuck in some places, it was too easilly to accidentally get outside some the areas that the game expected me to remain inside and hard to find my way back to where the scritpted events would get trigger to move the game onwards; in some places there was not enough feedback on whether I was doing the right thing and but the game was simply too hard to get right or if I was actually stumbling on a glitch of the game (but after trying many different alternatives, in at least one case I realized it was not my fault; later I stopped playing after reaching a point where I don't know if I'm wasting my time bashing my head against a glitch or if I've just not figured out how to make the puzzle work yet).\n\n\nOcasional fast repetitive key-pressing; I almost couldn't get past certain spots because it required the same keys to be pressed over and over again extremely fast.\n\n\nPassword based "saving"; you need to memorize (and in some cases guess first) the level name you wanna come back to if you don't wanna start from the very beginning. Dying while playing just brings you back to an earlier point most of the time; but you ocasionally have to endure an first-person cutscene everytime at certain points.\n\n\nIf you don't mind all these issues, then yes, I recommend this game.","September 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Albeit a little short, close to everything about it was decent quality and extremely creative and aesthetically pleasing. The weird little story was pretty interesting, the ability to choose was a nice little addition, the story that i played included many thoughtful and clever challenges that were accompanied by good voice acting through a comical and abstract storyline. The only few things i saw wrong with it were 1. A little short, 2. The ending i got was a bit.. eh. 3. The gun could've fit the story a little more fluidly. But hey, it was free and only took about an hour and a half for one ending, regardless of how good it was, it is definetly worth trying. And i think it's a very cool little game with good music, clever puzzles and interactions, and interesting theme.","August 17, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole game is like a big mindf*ck, so if you are into that, I really recommend playing this game. It's kinda trippy and it has a lot of weird puzzles in it. To complete these levels (puzzles) you need to 'think out of the box'. Sometimes this will make the game a little too hard. I had to youtube 2 levels to figure out what to do... With all the puzzling, i completed the whole game (2 storylines) in 4 hours. The graphics aren't that great and the game gives often no information what to do. But, it is a free game! And I enjoyed playing it. Some tips for people who want to play this game: Look everywhere, dont trust on logic, use your keyboard more than only controlling your character (little spoiler, sorry), and dont worry about failing too many times in some levels, cause you will fail a lot.","September 12, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Crock of ♥♥♥♥.  There's nothing terribly special about Only If, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  It's just not what people are going to or have made it out to be.\n\nThat being said, what the game effectively does is challenge your conceptions on how it's going to play out.  It is comparable in that fashion to the Stanley Parable (sans Adventure Line) such that solutions to the puzzles presented to you require some "outside the box" thinking.  Such as it is, being able to meet the challenge without being told what to do or looking it up will provide a nice diversion anyone wishing to try this game out.\n\nIt is, by its very nature, disjointed in its telling, but masterful in its execution.  It does not attempt to teach you its tricks or hold your hand; it merely presents you with an opportunity to find what you need and then act upon it, be it a sign, a note, or some subtle twist of what lies before you to isolate the metaphorical "Continue" button.\n\nIf you have a couple of hours to go, give it a shot.  It looks great, has great humor, and provides a memorable experience in a gaming landscape full of Ubisoft and Activision cookie-cutter games.  AAA this is not, but that's a good thing.\n\nWARNING: Game has some serious foul language.

Except for one model (I.E. The player's hand.), everything looks fine. The gameplay is responsive, except for a few problems I had in a platforming segment, but everything else controls fluently and responsively. The story is very good, and I don't want to spoil anything for you, I'll just tell you that it will screw with your head. Also, one of the major problems I had with this game is that it's just a little too confusing at times. Thankfully, I only had to use a walkthrough for one particular area. Even if you do get stuck, if you wander around the level enough, you can find hints scattered in different places. You just have to find them.\n\nFor a paid game, this would hold up by today's standards, but for free, it's definitely a must play if you like puzzle based games.","May 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

White Pawn path was very lovely and surreal. Have yet to try the Black Pawn. Probably will never choose it anyway, because I'm a selfless baby....and people say don't do it. The platforming section was G O D A W F U L. Like seriously. When they say you will fail a lot, they mean the platforming. Make it easier on yourself. Choose the White Pawn path to get the minimal groan. Puzzles were okay. You have to pay attention to what Vinny says to understand the Park stage and beyond.\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the game tries to be 2deep4u, but in the end it gives you an anime plot twist end and devolves from there. However, it, for a lack of a better phrase, remained in character. Oddly enough.\n\nFor a first game: this guy did a great job. I loved the atmosphere of the park and ammensity stages.  However lots of things could have been made better (i.e. the damn ending and platforming).  But I digress; this is the maker's vision. Gotta respect it a little (even if it is bad). For a free game, this is a good time waster if you're looking for a quick hour to jerk around. For a visual junkie (like me), this is a great example of how to catch a person's eye: lots and lots of atmospheric things.","September 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Except for one model (I.E. The player's hand.), everything looks fine. The gameplay is responsive, except for a few problems I had in a platforming segment, but everything else controls fluently and responsively. The story is very good, and I don't want to spoil anything for you, I'll just tell you that it will screw with your head. Also, one of the major problems I had with this game is that it's just a little too confusing at times. Thankfully, I only had to use a walkthrough for one particular area. Even if you do get stuck, if you wander around the level enough, you can find hints scattered in different places. You just have to find them.\n\nFor a paid game, this would hold up by today's standards, but for free, it's definitely a must play if you like puzzle based games.","May 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is it good?  Is  it bad?  As soon as I lean one way, I end up leaning the other way. You wade through a bunch of crap, yet there is a pretty humorous punchline in the end. But is it all worth it?  By the end of the day, this game gave me a terrible taste in my mouth.  A pretty gross aftertaste.\n\nNow, here's what the game's about.....wait....what IS it about?  Well...you attend a party for this girl you like.  You wake up and are soon assaulted by darkness.   Literally.   You're attacked by darkness.  You then find yourself "meeting" the antagonist.  An Italian voiced radio that keeps threatening it'll kill you.  On Black Pawn path, the voice of this radio "Vinnie" keeps trying to explicitly murder you (with a fake ending).  White Pawn....has some weird sh*t happen and your main character doesn't learn to keep his damn mouth shut.  After some weird surreal crap happens, you reach a final punchline (With a well-timed cue of "It's Not Unusual"), which is: The girl who held the party was your long lost sister/half-sister and you almost ♥♥♥♥ed her.\n\nBeginning puzzles are...absurdly difficult and make no sense  (Study through Windmill (Black Pawn route) ).  From House onward, everything else is self explanatory, making the game very simple.\n\nPROS:\nGraphics are well done.  It looks REALLY good\nHalf the VA sounds decent\nFree\nAchievements\n\nCONS:\nHalf the VA sounds....like it could've had better choices (ESPECIALLY for the protagonist, who's just a little pissant)\nButton Mashing segments\nBLACK PAWN PATH DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR PATH FOR WHAT IT WANTS YOU TO DO (Windmill area)\nShooting doesn't feel solid\nJumping areas need tweaking with the timing\nNo subtitles\n\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game if you're not an achievement hunter.  After days of thinking about this game, I just can't say it's something that was a good experience.  It's pretty, but as some users have said, it's a facade.  Either save yourself some headaches or get some achievements.  The choice is yours.\n\n3/10  Pretty....but......Only If this game didn't exist.","January 27","false","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You wake up in her bedroom after the party, and make an attempt to leave the house, guided by a short tempered voice on a radio.\n\nOnly If is NOT a very good game. The puzzles in the game are contrived at best and straight up broken at worst. The controls are alright when all you do is explore, but they aren't very helpful for precision platforming on flying painting or giant gold pillars.\n\nThe voice acting on the radio character is actually rather good, it has a decent amount of character, but some unrealized motivation. The main character's voice is not very good however, sounding cheesy and stilted. It doesn't help that the main character is pretty much just a horrible person, which could be used as a charcter study, or even a simple moral, but all it builds up to is a frankly weak ending that's comepletely irrelevant to the themes already presented.\n\nThe whole gimick of Only If is that the world can change around you as you solve puzzles. And this is alright, but it's never really used to make intersting puzzles, the creators instead care more about confusing the player. I will admit that the puzzles tend to have an atmosphere of oddity that I assume the creators were going for. The ways things play out usually is pretty intersting, leaving me quiet for most of the gameplay. But that doesn't excuse how broken the rest of the execution is!\n\nOverall, Only If is an unplayable game. It has some interesting ideas that never go anywhere, unused potential that could have been great, and shoddily done voice acting. But hey, at least the games pretty to look at.","December 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are a little tough, but they're interesting enough. There's some pretty unique mechanics in here that I haven't really seen done before. It's short, and as a result I can't think of a single time where a puzzle is repeated (except once, but you can't really call it much of a puzzle and it's for the story) so I'd say it's pretty good value for the 0 dollars you've spent. There's also some anime pictures. I don't know why. Doesn't that infringe on copyright? I guess it might not matter since they aren't profiting off it, so eh, whatever.

This game here is a perfect simulator of monotonous clunky gameplay. From unavoidable stabbing incidents to incredibly poor conveyance and structure all the way to never ending (unskipable) cutscenes. The game either gives you absolutely no clue as to what you are supposed to be doing, or beats you over the head with "cryptic" clues, which essentially amount to "do this dummy." And it is neverending.\n\nThe thing has a grand total of like six button controls wasd and m1+2 add in pause menu and were all good here. The only character who's voice can be tolerated for more than a few seconds is Andrew's but he never shuts up! Seriously, from his point of view he's been kidnapped and he constantly makes decisions to his apparently malevolent all powerful omnipresent kidnapper that no sane person would ever make.\n\nAnd the cutscenes, dear god the cutscenes. Each and every one of them is long and boring and essentially pointless. They don't further any story and provide loosely contrived reasons for anything that's going on. And you cannot skip them. You have to watch them every time you die SO BUCKLE UP! You are going to die a lot. And oh ho ho do I mean a lot, hoo boy. So get used to those cutscenes. ANd no there's no checkpoints per level, what do you expect? Actual gamedesign? Even if you know where something is from having died before (or having to restart the entire game to pick the new path) you have to sit through the entire thing. Over and over again. And you die. Rinse Wash and you get the picture.\n\nThere is one level with a checkpoint ONE!!! and no if you quit and type in the level name you don't start at that checkpoint either. And it starts you in the middle of a parkour section with completely out of the blue and yu will accidentaly jump off. The shooting mechanics in this portion are also shotty if that at best until the targets become so big that you'd have to look the other way to miss. Again "do this dummy."\n\nNo I do not reccomend this game. I only spent two hours on the thing anad it's free, and somehow I still feel like I've been cheated. I want my money back on this purchase and I spent nothing on it.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a waste of hardrive space.","August 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Because of that, when you get the choice, I suggest you choose the black pawn first.\n\nThe black scenario was FRUSTRATING.  Wandering around at the beginning unsure of what to do and constantly having to restart wasn't fun.  The house was equally so, as there were a one objective I simply couldn't accomplish without looking up how to do it.\n\nThe white scenario was awesome, however.  There was enough freedom to figure out what to do, and the puzzles only took a short amount of time to figure out.  While the two platforming sections were a little touchy, they didn't spoil the white scenario at all.\n\nThe ending...nice.  The last couple seconds seemed odd, but I'll just leave it at that.\n\nI agree with many people about the sound issues.  I would have preferred to understand the mumbling of the main character a little better.  Some of it I could make out, but I most likely lost about half of it.  For going through all the trouble of having (almost) 100% voiceovers, I feel we should have had the option to get everything recorded for the effort put it.\n\nGraphics were above average, and I didn't have any problems with the controls.\n\nI don't feel like the game deserved the 39% that critics gave it.  I believe that for this being an indie game, there has to be a little slack given.  I'd give this game about a 60%, since there were several spots where it would have been nice in the white scenario to hear or see the audible clues again, along with the other issues mentioned above.\n\nRegardless, for the fact that this is a free game, this is a nice way to spend an hour or two appreciating several people's hard work.  While it's definitely not for everyone, simply playing the white scenario would get everything one honestly needs to get out of the game.","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Admittedly, it's got more than its share of snags - Creability's grasp on 3D platforming action could use a little polish, and there were some moments where my interest in experimenting was drowned out by my urge to shake the monitor and scream at it until it told me what I was doing wrong, and while the voice acting was largely some of the most human and realistic I've heard anywhere, it occasionally was so mumbled I couldn't make out a word of it (And no subtitles either!

Early on in the game the story branches into to unique paths for you to take to the finale, so you will at least get two playthroughs out of it if you really want more after the first. Only If is free, so there is no reason not to try it you might find a story you don't easily forget.","July 29, 2014","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

From what you have already read in the game description, you went to a party and wake up in a different place. That sounds like a typical hangover and you're just there trying to piece things together, right? Nope, totally different, instead you are thrown into strange environments followed by a voice that you will decide either if that voice friend or foe. Piece together puzzles that may require speedy thinking or fast fingers. Throughout the game you will be questioning "What is real & what is not?" or "WHEN IS THE TORTURE OVER!" Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it had it's small frustrations but it keeps you interested and wanting more to experience.

However, instead of being something along the lines of Amnesia in terms of being difficult and still a good game, Only If derives its difficulty from simply not being polished or clear about what to do. While part of this can be put off as adding into the mystery aspect and making the player figure out the puzzles in each level, but a couple of the levels are simply ridiculous to try and figure out without the help of a walkhrough. In addition, some of the platforming aspects of the game are slightly frustrating simply due to confusing level design such as having to jump on parts of platforms that simply look like aesthetics.\n\nHowever, even with these problems, I still would recommend this game because of the experience that it provides. The story line is interesting (albiet difficult to follow at times) and really adds to the game as a whole. And even though I have pretty much bashed the gameplay, it does have its moments that makes it fun to play overall. On top of the whole thing, the achievements are all pretty simple to get and can help you improve your 100% complete rate on your profile if you are looking for that.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to people that don't mind less polished games with a few annoying parts and a ridiculous amount of swearing in relation to how short the game is. This game is pretty simple to complete and will probably take the majority of people somewhere around an hour or two to complete with all achievements (if you look up how to do them, since I am almost certain that you won't be getting the "One Day" secret achievement by accident).\n\nNeed a better reason? It's free and not a pile of garbage like a good deal of other free games on Steam.","November 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

In Only If you play as Anthony. One day after a party you wake up in a mansion and a man named Vinnie comunitcates with you through a radio. Hes keeping you locked up in the mansion and its up to you to escape. So how is Only If ? I enjoyed it quite a bit. Only If is like a more confusing  version of The Stanley Parable but thats not bad because Only If is quite funny too. The game lets you explore enviroments and solve puzzles which sometimes are hard and sometimes easy as pie. Only If is quite short as well with two diffrent endings to get and its all up to youre choices. The game is essiantly an exploration game with story. So now for the pros. Well writen story and funny jokes. Few Great Puzzles and FREE and the game looks great. Now for the cons. The game is quite confusing and the puzzles do get confusing later on even though theres choice making it doesnt do much. Overall The game is quite fun and it being free is just great.

The game looks alright and playes alright (for a free game) but is otherwise a simulator for beating your head against a brick wall. While one or two challenges could be described as organic most are exorcises in trial and error. Of the two paths you choose from at the begining, the Black Pawn path is the worst, which makes me wonder why the game told you to choose that path in the previous room. Described as a horror game, nothing about the game is very scary.\n\nThe two main characters (yourself and the antagonist Vinnny) made me feel like I was playing a crossover fanfiction staring  Dipper Pines from Gravity Falls and Vaas from Farcry 3. When not being hounded by Vass, Dipper is running from a non-descript cloud of black smoke. One area in particular forces you to stave off being eaten by the smoke by smashing the E key only to kill you anyway unless you have the good sense to run in the opposite direction, which was previously blocked by an impassible wall with no indication that any such thing had changed.\n\nI've seen some people call for this game to be removed from the steam store but I don't agree with that. The game is free and you can't fail to experience a return of investment if you haven't invested anything. I still can't recommend the game however because the puzzle-solving was bad and nothing was scary and for a Puzzle Horror game that's not good.

Parts of the game are almost so abstract they seem like they're taken from Max Payne.  Although the game seems a little rough around the edges at times, the graphics are stylistic and technically competent.  Gameplay and story wise it has a few qualities that make it worth playing.  At the core of Only If exists a psychological thriller that has heart pounding moments and challenging, but not too difficult, puzzles to the mix.  Despite a seemingly serious tone, there are plenty of comedic moments and irony that add to the interest.  The game is short, around five hours, possibly more more if you find the puzzles challenging.  Some other things going for the game are solid voice acting and well-composed music.  Coming from a lesser known production team Only If is indie gold, but if you're a stickler for perfection, you might have some misgivings about the game.  If you're just looking to burn an afternoon embarking on a unique adventure, this game might be just the thing you're looking for.Overall,  I would give the game a 7 out of 10.","November 18, 2014","true","5.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

You don't get to enter the house. The game instantly teleports you to the bedroom. The main character immediately starts going "Whaaatt? What happeenedd?" Wow. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.\n\nSo now we're in this bedroom area, littered with balloons, bottles, and even a cake. A cake, with a kindly note next to it saying "I told you the cake wasn't a lie!" Cross that reference off the list. Obviously massive picture of an anime girl or something on the wall, so we ignore that, and do a bit more exploring. Zero interaction with anything, all of it's boring. And then it happens. You get an achievement calling you a pervert, and telling you to move along. Claiming that you've been staring at the garbage picture on the wall? SURE THING GAME.\n\nSo you now try to leave the room, since the game is being such a naggy jerk. Okay, cool. I can press E to open the door. I wonder why that function was even added, when literally the only thing you can interact with is the door. Once you leave, you're immediately swallowed by darkness. Cool. You teleport to another room now, with some...Badly designed glowing blue orb, and a few walls that look like someone painted a blue texture in, in Quake 3(base engine, no enhancements). Of course it immediately kicks you out, so that was even more pointless than the E key.\n\nYou're now in a room, with some terrible sounding guy, cussing you out over a staticy radio. Yeah. That's all he does. He just endlessly swears at you, while you run around the room. Nothing of interest. So finally, if you can manage to hear him, since the audio is extremely distorted, and you can't hear him if you're more than 3 feet away, he will give you a prompt. A prompt, to look for a mirror. Now I'm pretty sure...Mirrors are shiny and reflective. This mirror? No. This mirror is a black abyss. Your reward for finding it is being cussed out some more. Thanks game! Now you're told to find a key, in a clock. Which requires you staring at a clock, while crouching (on some uneven physical surface, that's broken by a shelf that's been shoved over), for a minute. After three tries of this not going, and spamming the E key all over the clock. I said no. No more. This piece of trash can not have it. It can't have my time. I don't need this kind of attitude from you, game. I don't need some game to cuss me out cause it feels good about itself.\n\n1/10.

Right until the end, you will have no idea what's going on. You are presented with puzzling situations that you must extricate yourself from in order to keep a mysterious and maniacal voice from shooting you. The game gives no hints on solving the puzzles, and expects you to think out-of-the-box to discover ways to solve them. Critics of this game lament that the game is not orthodox enough and lacks solid object-oriented puzzles, but they are barking up the wrong tree and/or trying to fit a square into something that requires a circle. This game is not designed to tell you a story or test your IQ by presenting challenging puzzles. This game is about having fun -- loads and loads of it. I can't believe it's a free game, and if I had had to pay ~$5 for this game, I wouldn't have regretted it.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 9/10.","October 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some decent puzzling here and there. Controls work well and response is fluid. The game ran without a hiccup on maximun graphical settings, despite one crash.\n\nTerribad voice acting and sampling. Seriously. If you're out there gathering input, don't use the same methods and/or actors in your vocal recordings for the next game. It really detracts from the overall experience.\n\nFor games like this, I wouldn't wanna say much about the story, as they're much more fun going in blind. I will say that I enjoyed the twist, as well as how awkward the game is in general. It gives it some character, I suppose.\n\nAbsolutely can't go wrong with the price (free). I did play it back to back following "Gone Home". That experience was overall a lot more complete and much more fulfilling. I never really gave too much of a ♥♥♥♥ about what happened or to whom during this game.\n\nYou were close. Polishing up the quality of the voices, and using professional voice actors would have REALLY improved the experience. I would have also enjoyed more random environmental interaction instead of just what the game would allow when it wanted something from me.\n\nAll in all, not half bad. Still weirded out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/recommended/298260/","YourCompanionCube","Sturmgeist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YourCompanionCube/","103 products in account","Okay. So this game is free, obviously. So, you are free to try it. And you should, so you can formulate an opinion of the game yourself.\n\nThe thing is, this game has a great idea. It's very surreal with narration and dialogue playing a heavy role in the game. It reminds me much of the Stanley Parable in some ways, and then "Anna" in others.\n\nThe *problem* is this game has a lousy setup with controls and gameplay. God, I beat it so quickly but it was so f*cking frustrating. Basically, much of the game includes button-mashing quick-time sequences, but these are botched. You can try button-mashing, which seems to always fail. Trying to time each sequence right also fails, because you have to reach a certain amount of timed hits before death. You can time it just right, but the cue for the next sequence might take too long to appear, OR it can just be downright buggy in that it doesn't matter how you do it, you will fail.\n\nUnlike Stanley Parable, which had humor, clever dialogue, and no player dialogue (thus giving the player the sense he is communicating with the *vocal* narrator through his choices), this game lacks humor and clever dialogue, and instead uses excessive language and sexual innuendos.\n\nWhile I am a fan of excessive language and sexual innuendos, this game uses them rather crudely. They're not effective and it's like the game is trying to overdo itself with them. The player himself has dialogue, which takes away part of the surreal feeling.\n\nWould I recommend it if was a paid game? No. Would I recommend it when it's free? No. Unless you have taken a serious interest in the game already, I would not reccomend it.","August 20, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloopanthr/recommended/298260/","bloopanthr","Dorch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloopanthr/","96 products in account","This is basically an indie puzzle game, built as a discoverable situation with no real guidance.  In other words, be prepared to die a lot.  You'll say "What the ffffffffff" in a lot of different ways, a lot of different times while playing through this game.\n\nInitially, I almost gave up due to the button-mash-to-stay-alive thing that happens at the beginning and drove me a little nuts, not to mention a couple of programming objects failing to screen draw directions on occasion, but once I got beyond that, it was worth it.\n\nThis game is different, weird, and a bit heady (bordering on moments of pretentiousness).  In a world of sameness, it's refreshing to see a developer take a bit of risk, as well as listening to and hearing feedback from the community.\n\nThe big con you'll notice is that there's a terrible variance in the DRC (dynamic range compression).  In other words, it's REALLY REALLY quiet sometimes and nearly deafing at others.  I cranked the volume to catch dialog, only to have the floor shake because of audio some minutes later.  Had the developer though to simulate headphones for the character, it might've helped the experience quite a bit.  Especially given that the audio is intrinsic in puzzling solving and the experience.\n\nThe graphics, however, are pretty great considering it's free AND indie.  There are some really heavy atmospheric moments where I noticed that the music and vibe had increased my heart rate pretty effectively.  Awesomesauce.\n\nTotally worth checking out and playing through.  Don't be discouraged.  Pop on some headphones (it makes it a bit easier) and be prepared to play with the volume a little.  And make sure your "what the fffff...?" is on standby.","January 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voices were annoying or inaudible. I found myself running towards the radio as the man was speaking just so I could hear the instructions. If you go too far away you cannot hear him and before you know it you have missed the clues and they are unrepeatable. It isn't like a normal adventure where things are obvious. At no point do you get any hints as to wherever an object is useable or not. This often confuses as the controls let you down. For example to get a key that is low down on a shelf you are meant to crouch. If you don't get it just right you can't pick the key up but there is no icon to tell you that you can pick it up so you often miss things due to the controls.

You play as an average joe named Anthony. You were invited to a party. You get totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at said party. You wake up in a strange house, with a strange man talking to you through a radio. You wander through corridors, abandoned houses, and surreal dreamscapes. The game is very similar to the Stanley Parable gameplay-wise. Only If was constructed entirely on the Unity engine, and it is hands down the best looking game I've ever seen come out of that engine.\nOnly If's main downside is the lack of replayability. In the Stanley Parable, you have several interesting and varied endings that you can receive, all of which are based on your decisions made during the gameplay. In Only If, there are two endings, and the ending you get is based on one decision made fairly early into the game. I really wish the developers took a more complicated and versatile approach to the game's endings, because one of the endings is, albeit hilarious, really immature.\n\nOverall, Only If is a very good game, and a very interesting experience for a free to play game. I recommend you give it a try.\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8.75/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\nPerhaps it's time to wake up.\n\n...","September 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The more you let yourself become immersed in the game, the more you'll take from it. It is not kind, it will not coddle you. It's unfiltered and uncompromising and it's just the right flavors of raw and mute. Some bits feel like Myst, some bits feel like Amnesia, all in one queer head-trip that will leave you puzzled and uncomfortable.\n\nFor the price of free, I give it my full recommendations, but with the caveat that it's there for people that enjoy simmering in the surreal and have the patience to push or sometimes bungle through a puzzle that gives little to no explanation. Give it one evening and treat it like an abstract novella more than a whole game- if you're not likely to read strange fiction, give this one a pass.","February 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, it's riddled by technical difficulties, an incomprensible story, ugly graphics and poor gameplay.\n\nJust as an example, one chapter of the game called Windmill I had to replay several times due to a suite of problems. I didn't mash the space key fast enough to complete a quick-time event; I crawled in the wrong direction, got stuck and had to restart the chapter; I got eaten by black smoke repeatedly; the character got drunk and the vision impaired, so I accidently went off the track and stumbled around in a graphically ugly forest while being chased by a black smoke cloud.\n\nLater you get stuck in an old wooden house, where the furniture – or the lack there of – gives a very unfinished feeling. In the house you have to complete a set of boring puzzles, while once in a while getting chased by a  strange light without a body.\n\nThere are many more strange things and problems with the game, however, I think I have already made my point. But to summarize: the game feels unfinished and unpolished, and most of all, it's not at all fun to play.","August 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashu/recommended/298260/","mashu","An Amiable Italian Chef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mashu/","186 products in account","'Only If' poses itself as a cerebral adventure game where not everything meets the eye, but this promise ultimately dooms it to be an overly vague headache established on inconsistent "find the item to click on" puzzles and obnoxiously ambitious attempts to be "different". Combine this with the rather obvious hints that the creators of the game have the maximum mentality of a sixteen year old, Only If comes off more of an example of what not to implement in an adventure game.\n\nFirst off, many of the puzzles are far too ambiguous and expect the player to solve them in ways unconventional to popular game design. For example, there's a scene in the game where you, the protagonist Anthony, are asked to reply to the antagonist, Vinny, over the radio, answering 'what is sweet'. The game expects you to actually type the answer out; there's no prompt or dialogue box that pops up on screen. To make it worse, you're supposed to type the answer within the span of a couple seconds, else you're booted back to the beginning of the level. At first, I answered "candy", but after finding out this isn't correct, I assumed that typing it out wasn't what I was supposed to do. This led to me spending another five or so minutes, dying over and over again, trying to find out what to do. Supposedly, Vinny hints at the answer ("honey") when he's talking to you, saying it's "what bees make", but the vocal audio is so quiet and without the ability to turn on subtitles it's simply impossible to get the hint within your first few tries.\n\nSpeaking of voices, the voice acting and writing is really subpar in places. Vinny and his associate sound like a sixteen year old delivering a shoddy imitation of Vaas from Far Cry 3, and his loudmouth behavior is horribly cringy, but Anthony takes the cake in terms of unlikable characters. He's constantly making extremely obvious comments when he's walking around. One notable example is when you find a safe next to a locked door, and he says "Huh, there's probably a key in that safe." Yeah, no ♥♥♥♥. You don't have to treat the players like they genuinely can't find out anything on their own. However, it's even worse when he's conversing with Vinny; the near entirety of his speech is calling him "a ♥♥♥♥♥♥" or a "lifeless ♥♥♥♥" in an awkwardly uptight tone. Anthony acts like an entitled whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ throughout the game, and I sided with Vinny in wanting him to just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nAnother problem I had with the game is how the game's mood endlessly switches. One minute it's trying to be a serious (I'm guessing) 'commentary' on drugs, and another it's making some stupid ♥♥♥♥ing 9gag meme reference. I'm reminded of one of the parts of the game where you enter this fancy regal bedroom, and on the other side is a massive poster of some animu girl dressed in scanty clothing. Not only is it completely unfitting, it's most likely there just as some stupid "tribute" to one of the creators' waifus. It's laughably unprofessional.\n\nIn fact, that's probably the best word to describe the game in whole, 'unprofessional'. There's several parts where it's easy to see the little effort put into. In one instance, you enter this garden surrounded by a city. However, if you jump around a little, you can easily see the edge of the map and skybox, as well as the rest of the map supposed to be hidden to you until later. It's made worse by the lack of graphical options (outside of the generic Unity "simple-to-fantastic" dialogue box), and the pause menu that doesn't actually pause the game: it just blurs your vision and tells you the\noptions to quit.\n\nFinally, the game has a pretty awful plot. Actually, to be honest I can't really criticize it because I don't actually know what it is. The game does such a bad job at telling it to you that by the end of the game, I was still completely confused what happened. Was Vinny a mental projection of us, yet he was also Sam's father? Who the hell even is Sam? Who's Brittany? She was mentioned like in the middle of the game but never brought up again. The game also alludes to Vinny ♥♥♥♥♥♥ us, and incest for some reason, and yet it was a dream, but it wasn't. Seriously, none of it makes sense in the slightest.\n\nOverall, I can't say Only If is that good of a game. It might prove well as a cute little college game design project, and it is free, but that really doesn't justify the two hours I wasted playing it.","August 3, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is free and that is a major plus for it since spending money on something that is hit and miss is so very annoying. So, that really plays a part in why this game might be worth a bit of your time.\n\nMost of the time it ends up being a bit frustrating and the voice acting is not at all good. The characters are terrible and not someone you want to like or root for. The game is interesting at first and not the worst free experimental title. The controls are very stiff and at times the main downfall when it comes to getting things done on the platforming moments.\n\nNow, I really am interested in what these developers do next. I do want to like, Only if, more than I do. The idea of a free game that tries something new is enough for me to write about how much a game like this should be not judged so much. Then again, really don't want to just make it seem as if the game is only anything worth mentioning because of how it is free.\n\nIt is just nice to have the developers know that there is no reason to ask for money when the product is so unpolished. Yet, the fact that they are not trying to rip you off is enough for me to follow their next work and to support anything they do up until they get greedy like most indie developers do. If I had paid for this, I would be very upset. But I didn't, so I want to give them a thumbs up for not trying to fool you. Still, I really did not enjoy myself enough while playing this to justify your time being spent on it.\n\nIf you enjoy just about anything surreal, then you might find something worth liking in this. Time is not to be wasted, just like money, so if you really want to play a puzzle game that is off the wall and save some cash while doing so, then go right ahead and give it a spin. No need to really read too much into it and waste your time on reviews. It is what it is, a free surreal, puzzle game.","August 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Writing aside, the mechanics are poorly put together and are buggy. "Expiramental" does not excuse poor game design.\nFor starters the first bug I hit was after choosing to burn the "Black Pawn", after an obnoxiously long absense of gameplay, staring at the side of a wooden container that was quite aggrivating, I was then given a button prompt to hit space. Upon tapping the space bar, the prompt flashed. To me, the quick flashing prompt indicated to "rapidly press" the space bar. I failed. Clearly this was not the right option. My second attempt was more successful by holding the space bar.\nAfter arriving to the surface of the water and watching the protagonist crawl to shore (which I got to enjoy watching this same bit of gameplay several times over) I was then greated by another button prompt to push E. Judging by the last button prompt to press and hold "Space" I assumed this prompt simply meant to press and hold "E" to no avail. Again, I died. Ah, I see now, it's to rapidly press E now, thank you for clarifying the difference in the game...This would have been much less frustrating if the programmer took the time to denote the difference of when you should press and hold and when you should rapidly press.\n\nThe next thoroughly unenjoyable bug was apparently the invisible wall that follows just behind your ankles. Now finally equiped with the knowledge of how to fend off the evil QTE of the button mash, I decided to explore my options: As the game seems to try to encourage. Especially with the "afterlife" bit (fail state) wants you to turn the opposite direction of "the light" (Poignant...) and interact with the chess board to return just before the sinister QTE, I assumed after arriving on the shore, perhaps indulging the designers fetish of exploration and would turn the opposite way of the spawn point on the shore, of course, the invisible wall trapped me here as it followed just behind my ankles. Just when I was about to fail the persistant QTE "Rapidly press E" thing that continually comes up, I was able to sneak underneath the fence. So this must be the right way to go!\nAnd so I wondered around in this field for about 20 minutes until realizing, I had just escaped the boundaries of the game.\n\nOKAY, I purposely died from the QTE and tried again...\nThis time, following the path in front of me,  I straight forward, didn't stop moved close....aaaaaaand I'm dead. WHAT HAPPENED? There was no indication, I just died. Great...\nONE MORE TIME! Okay, followed the path, alright good, now my character is standing, thank GOD because this crawl is SOOOOO painfully slow. I spinted like a drunken mad man to the end..aaaaaand I'm dead. AGAIN, no indication of what happened.\nEventually the game just felt sorry for me and started respawning me at the part where my character stopped crawling, but at this point, with no inidcation of what to do, where to go other than a clearly layed out cobble stone path, that ended in a black out and fail state, I had no idea what to do. Finally upon giving up, I restarted the game and decided to pick the White Pawn. The first time I thought I had just picked wrong after it ran me through the same sequence as the black pawn. Restarting the game (AGAIN) I double and triple checked my choice to make sure I Picked the white pawn, and yet the game STILL gave me the black pawn result. Well, it looks like restarting the game doesn't undo some choices. Bravo.\nAnd it was with that, I closed the game for good and decided to come here and write a review.\n\nJust because it's "free to play" does not excuse bad design, and poor programming. This game is tosh. I gave it a go, and in the end my time was simply wasted.\n\nI could not recommend this game, even if it's free, but if you decide to give it ago: Understand that this game is poorly programmed and that the writing tries to be smart. It's kind of like the writing of Inception, on the surface it sounds smart, but if you REALLY pay attention, you realize that all of the characters are literally spouting gibberish! Some of the lines of dialogue are complete nonsense!...oh and the acting....let me not get into that, this review is long enough.\n\n\nTLDR:\nAVOID","September 3, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

A bunch of cool first-person puzzles and gimmicks (and I don't use that word in an insulting way here) were just sort of strung together with a really minimal narrative. The game wants to show you some cool stuff, but it's hard to get invested in the "story" of it. There's a lot of banter between the fully-voiced (!) player character and the mysterious shouting man on the other end of the radio, but your questions are never really answered in a meaningful way. The reveal at the end is more of a punchline than a resolution.\n\nFairly early on, the game branches into two separate paths. One is more surreal, but they both have their moments.\n\nSome of the clues are confusing or easy to misinterpret. Some of the tasks have solutions that you might find by dumb luck, without even knowing what you were looking for in the first place. Some levels make it very easy to die and aren't the most forgiving about how much ground you have to retread as a result.\n\nThe visual elements are very nice,  objects and environments look great. Some other games I've played recently have made me more aware of when games (like this one) make an effort to include other characters but never let you see them (I get it; human models are complicated). It becomes a problem when it's clear there are characters talking "just on the other side of this wall/door/etc" but if they walk around to your side, you get killed before you can see them.\n\nIt's an interesting game to ♥♥♥♥ around with, but it doesn't hold up as a complete game. I want to see what this developer can make when there's a strong story at the foundation.","September 16, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is one of those games that makes you wonder why it got through the greenlight. Ignoring the shoehorned meme achievements, the tasteless Portal reference, and the giant blown up anime picture greeting me in the first room; my biggest complaint was the dialogue.\n\nOur two characters communicated like internet frat boys, sputtering off things you'd expect to hear from someone playing the newest Call of Duty at 5 in the morning just after midnight release. Immediately after the two characters began to communicate, I felt awkwardly uncomfortable, not just because the swell fellow on the radio couldn't go two seconds without screaming down my ear because "I'm crazy and random because ART!" but also because of how my playable character reacted.\nThe dialogue quickly shows how awkward it is. My character didn't seem to care about the strange situation he had been thrust into, and then in the very next room proceeded to just start mumbling generic insults to our lovely radio guy. I felt like I was suppose to be laughing at this backtalk, but I only felt awkward and unamused by it Only a few minutes later I came to the realization I was not enjoying the experience at all.\n\nFrom what I've read, it only gets worse from there. Since I hear that the story and puzzles are what guides this game along (not it's flashy looking graphical landscapes which initially grabbed my interest) I do not see myself coming back to this game, knowing it would only grind on my patience with its incredibly unbearable dialogue and inconsistent voice acting.

And boy was it a waste.\n\nIf you make a puzzle/adventure game, the puzzles should make sense. And a wonky script mixed with bad voice acting makes figuring out what to do in tight situations a real pain in the butt. Especially when it seems like you're supposed to be paying attention and looking for some philosophical message or whatever among it all. But it's all disjointed, irrelevant, and in the end, meaningless. The first several puzzles aren't clear and don't lend any help to the player.\n\nFIRST FAULT: HIDDEN TYPING PROMPTS\n\nWho'd a thunk you need to TYPE stuff into this game? Because there's no way for the player to know from the interface that you sometimes have to type junk. This threw off my friend who first mentioned the game to me. It's stupid and interesting at first, but seriously, that's terrible game design.\n\nSECOND FAULT: BAD PLATFORMING\n\nIs your surreal adventure game going to have platforming challenges? Or mazes? Invest in a good engine. Having the player run and jump and slide in slow motion only makes them hate the adventure that much more. Especially when it involves tiny platforms that are high up.\n\nTHIRD FAULT: IRRELEVANT STORY TELLING\n\nI thought this was a game about a guy who goes to a party. It is. Eventually. But the entirety of the game up until the last 2 minutes is too surreal to even connect to anything without getting super super deep about it. Which it isn't deep. All of the stuff Vinnie rants to you about is just drug-induced mania. And that useless information mixed in with crucial puzzle details makes the experience lousy and annoying.\n\nFOURTH FAULT: BAD STORYTELLING\n\nI won't spoil the ending but if you manage the patience to get there, you'll agree with me that that's not how you end this kind of game. I expected some other wishy-washy drugged-out philosophical crud, but it's even worse- a complete shift in mood and tone. And not in a tragic or pleasant way. With really innappropriate music.\n\nOVERALL REVIEW: 2/10.\n\nIt's a playable game that I was able to finish in 2 sittings. I wanted to see the game to the end, and I was sorely disappointed from start to finish.

This is one of those games that makes you wonder why it got through the greenlight. Ignoring the shoehorned meme achievements, the tasteless Portal reference, and the giant blown up anime picture greeting me in the first room; my biggest complaint was the dialogue.\n\nOur two characters communicated like internet frat boys, sputtering off things you'd expect to hear from someone playing the newest Call of Duty at 5 in the morning just after midnight release. Immediately after the two characters began to communicate, I felt awkwardly uncomfortable, not just because the swell fellow on the radio couldn't go two seconds without screaming down my ear because "I'm crazy and random because ART!" but also because of how my playable character reacted.\nThe dialogue quickly shows how awkward it is. My character didn't seem to care about the strange situation he had been thrust into, and then in the very next room proceeded to just start mumbling generic insults to our lovely radio guy. I felt like I was suppose to be laughing at this backtalk, but I only felt awkward and unamused by it Only a few minutes later I came to the realization I was not enjoying the experience at all.\n\nFrom what I've read, it only gets worse from there. Since I hear that the story and puzzles are what guides this game along (not it's flashy looking graphical landscapes which initially grabbed my interest) I do not see myself coming back to this game, knowing it would only grind on my patience with its incredibly unbearable dialogue and inconsistent voice acting. Even the puzzles in this game can't breath life into it for me, I can't even stand it long enough to get that far. Not worth the time to be invested in, would rather play The Stanley Parable or Dear Ester.","August 1, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't have any experience with this genre, so I can't tell if everything is this crappy, but this particular game is really, really bad.\n\nI've played about half-an-hour of this game and it's irrelevant if you now tell me that, later on "it becomes the best game eva!!!1!", because the beginning is descouraging and one of the worst thing I've "played".\nThese guys did manage to create a decent horror atmosphere, but why is this a game? Would it take too much writing skill to make a movie and throw it into the immense pool of mediocre horror films that spawn every year? At one point, I was in a burning field, moving slowly in an irksome way (why would I want a game to be deliberately frustrating?) and, occasionally I had to press E to not die. Why? What good does that make? Is this what people think that a game's "interactive" part implies? I could've watched a movie and just mess around with the volume knob and you wouldn't call that a "game".\nAnother thing that bugged me is that whole "Save the black pawn thing", then a chessboard appears giving you the option of picking a white or a black pawn. It doesn't clarify whether you pick it for "saving" it or "not saving" it and that's another thing that I consider deliberately frustrating.\n\nMaybe I would've watched this as a movie, even though I'm not a horror enthusiast, but I wouldn't bother to press "E"  from ten thousand different positions just to pick a key in plain sight that seems to be reluctant of me picking it up. I think games today have this problem when they try to be just movies for people with ADD, occasionally requiring you to press a key to show the next cutscene or play the next line. The interactivity aspect of a lot of games today seems forced and unneeded, "Only If" is a perfect example of this, so, unless you like movie-like storytelling but can't sit for two hours without clicking some buttons, I'd recommend you stay away from this "game".","August 7, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

The first few minutes of the game setup a cruel masquarade, giving the player an expectation of clever puzzle solving intertwined with interesting level design and an engrossing story. I promise that none of these elements come to fruition.\n\nThe game very quickly abandons any hopes of requiring any thinking skills after the first quarter of the game, instead forgoing any oppurtunity for player exploration and problem solving in favor of arbitrary direct instructions on how to proceed. There is no point in playing any of the levels, as the game invariably tells the player exactly how to proceed, as if to make sure they complete the story it wishes to show off, thus removing the player's satisfaction of completing the level and killing their motivation to continue.\n\nAdditionally, the game is simply not fun to play. Level design is boring and overly complicated, and the game boasts no interesting mechanics aside from the standard "walk, jump, look, shoot" level of interaction.\n\nAs for the story, while initially promising, it quickly becomes frustrating and uninteresting, mainly due to the abysmal voice acting used to deliver it. At first, it's forgivable for an independent project, but it quickly becomes annoying and even embarassing to listen to. Since the game has no subtitles, muting the VOs eliminates the story of the game, which, frankly, isn't neccesarily a bad thing. The story is a pretentious mess either attempting to mirror the piecewise story-telling of Gone Home or Dear Esther, or attempting to mock it (given the ending). If the latter is true, it presents a better outlook on the game, but fails to redeem it from utilizing the poor design choices it is attempting to parody. In the end, it is revealed the story doesn't matter, which establishes the biggest shortcoming of the game: it has absolutely no redeeming qualities. No gameplay, no story, nothing interesting, overall a total failure.\n\nWhile the game tempts the player with replayability, as it utilizes player choice in proceeding, a quick replay reveals the choice changes essentially nothing, and exists soley to entrap the player once more.\n\nIf you wish to recieve any enjoyment out of this game at all, play for the first ten minutes, then stop and never pick it up again. Aside from a promising start, this game is an utter failure that is not fit for anyone's consumption.","November 18, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Never have you played a game, where on occasions, you type what you need to say in order to survive, including the Park episode which already has me stumped from the bizarre, manipulative settings of the world around you. It's unique, wonderful, the dialogue is EXACTLY HOW a human would talk in the same situation you were in. Anger, fear, and there's even more emotions I still have yet to discover of the main character you play as. On the lowest quality you can choose, it's very beautiful, the ear-functions are absolutely marvelous. Looking away, you can't hear well, walking away, you can't hear the antagonists voices and much other goodies. I very much recomend it, just as soon as I opened the game, I seemed to fanboy over the creation of the unique, puzzle-style selection of the games storyline. I had trouble doing the pawn sections, where you get shot, but to just to help out people in this situation, when he asks you what two bees make, actually type in the very same scenario you are in "Honey". You can type in order to communicate. It's a 10/10 for me, never in my life have I thought about the creativity that can be put into such a marvelous game. To the creator, PLEASE make more.

This game is free but is a complete waste of time. Right off the bat, the game lies to you. You get a launcher and the graphics will say "beautiful" or "fantastic". They are not. They aren't terrible (except out in the street where you don't actually play) but they are nothing special.\n\nThe main character talks with the antagonist over the radio. They both swear a lot just because. There is something to be said for having characters talk like real people, but I got the feeling the writer was giggling at how edgy he was being. You get a choice with a branching path but only one is right. If you choose wrong, you go through 2 awful levels and then have to do the other path. You have to avoid an enemy that isn't actually there. If you go toward them, you just die without ever seeing them.\n\nThe sound balance is terrible. You have to turn the volume way up to hear the voices but then the rare music or sound effects will blow out your ears.\n\nThere is no saving. The levels have names that you have to type in when you select "continue" from the main menu. You can't see what you're typing though. I hope you caught what the level name was when you quit.\n\nSpeaking of typing, there is one point where you have to quickly type an answer. There is only one right answer based on one bit of quick dialogue despite the antagonist just before saying "anything" would suffice.\n\nThe ONLY thing I can say as a positive is one area called "Park". It actually looks good and has beautiful music.\n\nThe game tries to sound like it's playing with a deep philosophical idea, but doesn't deliver, instead just telling you that you had sex with your sister.

The White Pawn scenario is pretty good, but the Black Pawn levels are so darkly lit that they're unplayable unless you find a torch, something which doesn't remain with you if you decide to reload your game. This made the Black Pawn scenario take hours to finish as I stumbled about using trial and error. Finally, when I did finish it, the game bugged and chose not to give me the achievement, forcing me to play through it again.\n\nAll of this said, the White Pawn scenario might be worth a playthrough, but be aware of the game's unpredictable nature when it comes to awarding achievements.","February 6, 2015","false","4.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impoxdragon/recommended/298260/","Impoxdragon","Impoxdragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impoxdragon/","300 products in account","The game describes itself as a "surreal first person adventure-puzzle game" and "The game's mechanics are designed to be experimental and unpredictable, to defy the logic of "What you see is what you get"."\n\nHad there been any logic to the game, then maybe it would be the above.\n\n"as an unseen, menacing, radio-bound antagonist will stop at nothing to block Anthony's path at every turn."  Well, for the first 5 minutes, yeah.\n\nLet's start with the main menu of the game: Continue, Start and Quit.  Booting up the game gives me a launcher to rebind keys, choose how the game looks "Beautiful", "Fantastic" and "Good" being options.  Nothing else.  No AA.  No Volume sliders.  I can't choose whether or not I want  V-Sync.  Captions WHICH ARE GREATLY NEEDED  Nothing.\n\nWhat I saw: A good-looking game.  A little too much memage for the achievements but they don't really matter\n\nWhat I got: More of what I lost.  I wasted time on this game but I'll try to explain what I "experienced" (there are things that are called good and bad experiences) through my playthrough.\nA game with some bugs such as collision and direction.  During the "Windmill" level, I managed to clip out of the mapby crawling through fire.  Had I known that the direction I took was incorrect, I wouldn't have crawled around for a good 7 minutes before getting stuck in a pit of the bottom of the lake.  I verified, re-installed and verified again.  I encountered the same "bug" all 4 times\n\nThe voice acting wasn't so good.  I've done some VAing but I'm not a professional or anything so forgive me if I'm just bad at critiquing them.  The quality of the recording equipment sounding good; there wan't any echo or the "through a can" sound that comes with bad equipment.  The acting, not so much.  The main character sounds really bored and disinterested in what's happening around him or what he's doing.  Oh, you got found and are going to be shot in the head?  "No... please..."  No, not "No! PLEASE!" just a flat "No" and "please" will suffice for this character.  The antagonist?  I can't tell if he's supposed to be hispanic, from Boston or what.\n\nUsually, I couldn't hear what they were saying and had to crank up my volume way up.  Problem is, some segments are at a good volume so I'll blow my ears out at times.\n\nTextures were good looking. but oddly placed.  Again, in WIndmill, the ground textures (leaves, dirt and sticks) were found at the bottom of the lake.  I also fell through the water and the lake.\n\nGameplay is minimal.  Press E, Walk, smash space or "E"  It plays more like an Amnesia custom level more than anything (you even hide in a dresser at one point, hiding from 2 enemies.).  Don't know what to do?  You're out of luck.  You either run around trying to find things to interact with, wait for the MC to talk and hopefully give you a hint or just get lucky.\n\nCan you start from where you left off?  Depends.  Do you remember the name of the level?  No?  Understandable; you have to go the the "Esc"/pause menu.  Doesn't pause when you go there either so if you're, again, in the Windmill level and have to smash you interact button, guess what, you just died.\n\nInventory?  No.  Health?  No.  Map?  No.  Compelling?  Not really.  Forgettable?  Yes, most definitely.  Fun?  Uh...  I didn't find it fun.  Didn't find a puzzle either, unless gathering items are the puzzles, then these are flipping cake compared to Professor Layton or Puzzle Agent.  But if finding out what to do is the puzzle, then this blows Ace Attorney, Professor Layton, Puzzle Agent and, hell, even Kryptos out of the water.  I'm not asking for hand-holding (I love challenges, not artificial difficulties or just bad game design making it hard) but I want to know that I've going in the right direction at least.  Now, the first three usually don't matter for a game and usually not a "puzzle" game like this one but the last 3?  Yeah, those are important for every game.\n\nI was really dissapointed in the game if you couldn't tell.  Wanted to like it because the first two or three reviews seemed to really, and suspiciously, praise the game for everything I found fault with it.","February 10, 2015","false","0.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Stuck at Windmill level,died about four times unsure whether I was supposed to continue to die or find a different route. It's pretty linear and I kept dying from fading (And disappearing) black spheres or non existant ones? As early as the Windmill level and as linear as it is, I should've known how to progress. But I did not.\n\nBeginning story and direction are a big drag.\n\nI found the voice of the antagonist quite annoying and predictable. Of course, a mafia boss. His character introduction could've been to befriend you before he turns on you. I feel that would be more compelling than to insult you as you begin. That way you can build some connection, you expect a mafia boss to be a ♥♥♥♥ anyway. Black spheres maybe introduced a little more clearly early on.\n\nElements that break my immersion are using the same painting on the walls. The simplistic black sphere effect, light source from windows with no actual outside light source. In the beginning two balloons that line up perfectly on a grid. More attention to detail is needed otherwise it just feels like it's lazy. Intrigue us, make us question the reality of the world.\n\nCut scenes were a little offputting at how a gigantic half-your-size rock does not kill you nor a falling windmill.\n\nGraphic design of title is decent. Gets the idea, could be a bit better even for a simple game. Trailer created is pretty good. I do like the rooms that were made. Decent game for something free. Would not pay in its current state.\n\nFor those who are tenacious, play on.","October 21, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The game drives you through different scenarios and forces you to "solve puzzles" without any direction as to what the puzzle even is. To sum it up: some parts are only vaguely reminiscent of Amnesia, while others desperately try to be like The Stanley Parable.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is poorly executed: it's ultra linear, bland, and outright vulgar. Everything about the voice acting and dialogues is cringe-worthy, there's no plot, and it lacks the visceral quality that Amnesia succeeded at. (Also, the ending was awful). Perhaps the only redeeming factor about it are the graphics in the park scenario.\n\nYou can tell there was a lot of ambition here--but /only if/ it worked.

Maybe 4 or 5 hours.   However it will actually feel longer, due to the way your persception of time and space is turned around.\n\nThe graphics are pretty well done and there is some beautiful scenery (like the park).\n\nFinally, a word of advise, as others have noted.

That's what I assumed from the way Only If presented itself.\n\nWhat I DIDN'T know is that this game would be a pretentious piece of sh**.\n\nSee, Only If revolves around isolating and confusing the player; and it's nonsensical story certainly attests to that. Seriously, who is Vinnie? Who is Sam? What the hell is going on?\n\nI get that that is the point of this game, and it does succeed- but it leaves so many holes and questions behind in its story, that I personally felt unfulfilled playing it. And the undertone message is either about... us being products of our environment and having a lack of choice in anything we do? Or is it learning to step away from video games and appreciate nature? Or is it a way to delve into the mind of a misogenystic man, who has to confront what a terrible person he is? It feels like its cramming so many random artistic messages into one game, that it turns into a big mess.\n\nIt is pretty to look at, though. That's the only saving grace for the poor labyrinthine design and even worse platforming and quick-time events. Seriously. There is platforming and quick-time events in a walking simulator. And both are annoying in their own respect.\n\nI like some elements on this game. But for the rest of the game, it feels like a college student trying to do something postmodern in a lousy attempt to create art, without having something significant to say.

However, my goal for this game was none of those. I wanted mystery and weird stuff. Nonsense does not equal mystery. I ended up frantically clicking all over every room in the hope to activate anything.\n\n\nMaybe the concept of making a puzzle game illogical is just no fun..

What Only If is a glimpse into the future of video games, where the boundaries between the strict game genres are cast aside, and new forms of storytelling are forged.\nSimilar to the vein of Gone Home, Only If tells a short story of a young man that is at the crossroad of personal, emotional changes. But the thing is that someone or something is pushing him to make a choice, forcing him to change.\nOn the plus side, the game has a delightful voiceover work, with snappy and vibrant dialogues, and for the most part it's a good-looking game considering this was made by a very small independent team with some very interesting ideas. On the negative side, the story is a mess, with a theme that was not appealling to me. While some levels look gorgeous, such as the "Park" level, most of them are not visual stunners and aren't designed well. The game struggles to communicate with the player, it has a poor way of teaching the player the basic use of commands, or hinting them what are they supposed to do next. It shows that it's creators have an interesting vision but still lack the experience to share it with others.\nThen why am I giving Only If a thumbs up? Because behind all the things that don't work, you can feel that the guys who made it have a potential to make a great game. It's like an unknown little movie that you accidentally stumble upon, or an experimental, concept album you find at the market: they are not great works of art, far from it actually; but they show signs that in time people who created them can make a truly stellar piece of work.\nOnly If is a glimpse into the future of games, where everyone can create and share interactive stories and experiences. There will be a lot of blunders and failures along the way, but with every such game that tries to achieve greatness, we are one step closer to making the Citizen Kane of games.","October 20, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Plays bad. The controls are horrible.  The people mumble.  The sound effects are too loud.  For instance at the beginning you can pick up a pawn.  The color matters, but as the guy on the radio is hard to hear, the coice is meaningless.  Turn the volume way up or you might miss it.  Also, there is no way to know exctally what you are aiming at.  Even if you understand the choice you can't be sure which pawn you will pick up.\n\nAnyway, the puzzles are pointless.  The entire game is based on what the characters say and since there is no way to turn on subtitles the point of the game is lost if you can't understand what is being said.  The end music drounds out most of the conversation.  At least I heard the punch line.  Ok, haha.

This game!\n\nWhile I was hoping for that "gone home" experience of storytwists and genious puzzles, all "only if" will give you is random nonsense that won't even make you pat your back after "solving" something.\n\nGranted, the game started with good graphics, nice voiceover, not too annoying controls and so forth. However, my goal for this game was none of those. I wanted mystery and weird stuff. Nonsense does not equal mystery. I ended up frantically clicking all over every room in the hope to activate anything.\n\n\nMaybe the concept of making a puzzle game illogical is just no fun.. You finally discover a way to get out (That's what it felt like after a while) and looking back all you did was "trial and error". Exactly the thing you wish to avoid in puzzling.\n\nThis game is free to play for a reason.","July 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Puzzle and exploring games are great.  I usually love such games.  The puzzles in a game like the original Resident Evil are just classic.  What annoyed me almost instantly in "Only If" is when the environment changes after simply turning your character around, or exiting and re-entering a room.  One of the first scenes I was in, I explored the entire room and there was clearly no mirror to be found.  The voice on the radio tells me to find the mirror, I go back to a wall that I already looked at, and suddenly there is now a mirror there.  Someone described this game as "trippy".  You aren't kidding.  Nothing says 'poor puzzle creators' more than 'hey, one minute let's not have an object there, but the next minute, let's make it appear'.  Annoying, sloppy, amateurish, and a waste of time.  Only if.... this were a good game.","August 7, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The sensitivity of the mouse is not able to be altered and leaves you wheeling around in a sickening lurch like a mad man. Bashing repetitively on space or e (when prompted) to stay alive works only half the time when prompted, leading to restart after restart when near death. The puzzles make no sense. I get that they're supposed to be surreal, but when your only hint is something about fire and still life artworks in a room with only landscapes, urns and still life arrangements of objects, there's something wrong with your dialogue script. An inability to cause repeats of these sorts of clues or to ask for hints in-game means more restarts.\nAnd, worst of all, the method for restarting involves typing the name of the room you're in into a menu screen that accepts no typing so you have to start from the beginning with each log in.\nMostly, the lurching constant movement of the view (which cannot be altered) leaves me feeling motion sickness, which makes all of the rest of these problems impossible to overlook.","December 27, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

At first I expected just some The Stanley Parable rip-off, but it turned out to be the best free game I have played. The writing and voice acting is spectacular, just like the athmosphere and also the music. I can only recommend this game.","October 18, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(I don't agree with the tag horror btw. Strange and mysterious, but not frightening)\n\nIt is actually brilliant! Yes, it has some problems, but if you are willing to get pass those, the experience is great. You could always look at a walk-through if you are completely stuck, but I encourage you not to. The game is not difficult, just a little odd at times, but that is also a good thing. Don't expect the same ol... This game goes deep.\n\nWhat really excels, is the music, sound and voice acting. Yes, there are some problems with the mix, making it hard to hear at times (headphones highly recommended) but I am really impressed with the overall quality, especially the music, being a composer myself. I would say that it is as good as an AAA-title in that regard, and I'm surprised there is so much fine work within a free title.\n\nAt times, the game is frustrating and confusing. You end up repeating some parts, especially the beginning. But I also believe that some of these frustrating parts are part of the game-play, not just bad design.\n\nThe puzzles in the game become an experience itself, rather than just something to complete in order to progress. It is dream-like and mysterious. I found the ending has little to do with the real message of the game, and it felt it was put there to have a sense of competion. I encourage you to find your own meaning in the game instead though. It will leave you reflectinging for a while, and it is great when I game can do that.\n\nI wish for more games like this, where you don't know what is going on, where you are in for a fresh experience with no handholding.","October 24, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A free game is a showcase of the creator's abilities and so far I'm not impressed. If the game needed feedback than a small group of beta players is better than a large community like Steam. Obviously, this affects my buying choices for future titles; I just won't buy from Creability.\nThe game is ruined by lack of thought at planning. What infuriates the most, and this is a very big deal, is the lack of subtitles. I can't overstate how important they are in a game that relies on character speech to play. Being hard of hearing, I find the game unplayable without a walkthrough to tell me what's being said. Subtitles are essential in a game like this.\nThe ability to change keys to control the characters is also quite important.\n\nUsing the walkthrough in place of being able to hear isn't ideal, since it gives away what I'm supposed to do without allowing me to work it out. This means that my thoughts on gameplay are very biased. It looks like a good game, though far too heavy on faux-wisdom, with puzzles that quite probably present a challenge without being too difficult to solve.\n\nIf you're hearing impaired or don't use WSAD key-controls, don't waste your time. There are some excellent reviews for the game, and I wish I could play it properly to see for myself why it has them.","January 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I also found it hard to sympathize with the protagonist due to his use of homophobic and sexist slurs.

Let none of us forget that the version of The Parable most of us know was a remake of a game that used another game's assests and one of the greatest voice actors ever. The Parable was a unique experience and it's a good sign that people are trying to recreate that experience, that's how genres are made; and i'd really love for this type of genre to be a thing.\n\nVinny's voice acting will stick with me forever as one of the best things i've ever experienced.\n\nFinally a game that doesn't walk you through the same old paces and lets you really think and explore without drawing out it's time, if you figure out what you need to do you can just do it without still needing to check every corner (except when you do need to check every corner xD).\n\nI may be seeing this game through rose colored glasses but i gained that perspective by playing the game and immersing in it so even if the quality wasn't top shelf that's kind of a moot point, they made something that i enjoyed and that far exceeds any physical flaws it might have.\n\nThere was one part that i had to look up:\non the trail at the windmill where the wall opens up behind you only while the darkness appears. They predicted my organic reaction incorrectly causing me to spend nearly 1/2 my play time going through that cut scene and atempting to find  a way out (for a while there i even thought the game might be playing with me saying "you chose your life over her's so now your damned to repeat this part over and over hoping to escape" kinda like that greek story)\nBut other than that all the puzzles where fair, meaning you could figure them out by thinking "what piece of this puzzle am i missing?" and not hunting for the 19th bamboo key to the subway employees office.\n\nWell well worth the time it took me to beat it; though i wouldn’t recommend this game to nearly anyone, i still love it. This is the kind of game you go out and find not the kind of game that's on the tip of everyones tongue. Most people are not going to like this game. Others will love it. A cult following type game. There are a few things that have to come together for this game to be something you enjoy. But hats off to the developers. "Make the game you wanna play" is the feeling i got.\n\nThe game's lack of hand hold by itself are gonna have too many drowning, even though there is plenty of direction. Be willing to think and listen. This game should go down as a milestone as a test to multiple mental capacities and every part of this game can be solved (except that one thing) Your abilities are what hold you back not the game.\n\nOne last thing: Had a ton of problems with the trophies but i played it within hours of it's release and eventually they appeared when i replayed it so i'm not sure if they fixed it or what.","August 16, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Do not play this game if you like that sort of thing, the description reminded you of other well-made games you enjoyed, and your hoping this game will give you a new but similar experience.\nDo play this gamer if you're naturally curious to a fault, you've got time on your hands (and/or you don't much value your time), you're a bit of a masochist, and you want to see what happens when a person tries to make a game similar to other games like "The Stanley Parable," "Amnesia," "Silent Hill," "Dear Esther,"and "Portal", and movies like "Inception," "Vertigo", and the last few scenes in "2001: a Space Odyssey," and that person is an idiot.\nThis is not much of a puzzle game. Every puzzle is either too easy or hard to figure out for all the wrong reasons. As for surrealism well... while the concept of "surreal" might popularly just invoke surrprising, nightmarish, absurdity, surrealism isn't just random imagery thrown on a canvas. Successful surrealist works rely on intentional symbolism derived from psychology, dreams, folk lore, mythology and even contemporary works of art. For all "Only If"'s evocative, and nonsequitur imagery and events there are very few intentional symbols or motifs in the mix. I also find it telling that the only time the game directly  referenced another work besides itself, it was just the radio guy asking you if you'd seen "Inception" and if you remembered the scene where the entire rooms turns over, and then the same thing immediately happens in the game.\n\nThis game is most fun during the trippy transitions between it's trippy scenes. Most moments in the game are ultimaltly inconsequential to any large idea, themes or plot but it did a decent job surprising me and not even too bad a job creating suspense. I also enjoyed the rude GLaDOS inspired Brooklyn mafioso sounding fellow who verbally abuses you over the radio at the beginings and ends of most sections. the voice actor deserves kudos. He chews the scenery to shreds but the guy commits to those lines even when they're truly bafflingly written.\n\nThis is a really bad game guys. But it's sort of perversely entertaining. And it's also kind of fascinating to see genres and aesthetics I really like in the hands of someone who has completely no understanding of them.","September 28, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was a really random non sequitur joke and then a goofy song plays and everyone slaps their knees and I'm just sat here confused and unsatisfied like I just got told the longest joke in the world and the punchline makes no sense.\nFor a narrative driven game, to end on such a low note is really really bad.\nIf you intend to play this game, don't go in to it for the plot because nothing will ever be answered, and trust me, it's not that you can't figure it out, it's that there genuinely are no answers. The developers themselves probably don't ahve an answer, and that's not a good thing.\n\nThe puzzles are ok, although some are tedious. They're enjoyable the first time, but after finding out the surreal coating of the game is a complete sham then there's not much point to them, and late in the game they get really really really REALLY tedious. You don't feel clever for solving them, you just veel like oh my god did you really just make me shoot 100 vases.\n\nOh yeah, and one big problem is the fact that the audio mixing is horrible. The radio is painful to listen to and, trust me, you'll hear it a lot, while hte main character himself is really quiet. Aside from that, the voice actors themselves are really unclear in what they're saying, and there's no subtitles option.

They predicted my organic reaction incorrectly causing me to spend nearly 1/2 my play time going through that cut scene and atempting to find  a way out (for a while there i even thought the game might be playing with me saying "you chose your life over her's so now your damned to repeat this part over and over hoping to escape" kinda like that greek story)\nBut other than that all the puzzles where fair, meaning you could figure them out by thinking "what piece of this puzzle am i missing?" and not hunting for the 19th bamboo key to the subway employees office.\n\nWell well worth the time it took me to beat it; though i wouldn’t recommend this game to nearly anyone, i still love it. This is the kind of game you go out and find not the kind of game that's on the tip of everyones tongue. Most people are not going to like this game. Others will love it. A cult following type game. There are a few things that have to come together for this game to be something you enjoy. But hats off to the developers. "Make the game you wanna play" is the feeling i got.\n\nThe game's lack of hand hold by itself are gonna have too many drowning, even though there is plenty of direction. Be willing to think and listen. This game should go down as a milestone as a test to multiple mental capacities and every part of this game can be solved (except that one thing) Your abilities are what hold you back not the game.\n\nOne last thing: Had a ton of problems with the trophies but i played it within hours of it's release and eventually they appeared when i replayed it so i'm not sure if they fixed it or what.","August 16, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

You go to a party, get drunk, pass out, and when you awake you find yourself being tormented by a radio voice harrassing you and threatenting you but never really giving you any pertanent information. It wants you out of the house, it tells you to find a key, that is never visiable in anyway, but you "happen" next to it and get a text on your screen that only lasts for about 2 seconds. Hope you can read fast and have good eye sight. It pops fast and is small and unless you are centered on your screen you will miss it.\nI would love to see a great mystery game hit the market but I can say this is not it.","August 25, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I liked the start in the house, seemed like exactly the kind of trippy and unusual game I would enjoy. The whole 'press E' in the Windmill level just annoyed me too much. I can't get passed that point because having to repeat the exact same bit over and over because I put a foot wrong and it gets to frustrating and just boring. That part of the game just felt very "trial and error" and really not needed. I know It's a puzzle game but that part is just really not fun. It's such a shame because I feel like this has potential but it's ruined for me by that part. I gave the level 3 chances, about a week apart but I like it less each time. I really hope a future update for the game will remove E-mashing or at least give you more than a second of stepping off the path before getting thrown back to the start. I've not given up hope yet and if I see an update for the game, I will try playing again.","August 30, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Do not play this game if you like that sort of thing, the description reminded you of other well-made games you enjoyed, and your hoping this game will give you a new but similar experience.\nDo play this gamer if you're naturally curious to a fault, you've got time on your hands (and/or you don't much value your time), you're a bit of a masochist, and you want to see what happens when a person tries to make a game similar to other games like "The Stanley Parable," "Amnesia," "Silent Hill," "Dear Esther,"and "Portal", and movies like "Inception," "Vertigo", and the last few scenes in "2001: a Space Odyssey," and that person is an idiot.\nThis is not much of a puzzle game. Every puzzle is either too easy or hard to figure out for all the wrong reasons. As for surrealism well... while the concept of "surreal" might popularly just invoke surrprising, nightmarish, absurdity, surrealism isn't just random imagery thrown on a canvas. Successful surrealist works rely on intentional symbolism derived from psychology, dreams, folk lore, mythology and even contemporary works of art. For all "Only If"'s evocative, and nonsequitur imagery and events there are very few intentional symbols or motifs in the mix. I also find it telling that the only time the game directly  referenced another work besides itself, it was just the radio guy asking you if you'd seen "Inception" and if you remembered the scene where the entire rooms turns over, and then the same thing immediately happens in the game.\n\nThis game is most fun during the trippy transitions between it's trippy scenes. Most moments in the game are ultimaltly inconsequential to any large idea, themes or plot but it did a decent job surprising me and not even too bad a job creating suspense. I also enjoyed the rude GLaDOS inspired Brooklyn mafioso sounding fellow who verbally abuses you over the radio at the beginings and ends of most sections. the voice actor deserves kudos. He chews the scenery to shreds but the guy commits to those lines even when they're truly bafflingly written.\n\nThis is a really bad game guys. But it's sort of perversely entertaining. And it's also kind of fascinating to see genres and aesthetics I really like in the hands of someone who has completely no understanding of them.","September 28, 2014","false","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have no real control and there is next to no immersion once you start touching the disorganized and often unresponsive controls. In a nutshell, you just keep pressing E and hope this makes some progress...maybe...hopefully...if you're lucky\n\nI want to like this game, I really do. It has great visuals, passable dialogue, and an atmospheric stream-of-consciousness form of gameplay that in other titles (i.e. the Stanley Parable and Gone Home) has been wildly successful and has helped drive player immersion. Only If could have been something memorable. It just failed to do so and failed spectacularly.\n\nNow, I've played some lousy games (Superman 64 and 50 Cent: Bulletproof, to name a few), but this game takes the cake and eats it...mostly because, in this day and age, when even low-budget indie games are able to successfully compete with AAA titles, this is unacceptable.\n\nThe only good thing about this "game" is that it was free.","November 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
