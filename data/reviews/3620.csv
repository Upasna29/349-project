I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes puzzle games or anyone who likes casual games; because Zuma is one of those games that you play in order to relax after work or school.\n\nIf there were any complaints that I have about the game it would have to be the bosses. The problem with the bosses is the fact that you can't lose any lives when fighting them so, because of that; there really is no fear in losing all your lives and starting from your last check point. In turn this is also be a good thing so, that you really don't need to stress when fighting them.\n\nBut other than that, it's a great game and for the price, it's entirely worth it! Many diffrent levels to play, cool powerups, and relaxing gameplay, makes this a good buy!","December 7, 2014","true","17.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

On one hand, you could get lucky with Plants Vs. Zombies or Peggle. But, on the other, you could be playing Zuma's Revenge. Before continuing, I would like to note that this review is coming from solely playing the adventure mode. Zuma's Revenge's adventure mode has you playing as a frog on an island, making your way through on your adventure.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be simple, Zuma having a color ball and having to match three or more of the same color of ball on the track before the balls reach a certain point to which you have to restart the round. On paper, this seems quite simple but the game needs polish as it becomes frustrating when the game solely relies on luck to win the round. The music to the game is simple but, unfortunately, lacking. The same song always plays, allowing for no diversity and not giving the player any reason to keep listening.\n\nIn adventure mode, the frog most fight bosses but it doesn't feel like there are any at all. For the most part, the bosses are simple, the only boss which is noticable is the last one because of it's three-stage gauntlet.\n\nTo wrap up, Zuma's Revenge seems to be attempting to ride on the success of Peggle, a game which came out two years prior. However, where Peggle is both skill intensive and luck intensive, Zuma's Revenge simply relies on luck to get through. I did put in almost eight hours playing this game but that wasn't because I was having fun, that's because luck wasn't on my side. When the right set-up and power-ups came up, I was able to finally get past a stage that troubled me, no skill involved. If you have the money and would like to play a mindless game, buy Peggle instead.","July 9, 2015","false","7.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","1"

It's quite obvious that chance alone can't explain why it leans so heavily toward feeding you balls that will do nothing but force you to push the line closer to the failure point. Skilled "twitch" gamers can probably get around it pretty easily, but later levels are going to be pretty much impossible for a fairly large segment of the population. I'm not opposed to "twitch" games in general, but this is marketed as "casual".

Now this is an awesome game, and I imagine almost everyone have played it at least once.\nThis is the sequel to Zuma (deluxe). You are a frog - a line (or more) of colored balls are rolling towards a golden coin with a skull on. You "puke" (spit?) a colored ball, and by matching the same color so it's three or more, they are removed.\nYou can also "puke" at fruits and such, to gain more points, which in normal play mode means stopping the balls faster and finishing the level quicker.  Some balls also turn special, gain laser, canonballs, supersight..\n\nIt's a fun and really, really addictive game.

The game is brightly colored, easy to learn, but occasionally quite challenging.  The sound design and tropical theme work very well together and none of the effects used become to grating or repetitious.  There is a main puzzle campaign as well as other challenge modes that can be unlocked, as well as a final boss for each stage of the story mode.  Altogether I would recommend this game to any of my friends who like casual puzzle games, as this title has both the gameplay and polish necessary to deliver hours of entertainment.","July 18, 2012","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, you clear out strings of rolling balls by matching colors. The main game mode is "Adventure", and is  60 levels. You are allowed to save your progress every 5 levels. Once you finish this mode you can replay it on a much harder setting called "Heroic Frog."\n\n"Iron Frog" is a gauntlet where you have to complete 10 very hard levels with only a single life. Very tough to do... I've still only gotten up to level 5.\n\nFinally , "Challenge mode" has you try and complete several series of levels in different difficulty levels. It's fun until you reach the last and hardest level of difficulty, because you have to have unlocked them in "Iron Frog" before you can play it here. And as I said before, that's really hard to do.\n\nIf you like puzzle-type matching games, you might want to give it a try.","June 21, 2015","true","59.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Level progression moves the game from simple time-killer to legit strategy puzzles. As with many games, they display hints and tips during various load points.\n\nEverything is based on how close the conga line is to the end point, which means that EVERY normal game is time based. The boss "fights" have some sort of twist that negates, or doesn't bother with, a time component. I have a harder time with timed puzzles, so this becomes especially difficult for me sometimes.\n\nDespite the game's challenges, the aesthetics are along the lines of cheesy humor. Adult-level chalenge is present, but the bright colors and simple animations encourage kids to play. Easily frustrated players will probably have some difficulties in the later levels.","September 26, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By far one of my favourite pass time games I had when I just wanted to chill. To my excitedment the game was on Steam and I was very happy to purchase it.\n\nHowever, there are far too many bugs and I'm very disapointed in the game. The cursor consistantly bugs out through the game and now matter what settings I choose it won't come right. Can't shoot at the right colours because I have no idea where the invisible cursor is. I'm quite unhappy with a game that used to be a lot of fun for me.\n\n2/10","March 9","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
