This game is not for everyone.  It is really only for hard core wargamers.  I love this game, but I have been playing games like this for a long time.  The graphical interface is a bit clunky and difficult to use, but it gets easier after you are used to it.  There is a map, but you have to switch screens to access it (maybe this adds to the realism since it feels more like reading a map).\n\nThis game is frustrating at first when your squad consists of militia.  Tactical gameplay elements like morale and accuracy mean that the conscripts will have trouble hitting anything and will run away when shot at.  But once you separate the men from the boys, you can build an effective squad.  The game has well thought out promotion, class, and technology systems, so your squad will improve in capability over time.  Eventually your men will be able to hit distant targets and will keep fighting even after being wounded.  This also means that it can be a major blow if one of your veterans is killed in action.  Fortunately, critically wounded soldiers can be evacuated if one of their comrades can reach them in time.\n\nLike many tactical games, the strategy aspect is mainly a mechanism to make the battles significant and give them some context.  But the strategy game is also well thought out in terms of game elements and play balance.  There are some imporant strategy elements like dirigibles, garrisons, and terrain types.  They each play a role in strategic operations and game economics.","September 20, 2014","true","113.7"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/recommended/308380/","flauxhawk","CTi flauxhawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauxhawk/","627 products in account","The tag line doesn't lie - this is a pretty hardcore turn-based tactical squad game. Troops utilize action points to perform all of their actions and have varying attributes which are reminiscent of old X-COM - strength, reaction, courage, accuracy, etc. The only difference is health which is uniformly 100 regardless of class. You don't distribute points upon soldier promotion - instead they are boosted automatically based on class. Each class does get specific class upgrade equipment such as specialty explosives, weapons, and so on. These must be researched in the strategic layer, one upgrade per turn. Each one costs a set amount of money. I haven't found too much to do in the strategic layer other than purchase more dirigibles and research upgrades.\n\nEssentially you assault a hex with enemies utilizing a dirigible transporting your squad. You'll need to outfit them prior which costs you cash. Equipment includes frag grenades, rifles, pistols, first aid kits plus specialty equipment previously mentioned. If you perform well you'll recoup your investment and then some after combat is finished. The tactical combat is slow and methodical. You select a stance for your soldier prior to movement - cautious is a crouch move which requires more AP per unit distance moved. Standard is regular movement and charge! is a sprint. You can specify whether to save AP for reaction fire as well. The stance selection is a bit annoying as once you've moved a soldier you can't change their stance. So once you move a soldier in standard stance, for example you can't have him crouch once he reaches a decent cover position. This doesn't make much sense tactically, though I can accept it for gameplay balance purposes. Crouching of course increases accuracy and decreases enemy hit chance. I assume charging carries an accuracy penalty. Typically your soldiers can take 1 hit, though if they get caught in the leg they might survive one more. Enemy 'hidden movement' can take an excrutiatingly long time and will likely test your patience, especially when the enemy squad is composed of only 9 soldiers. The tactical layer only provides bare bones information, for example if you spot an enemy you'll see the distance and whether you can fire. It doesn't provide hit chances at all. You can change soldier facing through the use of a button on the UI which allows you to click to change your facing. Trying to position your soldiers properly behind cover is an exercise in frustration though, as you click about trying to get them positioned properly. Enemy soldiers have always had reaction shots on my movement while my soldiers appear to stand about watching lazily, even when the have enough AP to fire and the enemy is in plain view. Frustrating.\n\nWith the realism mod enabled the terrain graphics are sufficiently attractive in the tactical layer though hardly amazing. The images on the store page are exactly what you should expect. Animations are stiff and unattractive but passable.\n\nI recommend this game but only to hardcore fans of turn-based squad tactics. It requires an extreme amount of patience and fortitude to enjoy considering the wonky movement system, tactical stance limitations and 'what the heck' moments.\n\nEdit: Please disregard Steam hours. I had originally purchased through Gamersgate and played fairly extensively before activating here.","January 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

If your not familiar it's progressive turn-based, 3D combat with real time interrupts.  Airship Dragoon is more hard core (read: punishing) than Valkyria by a long shot though.  Highly fun in the early to mid stages,\nHas balance problems in the later phases specifically, everyone starts lugging around massive explosive weapons and the tactics combat becomes more reminiscent of "Artillery".  There are a few other problems with the game, such as the A.I. almost infinite capacity and willingness to engage in hopeless but time consuming defensive operations, and small touches like being unable to set default equipment configurations, despite the fact that you almost always go with a standard loadout for each class (based on current available tech).  That said there are ALOT of good things about this game and it's probably the most fun you will have with a game which you are unlikely to finish.","May 29, 2015","true","138.4"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

Granted it is far from the best game out there but you can tell it was made "with love" as they say.\n\nI'll start this off by saying this game could do with some more work, although this might be a little harsh, it simply did not feel like a completed game; the campaign map is overly simple, the soundtrack gets repetitive (and so I decided to turn it off and add my own background through playlists), the information on the campaign map and how everything functions is a little hard to figure out and finally but most of all, the AI seems a little "simple". It was not overly hard to defeat, I had to figure out the mechanics more than outwit my opponent.\n\nNow with all that said I still think this is worth picking up. Though a little on the pricy end, the game is fun and slightly nostalgic in it's take but very enjoyable. The tatical combat is nice, the setting is too and the overall idea and execution are very good! I would consider this a potential diamond though very rough indeed and am very interested in what this game could become.\n\nP.S Steve (I think it's your name) Yorkshire, if you could add a comments section to your website I think it might be useful since people who, like me, are fond of this game and would like to see it grow, could maybe give you points we think could be improved.

Unit models and graphics are okay (~N64 era quality). There is no tutorial, only instructions pages to read through.\n\nThere are a few hotkeys, but it's largely a mouse-driven game. I would've liked to be able to do orders (like move) through hotkeys instead of having to click the button every time.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there is no free camera, so you can't keep a traditional overhead view. The camera always resets to behind the unit when you move, which is annoying because I prefer an overhead camera that looks over all the action (and lets you see the big picture). It also means it's easy to get confused when switching between units if you have them moving through different areas at once. I gave up trying to move tactially with small groups (because I had to reorient myself every unit switch) and ended up doing a big groups of death for expediency's sake. It's easier if you group units by unit order (so the camera switch won't be as bad). Even so, I still made it a habit to check the map for every unit to make sure I sent it the right way.\n\nYour move orders are cancelled if you switch units, which means you're forced to watch your unit move all the way to its destination. That feels like an unnecessary slow down of gameplay and a waste of time when you have to command up to 15 units each turn.\n\nAs a side note, pathfinding is non-existant (you click to move and it takes the straight line towards that point) and you can't queue up moves for future turns. However, it's nice that you can reserve AP for passive fire. There is a map for tactical battles but it's very barebones and you can't see structures/obstacles. If your unit seemingly randomly stops movement, it's probably because a new enemy target was spotted. The target info shows distance to target (so lower is better), not % chance to hit.\n\nThere are a lot of little things going on that it would have been nice to have a complete tooltip system. It would have also been nice to be able to create equipment presets that you could use on units (instead of setting equipment manually) and deployment presets.\n\nIf you're really into tactics games and steampunk, this might be worth a look. However, I personally can't overlook its flaws. I think someone could get into this game and learn its intricacies, but I don't enjoy fighting the camera/UI.","July 11, 2015","false","5.5"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","4"

This game is NOT for everyone. Only the most hardcore lovers of turn based strat games need apply.\n\nThis game is pretty baller if you ask me. Sure, it could be expediated a little bit - and the first two turns of moving everyone in place does get pretty tedious. HOWEVER. Someone mentioned something along the lines of 99% of war is boredom, and 1% is terrifying.\n\nYeah. That's true. It's 'boring' if you don't think. Because the enemy IS out there. And he's waiting to take your life. There's sappers with mines, there's (in the later researches) friggen lazer rifles - one shot rail guns that shoot through mountain sides and straight through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED CASTLES. Artillery Barrages (Which makes one think the Ships' gunners are all Imperial Stormtroopers.)\n\nI thought Xcom was a deadly unforgiving game. Then I played Xenonauts. And I thought 'Yeah, nothing could be more cruel to my random red shirts than Xenonauts.' Sometimes, You have really good games - hold 15 invading ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from the damned Zulu Nation off with only 7 brave warriors. And other times.. You bring 10 guys to route out 3. And lose  Two to mines, One to a death laser which causes the other two to freeze in place and die next turn, two more flee but the last three manage to somehow bring victory to you by sacrificing your last conscript in a brave attempt to draw the enemy's fire so your gunner and grenadier can kick his ♥♥♥ and LITERALLY take his stuff.\n\nYes. The graphics are Meh. The gameplay is slow (bring a book, or play turns in between commercial breaks of a tv show) And the mechanics are hard to understand at times. But it's probably been one of the more rewarding games I've played in a while. The challenge is there. It's not impossible or stacked against the player - but it IS a challenge.\n\nBut there is one thing you ought to remember. It was just one guy who developed this. So cut him a little bit of slack.\n\nWith that said, I love it. 10/10 would get sniped through a hillside again.","April 28","true","108.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Many who dislike this game don't enjoy it for what it is. It's hard but in a fun way, like dark souls it's all about the challenge. You can have some very cool epic tactically driven moments, ones where you are pinned down my machine gun or mortar fire and need one of your squads to flank the enemy position, or where you need to run in a medic to save a teammate before he bleeds out and need to cover him with supporting fire.

Players take control of one of six factions and fight for control of Pangea.\n\nI really didn’t think I would like this game. Most of the reviews, and even the description, say it’s for hard-core wargamers only. And there are lots of comments about bad UI. Not being a wargamer, much less a hard-core one, I wasn’t enthusiastic about this game until I played it. AD is really fun, though the UI is troublesome. The UI isn’t confusing per se, there’s just a lot of options. Before going into battle, you have to recruit soldiers then equip their gear. When on the battlefield, you need to press the move button to move units and the shoot button to fire at enemies. This takes some getting used to.\n\nEach battle is basically a capture the flag scenario. You can place up to ten units on the field and maneuver them through the various structures. The goal is to capture the enemies flag while protecting your own, but I’ve yet to win without eliminating the opposition. This can be difficult because the weapon accuracy is ridiculously low.\n\nOne of the interesting mechanics is morale. Each unit has morale and as units die or are fired upon their morale drops. If their morale drops too low, then they can freeze up, run away, or even go nuts. When units go nuts they fire wildly at the enemy. Sometimes this results in enemy deaths. Either way, the announcement that someone has ‘lost it and gone nuts’ was always hilarious.\n\nI’ll admit I’m still not sure what I’m doing most of the time, and I don’t take the game too seriously. But I’ve enjoyed every minute of this game, even when I’m losing. That’s unusual. This is definitely a niche game, though, and isn’t for everyone. While this isn’t typically my kind of game, I will be playing more of it.\n\nVerdict: Get it on sale. It’s worth trying, but it has a limited audience and a high price.","March 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
