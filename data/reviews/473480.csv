As Miko, you strive to "steal" diamonds from an evil mega-corp (of course), becuase you can, and female moles are renowned for their love of shiny stones. Probably.\n\nDespite not having any real USP, what Miko does, it does very well. Equipped with a rotor a lá Inspector Gadget, you can fly, dig and walk through each level, accumulating the required amount of diamonds to proceed to the next. Miko has 6 worlds, and each world has 40 levels. (That's 240 by the way. It's a lot). As each level goes by, the difficulty increases, and with each new world comes new enemies, puzzle mechanisms and abilities to ensure a continued challenge and freshness.\n\nIn terms of Steamworks, Miko offers trading cards, and a clever achievment collection that challenges users to achieve a specific target on specific levels, as well as the usual achievement for completing each level with 3/3 stars. Miko also offers full controller support.\n\nAt €4.99, Miko represents very good value, with a lot of content and replayability. It's easy to pick up, and will be popular with all ages.\n\nMiko Mole is another Steam release from Ensenasoft, a Mexican studio with a strong catalogue of mobile titles. Miko Mole is also available on PS4.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

The fact that the level starts before the camera finishes zooming on Miko caused a few deaths, and the fact that it's in 3D rather then 2D makes some of the physics less predictable then its ancestor, but on the whole these don't really mess with the general feel. Also given the small price tag, I think it's not trying to reinvent the wheel too much.\nMiko's little helicopter pack thing also makes the gravity of the Boulderdash genre a little more visually logical for me.","May 30","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We need to hurry if we want to get a 3 stars rating at the final of level, and it gets more challenging and fun because we have a lot of traps,surprises and much more things that can kill us. The game has a large amount of levels and it's really small in size. The game is also cheap and features Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.\n-----------------------------------\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nFun and Challenging Gameplay.\nCheap.\nHuge Amount of Levels.\nReally small in size.\n\nCons:\nThe music keeps looping,but's ok.\n-----------------------------------\n\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nChallenging and Fun Puzzles,Huge amount of levels, and a game to play with the family! What can go wrong here? Absolutely Nothing.\nRecommended Purchase!","June 2","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
