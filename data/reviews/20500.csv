It's like a GTA-lite where you can drive THROUGH buildings. Or walk through them in a huge industrial mech. Or plant lots of explosive charges, detonate them and watch the whole thing collapse. Or just bring it down manually with a hammer :)\n\nWith the recent updates (still open beta, but working flawlessly) the game was massively optimized, running at full 60fps without much trouble. It also ditched GFWL, and the developers even included a savegame migration tool to transfer your old GFWL save to Steam Cloud.\n\nFinally, we get the definite version of this game- one that shows how it was meant to look, feel and be played.","November 4, 2014","true","6.9"," 414 of 435 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","414","435","7","0"

A round of applause is in order for Nordic Games for reviving this wonderful game. Now, on with the review.\n\nRed Faction: Guerrilla is an insanely fun game, let's get that out of the way right now. The open world nature combined with the destructable nature of almost every structure in the game makes for one of the most enjoyable, destructive romps you'll ever have in a game. While you play through the story mode you'll have a wealth of options for how to deal with objectives, many of which involve the destruction of key buildings. Perhaps you'd like to get up close and personal with your hammer, maybe you'd rather hop in a truck and send it flying through the side of a building or you might just hail it with rockets from afar, all of which are perfectly viable options.\n\nEven if you don't wish to go through the campaign it's likely you'll find enjoyment in one of the two other gametypes:\n\nWrecking Crew - A Solo or Local co-op gamemode with leaderboard integration where you seek to do as much damage to the buildings in a give map with different caveats depending on the mode which are:\nTotal Chaos - Doing as much damge as possible in one minute with unlimited ammo.\nBehemoth - Using one of three Walker (mech) types to do as much damage as possible in a limited time.\nChallange - Completing level-specific challanges.\nEscalation - You have a limited amount of time and ammo, each round both increase.\nBarrel Dash - Destroying as many explosive barrels as you can within the time limit.\nRampage - Deal as much damage as possible with a three minute timelimit, each shot or swing of your weapon takes a set amount of time away.\nInternet Game - Go head-to-head with other players in a variet of gamemodes, such as:\nAnarchy / Team Anarchy - Your basic Deathmatch mode.\nBagman / Team Bagman - Hold the bag and gain points.\nCapture the flag - Exactly what it says on the tin.\nSiege - Defend / Attack gamemode where the key is to destroy specific structures.\nDamage Control - Fight to capture the three points.\nDemolition - Protect the Destroyer, the only person who can damage buildings as they go around and destroy as much as they can.\nTL:DR -\nThe Pros\nNew Direct X11 support, improved stability, better experience over all thanks to Nordic.\nNew steamwork intergration, including Matchmaking and achievements.\nStrong openworld campaign with plenty to keep you busy.\nA host of other activities beyond the campaign that provide many hours of fun.\nYou can load up a truck with remote mines, send it flying into the side of a building and then detonate it. Awesome.\nThe Cons\nKnown technical issues, check the forums and such to see if it'll have any issues with your setup. Many of these are being fixed by Nordic currently, it would seem. Still, it's good to make sure.\nWhile the campaign is fun and story is perfectly acceptable, anyone looking for a great narrative might find it lacking.","November 17, 2014","true","143.6"," 223 of 232 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","223","232","12","2"

And I mean everything. There are literally like two buildings in the entire map that you can't blow up, and it's only because they're integral to the plot or a mission element. Everything else is at your mercy. You can decide, at absolutely any time in the game, to punch a hole in the nearest wall with a supercharged sledgehammer. And I think that's really the essence of RF:G. You have absolute and complete freedom with the environment you're put in.\nIt's a true sandbox; there is nothing you can't put a few explosives on and demolish when the mood takes you. It's never the case such as in other games, where there's occasional missions to sabotage things and the rest of the time it's like "LOLNOPE, THIS WOODEN SHACK IS INDESTRUCTABLE, RAM AS MANY CARS INTO IT AS YOU WANT LOLOLOLOLOLOLO" It's never that.\n\nThe game never cuts you off with the mission focus, either. The entirety of Red Faction Guerrilla is built around the mechanic of destructable environments. What do you do in missions? You sabotage enemy bases, or demolish buildings to cover the Faction's tracks, or ram a car into this, or fire a thermobaric rocket at this big hydrogen tank thing. How do you unlock new missions? You smash the f*ck out of enemy bases to lower enemy control over the sector, and raise morale. And with the variety of it all, and the many methods of nuking an EDF outpost, and being able to dismantle every single piece of a checkpoint until nothing is left; it's just intoxicating.\nNot to mention: THERE ARE CHEATS. You can be an invincible super-badass and propel cars with melee attacks into buildings and run super fast and and and---\n\nEven in the moments where you're not giving Martian architects the finger, the game remains solid, and combat is enjoyable and challenging. It's never a case of running in like Superman and obliterating an entire army with your bare fists; you have to find yourself some cover and demolish the enemy's; choose the right weapons for the right situations, and be accurate. Ammo conservation is a big part of fighting EDF soldiers, so spraying plasma bullets everywhere isn't going to earn you victory. Story's pretty nice, too, but it's more just to support the gameplay; the main attraction is the explosions and destruction.\n\nTL;DR: Breaking things is fun. This game is all about breaking things, so this game is fun, and you should buy it.","October 16, 2015","true","244.6"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","95","114","120","30","0"

Just make an offline account using the GFWL menu that pops up at the beginning of the loading screen. Yes, multiplayer is not possible this way, but you can still enjoy the single player campaign. If you make an offline account once, this offline account is usable across all GFWL games, and all saves will then be local.

OK, this game has flaws;  The AI isn't bad but also nothing special, the behavior coding is pretty poorly done with followers walking in front of you while you are aiming and firing as well as running in front of your vehicles while you try to make getaways, and the game can get slightly repetitive.  HOWEVER, as Craig put it, Red Faction Guerilla is truly masterful at destruction.  The first true "Next Generation" feeling of awe I felt was from this game when I destroyed my first structure.  After I finished with it, I watched as it groaned while trying to support itself under its own weight then eventually crumbled beautifully into a glorious pile of scrap.  I don't think I have ever felt as truly satisfied than when I "stuck it to the man" in teh form of a giant mining truck plowing through military controlled compounds, watching architecture collapse all arounds me as I literally drove into then out of large structures.  If you have the capacity to be moderately creative, and teh rig to handle that "creativity" (I would recommend 512+ VRAM, though you can run this game at 256 on lowest, at least I had to for a while) then, as someone who has actually logged a respectable amount of playtime, I cannot describe this game in any other way than a "work of art."  I would say it's easily worth 20$, a steal if you get it under, like I did...","December 5, 2013","true","101.8"," 110 of 118 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","110","118","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/20500/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","GTA on Mars? Well, it may be a little too far-fetched, but it still is true. You have this HUGE map with tons of missions and tons of DESTRUCTIBLE buildings. And the game wants you to cause mayhem and destruction. No mission can be completed without wreaking havoc!\n\nThe story is mediocre at best: you play a guy called Mason whose brother has just died. He takes up his role working for the guerrilla, a rebellious group that aims to rid Mars of the oppressive government called EDF. There are some nice cutscenes telling the story but the 20 main missions are not sufficient to make it a great story.\n\nOn the other hand: Who cares? The story is just an excuse to destroy everything in your path. As you make progress further areas open up in front of you with the same goal: you must liberate them. Every sector has a morale meter that increases as you complete missions. Higher morale means more assistance from guerrilla members while fighting. Main missions that advance the story can be accessed, too, with the exception of the last one. This particular mission to liberate the sector requires you to decrease enemy morale. Naturally, helping the rebels causes the bad guys lose morale.\n\nDo you like collectibles in games? Well, Red Faction has destructibles. You can prove your worth by looking for high value EDF buildings, piles of ore, propaganda signs and practically anything else that belongs to Mars' evil faction. Side missions are also many and varied as one would expect: you can catch couriers, protect allied areas, take vehicles to safe locations or - and this is my favourite - ride shotgun with Jenkins. The guy drives but you are manning the gun: just shoot at everything that belongs to EDF - buildings, vehicles and anything that increases the counter on the upper right-hand side of the screen telling you how much damage you have caused. Once you have reached 1 billion credits another achievement pops up.\n\nI like how varied the environment is. You would think the entire game swims in brownish-reddish colours. No! New sectors have a newer, more different look. Oasis has green areas with fewer but bigger buildings telling you this is where the upper class of Mars lives. The Badlands have a more evil look with the presence of the mysterious marauders - you can clearly see this is an homage to Mad Max!\n\nA good way to encourage the player to cause destruction is the currency introduced: every collapsed building leaves scrap metal. These shiny, light blue pieces of salvage can then be used to buy newer weapons or upgrade the existing ones.\n\nI understand the Steam Edition of the game has a lot of new features. This is certainly a plus - I played this well after it finally ditched the awful GFWL service. It is a good thing that more and more games do the same!\n\nTo summarise: Red Faction is a game about destruction. There's nothing more satisfying than leaving the office after a long and hard day and using Mason's sledgehammer to off some Martian bad guys or to destroy a tower. And if you truly want to destroy everything dozens of hours of fun is guaranteed!","April 19, 2015","true","15.4"," 86 of 94 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","86","94","7","4"

Its double R and double L I know but no. No full name. Anyways back to the history, RF:G was originally released with Games With Windows Live integrated. That means no cheats, lots of issues regarding login and etc etc and we have tons of weird graphical problem that made this game not very well known. Thankfully the Steam port has been optimized and there is no more GFWL. Thank god. My pc went from 20fps to 60 stable fps.\n\nGame Info Name: Red Faction : Guerrilla\nDeveloper: A lot of people, this game has been brought out by Nordic Games after the fall of THQ. RIP.\nGenre: Smasing, Action, Open World, Guerrilla Warfare\nPersonal Thoughts: Good game although there are parts that they did right and parts that they did wrong.\n\nWhat is Red Faction: Guerrilla? A game about a guy who lost his brother and so join a rebel insurgency fighting back against the military. ON MARS! That means super wonky vehicle, unrealistic weapons and building that crumbles at the drop of a hat. Everything you see saved for some things are completely destructible using the force of vehicle, hammer and explosive! But dear god the story is wonky even though it make sense like the Dev tried stretching a lump dough too thinly trying to cover the whole baking table with it. But well at least the game is fun enough to cover that slight defect.\n\nSound\nMain character grunts a lot, gun doesn't pack any power in them although we can excuse it by saying in the future recoil proofing technology has improved. The most powerful anti infantry still sounds like the usual sci fi pew pew pew. Hardly any music in this game but one good thing is at least vehicle grunt properly instead of purring like a cat.\n\nGraphic\nEverything look so brown especially the first and third area. Especially the first area because when you exit the town you will see that there is literally a change in the overall saturation of the game. Also I have to state that I used the DX9 backend instead of the DX11 because it still runs badly on my computer merely just to add more reflection and glaring elements.\n\nGameplay\nFun game, you have a hammer from early on that can be used to smash buildings to pieces which is useful since every single building in the game is smashable and since it follows the laws of physics it is completely pointless to destroy the top part of the building since destroying the bottom part will quickly bring it down.\n\nWhy destroying building you ask? For money to get salvages duh. Salvages used to upgrade the Main Character from a big man with a hammer to a big man with a hammer and 20 kilos of metal strapped to him with a full blow rocket launcher on his back and an exotic martian weapon by his side.\n\nThe main game of RF:G has you filling a meter and emptying out a meter. The filling one is the morale meter where killing military unit quickly, destroying propaganda and helping out the rebel will fill it. This serves mainly to get more money when doing story mission and for receiving backup which you will seriously need later on. At maximum rate you will get 4 people fighting by your side.\n\nThe other meter is military control meter where you need to make it zero to unlock story mission and I can't confirm if making zero affects the military hardware they throw at you. Maybe not because I still get tanks and humvee trying to ram me even when the bar is full. You make it go down by destroying military stuff.\n\nThere are side activities that helps you with lowering those bar as well and they are generally pretty fun mayhem filled things to do that ranges from assaulting base, drive by mission and explosive mission. Generally fun enough. Good thing the story mission is as good as the side mission! Because the story is weak.\n\nEDIT: Forgot Vehicle\nVehicle are so tough even your basic buggy can break through concrete wall, lets not even talk about the APC that can smash straight through a building clean. Although they do handle terribly and tend to float all over the place if you hit a bump they're good enough I guess. Also you can change the orientation of your vehicle while in midair so pretty much you can with a bit of practice land perfectly fine on the ground.\n\nAnd that's pretty much for the gameplay, there's stuff to collect, people to rescue and the usual fanfare of open world stuff although some upgrades are evil enough locked behind doing side missions! So go complete them otherwise you won't get some of the gear.\n\nSPECIAL SECTION\nTHE STORY!\nPretty much does not suck but is jarring as hell. You see character usually make one appearances then were gone just like that.\n\nConclusion Yeah it's a fun game where you really are being a Guerrilla Fighter against a military forces. And you do get a lot of toys to play with. Well destroying building never gets old I guess but the story really rubs me the wrong way. Anyways lets wrap this up. RF:G a fun game from a publisher that is legendary in the industries but is no more. Buy this game now that it has steam support.\n\nTips\nLate game weapons are game breaking,\nAlways be on the run.\nJust climb on top of that humvee and smash his face in with the hammer. No need to waste ammo shooting the gunner.\nAlways when faced with demolition mission or assault mission use APC to smash through building, Usually they can go right through it.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: A-Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Each sector has its own unique setting and look to it. The developers made good use of color hues to really differentiate the different areas.\n\n+ The sense of destruction in the game is some of the best I've seen in a game to date with very few games matching it. Just about everything that is seen in the game can be destroyed with your sledgehammer, blown up with explosive or shot with rockets. Seeing large buildings crumbling down with debris flying everywhere is very satisfying.\n\n+ Variety of weapons that fit your play style\n\n+ Side missions are varied and provide a nice change of pace from the main game. 2 of the main side missions is destruction and transportation. In destruction you have to destroy a building given limited weapons and time. In transportation you have to drive a vehicle to a destination within a time limit.\n\n+ As you destroy enemy buildings and complete side/main missions you raise morale allowing more AI to fight alongside with you and gain more ammo from crates. Although it doesn't make the biggest difference in the world it is a nice system given the context of the story.\n\n+ The game comes with bonus single player DLC which extends the game\n\n+ In addition to single player, Wrecking Crew mode allows you to play a different levels with a variety of different options either by yourself or with others to try and get a high score. A fun, optional mode that extends your playtime.\n\n+ Removed games for windows live\n\nThe Average:\n\nI found the main missions to be pretty average. Most main missions have you going to a certain location and blowing everything up. I would have liked to see more variety among them.\nBecause of the lack of variety in main missions, sometimes the game can feel a bit repetitive.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Like past Red Faction games the story and characters are forgettable and one dimensional. The story serves as an excuse to blow things up and nothing more. A lot of wasted potential here which is sad given some of the cool locations.\n\n- I hear multiplayer is fun, too bad the community is gone.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a good mindless fun game that reminded me of Just Cause 2. You go around blowing things up and watch the destruction unfold as you fight wave of enemies attacking you. I am fairly new to this series only having beaten the other two games a few months ago. This is a very interesting series. Red Faction started out as a linear first person shooter, then it became a level based shooter with bosses and then it became a third person open world game. If you love blowing things up then look no further than this game.\n","August 4, 2015","true","32.9"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","0"

The really interesting thing about this game is that you are essentially a terrorist fighting the powers that be: the EDF. I, at least, would constantly go around with bombs strapped to my vehicle with a specific target in mind. Success wasn't surviving the attack; it was destroying the target. Even on medium difficulty, when the EDF came in force, it is very hard to survive long. I would have liked this game to be a conversation on terrorism and guerrilla warfare for a good, but extreme, cause. The ambivalence of destroying a civilian structure that probably-- but not certainly-- was a base of operations for the enemy would have been wonderful, and would have made this into a great game. Instead it is a ham-fisted, "the EDF are killing innocent civilians, they are evil tyrants, you must stop them" kind of a deal.\n\nAnyway, this open-world, physics-based third person shooter is a fun diversion and it's worth the twenty dollars they're asking. And, yes, seeing that building stand for a split second after most of its supports have been destroyed, then seeing crumble absolutely is one of the most satisfying experiences in video games.","March 9, 2015","true","13.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","38","41","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/recommended/20500/","tedizslayer","Insano-Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/","166 products in account","A technical masterpiece with few equals. Red Faction: Guerrilla accomplishes something very few games have ever tried, much less achieved with real success; dynamic destruction with full physics and few - if any - slowdowns accompanying them. While the game is not perfect and even its destruction system can be finicky at times, Guerrilla is a game that I wish had inspired other developers to follow suit.\n\nThe centerpiece of the experience is the Geo-Mod component of the game that handles dynamic building destruction. From my experience, little comes close to the level of optimization, stability, and overall fidelity that Geo-Mod enables for Red Faction. Practically every building in the game can be demolished in a maddening variety of ways. Strategically knock out primary supports and let the roof cave in, demolish a wall and watch the building topple sideways, or just ram a tank or a few demolitions charges in the front door and let the chaos unfold. Even with hundreds of individual pieces of a structure smashing to the ground and causing even more death or destruction in their descent, the game runs butter-smooth in all but the most catastrophic of collapses.\n\nIt isn't just Geo-Mod alone that makes the building destruction fantastic, but how the game is set up. From the beginning, Guerrilla understands that demolishing buildings is a core element of the game and incorporates it into everything from sandbox shootouts to evasion missions. Stuck in a corner with bad cover or no ammo? Whip out your sledgehammer and knock a hole in the wall that's got you trapped. Taking fire from a difficult target on a balcony? Chuck a demo charge onto the bottom and bring the floor out from underneath him. Horde of APCs charging over a bridge? Blast a hole in their path and watch them tear apart the bridge's supports on the way down.\n\nUnfortunately, all games pay for quality in some area or another. Guerrilla suffers in several. While its shortcomings rarely fall below a professional grade of quality, Guerrilla struggles notably in its writing and offers a fairly light, two-dimensional plot with an antagonist that's almost on par with zombies in lack of characterization and absurdity. Characters on both sides of the firing line aren't developed beyond their basic introductions and the conclusion of the story itself is predictable, at best. The game's wonderful soundtrack almost feels like wasted potential as a result.\n\nCombat, graphics, and post-story sandbox activities are smaller failings, but are thankfully not quite as mediocre as the game's story. Gunfighting suffers from enemies lacking satisfying hit feedback and a reliance on weight of numbers and spongy health instead of engaging or varied behavior. The player's arsenal likewise suffers from severe maximum ammunition limits, forcing many weapon switches or battlefield pick-ups to stay competitive. Interplay with the game's destructive environment, good player mobility, and a wealth of available weapons shore up the otherwise forgettable combat, but only enough to keep it from being a chore.\n\nGraphically, the game isn't quite up to snuff, but this is understandable given its sandbox nature and physics-heavy environment. Textures are low resolution, models often lack in style or quality, and animations are mixed bag of stiff movement "compensated" by high playback speed. Lighting is often strange inside buildings and the game's low texture resolution is regularly given its own "compensation" with aggressive tiling where applicable. Fortunately, the Geo-Mod system is again of note; its effects, sounds, and behavior make for a stunning experience watching buildings collapse.\n\nOverall, while not as well-rounded as it could have been, Guerrilla is an applaudable, enjoyable game that baffles me for all the right reasons; why has no one followed it up, copied it, or took after its lead with its sandbox destruction? Why does a 2009 game have better physics than many games that came much later afterwards? How the Hell does this thing run so smoothly? Finally, why haven't you bought this game yet?","December 22, 2015","true","45.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

No other game has come even close to be this good.\nYou can break buildings bit by bit with sledgehammer, explosives and a disintegrative gun (just like Marvin the martian). The destructions feels nice and works perfectly well. The physics are adjusted to a level where it feels realistic without compromising the gameplay.\nWatch the first teaser on this steam page. Do it.\n\nAnd for some kind of witchcraft this game runs smoothly even on my old as hell computer. There's all those particles and stuff flying on the screen, bits of buildings and people exploding everywhere and for some reason I still have a stable fps and 10/10 graphics.\nThis game is optimized as heck. The guy who coded all that stuff deserves a medal.\nOr maybe two medals.\n♥♥♥♥, just give him a bunch of medals and a beer. He deserves it.\n\nI guess I should say some cons too.\nWell, the AI sucks. Nothing game breaking but most of the time the NPCs will do weird stuff like running in circles, driving off cliffs for no reason and standing in front of you when you're trying to shoot something. But people would do that in real life too, so I guess I can't blame those silly NPCs. (still a better AI than Skyrim, though).\nAlso, everytime you start the game you're on one of those save points instead of just respawning where you saved the game. That's really annoying.\nThe game also uses GFWL, but it'll be fixed in some time.\nAnd that's it.\nDefinitely worth the full price.","January 23, 2014","true","28.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

After you blow up some buildings, you often also have to do a "guerrilla action" or two. Those range from rescuing people from their own houses, helping a redneck guy blow up some more buildings, helping a bunch of random people blow up even more buildings, and keeping the EDF from blowing up your own buildings.

I normally am not one that always plays shooters constantly so this game gave me a change of pace with a great level of difficulty from the very start.  The whole purpose of the game is to try to take over control points to stop this evil organization that has killed many people. In order to take control of these sections of the game you will have to bring down small and then large heavily fortified buildings.\n\nThere is little to hardly no cover system so often you may need  to shoot small packs of enemies and then retreat for a bit to get your health meter back up which automatically regenerates and then head right back over that way to finish your mission.  There is a wide variety between the tpes of vehicles you can hop in to remain safe from the opposing faction. The first consists of your normal vehicles you can only drive and have no weapon attachments. You can generally hop in any vehicle even if a civilian or the military organization your taking down is in it. Sometimes this will require you to shoot  them off the turrent based military vehicles so then you can invade control points easier.\n\nIn my own opinion wrecking crew mode is the greatest feature of all because it has no story and you just follow short  objectives like blowing up barrels to demolish buildings, using walkers to just obliterate everything standing in your way in what is known as Total chaos mode which is just a free-for-all destroy type of mode within wrecking crew.\n\nMy favorite part about this game is the use of Walkers to demolish control points if you are lucky enough to find one. There are usually a few different types but only one that has missles which is something similar to something that would be seen in a Armored core game or even generally comparable to a Star Wars AT-AT walker though smaller.\n\nI'll give this game a solid 8.5/10.  I highly recommend you check it out. It is made by THQ which was a company that went bankrupt eventually after having games only targeting family friendly kids games, movies games and then they created fully Muture games which was primarily targeted towards adults though that did not help their downfall as a company.\n\nAll in all the destructible environments reminded me of some videos I have seen where people play the Battlefield Shooter series.","March 14, 2015","true","14.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The environment always feels alive, the wind blows dust across your path and howls gently, the EDF are always carrying out patrol routes and intimidating civilians, then we have the safe houses where your fellow faction members are deep in conversation and planning their next moves. There are various sectors to explore, each with their own distinct look and feel. You will start your journey in a quieter and more open desert area, then move to a rocky wasteland, and venture across more urban and densely populated areas.\nEnvironmental design has also been taken into consideration, there are some vast open areas but all of the sectors are connected well and just as easy to navigate. In-game character models are well crafted and animations perform competently as the gameplay pushes the boundaries of pure carnage. The soundtrack deserves praise as it matches the ambient nature of Mars.\nThe story missions revolve around helping the Red Faction overthrow the EDF and liberate each sector; once a sector is free of EDF control then no enemy forces will bother you in that zone. A lot of the time you are outnumbered and it isn't always easy to take out specific targets. The A.l. for your guerrilla allies can be really clumsy at times, some missions require you to free captured guerrilla fighters and get them to safety. For some reason, sometimes they don’t wish to get in a getaway car with you and end up fending off enemy forces at their own demise. Perhaps it would have helped having some greater control over freedom fighters.\n","December 24, 2015","true","28.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Soon after your arrival, you get involved in a guerilla war against the oppressing force - Earth Defense Force. Your mission is to weaken EDF's control over different regions by destroying key buildings and completing optional tasks. Once you lower the control over a region, 3-4 story missions unlock for every region, so there is a little grinding involved for progression. Bring EDF's control to 0 in a region and you can take it over.\n\nThe gameplay is focused on destruction, as it should be because this game uses a very nice physics engine. There are a lot of tools to blow things up: items in the environment, mines, placeable detonators, rocket launcher, etc. You even get rewarded with scrap (game currency) for bringing down structures and making stuff go boom. There are also regular guns such as a pistol and assault riffle, but these are less fun to use. Later in the game you will have access to better guns and gadgets, but you will need a big amount of scrap if you want to unlock everything. My favourite combination was sniping with the nano-rifle from mid-air (using jetpack).\n\nI didn't play Red Faction Guerilla in its original itteration, but from the information available it looks like the developers cared enough for the game to improve a lot and re-release it in a better state.\n\nIf you like open-world games such as Saints Row, Just Cause or Max Mad then it is a must-play. If not, I would still recommend to give this one a try. You will have a blast, I promise.","May 17","true","19.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If sandbox style, open world play is your thing, I thoroughly recommend Red Faction Guerrilla. While it's getting a bit long in the tooth these days, both visually and mechanically, it's still a great game for tooling about and destroying things.\n\nWhile this is one of my favourite sandbox games, my recommendation comes with a cople of caveats; mission checkpointing can be a little harsh at times, and the game really is mostly about choosing your own way of doing the missions you're given. There is a story, and there are many, many missions. But the true joy is in deciding how to approach a given challenge with all the tools the game provides, especially in terms of destructibility. And when you screw up, you're sent back to the beginning of a mission, so repetition is virtually inevitable. Therefore, if you like your game experiences more towards the curated end of the spectrum, I can't extend this recommendation to you. This is very much a game that lets to find your own fun in a science fiction world, but helps that along by providing tools of sheer destructive joy.","December 2, 2014","true","28.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","8"

Its just as much fun to jump inside a mech (think power loader from Aliens) and run through buildings, vehicles and enemies.\n\nIt also features multiplayer which can be good at times. Its the frantic madness that makes it fun rather than the tactical shooting. There is also a mode where you try to beat others scores by causing as much destruction as possible in a given time limit.\n\nThis is a very fun game that you could easy sink hours into just blowing things up and watching the pieces fly.\n\n8/10 .

And carnage. And blowing some more stuff up. I lost count of how many times I just went on rampages throughout the various sectors, trying to destroy key strategic places while having the EDF on my ♥♥♥ trying to stop me. The fully destructible environments and buildings just give you such an amazing sense of freedom and endless shortcut potential. Combine that with the possibility of driving overpowered mechs and tanks, and you've got a really fun game to just mess about.\n\nIt is also open world, so there's plenty of side missions here and there, and unmarked collectibles, but this made me recall the first Assassin's Creed, and not in a good way. See, while there are several types of side missions, every time you visit a new sector, you just end up getting the same side missions anyway. You really just end up feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over again even when you're in a new zone, just like Assassin's Creed. There's a few dynamic ones that pop up when you might just be wandering around, but again, not a lot of variety.\n\nI absolutely love Colonial Mars. You don't see it depicted often, and it is that sweet blend of early colonization + open expanses of wilderness. The sectors themselves, of which there are quite a few, do have their own personality and flavor. The whole vibe it gave off really reminded me of driving the Mako in Mass Effect.\n\nThe plot itself is pretty standard really, usual insurgent rebels fighting evil empire with superior forces. There were a few plot twists here and there but I found most of it, including the story missions, rather underwhelming. Personally though, the freedom fighter premise is something that never really gets old for me, so I did enjoy it nevertheless.\n\nAll in all though, totally recommend this one. While it may not be thought provoking long after you've beaten it, you will remember the slaughter you've inflicted as your carefully planted bombs collapse that huge apartment block in one go, causing its floors to crash on the enemies' unsuspecting heads as you break a hole in a wall to cut a shortcut and make your escape.

Which is so well implemented I'm extremely surprised it was never really focused on in games since then. The game allows you to destroy literally every building in the game with it's revolutionary destruction mechanic. All the buildings are built with foundations, levels and fall apart due to the strain of gravity. So it takes a great deal of strategy inorder to destroy a building using as minimal resources as possible.\n\nIndeed much of the mission structure and sidequests in the game revolve entirely around the destruction mechanic. Add to that it has an engaging world to explore. Full of little niche references to the original while maintaining a totally different stylistic design. There are of course elements from other games like cars and firefights but it pales in comparison to the well incorporated destruction mechanic. Believe me, once you destroy your first building you will go on an odyssey to return Mars back to a desolate wasteland.\n\nThankfully RFG has had Games For Windows Live patched out. So now you can play it and it's multiplayer properly. I can't recommend this game enough.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=229985985","October 23, 2013","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenoPB/recommended/20500/","xenoPB","exno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenoPB/","154 products in account","EDIT: Recent update fixes most problems, definitely worth playing the game now.\n\nOK, kids gather round - it's time for a story. You'll like this story. I call it 'XenoPB's Wonderful Adventure with RF:G and GFWL.' It's an emotional story filled with ups and downs that teaches us that in life, ultimately the only one that wins is Gaben.\n\n\nXenoPB liked RF:G, in fact back when he played it on the PS3 he would have been tempted to list it in his top 10 favourite games. Xeno was really looking forward to getting the game on PC and being able to play at 1080p and 60fps. But alas there was one who stood in his path, one who would force Xeno to write an angry and negative review, one who went by the name of 'GFWL.'\n\nThe young lad, Xeno knew of GFWL, but was confident that he could triumph such a foe, so with this confidence he had in himself, he decided it was an excellent idea to purchase RF:G when Steam tempted him with an seductive 90% off sale. RF:G had now been added to Xeno's Steam Library. It looked happy and at home, nestled between Psychonauts and Red Orchestra 2  as it downloaded. After a short while, the download finished and RF:G quickly installed.\n\nRF:G booted up; the THQ logo appeared on screen, it soon faded away and was replaced my some more logos. The logos were closely followed by a loading screen and then, at long last, the main menu. Out of habit, Xeno immediately sped in the direction of the options menu and adjusted it to his needs. It was at this point his enthusiasm began to fade away. Xeno knew that in order to save his game, he would be required to log into GFWL. "No problem," he thought, confidently as he clicked on the large icon in the bottom left corner saying 'LIVE.' The 'LIVE' icon transported Xeno to what is commonly referred to as the 'GFWL login screen.' He thought back to GTA4 and how this same login screen had appeared then. It was at this point that Xeno entered his login details, while grunting in disgust at the very sight of GFWL. It worked; Xeno logged into GFWL. Now another screen had appeared. GFWL was asking for a product key for RF:G. With a quick tap of shift and tab, Xeno located his product key and entered it into the space allocated.\n\nThe end was in sight. Xeno gave a sigh of relief, confident that soon he would be able to play RF:G and save his progress after doing so. But it appeared that he was not destined to do so. GFWL looked in Xeno's direction and with an insultingly voiced "nope," GFWL displayed a third message to him: "Your Windows Live ID is locked. To check your Windows Live ID, go to http://account.live.com." Xeno collapsed to the floor, clutching his chest and gasping for breath. "No," he repeated, each one louder and angrier than the last. Slowly rising into his chair, determined to play RF:G, Xeno closed the game down and visited the accursed, 'http://account.live.com'.\n\nhttp://account.live.com looked at Xeno with a hostile gaze, one that said "You will not leave here alive." He was told to attempt to log in to GFWL. Xeno did as http://account.live.com commanded, he even typed out the distorted letters he saw in a small box, proving that he was in fact, a real person. http://account.live.com informed Xeno that he had entered the incorrect login details. Xeno protested. He was certain he was correct, he would bet anything on it! He was going to prove http://account.live.com wrong! Xeno entered the login details and typed out the letters a few times, each time being told he was incorrect. Too blinded by ignorance to simply change his password or something, Xeno decided that the best course of action in this case was to make a second account for GFWL, so that next time he would know the correct login details and be able to prove http://account.live.com wrong.\n\nIt took a few minutes for Xeno to make his new account. Now was the time to boot up RF:G for a second time and show GFWL who the true champion will be in the end. But once again, Xeno could not help but feel he was not destined to play RF:G. The THQ logo appeared on the monitor, RF:G was booting up. But there was a problem. THQ wasn't fading away like it usually did, it just stayed there, motionless. The game had crashed. After his first failed attempt, numerous times, Xeno attempted to launch RF:G again, but it crashed each time. His m8, bLuE, taunted him from their Steam Chat, finding Xeno's pain amusing somehow.\n\nAfter 15 or so attempts to launch the game without ever attempting to search online for a solution, due to Xeno being thick, RF:G finally caved in and allowed passage to the main menu. The 'LIVE' icon was still in the bottom left corner. It got clicked. The GFWL login screen appeared once again. Now an mlg pro at logging in to things, Xeno entered his login details and was once again asked for his product key. Xeno entered the product key a second time.  A different message appeared this time. It told Xeno that the product key he entered was already locked to his first GFWL account. Promptly, Xeno opened the Steam Chat with bLuE and typed "Fudge this."\n\nAfter being knocked down numerous times by his foe, Xeno accepted GFWL's terms and agreed to play RF:G in offline mode, without save files. The opening cutscene began to play, but armed with the knowledge from his first playthrough on console that the story was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible, Xeno wisely chose to skip it.\n\nNow he was in the game, at long last. Xeno was standing on a hill with his in-game brother and looking down on some sort of enclosed area. The textures on some objects were flickering violently, Xeno tried to ignore it, he wouldn't let such an issue stop him from destroying colossal structures with his magical wonder hammer. With a firm press of 'W,' Xeno instructed his character to walk down the hill, but even with GFWL conquered, he was not destined to play RF:G. Before the bottom of the hill was reached, RF:G crashed again.\n\nXeno's face was emotionless. His soul had been crushed. Out of only raw instinct, he opened up his Steam Chat with bLuE and once again proclaimed: "Fudge this."\n\nThe End","August 1, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","4"

Awesome!\n\nWhat's not so awesome is the characters, the music, the AI and the story...\n\nThe characters are easily forgettable and the story feels weak mainly because the good guys win only thanks to the main character (who's just some generic dude). The EDF aren't that hard to beat either (I played on Normal).The game also talks about some Marauders during the beginning, but they only appear twice in the story. Some interesting events happen throughout the story every now and then, thankfully.\n\nThe AI is dumb, but at least it's funny watching the enemies and allies do weird stuff sometimes. The music is there, but nothing really stands out. Everything sounds the same and it's usually hard to even hear the music, because of all the loud noises (fighting EDF, blowing up stuff, etc.)\n\nOne last big annoyance is the the ore crystals & the EDF crates. There are way too many crystals and crates and they are all too far away from each other. The rewards you get for destroying them are also negligible. 6-12 salvage per crystal and about as much per crate? That's it? If there were fewer of them, but rewarded more salvage (and maybe even stuff other than salvage, like unique weapons or temporary buffs, or discounts to certain upgrades) then maybe it would've been fun destroying them all.\n\nDespite its flaws it's a good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moipy/recommended/20500/","Moipy","Moip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moipy/","96 products in account","Red Faction Guerrilla is an open world sand box game with an interesting narrative and fantastic amounts of playability.\nOpen world games are certainly not my kind of game, however this game excels in the fact there is a linear, developing plot as you progress from story mission to story mission, without this, the game would have been a flop in my honest opinion.\n\nThe game didn't hook me at first, but the moment they put a gun in my hands, and I was fighting hordes of EDF soldiers, that's when I started to become hooked. The gun play feels refreshing, impactful and enjoyable. That and the fact that it isn't your stereotypical cover shooter... because the cover will just get blown up! It's great that for once, the best way to play is aggressively, it really helps make it refreshing.\n\nthe game heavily features driving segments, and they aren't F-zero GX quality driving segments either. This would hinder the game, but it actually helps a lot. It gives you time to immerse yourself into the game and the game world. Eventually you do get a fast transport system, which is fantastic, but you still need to drive to your destinations. This combined with the raid missions which have colonists hop in your vehicle, makes the driving all the more pleasant.\n\nAnd on the topic of colonists, this is where the game truly shines. You can sing praises on the destruction physics, but what really makes this game amazing in my eyes, is the Morale and NPC interactions. As you fight the EDF and complete objectives, more and more colonists will fight by your side. One particular cause of this, is the EDF assault missions, where EDF Armoured personal carriers and tanks drive into a colonist base, and you must fight them off. As your Morale increases, more and more of these NPC's fight by your side, it makes the world feel real, and helps really show that the mission your doing actually have weight behind them. The morale goes as far to change the dialog of the NPC's when you walk past them, which is truly the icing on the cake for me.\n\nThe games plot is nothing to write home about, but the game does a great job immersing yourself in the world at least, thanks to features like the Morale system, as described earlier.  The mission variety also helps a lot in keeping the game interesting. The Jenkins missions are a little bit boring by the end, as its basically a gallery turret segment, and timed driving segments would have been better if the driving itself was more enjoyable, but it is what it is. The two artillery segments towards the end where mediocre at best, but they weren't bad, I'm glad they were included just to spice things up a little right at the end, but I would have preferred to only have had that segment played once, and not twice.\n\nHowever, the expanding diversity of guns and upgrades, and the dynamic, highly entertaining Havok physics engine made this game a stellar experience. A fantastic game, definitely worth the time and effort (and of course the money) to play, you will (probably) not regret it!\n","December 7, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I tried it and played through the start and was immediately hooked and had to buy it even though I wanted to play other games first.\n\nI love games where you get to destroy your surroundings I always find them so much fun.\nAnd there are so very few games like that. The only other game I played that was sort of like that was Just Cause 2.\n\nI enjoy this game a lot. Blow up entire buildings, destroy everything around you with explosives, sledgehammer and even your vehicle, what more could you want?\n\nIt also has decent combat, and side missions that test your skills such as beating the time for demolitions master which you have various scenarios such as find the buildings weak spot, destroy it with 1 explosive and beat the pro time of 15 seconds, or destroy this building as quick as possible just using your sledgehammer as well as various others.\n\nThere's also transporter challenge of getting a vehicle somewhere as quick as possible. But I find those boring. I dislike vehicle controls so found it rather frustrating doing transporter missions.\nAnd some others as  such as raids, rescue etc.\n\nThe story and characters aren't much, but I don't mind as destroying everything is what the focus of the game is and I can't get enough of that. Once I start destroying I get so immersed and can't stop.\n\nI really like the futuristic look to some vehicles and buildings. The music is very good. Though the landscape looks rather bland and barren being mountainous and dusty, but I guess that's what you get with Mars.\nDid not have any problems or bugs with this game and like that the world feels very open and not boxed in\n\nIt's great that when morale is high guerilla's join you and help attack the enemy and they can be helpful when trying to destroy things they can draw the enemies focus so I can destroy things easier, but they also can be a hindrance and get in the way of explosions and hammer swings.\n\nThis is a great game for those who love destruction and I did not start to feel bored until after the 46 hour mark which is good.\n\nWhat I disliked most was that you get such a small amount of ammo, even with full upgrade.\n\n\nAwesome fun and a must play. Doesn't quite get an 8 as there is not much variety in what you do.\n\n7/10","August 25, 2015","true","77.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

That's the only reason to play RF: Guerilla.  It's not the story (which is reminiscent of Total "Get Your ♥♥♥ To Mars" Recall) that keeps you playing, it's certainly not the throw-away character development, and it's not even the Games For Windows Live.  It's taking a sledgehammer, clubbing a dude four feet into a Mars precipice, and collapsing a highrise apartment complex from the ground floor.  It's climbing into an industrial loader and walking through a military base like Stallone in Rocky IV, if buildings were Ivan Drago and face-punches were that robot butler.  Maybe that last analogy doesn't make sense...\n\nBottom line is- I fully recommend this game if you grew up watching "Aliens", Schwarzeneggar, or American Gladiator.  Again, maybe not that last one.  Like I said, it wasn't the story that kept me coming back, it wasn't the engine (not the prettiest game by a long shot), and it wasn't the basic game mechanics (driving is hopelessly, but somehow appropriately, floaty to the point of frustration; level design is a lot less open world than many similar games due to impassable mountain ranges; shooting mechanics are inaccurate at best)- it is literally the joy of melting a memorial bridge with a nanite rifle before exploding the rest using remote charges and a saw-blade launcher.  That'll do, pig.  That'll do.\n\nGive it a try if you like:\n-GTA or Saint's Row games\n-any of the previous Red Faction games with the VMod Destruction technology\n-Total "Man, I got five kids to feed!"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/20500/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Download size: about 8 GB\nPlaytime: about 12 hours for single player\n\nThe newly updated Red Faction Guerilla steam edition comes with trading cards and achievements since they migrated away from Games For Windows Live. It also seems to be less buggy, but this may be a coincidence. You don’t need to have played the previous Red Faction games to understand what’s going on, and if you played Red Faction Armageddon, the campaign story isn’t really spoiled for you either. The stories take place with enough time in between for all sorts of things to have happened.\n\nYou play as Alec Mason, a recent immigrant to Mars planning to live with his brother as a miner (actually a scavenger of salvage). Unfortunately your plans are ruined when you experience the brutality of the EDF (Earth Defense Fleet), the powerful military organization that seems to be in the pocket of all the major corporations keeping the working man down. Alec joins the Red Faction, which is a kind of resistance/terrorist group committed to driving the EDF off of Mars by any means necessary. So now you (as Alec) spend your time blowing things up (and collecting salvage).\n\nRed Faction Guerilla is a third person open world game, similar to Grand Theft Auto or the Saints Row games. Since it takes place on Mars, there’s also reduced gravity though you don’t really get to fly around everywhere, even after you get a jet pack. The trademark of all Red Faction games is destructible environments, so like Red Faction Armageddon, you can pretty much destroy any man-made structure in the game, including buildings, bridges, walls, and all the crates the EDF leaves lying around. There are a few things that might give you trouble, for example some buildings have indestructible metal girders as part of the construction, but you can still knock them around and cause the buildings to collapse. It’s probably easiest to just ram your cars into the buildings though. Yes, like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, you can hijack all sorts of cars (no aircraft) and drive all over the map. The game world is moderately large and probably would take 15 minutes of straight driving to get across it. You can’t do that though since Mars has mountains and valleys blocking you so you mostly need to follow roads.\n\nYou can carry up to 4 weapons at a time, but one of them is locked as your trusty sledgehammer, which is decent for destroying buildings. There isn’t too much variety in the projectile weapons, and you’ll probably stick will explosive weapons in order to bring down buildings. Weapons and their upgrades are unlocked in the game by completing side missions or just picking them up from fallen enemies. Once you’ve unlocked the weapon you can restock it from any of your “safe houses” around the map. Money in the game is salvage, which shows up as shiny metal that you can pick up by walking over. Most of your salvage will likely come from completing missions, but a there’s a lot to be gained from the rubble of buildings.\nPros:\n+Wreck buildings in all sorts of ways. Usually the quickest way is using explosive weaponry, which has ammo limitations, so I like to try and crash cars into the buildings whenever possible. Just make sure you have enough room to build up ramming speed (and enough firepower to survive the EDF retaliation).\n+The game has multi player which I only dabbled in for about an hour. There are actually people still playing but not more than a dozen or so at a time. No co-op campaign play however, which is a shame. There are a lot of multi-player modes, but people only seem to be playing the deathmatch types.\n\nCons\n-Unfortunately for me, a large number of the game’s Steam achievements are for grinding in multiplayer, and a bunch of the single player achievements require finding ALL of certain types of collectibles.\n-The game’s side quests become repetitive after a while and by the time you unlock the game’s final area, you probably won’t be doing any of the side quests since you’ll be bored by then.\n-For an older game, my computer actually heats up when I play for a while. The game uses Havok engine, which seems to appear in a ton of the games I’ve been playing recently, but the game’s graphics aren’t much better than say, Fallout 3.\n\nAll in all Red Faction Guerilla is a good game worth your weekend to play through. The campaign has its exciting points and it’s fun to go around blowing up buildings. The DLC Demons of the Badlands is included in the Steam edition (I don’t know if the GFWL version had it). The DLC is about 3 hours and includes a few new weapons to play with, as well as a completely useless new kind of collectible (battery packs that don’t do anything). At least in the main game, all the collectibles had some sort of benefit (like give you a little salvage).\n","January 14, 2015","true","31.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Its a third person shooter about how THE EVIL EARTH FEDERATION opresses the GOOD PEOPLE OF MARS. You become Space Che Guevara by sabotaging Federation buildings, wich is great fun. You have an absurdly powerful hammer and remote charges at first, and more exotic weapons later, but to be fair, nothing beats the hammer and the charges...except for a car..loaded with charges..launched into the building with the hammer. The destruction physics are really nice, even tough buildings manage to stand upright with only 1 supportive wall for a long time, but I guess that can be blamed on MARS GRAVITY. Our hero, Mr. Alec Mason person, is rather boring. All characters are, actualy. The story is meh, it kept me playing as you unlock new areas that way, but it is really a generic revenge-rebelion story.\n\nHa ha ha, you think this is the real recommendation...?\n..IT IS!\n\n","December 27, 2011","true","32.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This is a great game and i recommend it to everyone espicially when its on sale ($2.99 when i purchased)","December 5, 2014","true","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Whats not to like.\n\nOn a more serious note the damage model makes the game.  There's a few issues with the graphics under DX10 but these can be fixed by running in DX9 mode.   There's a few threads on how to fix DX10, but none worked for me with the remaining suggestions covering all sorts of things with the potential to break your system.  TBH not worth the effort and DX9 mode only means a few extra graphical effects are missing, nothing major.\n\nThe selection of weapons in the game complement the smash-it-up feel and the AI's acceptable.  Played through till the end and enjoyed the lot.  One thing to note a lot of the screenshots on the store didn't really seem to accurately show what single player is like (I never once saw a flying vehicle close up like the screenshots show).\n\nThe only real issue is it is a GFWL title with all the baggage thats brings.  Personally had no problems with this but many others seem to have, and of course there's no guarantee how much longer GFWL will remain around so play it while you can.","July 27, 2014","true","123.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is worth the full price, every penny well spent.\nFar from perfect (friendly AI is more pain than help, slow upgrades at the begining, dull story etc), but this title offers something special that top rated games so often lack. Many reviews mentioned the destruction which is awsome, especially with the weapon unlocked after liberating the second area. But for me, the best is the thrill of multi million mayhem, hit and run guerilla attacks on really high security enemy installations. Spiced with killing sprees on the getaway, and making it home with -100 control and +20 moral. That is priceless. Of course on hard difficulty.\nMain quest missions can be a chore, but the side missions (demolition, transporter, house arrest) are mostly awesome.\nHighly recommended.","December 14, 2013","true","19.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Easy!\n\nSimilarities:\n-The Map physics are alike\n-Both have really good graphics.\n-Both have car travel\n-Both have lots of action\n-Both campaigns are based around missions,\n\nDifferences:\n\n-The Destructibility for Mad Max is for cars, but Red Faction Guerrilla's is houses, buildings, and more, but not much destructibility for cars.\n-Mad Max action is mostly fists, Guerrilla's is mostly a Hammer, or Machine gun.\nGuerrilla's Car action is mostly running away, it isn't meant for ramming and destroying other cars, It's to get to the mission quicker, or to run away. Mad Max's is for the same reason, but also ramming and destroying other cars, and running over people.\n\nMad Max and Guerrilla are both amazing games, Guerrilla is better if you have a lower budget, because it's a lot cheaper.","December 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The timed car drives are killer, the hostage crises are even harder, and dont even get me started on some of the missions.\n\nAlso, the Badlands are annoying as hell because theres only one respawn point and its located on the far side of the area, so every time you die (which is quite often), you have to drive ALL THE WAY BACK to where you were OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\nYou're also running away a lot. If you stay in one area for too long killing people, the EDF will come in tanks and helicopters and WILL kill you.\n\nPERKS: Not many games have quite the ammount of explosions and destructibility of scenery the way RFG has. its fun to tear buildings apart with the power of Thor or throw sticky C4 all over a building and run away while blowing the whole thing up.

It's not deep, but it's well balanced as a shooter and it's just oodles of fun with how much you can destroy.  Destroy, destroy, destroy.  It's just plain fun.\n\nIt's mindless in most ways, so if you're looking for an epic story this is not it.  It's also not a brand spanking new game: I had it on the PS3 in 2009 or so, and played it to completion then.\n\nThat said, the graphics get the job done, and it doesn't feel dated to me at all.  The shift to the PC format is a huge step up over the console version I previously played.  I usually play shooters on the PC anyway, so this just feels more natural.\n\nTwo examples from my previous playthrough that really stand out to me to this day:\n\n1. There was this big armored fortress in I think the second sector.  The thing was enormous, had all sorts of vehicles, guys on towers, you name it.  I spent hours going around the thing accomplishing other missions, and then finally decided I wanted to crack that nut.  I must have tried it 30 different ways, but finally I deduced a weak spot, breached the wall, set charges, went through absolute chaos, stole an enemy vehicle, caused more chaos, and somehow escaped.  Goodbye, giant fortress!  And the game remembers; it's one way to progress in the game, with these sorts of optional "side quests" (for lack of a better term.\n\n2. The other thing that really stuck out to me was in one of the last sectors, maybe 5 or 6.  It was a more dangerous area, and really hilly and comparably complicated to navigate around.  My mission was to assssinate some corrupt businessman who was on the sixth floor of some building.  He was up there having a meeting, and would be exiting to I believe a gunship soon.  So, my mission is to kill him -- but how?  Some people would go in the building, make their way through carefully, then take out the guy and escape.  Others would prepare an ambush, wait for him, and then spring a trap at the last second before he could get to his gunship.  Me?  I figured out what part of the building he was in, shot out a window semi-quietly, and then launched one of the overly-massive rockets in through the window, knocking out about a quarter of the building through several floors.  Didn't kill the guy, but suddenly I had line of sight on him six floors up, and I took him out.  It was kind of a lucky break in most respects, it would be hard to duplicate.\n\nBut being able to pull off lucky breaks like that is what makes this game so darn fun.  There isn't one path to completing a lot of the missions because you can carve your way through the buildings and obstacles how you see fit (but not the terrain).  That's just bloody fun.\n\nIt's not a game that I feel a constant need to play, or will come back to constantly.  But it is very much one that I enjoy, and occasionally will come back to for a romping good time destroying everything I see before me.  One of the more tactile shooters in years.","December 3, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This solution worked for me and I hope it helps if you have the same issue!\n\n===\n\nBefore reading my review, my time on record in the game is low because I originally played and completed just about all of the game on PlayStation 3. However I managed to do a lot of things in the PC version in my roughly fifty minutes of play.\n\nThis game was quick to become my favorite of the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. I played the original Red Faction A LOT way back in the day. My friend and I absolutely loved the first one.\n\nI think Red Faction Guerilla is an amazing sequel to the original game that started terrain deformation in videogaming.\n\nThe story is fantastic,\nThe graphics even for a 2009 videogame are still stunning!\nIt runs great and smooth as well and I'd have to say it's really well optimized.\nMore recent pro, Volition is ditching GFWL to use Steamworks instead.\nThe destruction engine, GeoMOD 2.0. (Although, not the same as the original GEOMOD, it does however have really fun building destruction capabilities and that makes up for it in an OPEN WORLD game.)\nDid I mention the game is open world?\nThe beloved Rail Gun is still in here, too! As well as weapons very much similar to previous games as well as completely new ones.\n!!! Great game for stress relief because let's face it. What's more fun than swinging a sledge hammer around tearing a building apart and smashing EDF soldiers? !!!\n\nIs that not enough of an incentive to buy it? Aside from, the price on sale events? LIKE RIGHT NOW?\n\nThe only major issue with the game is that it will crash on start up at some point namely because of the DirectX 10. I'm not entirely sure why but I was able to cure my issue was to set a lcommand line launch parameter of -nod3d9.  Every single issue I had with the game was cured. No crashing, either. I can't fault the publisher or developer for it though. For me, I see a positive visual change by disabling D3D10 because the sun no longer shines through solid objects (and it was blinding) and a few other things I could mention but can't because I was never able to keep the game running long enough.\n\nThe amount that I recommend this game is tenfold unending. The game is definitely worth even paying the regular non sale price!\n\n10/10","November 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The destruction physics are actually pretty good as you can cause entire buildings to fall over and crash onto people and other structures. Just don't let a building fall upon yourself.  Either do it singehandely with a sledge hammer or with a series of attachable explosives.  Maybe use a rocket laucher is you have one handy.

However this version no matter what I did (-nod3d9, -nod3d10, disable overlay, vertify files, reinstall, delete save games, ect) the game on direct X 9 or 11 crashes immeditely even after a computer restart. It was some issue about external harddrives. I don't know why but this game WILL NOT PLAY if installed on an external HD. Once installed on the C:/ drive though everything worked flawless. This game runs and looks great and I have not come across any of the problems that I read about while searching for a solution to the HD issue. I will review the basic aspects of this version of the game: (not review the story ect. read another review)\n\nDirectX11: Looks good and is a really nice update. I own a intel 2.8Ghz i7, AMD Radeon HD 5700 2GB vram, 8GB ram (4 year old computer)\n-Game runs perfectly with no lag at all, even with Norton Security and other performance demanding apps.\n-Quick load times, Cinematics work fine\n-Still very fun game, no graphical issues or CTD at all during entire game. Destruction is good though one time during a mission my character jumped out of the verhicle in what I assume meant to be a dramatic scene where we avoided certain death instead my character catapulted directly into a death pit but the mission was still a success so it didn't bother me.\n-Had issue with resolution once but didn't take long to fix. Devs say they are updating game often.\n-Steam Overlay works fine, Downloading in-game works, overall transfer from GFWL to Steam is unnoticable\nDirectX9: Didn't play the actual game on this mode after comfirmed working for DX11.\n\n\nIn the end a very good game and PC edition, only note is DO NOT buy if you don't wish to install on main drive; save yourself the time.","December 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are presented with an open world containing endless enemy soldiers, civilians, and rebel allies in a struggle for dominance.  The object is to destroy enemy buildings and resources with your overpowered arsenal of weapons, while avoiding death and collecting resources with which to upgrade your weapons.  The draw of this game over JC2 is that there are some fun physics involved.  Buildings can become unstable when you damage them enough in key locations, and will callapse somewhat realistically, so you can plan your attacks to minimize required ammo and bring things down as quickly as possible.  There are also lots of missions that progress the story and keep you focused.\nRF:G has several multiplayer modes that make for some great post-game smack talk.

They promised me destructibel environment, I got destructible environment, and I don't need an atomic reactor to run the game on. Tho sometimes it's a bit clunky, and you can break physics, but overall, destroying a building with only a big ♥♥♥ hammer is really fun. And the better your hammer is, the more fun it becomes.\n\nGraphics are a'rite. You are on Mars, so it's mostly red. Gives a great atmosphere, so it suits the game well.\n\nSounds are good. Voice actors gave a good and believable act, ambient sounds are cool. Again, suits the atmosphere of the game.\n\nStory is while not the strongest, it gives a theme to why you wreck ♥♥♥♥ and have fun. You are the member of the Red Faction, a guerrilla movement on the planet Mars fightning against the Earth Defense Forces, or EDF. You have to clear each region before you can advance to the next to liberate them too. There are some storyline missions, but most of them are kind of fillers - destroy a building, ride shotgun for a crazy Red Faction member, bring a car back to the safehouse in a given timeframe, attack a building, defend a building. Thankfully they are varied, so you don't get bored, and not all of them are necessary to liberate an area. With every mission, EDF's presence in the area is weakened, and in the end, usually there's a mission where they retreat to the other area, and the one you've been in is freed. The final battle and the ending is again, not the best, but is really satifying.\n\nGameplay is where it shines. You can destroy basically EVERYTHING. And you have the tools for it. You smach things with your hammer. You explode things with rocket launchers. You have disc-launcher that shoots razorblades. You have a huge arc welder. And then, the best, the nano-forge. It basically melts ANYTHING it comes into contact with. Vehicles, personnel, building, what you want. Hit the thin spot of an airplane, and laugh while you watch it drop to the ground with a huge KABOOM. Other weapons include assault rifles, shotguns, the usual stuff. Most of them have upgrades too. There are a bunch of accessories in the game, like the warp to safehouse (good when you don't want to walk or drive), or the jump-pack. They are useful, but usually being fun is what matters. You can drive some vehicles, ranging from dumpster trucks to rocket launching tanks. Driving is sometimes tricky, and as well defined as in GTA (so to say, not the best), but then again, it's fun. And this is what this game really is: fun. It keeps you entertained, especially if you don't fail some of the missions for like 5-6 times like me. I'm glad I got the Red Faction bundle some time ago, as Guerrilla is one of the most entertaining and fun games I've played in the recent years. A big thumbs up, we can only hope more of this.","August 18, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Oh great," I thought, "they're making a GTA clone set on Mars and slapping the Red Faction brand on it.  This is going to be bad." Well... I was half right at least.  You can definitely call it "Grand Theft Mars", but it is anything but bad.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the gameplay on this is just addictive.  I cannot count how many hours I've spent "reappropriating" colonist vehicles for "the cause" then driving them into buildings, through buildings, over people, and so on.  GeoMod + buildings + magic hammer that breaks everything is a winning formula.  You can also replace the hammer with plastic explosives, rocket launchers, cars, tanks, tank weaponry, the bodies of dudes you just hit with your hammer (yes that will take down walls).  RF:G captures the raw destructive joy that was present in the first Red Faction and scales it up in a major way.\n\nTo be clear, this is a major shift in the Red Faction brand from the previous two titles.  While there is a relatively linear plot, the gameplay is anything but.  This is very much a sandbox title, and yet the game does not suffer for it. On the contrary, the huge number of opportunities for destruction have never been so well presented.  If anything, I would argue that a sandbox game is the ideal way that the destruction-oriented GeoMod engine should be presented.\n\nThere are, of course, downsides.  The ability to GeoMod the terrain is completely gone for one, though I can see how that would be too complex (and resource intensive) for a game area of this scale.  A number of the weapons are somewhat lacking, particularly the traditional bullet weapons which are only really useful at all due to the never-ending waves of enemy mooks carrying them.  The biggest problem though?  Games For Windows Live, or more specifically the horrible incompatibilities it can cause.  I can barely get this game to not crash outright on Windows 7.  I highly recommend you use a GFWL alternative if at all possible.\n\nIf you take anything away from this review, it should be this: until the game started crashing on me 100% of the time, RF:G was always installed on my computer.  While it does have a long and rewarding campaign mode, it's also perfect if you just want to kill some time by causing mass destruction and chaos.  I'd not play the game for months, then pick it up for an hour or two just to destroy some buildings, cars, tanks, so on and so forth.  This is an incredibly fun game, and I'd argue the best in the series.","May 17, 2013","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are presented with an open world containing endless enemy soldiers, civilians, and rebel allies in a struggle for dominance.  The object is to destroy enemy buildings and resources with your overpowered arsenal of weapons, while avoiding death and collecting resources with which to upgrade your weapons.  The draw of this game over JC2 is that there are some fun physics involved.  Buildings can become unstable when you damage them enough in key locations, and will callapse somewhat realistically, so you can plan your attacks to minimize required ammo and bring things down as quickly as possible.  There are also lots of missions that progress the story and keep you focused.\nRF:G has several multiplayer modes that make for some great post-game smack talk.

The way the revolution is played out is up to your choices to upgrade your skills and purchased new weapons, the way you inspired your fellow guerrillas, and your overall combat skills. Driving the surface of terraformed Mars, you are revealed to structure after structure that can be destroyed with whatever means you choose! The freedom Havok physics engine provides is just another fantastic edition to this revolutionary game. With such a stimulating and realistic environment, Red Faction Guerrilla single player provides an extraordinary and unique, freeworld campaign that many other games attempt to strive for. Red Faction Guerrilla achieves this.\n\nIts multiplayer is one of the most colourful and sublime multiplayers I've ever played. Instead of the monotonous Call of Duty kill-die-respawn pattern that we've all played before, it allows you to kill creatively with weapons that no other game has ever coneceived but still require tactics to use; not just anybody can pick up the Grinder and slice people up with it. Plus, the multitude of objective gametypes that are found in no other game (simply due to the fact that Red Faction Guerilla is so unlike every other game and therefore its objective gametypes can only be based around RFG's mechanics) adds variety to each game you play. The multiplayer never gets old. It is well worth it.\n\nThis game's population must be maintained. On the Xbox, its popularity has diminshed a point of no rejuvination.

GFWL has been removed and the game has been integrated into Steam - Multiplayer, Achievements and all! Plenty of other games have done destructible environments, but never to this degree. Not only is virtually every man-made item in the game breakable, it breaks in detail. When you take your sledgehammer to a wall you break away the outer shell first, then you start digging into the concrete, and finally you hit rebar. Not only is the game's destruction fun to deliver and watch, but it also has a pretty big impact on how you play the game. When tasked with an assassination, you can sneak in and shoot the target or just take down the whole building the person is in. Tired of enemies sending reinforcements over a bridge? Take down the whole bridge. The level of destruction in Red Faction: Guerrilla deepens gameplay in ways I never would have imagined! Your best friend is the sledgehammer! The coolest looking is the singularity bomb which sucks the surrounding area into a small gravity well. Did I mention open world and massive scale? You can roam around and unlock new areas, new missions, new weapons. You get to demolish entire towns and design all the destruction as you see fit.

This solution worked for me and I hope it helps if you have the same issue!\n\n===\n\nBefore reading my review, my time on record in the game is low because I originally played and completed just about all of the game on PlayStation 3. However I managed to do a lot of things in the PC version in my roughly fifty minutes of play.\n\nThis game was quick to become my favorite of the series, and one of my favorite games of all time. I played the original Red Faction A LOT way back in the day. My friend and I absolutely loved the first one.\n\nI think Red Faction Guerilla is an amazing sequel to the original game that started terrain deformation in videogaming.\n\nThe story is fantastic,\nThe graphics even for a 2009 videogame are still stunning!\nIt runs great and smooth as well and I'd have to say it's really well optimized.\nMore recent pro, Volition is ditching GFWL to use Steamworks instead.\nThe destruction engine, GeoMOD 2.0. (Although, not the same as the original GEOMOD, it does however have really fun building destruction capabilities and that makes up for it in an OPEN WORLD game.)\nDid I mention the game is open world?\nThe beloved Rail Gun is still in here, too! As well as weapons very much similar to previous games as well as completely new ones.\n!!! Great game for stress relief because let's face it. What's more fun than swinging a sledge hammer around tearing a building apart and smashing EDF soldiers? !!!\n\nIs that not enough of an incentive to buy it? Aside from, the price on sale events? LIKE RIGHT NOW?\n\nThe only major issue with the game is that it will crash on start up at some point namely because of the DirectX 10. I'm not entirely sure why but I was able to cure my issue was to set a lcommand line launch parameter of -nod3d9.  Every single issue I had with the game was cured. No crashing, either. I can't fault the publisher or developer for it though. For me, I see a positive visual change by disabling D3D10 because the sun no longer shines through solid objects (and it was blinding) and a few other things I could mention but can't because I was never able to keep the game running long enough.\n\nThe amount that I recommend this game is tenfold unending. The game is definitely worth even paying the regular non sale price!\n\n10/10","November 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Red Faction franchise returns to Mars in the year 2120 to find the Earth Defense Force (EDF) twisted and corrupted into the very thing they helped to destroy in the oppressive corporation known as Ultor. The Red Faction rises once again! Resistant as ever and never willing to lay down quietly!\n\nVolition, Inc. waste no time in throwing the player headfirst into the coup to overtake the EDF, giving players a very early taste of the destructive appeal of Red Faction: Guerrilla's gameplay. From there on it's liberating time--through a series of raids, assassinations, vandalism, and the occasional full out assault.\n\nRed Faction: Guerrilla's gameplay styles itself after the Grand Theft Auto franchise, featuring a free roaming open world, alert levels and EDF responses to any of the player's hostile actions, a slew of both small and large missions, oh--and not to mention the fact that anything man made can be destroyed. The gaming world is made up of six different zones, as well as a seventh zone reserved for the end of the game. Each zone has two unique meters indicating the progress made towards liberating the zone. The most essential is the Control meter, which measures the EDF's total control over a given zone. The second is the morale meter--the higher the meter, the more perks you receive from colonists residing within the zone. The Grand Theft Auto nature of the game really comes through in the raising of the morale bar and the dropping of the control bar. The player is left to decide what they will do to get the job done. Destroying buildings owned by the EDF will reduce their control, however the buildings that yield the biggest net change in control are often deep within EDF territory forcing the player to fight their way through an entire base and then destroy the target building on top of that. There are also other types of missions, raids, rescuing hostages, assassinating targets, and helping colonists raid EDF controlled bases. All of these fill out to make a fun guerrilla warfare style of gameplay.\n\nSounds fun, right? Well it is, very much so. Unfortunately the EDF doesn't like you having fun with their property. As you destroy their structures, blow up their vehicles, and kill their personnel your alert level will rise. The alert level signifies how badly the EDF currently wants to put an end to your rampaging ways. So even if you make your way to the back of an EDF base to destroy a command center, you may be left with no easy means of escape, with airships, tanks, and EDF troops raining death down upon you as you leg your way out of the camp.\n\nVolition nails this overall style of play which really draws the player into the spirit of revolution. This guerrilla warfare style of gameplay simply put is fun, just pure mindless fun. This is in no small part due to Volition's good job of complementing this style of gameplay with the franchise's most notable feature--the ability to destroy anything man-made. Going around destroying things like the badass you are is easily the numero uno element that makes the gameplay fun.\n\nGuerrilla sticks to it's roots and once again features another story focused around a worker uprising on Mars. Although the story may not be anything exceptional, it is still really good in it's ability to support the guerrilla style gameplay the game gets it's name from. As mentioned before you really feel like you're part of a revolution, and that's half in part due to the gameplay as mentioned and half in part due to the story. You won't find the voice acting or dialog found in a game like Portal 2, but you'll still find something that works and get's the job done.\n\nRed Faction: Guerrilla offers so much unbridled fun. Between a guerrilla warfare style of gameplay and a destructive sandbox world this is easily the game to try in the Red Faction franchise. So what are you waiting for?

Let's see, you get huge hammer to hit things with. (EDF and buildings). You get rocket launchers, remote charges to throw at things, really cool vehicles and big explosions when you take stuff out. The EDF try really hard to kill you and your guerrilla compatriots and also they use terrain pretty sensibly, but the man made stuff can be destroyed and so it works in your favour if you gat a couple of troopers hidsing behind one wall. Boom and the trouble is gone.\nThe missions are well spaced out making you travel around to find all the stuff and although there is a storyline it does not drag you along by the nose, you have a lot of freedom to find your own targets.\nWould I recommend this game? Most definitely yes. Can I find any flaws? Yes, there are lots of video issues but turning off DX10 gets rid of 99 % of these. To stop DX10 add -nod3d10 to the startup commands through Steam.\nI am nowhere finished yet as I have been wandering off looking for stuff to destroy on my own, according to the stats I kill mostly with the assault rifle but enjoy hitting stuff real hard with the sledge hammer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/recommended/20500/","zirrian","[StuG Lyfe] Zirrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/","701 products in account","This was the second game I've played from the Red Faction franchise, right after the first Red Faction. They promised me destructibel environment, I got destructible environment, and I don't need an atomic reactor to run the game on. Tho sometimes it's a bit clunky, and you can break physics, but overall, destroying a building with only a big ♥♥♥ hammer is really fun. And the better your hammer is, the more fun it becomes.\n\nGraphics are a'rite. You are on Mars, so it's mostly red. Gives a great atmosphere, so it suits the game well.\n\nSounds are good. Voice actors gave a good and believable act, ambient sounds are cool. Again, suits the atmosphere of the game.\n\nStory is while not the strongest, it gives a theme to why you wreck ♥♥♥♥ and have fun. You are the member of the Red Faction, a guerrilla movement on the planet Mars fightning against the Earth Defense Forces, or EDF. You have to clear each region before you can advance to the next to liberate them too. There are some storyline missions, but most of them are kind of fillers - destroy a building, ride shotgun for a crazy Red Faction member, bring a car back to the safehouse in a given timeframe, attack a building, defend a building. Thankfully they are varied, so you don't get bored, and not all of them are necessary to liberate an area. With every mission, EDF's presence in the area is weakened, and in the end, usually there's a mission where they retreat to the other area, and the one you've been in is freed. The final battle and the ending is again, not the best, but is really satifying.\n\nGameplay is where it shines. You can destroy basically EVERYTHING. And you have the tools for it. You smach things with your hammer. You explode things with rocket launchers. You have disc-launcher that shoots razorblades. You have a huge arc welder. And then, the best, the nano-forge. It basically melts ANYTHING it comes into contact with. Vehicles, personnel, building, what you want. Hit the thin spot of an airplane, and laugh while you watch it drop to the ground with a huge KABOOM. Other weapons include assault rifles, shotguns, the usual stuff. Most of them have upgrades too. There are a bunch of accessories in the game, like the warp to safehouse (good when you don't want to walk or drive), or the jump-pack. They are useful, but usually being fun is what matters. You can drive some vehicles, ranging from dumpster trucks to rocket launching tanks. Driving is sometimes tricky, and as well defined as in GTA (so to say, not the best), but then again, it's fun. And this is what this game really is: fun. It keeps you entertained, especially if you don't fail some of the missions for like 5-6 times like me. I'm glad I got the Red Faction bundle some time ago, as Guerrilla is one of the most entertaining and fun games I've played in the recent years. A big thumbs up, we can only hope more of this.","August 18, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The way the revolution is played out is up to your choices to upgrade your skills and purchased new weapons, the way you inspired your fellow guerrillas, and your overall combat skills. Driving the surface of terraformed Mars, you are revealed to structure after structure that can be destroyed with whatever means you choose! The freedom Havok physics engine provides is just another fantastic edition to this revolutionary game. With such a stimulating and realistic environment, Red Faction Guerrilla single player provides an extraordinary and unique, freeworld campaign that many other games attempt to strive for. Red Faction Guerrilla achieves this.\n\nIts multiplayer is one of the most colourful and sublime multiplayers I've ever played. Instead of the monotonous Call of Duty kill-die-respawn pattern that we've all played before, it allows you to kill creatively with weapons that no other game has ever coneceived but still require tactics to use; not just anybody can pick up the Grinder and slice people up with it. Plus, the multitude of objective gametypes that are found in no other game (simply due to the fact that Red Faction Guerilla is so unlike every other game and therefore its objective gametypes can only be based around RFG's mechanics) adds variety to each game you play. The multiplayer never gets old. It is well worth it.\n\nThis game's population must be maintained. On the Xbox, its popularity has diminshed a point of no rejuvination. This game is well worth the $20, and when it's on sale don't hesitate to pick it up!","March 19, 2015","true","87.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has the best destruction engine I have ever seen in a game, including Frostbite. And whats more, it was incredibly fun! SIngle player could occationally get repetitive, and the racing mission were such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (but I don't like racing in open world games anyway), but the awesome destruction NEVER got old. Throw in some great weapons with which to cause mayhem and you've got yourself bags of fun for hours on end.\n\nAnd that's only the single player the Guerilla multiplayer was one of the most underrated parts of his massively underrated game. It was quick but not twitchy simple but not without lots of strategic and tactical options. Your combination of which superpowered backpack and which gun you chose to use would drastically change your play style. My personal favourite combo was the Rhino pack combined with the electric gun. You could smash through a wall taking out a passing player then finish them off by frying them with the elecric gun. So awesome!\n\nI was gutted when the new call of duty came out (whichever one it was at the time) as there seemed to be a mass exodus on  xbox to tath, leaving me and my mates without anyone to play with or against. An unfortunately recurring problem with consoles.\n\nSo when I saw it on steam I though GREAT! PC gamers are way more likely to keep this online stuff going! Only to find out it was a GFWL game and that it'll be going the way of the dodo very soon. So dissapointing!\n\nRed Faction: Guerilla is a brilliant game basically. But with very little incentive to play it any more....such a shame.\n\n","March 23, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the combat and physics are top notch; it's SO satisfying when enemies are entrenched in buildings to just destroy the entire building instead of carefully sneaking through each corridor and hallway.  The campaign is long and varied and I've found myself setting RF:G down for several months, then reinstalling it just to play through again and laugh in delight as I set elaborate traps up for the security forces foolish enough to mess with me.\n\nThere's a few failings in the game, but I feel nitpicky pointing them out.  Sometimes the AI is dumb.  The in-game grass has a laughably short drawing distance, making it look like the ground is kind of boiling while you drive across it.  And while the missions are varied, some are just annoyingly long with frustratingly few checkpoints.\n\nOverall, it's a great game.

Ever\nInteractive open world\nUpgrade's\nA lot of gameplay\nGreat gameplay!\n\nCon's:\n\nWhen you die in a quest, there's about 80% chance that you will have to restart the whole thing, yay! -_-\nThey could've made more changes in the environment, it is mainly just 1 kind of environment but with weather changes (I know it's on Mars, but still)\n!!YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT SIGNING INTO WINDOWS LIVE!!\n\nAnd that's about it, I do recommend this game, but.. i've heard something about Windows Live Games support is going down and since you can't play offline, ermmm you wont be able to play the game.\n\nOther than that 7.8/10","June 15, 2014","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Often, I would stop playing the campaign for hours and just destroy as many things as possible with a sledgehammer.  It sounds silly, but it's obessively fun.\nStory itself is so-so and there isn't really any serious drama involved except maybe in some spooky places in the middle of the game in the desert.  Controls took a little getting used to - driving can be difficult if you are not good a driving games.  And there is a TON of driving.  You can be sneaky or guns a blazing - I usually played it safe with sneaking but at a certain point it really works against you.  Well times smash and grabs did best.  I'd say a medium sized chunk of the game is a grind, but it's got it's fun moments with the sheer destruction chaos.   Last level was a bit confusing as I often got to the end, but got stuck inside the final 'thingee" somehow.  Maybe it was a controller issue.  Got this in a bundle and don't regret it at all.  Don't expect much story line, though.","July 17, 2014","true","62.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No actually, its on mars. The game immediatley shoves the emphasis on fun and being able to destroy everything you see whilst gawping at the games great physics destruction effects. Literally, everything you see that isnt part of the terrian (i.e. cars, buildings, fences) can be destroyed using the various arsenal of weapons including explosive charges and your trusty sledgehammer. The story is nothing particularly exciting and SPOILERS will follow. This game isn't based on giving you an intense, jaw dropping story based ecperience and has a pretty run-of-the-mill sotryline. The world is basically being held captive by an opressive evil government, your brother is part of the resistance group and he gets killed in pretty much the opening cutscene (the second one). END OF SPOILERS The characters that the game throws at you are pretty run of the mill, but that in no way ruins the experience of the game. It delivers satisfying destruction and fun gunplay and should not be ignored.\n\nPositive\n+ Great Destruction\n+ Graphics are OK\n+ Fun Gameplay\n\nNegative\n- Boring Story\n- Un-interesting Characters\n\nConclusionIf you are looking for a story driven epic, just ignore this game. If you are looking to blow some stuff up and have a little bit of fun, then this game is probably a safe bet for you.","March 13, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really didn't care for a story or characters, but that doesn't mean i didn't like Red Faction. On the contrary, i really enjoyed every minute of it. Basically, you are able to destroy almost every (99,99%) structure in  the game. You have different set of weapons, but the main star is sledgehammer, which you can use to precisely to turn things into rubble. Shooting is ok, i guess. So is the driving...basically it's nothing special. In the end, i'd recommend this game, because it really brought someting new in the genre.

Driving vehicles is very difficult to do. Made me have to restart several missions for several times.

I first got it on my Xbox 360 and thought it was amazing. You can do whatever you want. Destroy buildings, crash cars, kill innocent or enemies, jump into pits of doom.... but it's not really all about that. It's about the creatitvity the developers put in the game. The weapons are amazing, the story line is good and the bunches of days/months or even years they put into making the whole world in this game is amazing. It's cool to watch the NPCs react in the game, they'll help you out in very tough situations and lead you to victory. They are a HUGE part in the game.

The physics gameplay makes this game unique and unrivaled in it's genre, yes, you get a massive open world to enjoy but more that that... You can enter every building and destroy it wall by wall. See a bridge, you can destroy it, see a massive sky-scraper... DESTROY IT! And what's more that that is that you feel like everything you destroy will somehow affect the storyline in some way. And it does. The weapons make you feel powerful in this game, heck, even swinging a hammer will be rewarding because it actually does something to the environment lol\n\nThe only complaint is that the game feels empty sometimes. While it's fun to drive around and blow $#!t up, there's really nobody to interact or talk with other than the main story missions. Side quests consists of you smashing stuff, but alone. You're on Mars and the devs really make you feel that lol Still, the storyline is a great one.

This is by far a perfect game, or even an amazing game. Hell, I barely started the campaign. The wrecking crew on the other hand, is what I have been doing since I bought it. The total chaos option of it is just way too much fun. You can play it hot seat, or solo. To describe it in a nutshell, you see how much collateral damage you can cause in a minute with a single weapon. The person who caused the most damage wins. I have just been having a lot of fun challenging friends and just watching their advanced destruction engine go to town on the buildings on this rendition of the surface of mars. I recommend this for people who like social gaming, but are limited in computers.

This is by far a perfect game, or even an amazing game. Hell, I barely started the campaign. The wrecking crew on the other hand, is what I have been doing since I bought it. The total chaos option of it is just way too much fun. You can play it hot seat, or solo. To describe it in a nutshell, you see how much collateral damage you can cause in a minute with a single weapon. The person who caused the most damage wins. I have just been having a lot of fun challenging friends and just watching their advanced destruction engine go to town on the buildings on this rendition of the surface of mars. I recommend this for people who like social gaming, but are limited in computers.

You can take your time smashing everything thing to bits.\n\nThere is NO "hit the wall and whole wall disappears" no, rather, small to medium pieces slowly break off and fall due to gravity into a pile on the ground. You can knock out the support beams, and watch the whole building come crashing down.  The floors might have offices, bathrooms, data centers, or might be a shopping market with shelves of products, etc.\n\nBut if you knock out the support beams and other supportingp arts, it will start to creak and make sounds, shake, become unstable, and a couple more hits, THE WHOLE THING CRASHES down.\nIt's like watching videos of buildings being demolished, but in a game.\n\nYou can be in combat, and there's like 10 guys on one floor shooting at you.\nYou can fire rockets and they explode realistically inside, causing realistic damage.\nMaybe you are a 2nd floor and enemies on the 3rd floor?\nYou can shoot the floor out beneath them and make them fall through.\nOr you need to make a quick escape? You can shoot out the floor under you and drop through.\n\n\nThe game is GTA like in that there is a "living" world of people driving and going about their business, and you have various quests to deliver this, get this hear, some of them timed (which suck). You can get vehicles, run around, do whatever. The world is Mars, and the game world is divided into several large areas you can travel too seemlessly (just a couple areas must be unlocked due to the main quest).\n\nThe game is like Just Cause 2 in that you are up against an evil government that has bases, outposts, and centers all over an area. The more you destroy their assets, the more they "lose control", the more your support builds up.\n\nThe game has main-story quests, but tons of side-quests and things to do.\nYou generally have to reduce the enemy's control in an area before opening up the next (again, you can still go there to some, but will be harder).\n\nYou can take down their control however. You can attack however.\nThere is no fixed way to do things. You can get some bombs, ram through the gates, detontate them. Or you can perch on a large hilltop or rooftop and fire rockets at them from afar, slowly damaging them and lowering their control. You can then come back later and finish the job or go do something else.\n\nIt's like GTA where once you start mayhem, there is a meter that rates how "wanted" you are, so the security forces start to chase you, but if you can get away and hide.\n\nThe game has dynamic type events you can participate in, as if the whole war is going on without you, and you can choose to go help your side in a battle or not.\n\nSo, imagine Just Cause 2 meets GTA but you can destroy all the buildings, bridges, etc. completely in those games, and then pick up the salvage from them to use as currency.\n\nThe whole free-to-do-it-however is the biggest plus, and you'll never get tired of demolishing the game world. After you beat the game, you can keep playing to with increased difficulty, with all your unlocked items and stuff, so that was cool.\n\nThe only bad, is I wish nothing had to be unlocked. I beat the game and the later vehicles, like tanks and aircraft, I only start able to be using them right at the end, which is bullcrap if you ask me.\nAnd, I wish the game world was even bigger (it was pretty big, I just wanted more!), and lastly, mostly, that they did more games like this.","August 9, 2015","true","46.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you've played this game on console and are worried about the port quality: don't be.\n\nGameplay Solid third person shooter mechanics, incredible destruction and destructive physics. Vehicles are a little floaty but you're on Mars now baby, what do you expect?\n\nVisuals For a 2009 game? Are you kidding me? Solid as hell.\n\nSound Buildings under stress creak and groan. Guns are punchy. Enemy soldiers crunch when you hit them with a sledgehammer or run them over in a rover. Voice acting is alright. The soundtrack is at a quite enjoyable level of cheese.\n\nStory Story is not anything incredible. But you're not playing this game for the story, are you? You're here to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. It gets the job done.\n\nMultiplayer Thoroughly dead. However, it is fun when you can get game going. So grab a few of your mates for a good time.\n\nReplayability Open world, Lots of "collectable" type stuff.  Cheat codes.\n\nCONCLUSION If you're on the fence about buying this game, it generally goes on sale for about $4 USD (and is on sale as of this writing). The game is fantastic and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The game knows what it does well (destruction mechanics) and doubles down on it. If its any indication of how much I enjoy this game, I had played it for many hours when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and have just now purchased it to replay on my PC.","November 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Funwillfunwill/recommended/20500/","Funwillfunwill","Will Harvey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Funwillfunwill/","63 products in account","This is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. I'll begin my review now:\n\nStory: 5/10.\n-Its not good. In fact its pretty bad. There aren't really any "emotional" moments even when the Commander dies, which the ONLY thing you think is "oh darn instead of this guy giving me orders i now have this guy." However, it does at least attempt to explain why they are the good guys and not just terrorists.\n\nGraphics: 9/10.\n-Ok so for the time these were seriously almost as good as Crysis. Like on Ultra graphics settings this could even pass as a PS4/Xbox One game, so yeah they still hold up despite being an older game.\n\nGameplay: 10/10.\n-Driving: This is where its at (cues Beck to start singing.) The driving mechanics are very good, especially in comparison to similar games like Just Cause or Mercenaries. They are almost as good as GTA in fact. The vehicles feel like they actually have a weight instead of just floating. A tank makes you feel like a badass.\n\n-Destruction: To the main gameplay feature. RFG would just be another GTA clone without this. The destruction is the best i have seen in any video game. Physics are very realistic most of the time. Its really fun using C4 to blow up a bridge and stop the EDF from getting to you. The most satisfying part of Red Faction Guerrilla is testing yourself...role playing in a way. So i would set C4 on a building and go upstairs IN that building, and set it off. It was fun seeing a building begin to collapse while you were inside it, and you having to escape.\n\nFavorite moment: the sniper mission by FAR. It is near the end of the game where you have to take out some snipers who are shooting out of civilian buildings. The EDF is guarding them so you have to take them out, which is hard considering the fact that they are going through above ground tunnel-bridges. Once you get to the buildings with the snipers there are 2 options: go in or destroy the building. I would do the first one because you will be slaughtered staying out in the open that long. So, once in the building i went upstairs and took out the first sniper, easy peasy. I went up the next flight of stairs and didn't see anyone, despite on my minimap seeing someone exactly where i was. I soon realized it meant he was above me.....but there way no way to get up and kill him. There was only one solution. I had to blow through the ceiling. I placed the C4 and stepped back. When i was far enough away, i blew open the roof. The sniper was indeed there. Using my machine gun, he was finally dispatched. It wasn't over though. When i destroyed that section of the roof, i fell on the floor, breaking that part open. There stairs were destroyed. Everyone knows it's rude to just jump down, right? So instead of jumping through the hole, i jumped. Out of the 3 story building, and jet packed to safety.\n\nSo all in all i give Red Faction Guerrilla an extremely high review of 10 out of 10. Would jetpack out of half destroyed building again.","December 9, 2015","true","160.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

OF COURSE YOU DO! Tired of killing people with just regular guns? JUST USE A ROCKET LAUNCHER TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE BUILDING. See, now that's clever thinking. Muuuuuch more efficient.

Use the old fashioned hammer, or a rocket launcher, or some Remote charges! Really it's up to you.

Note my laptop is weak but yet powerful. It runs this game ((Lowest Settings)) at a solid 30-25 FPS. And when I blow up a building it lowers down about 2 FPS. Which isn't to bad! =-)\n\nAll in all this game is amazing! Recommended for time waisters since you might not be for the Story but yet the DESTRUCTION!!!!!! The story is pretty nice as well.

Aldo Raine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hardcoreballer/","114 products in account","GTA: Mars For a game released in 2009, it holds up both technically and in terms of gameplay. If you've played this game on console and are worried about the port quality: don't be.\n\nGameplay Solid third person shooter mechanics, incredible destruction and destructive physics. Vehicles are a little floaty but you're on Mars now baby, what do you expect?\n\nVisuals For a 2009 game? Are you kidding me? Solid as hell.\n\nSound Buildings under stress creak and groan. Guns are punchy. Enemy soldiers crunch when you hit them with a sledgehammer or run them over in a rover. Voice acting is alright. The soundtrack is at a quite enjoyable level of cheese.\n\nStory Story is not anything incredible. But you're not playing this game for the story, are you? You're here to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. It gets the job done.\n\nMultiplayer Thoroughly dead. However, it is fun when you can get game going. So grab a few of your mates for a good time.\n\nReplayability Open world, Lots of "collectable" type stuff.  Cheat codes.\n\nCONCLUSION If you're on the fence about buying this game, it generally goes on sale for about $4 USD (and is on sale as of this writing). The game is fantastic and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The game knows what it does well (destruction mechanics) and doubles down on it. If its any indication of how much I enjoy this game, I had played it for many hours when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and have just now purchased it to replay on my PC.","November 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not the epic type of game, because the story/characters/objectives and also the world are rather shallow, but if you´re in the mood for some creative deconstruction or atomizing your friends, Red Faction Guerilla has a lot of interesting tools for the job. Those tools combined with the amazing physics for collapsing buildings manage to make this game something really special.

I own this game as a retail version and re-bought it on Steam.\n\nRed Faction Guerilla is an open world game. It takes place on mars which is being colonialized by mankind and civilization there is currently in the state of terraforming and mining (so don't expect a city like you would in a GTA game or similar). That said, there is a fairly big map to explore with a whole lot of buildings, machines and structures which are fully destroyable. There are driveable vehicles and a small amount of weapons (of which some are very fun to play around with). There are RPG elements like the upgrading of weapons, health and some other useful things. Besides the main story missions (of which I don't want to spoil one bit), you can take on challenges, collect and destroy stuff to be able to buy upgrades. The story is not bad, but the focus in this game really lies on exploring and destroying..and if you're in for that, this is a straight buy for you.\nBy the way: The game was recently patched and got full Steamworks integration alongside with new MP-maps and a great community :)","March 28, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I must admit, I came in a bit skeptical as the very early minutes of the game reminded me of Grand Theft Auto in space. The cars were crappy and its only gimmick was destructible environments.\n\nAn hour into the game, I found myself loving it. The plot is thin, but the plot was not what kept me playing. It's surprising to see such a simple gimmick go a long way. Not only was watching buildings get demolished fun, this game mechanic forced me to strategize on my feet. It gave me many options to approach a given situation. To my surprise, this was a thinking man's game.\n\nIf you ever see this game on sale, don't hesitate to purchase it. I picked it up for $5 a year or two back and it has rewarded me with about a dozen hours of fantastic gameplay.

It doesn't need to be an indie game, or a flash game to really show that it's creative, and just  like other games, for example GTA you have an extreme amount of fun just walking around, enjoying the feel of the game. Even though it's characters, or landscapes are pretty boring over all, what really shines is the game play. It has a pretty good combat with guns, and also has additions to use like a Jetpack, cars and environment. Environment. You might wonder what i mean about that. Because what really defies the game is it's physics, combined with your best friend and companion - the hammer. You can see that the best par about the game is the hammer, it's upgrades, and the destrucion of every object in the world. The controls are great, and you have a big map full of secrets and things to destroy! even though planet mars is a bit boring, the graphics are advanced for the year 2010.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunnyFarmF/recommended/20500/","FunnyFarmF","FunnyFarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunnyFarmF/","222 products in account","I just now got this game on Steam, having some 100 hours on my hard copy, but nonetheless it is an amazing game. It's destruction engine is still all but unmatched, and the "insane" difficulty level gives anyone a huge challenge to raid enemy fortifications with the utmost stealth (or I guarantee you will die). It has plenty of "standard" (i.e: Pistol, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, etc) weapons, as well as end-game toys to just screw around with. It's also good to occasionally gaze up into the Martian sky...seeing the beautifully rendered Heavens above, with a comet streaking past every so often.\nLet me talk for a minute about the destruction engine: off the top of my head, there are 2 things that cannot be destroyed in this game: the terrain and those big-♥♥♥ towers in the games last stage. Every other building, however, you can destroy essentially brick by brick, with any non-energy weapon (even your fist). The engine also understands that if you take out critical points of a structure, it will fall much easier than just randomly blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.\nThe EDF in this game are also very realistic (on the highest difficulty at least, I haven't played medium or easy in such a long time), as in they behave like police. If you commit a felony and they see you, every one of them in close proximity will fire warning shots and try to "capture" you. If you start killing them, they send in reinforcements. If you're just being a big enough ♥♥♥♥ about killing them, they send in tanks and even ♥♥♥♥ing gunships (yes, they have an airforce). If you try to hide from them, they search the area for quite a long time, unlike in other games where once you leave their sight you're free to do whatever.\nHowever, I'd like to talk for a moment about the hilarity of their pilots and drivers. The EDF will often flip their cars and crash into each other or even drive off a damn cliff when they're pursuing you, and they will often just fly their gunships into tall buildings, mountains, or even each other. It's really ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious and I'd say buy this game just to ♥♥♥♥ off the EDF.\n\nBut aside from that, I 100% recommend this game. Buy it and play it, then let your kids play it, and let their kids play it. This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing underrated. Spread the word of how amazing this game is (but not the GFWL part. That part sucks).","May 29, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","2"

I originally had this on Xbox 360 but recently bought it on PC. The PC version is identical to the console version as far as I can tell. This game offers a unique perspective as a member of a resistance force who cannot fight face to face like in FPS games, but has to use clandestine methods to overcome the enemy.\n\nPROS:\n\n*Great destructable environment\n*Unique storyline\n*Original gameplay\n*Excellent graphics considering its age\n*Good range of vehicles\n*You can crash your car into ANY building and attack anyone: this game offers a lot of freedom to the player, in a similar way to GTA, though simplified.\n*Open world that is easy to navigate and you can go off-road wherever you want.\n\nCONS:\n\n*You need to install Games for Windows Live (the Microsoft equivalent of steam) to use and save the game\n*DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer experience. There is no multiplayer community and the servers are soon to be shut down. Do not let this put you off however, the singleplayer is great.\n*It was clearly designed for consoles, so the console experience is generally better.\n*Missions can be repetitive (they mostly involve blowing stuff up) but because the destructible environment is so good, you don't really mind.\n\nTo conclude, this game is worth buying if it's on sale, and you could spend a lot of time playing it. However, the game is more suited to console, so if you can, I would recommend buying the game for console rather than PC (though it could be more expensive). If Halo married GTA, this would be their child.","April 25, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, in a market full of open world action games, this one is just dull and frustrating. Mars isn't an interesting environment. The story isn't worth your time. All the side quests are lame, especially the vehicle deliveries. The low gravity makes all the driving on the bumpy terrain incredibly frustrating. The main quests are nothing special either. You wont care about any of the cast. You'll get a few bucks worth of fun out of just destroying buildings, but it's pretty much the same kind of destruction you could get out of something like Demolition Inc, a game I quite like that's also on Steam.\n\nI ended up totally losing interest and quitting before finishing the main story.

Aldo Raine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hardcoreballer/","114 products in account","GTA: Mars For a game released in 2009, it holds up both technically and in terms of gameplay. If you've played this game on console and are worried about the port quality: don't be.\n\nGameplay Solid third person shooter mechanics, incredible destruction and destructive physics. Vehicles are a little floaty but you're on Mars now baby, what do you expect?\n\nVisuals For a 2009 game? Are you kidding me? Solid as hell.\n\nSound Buildings under stress creak and groan. Guns are punchy. Enemy soldiers crunch when you hit them with a sledgehammer or run them over in a rover. Voice acting is alright. The soundtrack is at a quite enjoyable level of cheese.\n\nStory Story is not anything incredible. But you're not playing this game for the story, are you? You're here to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. It gets the job done.\n\nMultiplayer Thoroughly dead. However, it is fun when you can get game going. So grab a few of your mates for a good time.\n\nReplayability Open world, Lots of "collectable" type stuff.  Cheat codes.\n\nCONCLUSION If you're on the fence about buying this game, it generally goes on sale for about $4 USD (and is on sale as of this writing). The game is fantastic and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The game knows what it does well (destruction mechanics) and doubles down on it. If its any indication of how much I enjoy this game, I had played it for many hours when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and have just now purchased it to replay on my PC.","November 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With a surprisingly good story, an interesting setting and atmospehere, and the beauty of the Geo Mod 2.0 destruction engine, the game will keep you enthralled and playing. Speaking as someone who's only played the game on PS3 before, I can say that it gets even better on PC. There is a somewhat small modding community, but a modding community none the less, who unlock hidden content, make tweaks and even allow to have godmode.\n\nPros:\n-You can tear builidngs apart, brick by brick using a wide array of weapons\n-You obtain weapons such as remote charges that can be thrown and exploded at will, a rifle that disintegrates solid matter, a large missle that causes massive damage, a guass rifle, and a whole array of normal combat weapons.\n-You really feel like you're fighting as part of a rebellion if you play it seriously\n-There's a large amount of augmented vehicles that can assist you in the rebellion\n-It's Open World!\n-It plays out in a territory capturing kind of way. You force enemies out of sectors by lowering their control over the sector and rasing the morale and support for your guerrillas.\n\nCons:\n-Buildings take quite a long time to collapse. An unrealistic length of time. This can be tweaked with mods though.\n-Enemies are too powerful, and you can't hold enough ammo to deal with them all.\n-No checkpoints on any missions\n-Buildings don't respawn, meaning that you can't go back to destroy them again at the end of the game\n\nI can confidently give this game a 10 of 10. Playing with difficulty enchancing mods can make the game somewhat frustrating when you die repeatedly on missions with no checkpoints.","December 2, 2014","true","56.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","6"

Well that's part of it. This game is like taking Saints Row, GTA, Mass Effect, and Battlefield's Levolution, and making a new game out of it. This game is probably one of the most fun games I have played. It's set in the future where miner's have made a society on Mars, but is threatened by the federal government. The EDF which is like the federal soldiers are controlling the whole planet, and you have to join a rebel group to take back the planet. Throughout gameplay, you'll definitley notcie that the developers have put in physics. So if you destroy a certain support beam, a building will come crashing down. This is something I really like. When I have an objective, I take a fast truck, thow C4 type stuff on my truck, and head it right for a building, jump out, and watch the truck ram into the building as I detonate it. It's great!\nPros:\n-Physics\n-Good story\n-Great Graphics (Low end PCs can definitley play it: I play on very high, and get forty frames, and that's good for mine)\n-Explosions\n-Plenty of weapons, upgrades, and vehicles\n\nCons:\n-The enemy AI seems a bit too over powered\n-You have to click again to reload, and ammo runs out fast (It takes a good half a clip to kill on soldier)\n-Every little thing sends unlimited EDF to you\n-Gang banged by EDF and Natives (They seem to work together for some stupid reason)\n-No way to defend yourself when you're a slow vehicle and they have trucks with turrets\n\nEven with these cons, it;s still a fun and challenging game. It'll make you rage here and there, but it always has a way to draw you back. I do think that this game does need more updates, but other than that, it's defintley a game worth getting!","June 3","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/20500/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Like Armageddon, it has good graphics, great controls, cool weapons, ability to wreck almost the entire environment, and cool weapons. Although Armageddon has way better graphics and is optimized much better. This game lags if there is a ton of stuff  being torn down around me, Armageddon does not lag ever. Armageddon is linear and this game is more of an open world type game, but still mission and objective based so it doesn't make much sense to randomly explore the open world because it is a waste of time since you need to do missions and side missions and blow up points to get a good amount of salvage and push back the enemy to advance the game. It is a pretty good game and is a lot of fun, but it does have some crappy problems.\n\nThe biggest problem is that it has some of the worst sound I have ever heard in a game. The voices sound very tinny like in Half-Life 1, and all sounds in the game are very low quality, however HL1 has way better sounds than this garbage. The sound is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible.\nTheir idea of a challenge and the only real hard aspect of the game is that you can be doing very well on a mission then out of nowhere you are swarmed with guys and you die very easily so you are going to see game over a lot. Just a little dmg and I am dead so I have to be really careful always.\nVehicle control blows. My vehicle constantly takes way more dmg on missions than it should from the enemy because of the sucky vehicle controls. I am always ramming into rocks or buildings and coming to a dead stop which then allows the enemy to wail on me until I get going again, or flipping over/flying into things because vehicle jumping is very floaty. It is pretty much a problem with turning: for some reason, keyboard acceleration seems to be on when driving, so after holding left or right to turn for more than a second, it speeds up the turn and you instead of taking a turn smoothly, smash sharply into the left or right side wall.\nGame is not well optimized. Lags like a son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ when a large building is being demolished around me. Armageddon never lags and it is a newer game.\nEvery time I alt+tab out of the game then go back, it is in a full screen window and I have to press alt+enter to get it back to regular full screen. Not a big problem though because I tend to not alt+tab out of games that much.\n\nIf it were better optimized and had better sound it would be a 8.5/10 but I give it 7.5/10. Armageddon may be more linear than this but that does not take away from its fun factor in any way at all. Even though this game came first, I highly recommend playing Armageddon before you get this.\n\nSound 4/10\nGame 7.5/10","October 11, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Let's see... spoiler-free. You can blow up buildings that come apart dynamically. When you use a rocket launcher on a build cement wall, you can see the chunks of concrete blasting out and leaving fragments of rebar inside. Knock out the supports for a structure and it will come down, splintering into pieces and chunks and shards that just make me want to go knock something else down!

That sheer, cathartic joy of structural destruction crying out to the gorilla in the cockles of your heart, lifting it as that ever so ephemeral archetecture was undone by your besandled foot?  That's this game.  That is so this game at any given point.  Hammer, car, rocket launcher, remote mines.  Car covered in remote mines full of propane tanks propelled by rocket launcher.  All structures are yours to unmake and the joy of it is splendid.   The graphics and soundtrack are about standard, nothing to deride or write home about, but the gameplay.  THE GAMEPLAY.  Beat the game and you get fun cheats to sandbox destroy the surface of mars and everything on it.  The story mode is tolerable and when set to hard enough difficulty actually kinda fun to play through.  The side missions are the oven fresh cornbread next to that cold chicken that is the story mode.  Rescuing hostages in building, destroying a building with the missions weapon of choice, causing as much destruction as possible.  Brilliant gameplay and standard everything else a game needs to be shipped out all in this package.","August 31, 2013","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game departs from the FPS genre and while that might offput some (it did for me at first, but I got over it), it does well to distance itself from the failure of Red Faction 2.\n\nRed Faction Guerrilla is one of the few games that I've actually played to completion. I loved the original Red Faction FPS game, can't say the same for RF2 and I was hoping this game would restore the franchise.\n\nIn the spirit of the original Red Faction, Red Faction Guerrilla totes a physicals engine that allows for physics based destruction of buildings. Unlike the original Red Faction, this game actually does produce gameplay around this aspect. The building destruction physics is fairly well executed and destroying buildings can be extemely satisfying.\n\n8/10","November 27, 2013","true","44.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rebels come and go to help your endeavor to liberate Mars. The plot is thin but the Sci-Fi atmosphere in thick : free roaming on half-terroformed Mars, through craters and hills (but no mountains). Missions belong to several categories : free the prisoners, help defend an outpost or capture another one, stop a convoy, destroy a building, steal a vehicle and drive it to destination in a limited time, get in this big robot and destroy everything. They also become increasingly difficult.\nAfter liberating a map you'll get access to following one, each map has a unique flavor.\nGraphics are a little bit dull, but this is Mars, so who cares.\nCombat can be intersting as you may destroy the enemy's cover or just blow them up.\nGathering metal from destruction allows you to buy improved weapons and means of even more destructions.\nIf only this game was made into an RPG !","March 13, 2015","true","86.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game departs from the FPS genre and while that might offput some (it did for me at first, but I got over it), it does well to distance itself from the failure of Red Faction 2.\n\nRed Faction Guerrilla is one of the few games that I've actually played to completion. I loved the original Red Faction FPS game, can't say the same for RF2 and I was hoping this game would restore the franchise.\n\nIn the spirit of the original Red Faction, Red Faction Guerrilla totes a physicals engine that allows for physics based destruction of buildings. Unlike the original Red Faction, this game actually does produce gameplay around this aspect. The building destruction physics is fairly well executed and destroying buildings can be extemely satisfying.\n\n8/10","November 27, 2013","true","44.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, if so there is litterally no better game for you that isn't an indie game.\nThe shooting is relatively passable, the weapons interesting, the graphics are definitely suitable, and the story is kind of meh. There's driving vehicles, which handle relatively well although one or two early missions involving them are rather annoying.\nThe destruction though? Well, it doesn't always follow the laws of physics but it's fully functional and fully worth it. The game is basically Just Cause 2 with the tropical setting replaced with mars and the focus on movement and all around freedom replaced with a high fidelity destruction system and sci-fi weapons.\n\nIf you're considering buying this game, it's $20 so you'll probably be getting your money's worth on this one. The Steam Edition guarentees that it will run on your system without trouble. The multiplayer, while fun, is pretty much dead right now, but it is still fully fuctional in case you get some curious friends together.\n\nReccomendation: If you're interested, buy it.","August 29, 2015","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All structures are yours to unmake and the joy of it is splendid.   The graphics and soundtrack are about standard, nothing to deride or write home about, but the gameplay.  THE GAMEPLAY.  Beat the game and you get fun cheats to sandbox destroy the surface of mars and everything on it.  The story mode is tolerable and when set to hard enough difficulty actually kinda fun to play through.  The side missions are the oven fresh cornbread next to that cold chicken that is the story mode.  Rescuing hostages in building, destroying a building with the missions weapon of choice, causing as much destruction as possible.
