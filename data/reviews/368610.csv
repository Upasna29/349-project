In The Enchanted Cave 2 you, an adventurer with your eyes on the prize, enter an enchanted cave and travel through it taking all the loot you can find while taking down or avoiding the many monsters you'll find on your journey in the cave. As you fight monsters and search for loot you'll level up your character, making him more powerful and more able to take on the monsters.\n\nOne thing I'd like to address before I get to my review is that this game, despite being called a rogue-like, is not really a rogue-like. Sure it has procedural level generation but it lacks perma-death, when you die you keep all of your EXP and skills that you've collected.\n\n+Great pixel graphics\n+The cave consists of 100 levels so there's a fair amount to do unless you blaze through all 100 levels in one run\n+Lots of different weapons and items for you to loot along the way\n+Good variety of enemies, new enemies are introduced the further you get in the cave\n+As well as finding loot you also have the ability to create potions and craft your own gear\n+Four playable characters though as far as I can tell the only difference between them is their appearance\n+It's simple and easy to get into, not something that can be said for many games similar to this\n+Great soundtrack which fits well with the game\n\n-While the skill tree is huge it's far too simplistic. The tree itself is split into three sections: warrior skills, mage skills and alchemist skills. Each section of the skill tree then has about four different skills/upgrades which just get repeated over and over again\n-The combat is again, far too simplistic. Unless you try to use the weaknesses of the enemies against them combat consists entirely of walking up to an enemy and watching your character fight it, no input from the player is required\n-The simplicity mentioned above leads to very little replayability in the game unless you're a perfectionist\n\nVerdict:\nWait for a sale (7/10)\n\nThe Enchanted Cave 2 is a good RPG game with rogue-like elements that has great pixel graphics, a large cave to explore and lots of items and enemies that falls somewhat flat due to it's simplicity.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews?\n\nEl K.","June 9, 2015","true","4.1"," 75 of 87 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","75","87","2","0"

The problem comes when you reach floor 30 where you start to feel that you are playing exactly the same but with bigger numbers.\n\nYou have a skill tree but the gameplay is too simple and the only thing that you do is kill weak monsters that can't do damage and farm the same items with more stats, to make the next monsters weak so you can repeat. Different monsters doesn't need different strategies to kill them, they are more or less the same with different skin, damage and hp.\n\nIf you love roguelikes, you will play this games for 3-4 hours and then you will leave it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/368610/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that the original Enchanted Cave is not only one of my favorite Flash games of all time, but one of my most-played games of all time.\n\nI spent a good 50 hours or so with the original version on Kongregate and would come back to it periodically. When I saw that a sequel had not only been made, but had a Steam version too, it became one of the few times I've instabought a new release sight-unseen.\n\nThe Enchanted Cave 2 is very similar to its predecessor. You play as a rogue adventurer who journeys deep into a 100-level dungeon in search of loot, monsters and glory. Along the way, you find relics, potions and new items, and if things get too dangerous, you can always "escape" with a pair of magical wings and try again with the gear you collected on the way. Combat is done automatically by just walking into enemies, and there's a semi-randomized aspect to the floors you visit - no two are the same.\n\nIt's pretty impressive what the creator, one-man dev studio Dustinaux, upgraded in the interim between games. Chief among the improvements is a massive skill tree system that has three distinct sectors. You can choose to upgrade physical skills (combat, defense, experience boosts and HP), magical skills (MP, new skills) or a general utility set (gold earned, potion efficiency). It actually gets quite challenging in later floors as you gain levels, because XP gains become minimal and you have to prioritize what you want to upgrade.\n\nInstead of a simple splash screen in the original, there's now a town that you can visit in between runs, which has NPCs, shops and more. It even incentivizes the plot by making it possible to rescue NPCs trapped in the dungeon, who escape and become shopkeepers or bar patrons afterwards.\n\nFrom a story standpoint, things haven't changed much. The story is pretty much exactly the same as before - there's an evil sorcerer who lives at the bottom of the dungeon and is trying his best to kill you, via subterfuge and the numerous enemies he summons on each level. The only difference now is that he isn't so blatant about his intentions, and you can find journal entries written by him in secret areas littered throughout the dungeon.\n\nThe one thing that makes the game so good is that it's addicting as hell. There's a definite sense of "one more run", and you're constantly on the lookout for better gear, relics and potions. You can craft your own upgraded gear with special attributes, pick one of four character skins to use when raiding and try to fill out the "Museum" (a place that houses all of your duplicate relics).\n\nThere are a couple problems of note as well. Despite the inclusion of Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong Country) as composer, the music is... underwhelming, considering his pedigree. Likewise, it can take hours to finish a run. Don't be deceived - there are enemies you physically can't pass without significant grinding.\n\nThat being said, the Enchanted Cave 2 is just as immersive and enjoyable as its predecessor. While it's not necessarily a true roguelike, it offers enough fun for anyone who's looking for an adventure with lots of variety and grinding. There's even a New Game Plus mode once you complete the dungeon for the first time.\n\nDefinitely check this one out.\n\nFor more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!","September 24, 2015","true","17.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/recommended/368610/","orpe11","orpe11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/","474 products in account","TL;DR: An Eastern-styled rogue-like, simple in design but engaging. Good for a playthrough, but late game and NG+ are heavily unbalanced.\n\nThe first thing to note about the Enchanted Cave is it is available for free as a flash game. That version of the game stops at level 80. The version on steam is the equivalent of the 'Premium' flash version, with steam achieves and trading cards added. The second thing to note is this is not what most modern people would consider a 'rogue-like' in the traditional sense. I would call this an Eastern rogue-like, closer to Shiren the Wanderer or Azure Dreams. Each run is not separate from the others, you play the same character, with certain things getting reset on the run while keeping others.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is about delving into a randomly generated dungeon. The end goal is to reach level 100 and defeat the boss there, but individual runs are about either collecting gear, levels, money, or making progress to a checkpoint. Every ten levels has a checkpoint available that can be warped to after you find it. The rogue-like part comes in that every new run has you lose all gear gained. You keep levels and money, and certain pieces of gear called 'artifacts', but generic gear and items such as healing potions and alchemy ingredients are lost. You finish a run by using a special item that exits the dungeon. If you die on the run, you are reverted to before you started the run, losing all progress made. In essence, the game is about knowing how far you can push a run before you need to leave. There is really very little luck-based about this, as you can look at monster stats before engaging them, and they stay in one place, never moving to engage you first. The main randomness is in criticals. Basically, you do runs at a level, until you acquire artifacts that let you start comfortably at a later level, making gradual progress until you win.\n\nThere is a sort of class system, with every level letting you apply points to features that either boost your warrior abilities, alchemy, or magic. Levels also raise a stat by one rank, as do crystals found in the game or later on purchased from a merchant. Gear found improves stats, and can be enchanted with items to give additional effects that aren't gained by levels, such as elemental damage/resistance and dodge chance. All of the paths seem a bit balanced, but warrior seems to coast through on minimal effort, only needing to dab in mage for a bit to grab healing until they finish that route and can do another. By the time you finish the game, you should have one path finished, and be most of the way down another.\n\nThe faults start to show when you reach the end of your first run of the game, and in NG+. Notably, levels don't scale, so you are still getting +1 attack at level 2 all the way to level 50. Notably, with gear, crystals, and the like, that means that levels mean way, way less as you go on. Raising your attack from 2-3 has more impact than raising it from 90-91. Once you get near the end, you'll pretty much have the best gear, have it enchanted the best, and find that you barely get stronger than that. This isn't a problem really, it leaves the final boss still challenging (albeit with spamming healing potions in combat, nothing is challenging). It becomes extremely broken in NG+, as you don't get any stronger gear, monsters just get much stronger, leaving your only way to advance being the less and less effective stat ups. Enchants get better, but the only enchantment worth anything by that point is instant death chance. You can easily break the game by stacking instant death and dodge, and relying on the RNG for most enemies.\n\nAs such, overall it is a well done game, and the cracks only start to show in the late game with scalability of stats. It is still worth a play through, though perhaps better to catch on sale than pay full price.","January 16","true","109.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

While the game isn't overly complicated in its mechanics, it's able to mix things up with resistances and other types of challenges to fully take advantage of risk/reward gameplay, where you have to question attacking an enemy and what benefits it gets you. The crafting system 2 attribute system does add a layer of choice that's appreciated, and while the combat is rather simple, it can work over the long haul. The music by Grant Kirkhope does stand out and was able to be listened to repeatedly over a period of time, and honestly, it's just a solid title all around, where you want a little bit more of a thinking roguelike more then anything else.\n\nGameplay/Video:\nFirst Impressions and Gameplay: https://youtu.be/4XuFPMNCut0\n\nLists\n+:\nSimple, but works well.

And it runs well, which is the biggest boon.\n-:\nWould like to have seen a tiny bit more complexity to battle. While it's simple, over the long run it will probably wear down in terms of replayability.\nThe 3 different character trees don't lead to 3 different playstyles in my opinion like the description says. There's maybe more emphasis on certain elements, but the combat is too simple to really support that.","June 3, 2015","true","3.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","24","33","3","0"

And i must admit i was quite excited when i saw the second one poppin' up on steam.\n\nIf you ever played Lufia 2 - Rise of the Sinistrals on the SNES you should know the Ancient Cave - the optional dungeon of that game. Enchanted Cave follows the same principle. You explore a cave with 99 floors where you will only be able to go further down, not up again. Every floor is filled with monsters and treasure and you must try to find good equipment and fight you way through. If monsters get to strong you can teleport out of the cave with a special item you have to find - but you will lose all equipment you found except for special artifact gear which you are allowed to start with at your next run.\nEvery 10 floors you reach a checkpoint, meaning you can start your next run from there once discovered. Occasionely you will find a shop (usually on said 10th floors) where you can sell your crap and buy useful stuff.\n\nWhat i really enjoy compared to the first game is the implementation of a crafting system. You can't craft your own gear but improve the stuff you found for some extra stats or nice things like life regen.\nI also like the new dungeon layout. The floors are no longer plain squares with walls drawn within them which is nice. There is also some sort of skill tree now which i guess could have been more interesting than it is. The magic path is nice since you learn your spells there now instead of finding them but everything else is just minor stat improvment.\nSome of the villagers will give you quests that so far only consisted of finding specific things in the cave. Not the most interesting thing to do but it's alright for a little extra stuff to do.\n\nSummary:\nSome nice improvements over the first game. If you like rouge-lite dungeon crawling i highly recommend this one to you. The price tag is fair since i think you will at least get 10-12 hours out of it to complete it once and replayability is given for perfectionists.\n","June 3, 2015","true","14.7"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

Enemies stay in place, and you can challenge them as you please, though obviously some you NEED to fight in order to get to the next floor. Along the way, you'll earn gold and experience as you gain levels and kill enemies, and you can loot bags/crates/chests for items and equipment along the way, and collect Stat Gems that permanently increase Stats. When it comes to equipment, they come in 2 type: regular and artifact. Normally when you die in the dungeon, you'll lose ALL progress you made on that run. However there's an item called the Escape Wings, which will not only return you to the town, but will let you keep all experience and levels earned, along with all gold and Artifacts and Stat Gems collected. When you escape, all regular items are lost/destroyed, while Artifacts are kept.\n\nWhenever you gain a level, you get to choose 1 stat to permanently increase, and recieve 3 skill points to spend on the Skill Tree. The Skill Tree for the most part are passives, like increased damage, defense, magic, mana, health, etc.. Though there are Spell to get on the Skill Tree that are kept between dungeon runs. Spells like fireball and the like, though there's a few other utility spells, like one that will turn a regular item into an Artifact.\n\nThere are 100 levels in the dungeon, and every 10 levels is a shop to sell your stuff. When you make it to a shop, you'll be able to start your next run on the previous shop. So, if I made it to the shop on Dungeon Level 20, that means all future runs I have the option of starting on Dungeon Level 10. There's are pluses to starting at the beginning or an earlier level, like having time to collect money and items, which is useful if you're low on gold.\n\nThere's some other side stuff to do, like quests and secret areas that I won't go anymore into. My only real gripe is that you can't rebind keys. It's just a personal preference, but I like to keep my fingers planted on the WASD area, so being able to put the Inventory key on "F" instead of "I" would be a nice touch. You can also play the game using only the mouse, which works great, though Keyboard works just as nicely.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a casual roguelike and/or RPG.","July 3, 2015","true","10.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The first game felt more like it was about health management than anything else, lacking rewards other than gold when enemies are defeated. The added features of more loot, gold and now experience dropping from enemies changes up the game along with a graphical facelift from its previous incarnation to make a smooth game for a more casual dungeon crawling experience. My only complaint is that the shop UI and the process of getting items onto your hotbar are unintuitive.\n\nThe game is relatively easy, I've been able to fill out the warrior tree in under an hour and a half and reach level 50 without dying a single time yet.

I was looking for something that provided a mix of challenge without having to over think things. It is something of a puzzle game as well as you decide is it worth fighting a creature to get to a new section of the level or should you work around it.\n\nThe broad array of equipment choices, the ability to enchant equipment, and potion making allow you to try out a variety of combinations to find one that works for your play style. The paid version has some nice new content including new side quests, more equipment, more levles, new shop options, and new NPCs. It is well worth the $4.99 price tag. You will find yourself replying and starting over just to try new strategies. For collectors there is even an in game muesum where you can store examples of all the Artefacts you find. Completely your Artefact collection is a nice personal challenge.\n\nSome people might be turned off by the old style graphics, but as a child of the 80s I like the retro look. One other issue that might turn people off are the fact that the monsters don't move around or chase the player, but to offset that monsters often block your path and there are no ranged attacks. So unless you use magical pickaxes to tunnel around them you often have to go through a monster by killing it to get to treasure or the next floor. If they moved you could possible avoid them altogether.\n\nFinally buy the game so that the developer can make more like it!","June 5, 2015","true","32.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you die, you lose all progress since you last exited the cave, if you leave, you only keep special, golden items. If you have played through the ancient cave in Lufia 2, this is exactly that.\n\nThis game is incredibly easy, and has little in the way of customizing your character in way of skills or items. As you start to get towards the end of the game, it turns into a bit of a grindfest, making sure you have enough gear and consumables to beat the end boss.\n\nThe game is also pretty short, it would probably have taken about 3-4 hours if I hadn't died on a mini-boss after a couple of hours of play without exiting the cave.\n\nThe replayability is limited in that there is a New Game+ option, allowing you to go back to the start of the game with harder enemies, but keeping all your character progression from your previous game.\n\nThe problem is that after the grind at the end of the game, I'm not really interested in playing through it again as a New Game+.\n\nSummary\nIf you like, or are interested in trying a roguelike, by all means, pick up this game. You're not missing anything by waiting until it goes on a heavily discounted sale though.","June 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That says alot these days.  I've grown pretty sick of games that are unfinished or charge microtransactions to fully enjoy.  This RPG harkens back to the days of yore, when games were meant to be enjoyed.\n\nThe price is cheap.  The graphics are sorta cute and enjoyable to watch.  My only complaint is that you don't see the gear you equip on your toon.  It stays the same throughout the entire game.\n\nGameplay consists of doing multiple dungeon runs and keeping the gold, buffs and levels you obtain whilst inside the dungeon crawl.  You lose all gear that isn't epic level quality.  Just don't die inside the cave or you could lose hours of leveling.  You leave each cave using an item called "Wings of...something" Can't recall the name.  But they're your Oh ♥♥♥♥! spell when you're stuck and don't want to die.  These wing items will usually drop once every dungeon run.  There is some grinding involved to progress.  But with the combat animations being nice and quick, it's enjoyable to do in short spurts.","February 1","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Suffice it to say, I bought it right away since it as 50% off, if only to encourage the one-man army of a dev.\n\nThis game is kind of a rogue-like but it's somewhat hard to classify.  Wherein rogue-like games you play till you die and lose everything, in Enchanted Cave if you die you do lose everything you've earned during that run, but you can also choose to escape with a few items called artifacts and also keep your exp and skills so you get farther and farther each run.  You unlock a new checkpoint every 10 levels but can restart from an earlier checkpoint if you find the enemies are too hard for you at that point.\n\nA normal playthrough should last you about 4-6 hours, but upon beating the game you unlock NG+ which allows you to start over while keeping your artifacts, exp and skills but with much tougher enemies.","February 7","true","7.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Despite some small annoyances I mentioned earlier the game delivers what it promises, which is a fun game. Of course, it doesn’t actually reach the quality of more complicated games developed by bigger companies, but then again it also doesn’t have the problems those game have, like wide variety of bugs. In fact, I haven’t encountered any bugs so far, which is very good thing. Still, a good game for what it is.\n\nNow, the question whether to go with paid version or free to play version. I honestly see no reason why you shouldn’t buy this. The game is cheap, the paid version actually contains noteworthy improvements like more music and items, and honestly developers like the one who is behind this game actually deserve the support they can get.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Absolutely! Especially if you like rogue-lites and dungeon crawlers, and if you are unsure, then you can take a look at the browser version of the game found from Kongregate.\n\nSCORE: 8/10","June 4, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","1","6","2","0"

Each floor is procedurally generated with a random placement of monsters and treasures. The monsters don’t move and you simply move into a monster to begin fighting it.\n\nThis may seem shallow at first but very quickly becomes addicting as the real depth of the game comes from customizing your equipment set and its enchantments. Stats such as bonus damage, health regen, mana regen, and resistances have to be balanced appropriately to play the game effectively.\n\nThe game is fairly simple but despite this remained very engrossing for a long time. I always wanted to push farther to see what better gear would drop.\n\n-Playtime-\nI think a good 10 hours before completing it the first time. The game has an infinite New Game+ which can be completed and then started again at an even higher difficulty each time.\n\n-Achievements-\nThe biggest achievement was getting Completionist where you have to fill in the museum with every artifact piece of equipment. This took quite a bit of farming but I found it fun as it was just a perpetual treasure hunt and it was always exciting to open an artifact chest to see if it had an item I was missing. If you are trying for this achievement however I highly recommend that you don’t start the New Game+ as it brings a pretty large difficulty spike and will greatly slow down your farming time, especially on the lower levels. There are also achievements for maxing each of the 3 skill trees but I would recommend getting the 3rd one on a new character, otherwise be prepared for a massive grind as the exp needed to level scales up quite a bit toward the end.\n\nRecommended at full price.","March 31","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very simple in combat and very rewarding in exploration. Picture the concept of dark souls, where you lose souls every time you die. Well if a certain area in Lordran is tough, you go somewhere else and farm some souls, level up and gain new items and abilities until you are ready for the next area/ boss fight. Well in this game, you run around collecting loot in the various generated dungeon levels. Gold items you keep with you for the rest of the gme while white items dissapear once you leave the cave. The only way to leave the cave, however, is with a certain warping item you pick up. Once you warp out, you are returned to the town and all the gold items you've collected remain with you for the rest of the game but all the white ones will dissapear on return to the hub. If you die in the cave, however, you will lose all gold and white items that you have collected and then you will be transported back to the entrance of the cave. It's a very rewarding system and it made me feel like I progressed through each level of the dungeon and it caused me to actually manage my health and magic and make sure I could take down a certain foe. Whenever I felt a little overwhelmed, I would transport out of the cave (to make sure I kept my gold itmes) then I would re-eneter to go to the mercahnt and upgrade my weapon, buy health and magic potions, some armor and anything else I needed then I would venture back into the cave. If an area was too tough, I would go and revisit certain areas to level up on XP and upgrade weapons. What makes this different from needless grinding of XP through less tough enemies is that the loot respawns. I mentioned Dark Souls earlier and this is where these two mechanics differ drastically. See in dark souls (and other games, I'm not just singling out dark souls (I love the game)) loot doesn't respawn on corpses so it makes revisiting other areas much more of a hastle/ tedious rather than something you think you should do and even want to do. While they share the same risk and reward style, they differ drstically here. Now in this game, there is always the chance of finding an awesome gold weapon hidden in a secret area of the cave or in a chest guarded by some enemy. This the game feel fun and refreshing from a stale ginding mechanic you find in a lot of other games. The music in this game is also fantastic. Grant Kirkhope composed it so obviously its going to be good. I usually hate how the indie game scene sometimes rely heavily on a good musical soundtrack and then the game ends up being subpar, but the game and music are both good! One complaint I do have about the game is that there is sometime a lack of gold itmes. You can't purchase gold itmes from the merchant (at least as far as I've gotten) so you have to rely on purchases of white itmes prior to venturning forth and the itmes you find in the cave. But when you do stumble upon a gold item, it becomes your new baby. The crafting system is also very lack luster. It doesnt have the appeal that many other RPG smilar to this one have. You collect different items in the cave or buy the from the merchant but you don't really get to use them quite often and it makes them seem rather useless sometime, but the core game design is more revolving around exploration. Even though it explorartion heavy, it still doesn't excuse these two flaws to the game. This game has great replay value since it's dungeons are random, something you don't see much of now a days. Overall, this is game is right for the price and I would highly recommend it!\n\n+Superb Exploration\n+Easy Combat and Health/Magic Management\n+Great Music\n+Grinding made rewarding\n+Random dungeons keep the game fresh\n+High replay value\n-Lack luster craft\n-Shortage of gold itmes in cave\n-Can't purchase gold itmes\n\n9/10","June 13, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint is I'm not sure it explained game features that well, or maybe I skipped the tutorials? I never knew you could craft potions until I looked it up online. Also I really wished I had seen more quests before all the people dissappeared. I didn't know about that until late game, maybe you should have forced one on us, or forced a chat with a quest person. Also it's hard to tell what exactly the stats for weapons will do.\n\nAnyways, other than that I had a great time.

Strategically choosing your battles, building your character, enchanting your equipment and knowing when to escape the cave are crucial to succeed. Delve into a strange cave with a seemingly endless supply of treasure, strategically choosing your battles to gather as much treasure as possible! Find rare artifacts and traverse the skill tree to become your choice of a mage, warrior, alchemist, or a mix of skills. Craft potions or enchant your equipment with ingredients, and discover secret areas!

He hit me for up to 5250 and I had 5390 hp. Took me 360 large mana pots to win. The only way I'd survive Newgame+8 boss is to grind gems.

If you like dungeon crawlers and collecting massive amounts of loot, this game is for you. I was unsure of it at first, but it was well worth it and I really did enjoy it.

Your quest covers 100 levels, and you can only save certain gear as you progress. You make multiple runs of the cave, and you get different loot as you go. The loot can be nicely customised by other items that you find as you travel. Those items can either enhance gear, or be turned into potions. That's an excellent feature, and it means you're rewarded by using different combinations of ingredients. If you're on level 80 and you have a ton of starting ingredients, you can just turn them into potions and get some good effects.\n\nIf you're careful, you won't die in the game and your character just keeps getting better and better. It took me 25 hours to play through the game and I haven't had a character die. Since then, I have started the new game + mode, but the gear all seems really basic so I'm not sure if there's much point continuing.\n\nI certainly enjoyed the game. It's a simple game at its core, but it has enough customisation of gear, and enough skills, that the game has a surprising amount of depth.","February 18","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each floor is procedurally generated with a random placement of monsters and treasures. The monsters don’t move and you simply move into a monster to begin fighting it.\n\nThis may seem shallow at first but very quickly becomes addicting as the real depth of the game comes from customizing your equipment set and its enchantments. Stats such as bonus damage, health regen, mana regen, and resistances have to be balanced appropriately to play the game effectively.\n\nThe game is fairly simple but despite this remained very engrossing for a long time. I always wanted to push farther to see what better gear would drop.\n\n-Playtime-\nI think a good 10 hours before completing it the first time. The game has an infinite New Game+ which can be completed and then started again at an even higher difficulty each time.\n\n-Achievements-\nThe biggest achievement was getting Completionist where you have to fill in the museum with every artifact piece of equipment. This took quite a bit of farming but I found it fun as it was just a perpetual treasure hunt and it was always exciting to open an artifact chest to see if it had an item I was missing. If you are trying for this achievement however I highly recommend that you don’t start the New Game+ as it brings a pretty large difficulty spike and will greatly slow down your farming time, especially on the lower levels. There are also achievements for maxing each of the 3 skill trees but I would recommend getting the 3rd one on a new character, otherwise be prepared for a massive grind as the exp needed to level scales up quite a bit toward the end.\n\nRecommended at full price.","March 31","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
