They are very sensitive and makes it troubling to be precise during gameplay. Options and optimization are pretty bare-bone, and as a result, you're stuck with very dated and unpleasant graphics and textures. While I give props for Disney Planes: The Video Game being basic (which is good for a game being targetted for a young audience in mind), the game is mostly just going from mission to mission and completing a few tasks. Aside from trying to get a higher score per level, the levels and missions are not interesting enough to go back to previous levels and play again.\n\nOverall, this game has a specific audience in mind. Although I think it is a good kids game for its simplicity, there are flaws that makes this game boring and bland, aesthetically and in design.","December 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","21","39","6","0"
