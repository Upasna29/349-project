No playerbase, period. Just now, two hours of waiting, played one MP game. AI is too stupid so you can't really learn to play in singleplayer in preparation to non-existant MP. Almost no youtube videos (other than some reviews). No word of mouth, no advertisement. It has no existing playerbase and no way to keep new players in the game.\n\nSingleplayer... Well, AI can't play it, and given that it's a logic/tactics game, AI = content.\n\nNice game mechanics, probably one of the best for that type of the game... But without players it's useless.\n\n***\nI added my responce to a comment to this review, i think it will be helpful too.\n***\nKeith, i agree that Puzzle Strike is kinda okayish as a singleplayer. But i like Ascension much better as a deckmaking singleplayer game. It has much more different cards and effects, and you can think how to combine them together and it's fun. AI is also weak, but i have more fun playing it because i can play it like, well, a Puzzle game :) Comboing cards, making a deck, things like that.\n\nPuzzle Strike is great differently, it's great in it's simplicity. It's more like chess. But AI can't use the greatness part of Puzzle Strike simplicity :) How top ladder players play in Puzzle Strike (they're like half of the active players actually playing Puzzle Strike)? They see the cards, they see the champions, they make a winning plan and they go for it. AI here doesn't do the "analyze" and "making a plan" part, i think it just buys "good" cards and that's it. The difference is striking. Puzzle Strike is designed as a competitive game, but AI does NOT compete with the player, it just plays randomly based on card weights. AI is just too weak to make use of the best things in a game like Puzzle Strike. They're there, but AI can't show them to you. You need MP for it, but then again, there is no players. That's why i said that it's probably one of the best game mechanics in that kind of game, but unfortunately we can't enjoy it.","January 18","false","44.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","4"

I actually prefer playing this version than the boardgame as it's easier to see what's going on with action arrows, pigs etc. I've generally played this game in 4 player free-for-alls, but it's got some really great even-playfield, no grind-to-win, no pay-to-win PROPER competitive 1v1 modes too.","December 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/386740/","Dragnix","{FITH}â„¢Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Another tabletop adaption makes it's way to my channel this week, and it comes from the minds behind the old Puzzle Fighter HD. The mechanics are solid as the game is known for it's deck building elements, but can that do enough despite an interface that's lacking in several areas? Will the chips fall into place in terms of the multiplayer and the challenge that it gives? Will you go all in on aggro, or will stay back and build up your resources? Will I ask more silly questions in the description of the video? Come find out!\n\n\nSummary:\nIt's nice that there's a virtual version of the famous tabletop game, and the strategy element here has a core RPS element to it, but it's much more complicated then that. Granted, I wish the interface was a lot better: it's servicable, but it shows its browser based routes and some elements of it are particularly ugly. However, I found it to work a lot better then it's browser based counterpart, as online matches were easy to find with no connectivity issues that I could see. If you can stand that, there's a fun core game experience here that will keep your attention in the multiplayer seen, as the different characters do play reasonably different despite only having differences in the character chips. Good deck building mechanics that punish being too aggressive and not thinking about your next move, while giving you reasons to not just horde buying chips.  It's fun, I just wish it was better in the end, but you can find out via the browser based version if the game is right for you (if it works).\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/w_E828NWyxc\n\nLists:\n+:\nGreat strategy elements that work on a couple of levels. Good back and forth strategy that has you trying to get two steps ahead of your opponent.\nCharacters being the only unique chip aspect makes it feel like you've got a reasonable chance against anyone, despite maybe having a strong weakness against them.\nDeck building element does a good job of punishing negative moves but also making sure that you don't go to heavy on one strategy that can't be countered. Good Balance.\nNetwork elements work, matchmaking was quick and there's cross-platform which helps things out. No major lag or latency issues as well.\nLike the Challenge mode that helps bring a little bit of thought and understanding of mechanics, even if it can be a little confusing at times on what it truly wants you to do.\n-:\nThe interface and application implementation is ugly. Elements feel tacked on in terms of the interface, and some of the text and color choices are down right bleh.\nCould have had some animations, some things to help the presentation elements of the game, as again, it's implementation is pretty ugly.\nDoesn't save information. Even after playing a match, simple choices like who's going first reset to their default, or the chips you've chosen reset on exiting the game. Annoying.\nTutorial could be implemented better.\nDo wish there was some options in terms of gameplay regarding the choosing of chips in the bank, because it would have helped some interesting issues of siding the bank to the host players advantage.","December 24, 2015","true","7.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RayLancer/recommended/386740/","RayLancer","RayLancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RayLancer/","448 products in account","Puzzle Strike is a video game adaptation of a board game that's an adaptation of a video game called Super Puzzle Fighter. Yes, that weird Street Fighter spin-off game that plays like Tetris, but isn't quite Tetris. So how does it work? This game is actually a deck-builder similar to games like Dominion. Unlike most deck-builder, this one has a lot more interaction between players and the ultimate goal is to defeat your opponent by crashing Gems into your opponent's gem pile (similiar to filling up your screen in Tetris or Super Puzzle Fighter). The game is also a bit assymetric compared to other deck-builder games in which each player selects a character. Each character has 3 special ability "chips" (cards) that makes them different from other characters changing up how a person plays the game and the strategy they employ. There is more to the game but this, like Yomi, is easy to learn but challenging to master. The PC adaptation is solid, and I think it plays better than the physical boardgame counter-part due to everything being automated.\n\nFor more information, check out Watch It Played's Puzzle Strike Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og01q5_zbD8","December 24, 2015","true","8.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

At the beginning of your turn an ante gem is added to your pool.  At the end of your turn you buy a chip from a custom or random bank that is shared by all players.  Use the chips you buy to keep your gem pool the lowest and then KO someone else at 10+.  I'm having fun with the 4-player AI battles.

It translates well as a video board game as there's no setup, no need for randomizer apps, etc. Moreover, it lets me play when the mood strikes me rather than trying to get people over to play.\n\nThe Shadows expansion looks like fun - I'll buy the DLC later on, and will easily be buying the physical version later as well. Well done, very enjoyable, and I've already bought five more copies to gift to friends :)","December 24, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, please.\n\nBasically this is a digital version of the board game which is inspired off the old game Puzzle Fighter and the popular deck builder board game Dominion. Unlike Dominion however, there is a ton more player interaction and you get to play as cool fighting game characters in an asymmetrical yet balanced battle to the death throwing gems at each other through pile, hand, and deck management. For me, in real life and on steam, this is my favourite deck builder board game and one of my favourite board games in general.\n\nWhat's not to love?","December 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

It's a lot of fun and has a great amount of depth. The video game version of this is, however, extremely janky, confusing, and not worth your time. This is a great game ruined by horrible UI and controls. I was hoping it would be an updated version of the Puzzle Strike you find on their website but it's even jankier than that.

But the matchmaking is dead, and that speaks volumes.\n\nHere are some reasons why:\nRandom banks skew matchups far too drastically. It's a shame, because when this game works, in a fair matchup, it can be glorious.\n\nThis game either needs a chip drafting stage before the game starts (adding to gameplay length, unfortunately), or it needs to let you see the random bank and then pick your character (this is how the remaining fans currently run tournaments).\n\nAlso, the power level spread on the characters is far to wide. There are barely a handful of tournament-viable characters.\n\nThere are ample technical glitches, but the UI is totally slick.  This IS the best way to play Puzzle Strike, from an interface perspective.\n\nIn light of the game's issues, not a lot of people play it, so good luck finding opponents.","December 31, 2015","false","39.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

We played the first four expansions, then years later when the digital version came out, we've been able to play with all of them (except Adventures, as of this writing). It was a rare game that had the perfect balance of strategy, tactics, and randomness to promote table talk and interaction among players. It's an excellent game to play with friends.\n\nWith Puzzle Strike, the deckbuilding format is evolved to be more competative and aggressive, with its fascinating Crash Gem mechanic making the game feel more like a bar fight then "multi-player solitaire" as some of Dominion's detractors call it. I wouldn't go so far as to say its better than Dominion, but it definitely has a strong, competative feel that makes it exciting in ways Dominion never was.\n\nIf you like Dominion or other deckbuilders, this is an excellent game. If you are new to the genre, I'd start with Ascension or Dominion to get a feel for if that style of game is right for you. This game does have a little more of a learning curve compared to those games, and plays a bit different from other deck builders, but it is well worth the time it takes to master it.","February 28","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
