ITS SO ANNOYING.  For an otherwise quite relaxing game that sound makes me wince every 10 seconds .\n\n**Update** The above is no longer an issue!\n\nVery impressed that the developers actually listened to my wee moan. A rare thing indeed in todays gaming industry.\nI heartily recommend this game , very relaxing and a good way to unwind.\nMany thanks indeed Decayinglogic!\nI'll be sure to follow your future projects.","April 17, 2014","true","8.3"," 116 of 119 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","116","119","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/284950/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","So why do I not recommend this game yet still love the game???? Well the answer is quite puzzling...\n\nLet me begin by saying that if you enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle you will find great enjoyment within this game. There is a definite feel of working a jigsaw puzzle here and it's quite relaxing and enjoyable. The pictures are decent and give some good challenge in matching up the pieces and once you get to the larger piece puzzles it really feels like your working a real jigsaw puzzle on a table top.\n\nAnother interesting slant on this game is that in many puzzles the pieces are cut in ways you could never cut a real life puzzle. This is good in the sense that it opens up new challenges with matching up pieces and actually adds to the puzzle experience in ways that only a virtual puzzle could. It's bad in a way too though because some of these cut styles up the difficulty in matching pieces by cut to sky high levels that make it nearly impossible to do, leaving you to rely on color matching alone. If you’re looking for more challenge though this is certainly a way to get it in ways that physical puzzles could never match so I think this is certainly a positive overall.\n\nSo where does it all go so wrong?? It's a couple of things that on the lower end, smaller piece puzzles, you won't experience too badly but as you climb up to the high piece puzzles will have you ripping your hair out. The first and most obvious fault is that there is NO mid puzzle save feature. On the small piece puzzles this isn't so much an issue as you can solve them in 15-20 minutes tops. However as you approach the larger piece puzzles this becomes an issue as most people don't have all morning or night to finish a puzzle. Your only option is to leave the game running in the background of your computer, which isn't a horrible option, but sucks down your computers resources if you'd like to go play another game for a while or sucks down electricity if you'd rather just power down your computer for the night.... And there's really no excuse for why the developers couldn't have coded a simple mid-puzzle save feature for this.\n\nThe second flaw is in piece selection. The pieces float around in a "river" around the puzzle which honestly works as it allows you to see the pieces and really resembles the pieces in a box being shaken around a bit only probably better as all the pieces are right side up. Another area where virtual is somewhat better than real life. The problem occurs when you see a piece floating out there amongst all the other pieces that you know fits somewhere and you go to grab it, it's as if the program actually goes out of its way to give you every piece except the one you want.... You'll be clicking and clicking though a million pieces just to get the one you want that you can see right in front of you. Several times per puzzle I've clicked on the piece I wanted while it was clearly in the open, with my curser only touching that piece, and been given a different piece. Then when I release that unwanted piece back into the river the piece I wanted disappears from its current location and reappears somewhere else, usually in a mess of many other pieces again..... Super frustrating.\n\nAt the end of the day, because of those flaws I cannot in all fairness give this game a recommendation. These are flaws that could have, and should have been addressed by the developer before or soon after the game was released. Is there a market for virtual jigsaw puzzle games?? I think the answer is yes. Ways to improve upon the design?? First off mid-puzzle saving is a must. Second off improve the puzzle selection process and perhaps give us two to four "ponds" to place specific pieces in where they will float around separated from the river. Lastly, maybe allow for players to use their own pictures to create their own original puzzles. Maybe even have a Steam Workshop for those puzzles..... I certainly think there's a market for jigsaw puzzle games but this one has too many frustrating flaws to really grow that market...","November 1, 2014","false","93.5"," 138 of 172 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","138","172","6","0"

They'd be talking, laughing, and staring down at the surface of the table with perplexed  expressions on their faces. Their hands were in constant motion. Standing on tiptoes, you'd try to see what all the fuss was about... The table legs were so high up and you were so very small. Someone milling about would pick you up and settle you on a lap. And there to your amazement was a strange and wonderous mystery being solved. A picture of exotic wild life, mountains, a river, a famous landmark, horses galloping on an open plain, or maybe fairies and unicorns dancing under a starry night's sky filled your eyes. The picture wasn't complete but you were told that if you were good and didn't knock the strange, funny shaped pieces of cardboard to the floor, that you could help solve the picture too!\n\nIt's now been many years since I sat at a table and put a puzzle together. Many of the people I once sat across are sadly  no longer with us, having passed on. But I still remember that thrill that ran through me on "Game Night" when puzzles and board games ruled the living room! Pixel Puzzle: Japan, took me back to those fond days and made me feel that I was once again sitted at that magical card table. The imagery and audio are quite lovely. The actual puzzle pieces are designed beautifully and lock in place just like a real jigsaw puzzle. They are also nicely challenging.

There is a handful of puzzles and completing them will unlock greater difficulty ones, as well as a level increase to your profile (the ranking is only ''to be''; it won't affect your gameplay experience in any way).\nAs you may guess from the title, this is a Japan-focused game in the ''Pixel Puzzles'' series. Thus, all puzzles are set in a japanese landscape.\nHowever, as simple and relaxing this game may sound, there is a very annoying bug when picking up puzzle pieces. It's usually never the piece you click on, but the one nearby. I don't consider this a game-breaking bug but it can be very frustrating at puzzzles with hundreds of pieces, where you can barely pick them up. Not to mention, there is no ''Save'' function. If you've embarked on a 300 pieces puzzle, you need to either stay there for an hour or two and finish it, or remember the pieces' position. This is because the screenshotting option is disabled in this game.\nThe game only has one, repetitive song during puzzles. I ended up muting the game and playing my own music in the bakground, I recommend you do the same.\n\nPros: + Fun and relaxing game, excellent to pass time with;\n+ Puzzles with different difficulty levels which are unlocked as you complete easier ones;\n+the hint system is balanced, so players won't spam it;\n\nNeutral: +/- The ranking system is only there to fill the game with a new element; it doesn't do anything, but some players may like seeing the monk leveling up after completing puzzles;\n\nCons: - Picking up the piece you want is a pain; they are always moving in the background and cursor will pick up another one;\n- Only one, repetitive soundtrack;\n-Missing save button;\n\nBuy it while it's on sale if you're into the casual genre, you won't regret it.\n\nPersonal rating: 75/100 - Good","August 29, 2015","true","23.5"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/284950/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","While I enjoyed this game, and played it to completion, one particular flaw was simply to big for me to recommend it.\n\nFirst, the Good:\n\n1. It's jigsaw puzzle game on Steam!\n\n2. Plenty of pictures gives you plenty of jigsawing to do\n\n3. Different puzzles have the pieces "cut up" very differently, adding to the variety\n\n4. As you'd expect, it's pretty relaxing just slowly taking your time to work on the puzzle, and then it feels really good when the puzzle is almost completed and you can just plop the remaining free pieces in the remaining holes without any searching :)\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. The worst issue with the game - picking the puzzle piece you want out of a group of other pieces is an exercise in frustration, especially in the latter puzzles when so many pieces are floating in the river.  You can click directly on a puzzle piece, and the game then hands the piece that was hiding underneath it - over and over again.  I sometimes took me literally a dozen tries to pick up a single puzzle piece!  This one flaw by itself is what had me click the "No" for this review.\n\nThe final puzzle is by far the largest, and has 350 piece.  As soon as I started it and saw the river absolutely full of overlapping pieces, I despaired - only to find out, to my amazement, that I was flawlessly picking up every single piece that I was intentionally clicking on! 30 pieces in a row, with no mistakes - what sorcery is this???  It's as if the QA testers complained to the programmers that this puzzle was unplayable, and they fixed the issue only in the final puzzle.  Yes, it seems ridiculous, but I honestly cannot think of any other explanation.\n\n2. No way to save progress in the middle of a puzzle.  Some puzzles take hours to do, and if you exit the game, you gotta start them all over!\n\n3. The music, while pleasant enough in the beginning, just loops over and over and over, and it's the same song for every single puzzle.  Thankfully you can mute it, though that also mutes the few sound effects.\n\n4. The colors in a most of the pictures seem washed out, though maybe that's a style thing.\n\n\nThe Differences From Physical Jigsaw Puzzles Which May Be Good or Bad Depending On Your Point Of View:\n\n1. The puzzle pieces are always oriented in the proper direction, so there is never any need (or ability) to rotate them.\n\n2. When dropped on the board close to their correct spot in the picture, the puzzle pieces automatically shift and stick there.  There have been many times where I'd accidentally plop a piece down in the right spot.  This also allows you to "hunt" for the right spot by just moving a piece around the board in small increments.\n\n3. There is no way to stick two puzzle pieces together when you know they match each other, but do not know where exactly in the picture they belong.\n\n4. The only way to view the full picture of the puzzle you're solving (without taking a screenshot of the level-select screen) is with a hint-style button, which slowly lights up as you place pieces in their proper spots.  When you do use the button, it turns the board you're solving into the complete picture for a few seconds during which you can still move and place the puzzle pieces.\n\nSo yes, I mostly enjoyed the game when it was not frustrating me with the puzzle piece selection issue.  If the devs fix that, I'll switch the recommendation to Yes.","February 4, 2015","false","13.0"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","0"

I love the way this game solves the problem of displaying the unused pieces while still allowing a full frame to work the puzzle. The koi pond and "fishing" for the moving pieces is very relaxing and fits well with the theme of this puzzle series. (Edit: This feature gets less ~relaxing as you hit the bigger puzzles since it's really tough to select the piece you want.)\n\nThe artwork (both in the interface and the puzzles themselves) is very nice, and the music and sound effects also blend well with the overall theme. I also like the way the monk "levels" up as you solve puzzles, it just adds incentive to keep going.\n\nUnfortunately, the pieces don't rotate and you can't connect pices that aren't already in the correct spot within the puzzle frame. You can, however, lock pieces into place by luck or trial and error, even if you have nothing adjacent in place. I really wish this game had a save feature that let you save your progresss as you work the puzzle. If you only want to spend a few minutes at a time playing, you have to start again from the beginning.\n\nBasically if you like working jigsaw puzzles but hate the effort of setting up all the pieces while sacrificing table space for the time it takes to finish  (not to mention keeping your cats away) then this is a great game for you. It's also a good time spinner when you just want a chill game that doesn't take a lot of concentration.","August 30, 2014","true","15.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

As the title suggests, the focus is on beautiful Japanese scenes that are revealed as you progress through the nineteen puzzles that are available.The basic goal is to assemble a picture by fitting together the puzzle pieces. The puzzle pieces come in all shapes and sizes so you have to pay attention to the image and the shape of each piece to figure out where it fits into the picture. Puzzles in this game range from ones with 60 pieces to one with a whopping 350 pieces. Instead of using the box cover as a reference as you would with a traditional jigsaw puzzle, this game gives you a blank slate to work with. You can view a small picture of the puzzle before attempting it, but after that you are essentially working blind. As you put together the pieces an "I Ching" meter is filled which, when completely full, allows you to view the full picture for a few seconds.Each puzzle in the game not only has a different image, but the actual shapes of the pieces differ as well. Some of the puzzles have pieces with very strange shapes that you won't see in real-life and it adds another layer of challenge. You don't have to worry about time limits or objectives though. The visuals are rather nice for a casual game and I quite liked the Japanese scenes of bridges, pagodas and cherry blossoms. Like the gameplay, the audio is very relaxing with some soothing tunes and the sound of a shishi-odoshi.If you are looking for a nice relaxing game where you don't have to worry about quick reflexes then you can't go wrong with Pixel Puzzles: Japan.","September 17, 2014","true","17.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

The music is soothing and the puzzles make lovely pictures.  There are 26 achievements that are fun to get.  It took me almost 20 hours to get them all.\n\nThere are three drawbacks.  First there is no save feature.  So you have to complete each puzzle before leaving the game or start over.  Some of the harder puzzles took me a couple hours or so to complete so this was quite annoying.  Second the piece size decreases since they cannot increase the puzzle size.  If you have a small computer screen or poor eyesight this may make things difficult.  Third a few of the puzzles make it hard to pick up the piece you want you have to grab other pieces and move them away from the piece you want in order to grab it.\n\nEven with these drawbacks it is an enjoyable experience and I am glad to have purchased the game.

(But not too much)\n\nYou have 19 main puzzles, which vary in size and difficulty and 2 bonus puzzles that must have been added in later on.

Simple!\n\nThe only problem I had with this game was that towards the end, the bigger puzzles with around 300 or so pieces in the water, it became harder and more tedious trying to pick out the right pieces you want. Although it’s not all that hard to get around so that’s as far as you are going to get in terms of stress.\n\nTo 100% the game you just complete every puzzle. That’s it. It’s an easy one.\n\nThe scenes are nice Japanese themed scenes, some are harder then others but in general they are all nice to look at.\n\nAll in all it’s a nice little game to steer you away from the bigger more stressful games that you may have in your games library.\n\n\nTL;DR : It’s a nice relaxing little jigsaw puzzle game, it’s pretty straight forward and it’s an easy 100%ed game.\n","May 3, 2015","true","11.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I LOVE jigsaws, but find myself unable to partake in many because I have so few flat surfaces around my home, and I also have quite a few cats that are always determined to chew and eat the pieces. Pixel Puzzles allows the player to piece together jigsaws without the hassle.\n\nThere are a few pros and cons to the game when compared to regular jigsaws that I thought I'd point out. For one, the puzzles are extraordinarily easy for those of us who are used to piecing together 500 or 1000 piece + jigsaw puzzles. Why? The top tier puzzle is, I believe, only 300 pieces, for one thing. Another thing is that the pieces are always rightside up; that is, you never have to turn pieces around clockwise or counter-clockwise to try different sides in different places. When you place a piece in its respective spot, it "clicks" into place, which can be seen as a pro and a con. For one thing, that's convenient, but for another, sometimes I would place a piece in about the area I thought it would go, and it would snap into place, taking away the challenge of guesswork, trial and error. There were also a few times I'd grab pieces that were unique to save them for later, only for them to snap into place simply because I'd placed them on the board in just the right place, when I'd had no intention on placing it yet.\n\nMany reviews state the lack of a save feature as a flaw, but I had no trouble with this. I'd sit down for an hour and knock a few of them out. I 100% the game without knowing whether or not there was a save feature, since I never needed it. The puzzles have so few pieces even in the top tiers that 45 minutes to an hour is the most you will likely need to set aside.\n\nThe one flaw that actually DID bother me that others have mentioned is the piece selection. Unused pieces float around the borders of the puzzle area in a pool of water, and they can overlap while floating. If you see a piece you want, it can take a few tries to pick the right one, and this can, admittedly, be infuriating. I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and one of my "obsessions" is that I have to complete the border of a jigsaw puzzle before placing any middle pieces. This one flaw had me reeling quite a few times, because I'd have my eye on a border piece and kept trying incessantly to pick it up, only to pick up dozens of middle pieces in the process. This was pretty time consuming, since I couldn't progress in the puzzle personally until I had the border complete, and this sometimes would take picking up half of the entire puzzle's pieces and setting them aside to accomplish.\n\nThe last issue with the game is that I couldn't find a way to view what the completed puzzle would look like once I was putting it together. So in the midst of a puzzle, the player can't pick up a piece and check the "box", if you will, to guess just about where it will go. In the end, while this is technically an issue, I didn't mind it. It presented a challenge in the game that I enjoyed taking on due to the fact that the game is easier than regular jigsaws.\n\nAll in all, if you like jigsaws, you will probably enjoy this, and I highly recommend it for those of you who find it hard to make the room for physical jigsaws, as this is the next best thing. While the game is fairly short, I thought it was a great deal as I got it on sale and I ended up paying less than $1.00 per hour of playtime, which is a great value. I highly encourage the developers to consider more pixel puzzle games with other varieties of subject matters, as I'll definitely be supporting future releases.","November 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This one didn't disappoint me either! With that being said I wouldn't pay full price since there are some serious limitations to the game. I picked this up for around $1; I would look to spend no more than $3-4 even if you love puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are anywhere from 60-350 pieces; once you start getting into the higher puzzle count it does get quite hard! There are 21 puzzles and 26 achievements to complete. This game will definitely take you longer than 12 hours to complete all puzzles.\n\nAll of the pieces are floating around the border, so once you get to 350 puzzles you will run into some serious frustration when grabbing a specific piece. I also wasn't thrilled with the puzzle images; they felt very generic. It seems like they went for license free images instead of having amazing pictures to put together.\n\nIt's worth $2.99-$3.99 based on the length and quality of puzzles.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

This should indicate that this is a game where 100%-ing is relatively easy. Overall I would say Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a good relaxing experience under several conditions:\n1. You enjoy jigsaw puzzles (surprise!).\n2. You like or at least do not mind oriental-themed images (well it says "JAPAN" in the title after all).\n3. You do not rush yourself (or, in case you are not prepared to alt+tab out of the game at any given time you don't play the last 3-4 levels).\nWell 1 is pretty much obvious in of itself.\nConcerning 2 I have to say that the pictures chosen for puzzles (again from the point of view of someone interested in South-East Asia and its beauty) are splendid and wonderful. Looking at them is a pleasure. The accompanying sounds of a water pipe and what does seem to be a shamisen are very helpful in relaxing. They are letting all your troubled minds go away and let you settle down well. The music seems to adapt to your actions and plays more intensively the more pieces you match and the faster you do it. There also some "interactive" sounds available for playing with koi or puzzle pieces (in particular, there is a very satisfying sound when the piece touches the sand). The sand color can also be varied to better outline your puzzle pieces.\nNow it is 3 that I would like to emphasize. The last puzzles are so complex and huge (many small pieces) that, if you are trying to rush yourself through them, (e.g. for the achievements) you might feel a bit frustrated. And the game does not save your progress so your only way of taking breaks is to alt+tab out its window. So do not hurry!\nMore than that there are two additional problems: in the end there are SO many pieces it is quite impossible to fetch the right ones (the ones your see and want to grab) out of your koi pond as they overlap too much and you pretty much have to drag out whatever you can manage to grab with your cursor "hand".\nThe last problem I have personally had was a bit subjective (perhaps, people with bigger/better screens would not have it). The very last puzzle had the most pieces and they were so tiny that the "reflection" effects, which the game adds on their borders to make the pieces look more volumetric, obscured some of the fine details of the picture (and there were A LOT of fine details there). So in the very very end of the puzzle I basically had to exhaustively try various combinations to fit the pieces in.\nAgain all of the above is NOT a problem, if you take breaks and just chill yourself out to the ambient sounds, enjoy the beautiful views and do not rush yourself forward. If you want easier and more relaxing experience - just play earlier levels again, they provide just that in spades.\nOverall I DO recommend to try out this game, especially if you see it on sale where it can be really really cheap.","October 4, 2014","true","24.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

If you charge up the "i-ging" symbol in the right upper you'll get a complete view of the picture for 10 seconds.\nThe pictures you puzzle are mainly impressions of japanese culture or locations.

The game is nicely designed in terms of UI graphics, but there are two moments that lead to huge frustration:\nFirst, the detection of what puzzle piece you want to take is horrible. So it comes down most of the time to randomly getting a piece, throwing it away, etc, or clearing the route of the piece you want per right-click and hoping you can somehow catch it.\nSecond, some puzzles have too large spaces where absolutely nothing is with the exception of one color. This makes the game coming down to trial and error, clicking through numbers of absolutely identical looking pieces and hoping it fits.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics itself are nicely done, as I said, but the motifs for the puzzles are sometimes poorly chosen.\n\nMusic:\nThe music is annoying. One sample sounds like taken from the end of a Settlers 4 tune, together with exactly the same annoying bling sound that makes you think your microwave has finished working / your door has ringed / whatever you have that sounds like it. The sound effects are nothing special as well. I turned it off and heard my MP3s instead.\n\nControls:\nThe game is played entirely with the mouse, but unfortunately it is often impossible to get exactly the puzzle piece you want since - if several are above each other - a certain one is always picked instead of the visible one you click.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall you get a jigsaw puzzle game that is frustrating after you did half of the puzzles. The achievements are easy to do, however, they just require a lot of time and frustration tolerance. You can expect taking around 12 hours to solve all puzzles, which also gives you almost all achievements. The two you don't have by then are done in seconds and you can find out what to do by their picture.\nYou can find jigsaw puzzle simulators on the internet that are more fun since at least you can pick the pieces you want there. Also don't get confused by the title: Apart from the puzzles showing Japanese scenes, there is nothing about Japanese culture, so this isn't a game for the hardcore Nippon fans either.\n\nRecommended:\nOnly if you get it cheap and hunt achievements. Otherwise try some free jigsaw puzzle games on the internet instead! If the controls are ever fixed, you can get it, and the developer still actively patches the game. So please compare this to the actual version (this review was written on 1 September 2014).","August 31, 2014","false","12.0"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

I did three more puzzles, getting an achievement for each one, and an achievement for completing five puzzles.

Well, it seems that only my website got the privilege. I'm repairing the error now.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Japan is a game where you have to rebuild an image which is a Japanese landscape. Each time the puzzle is completed, you unlock new ones, with more pieces (it can go over 300!). The pieces are floating in the pond, with a koi wandering around. Some of them hide a bonus that, once completed, can be used though I don't remember what it's doing - if I have it used at all.

As you don't know what's the image looks like (I suppose that the bonus is about showing for a few seconds the whole picture), you have to relay on the nuances of the color.\n\nAs it's the first game in the series, there are negative points: taking the pieces isn't easy. Indeed, you want to take one but you're ending up with the one that was passing under it or around it. It lacks also of a saving feature: if you have to interrupt your game, you will have to redo the puzzle from the beginning.

Use it to unwind! If not, I don’t see how this game would differ from the real thing enough to show you the joy of matching pieces for hours on end.\n\n\nRecently Indiegala had a free giveaway of Pixel Puzzles: Japan and Commando Jack so that’s how I came about this game. The most I’d heard of Pixel Puzzles: Japan was from achievement threads on the forums and how it was an easy finish(?). The achievements may be straight forward enough, but this game, like the monk that smiles peacefully at you through the whole experience, will make you start twitching like a broken robot (it ain’t easy). I spent 10.5 hrs, spanning two days finishing this game.\n\nWhen I pick it up I’m thinking this’ll be easy as I’m an intermediate puzzle completist and completionist. This was a calculated presumption as when I was twenty one, I had a crazy stalker who scared my family and me so intensely that for a while (until we sorted the whole situation out) I would be cooped up at home and with a fixation of my own, jigsaw puzzles. I’d start at the living room table and end up moving to the floor for space. Family members would come and go to help with the progress and basically it would be hours of just staring at a bunch of puzzle pieces. This went on for a few months and by the end of it I was a fairly confident matcher of jigsaws. I also found some fantastic jigsaw puzzle enthusiast friends along the way! Even without the relaxing chimes and trickle-clunk repertoire of the shishi-odoshi (bamboo water pipe), which can be enjoyed whilst playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan, jigsaw puzzles are the epitome of equanimity and tranquillity. Some people wonder how exactly the tedious matching of a couple of hundred jigsaw pieces can ease stress. Most I know tend to feel better when they have something to keep them busy. Jigsaw puzzles enhance this experience by giving you improved concentration and a zen state of mind.\n\nThe first two hours of my play time sprung from my idiocy of not knowing how to start the game. I had no idea I was meant to choose one of the lower levels to the left and then press the black and white go button to the bottom left of the screen to start my journey. So I spent 2 hours piecing together two high level puzzles and failing to level up for it. Like actual puzzles, the more pieces in the puzzle, the higher the replay value is so even with the actual 8.5 hours I took to complete this game, I bet I could play it over a few more times before getting bored. I actually had fun playing the harder levels straight off the bat even though it was challenging.\n\nThe puzzle pictures are pretty and pleasant and everything is simplified with just you and your mouse clicking away. You have a koi pond surrounding your “puzzle board” where a nishikigoi swims around with the pieces of your puzzle. Puzzle pieces keep floating around the pond and it will be difficult to “fish out” the exact piece you’re looking for because of this. You click the piece you’d like to use and put them on the board in front of you and keep looking for jigsaws to make your final picture. The board can be viewed in a variety of colours which will help later on if you’ve misplaced pieces at the end. It is possible to take the koi out of your pond and place it into your bamboo stick (part of achievements). When you place pieces on your board there are two points to consider. One is that when your piece is put onto or very near its proper place, it’ll automatically shift into that spot (handy). This means you can use this when you can’t quite place a puzzle piece but you know whereabouts it may go. The second is a little cheekier and visibly up voted in Pixel Puzzle: Japan’s community hub as a cheat method. You can pile pieces directly on top of each other so that when you click the pile, the pieces will be selected in order from left to right of the actual puzzle. It’s simple and effective even if it isn’t placed quite on top of each other and isn’t in perfect order, but this play method will bore you so I recommend you don’t do it unless you’re near the end of a puzzle and would just like to stack pieces so you don’t lose any of them. I’ve already mentioned this twice so I might as well articulate this problem; you may lose sight of the last 1-2 pieces of a puzzle when you’re close to finishing it because it’ll be on top of some other puzzle piece and camouflage itself. This isn’t too bad because when you find the correct spot for a piece and it clicks into place, you can no longer move it. So when you lose a final piece and can’t find it, just drag your cursor around until a random piece moves. This is in relation to one of my favourite parts of this game because with physical puzzles, you’re constantly left with extra identical pieces and missing pieces that you have to send out for which is the downside of physical jigsaw puzzles. I no longer have to fret till the end, wondering if I’m going to be left minus a puzzle piece. Hooray! Another lovely part of this game is that puzzle pieces have the wackiest shapes. Some look like various animals, others are swirling like something Dr. Seuss made and are very cool. Though first impressions make it seem daunting, the original shapes will work out in favour of your game play as it’s easier to spot pieces which fit.\n\nThe first few levels aren’t necessarily in order of difficulty. I find lines easy and flowers hard so the levels fluctuated for me but by the last few levels, difficulty rises progressively and steeply. Yet it was always rewarding to see the final completed puzzle image (you don’t see a clear image of the original picture beforehand) as a fan of Japanese culture (the theme).\n\nEven with a simple game like this there were points I found were in need of improvement. There isn’t a save button so if you feel tired and want to rest your eyes a bit or try and pick it up tomorrow, TOUGH! You either lose your progress or keep pinching yourself so you won’t fall asleep. I literally kept falling asleep in the middle of one puzzle last night and I finished it in twice my average completion time. I also didn’t enjoy how small the puzzle pieces became later on as they grew in quantity, because I use a laptop and though I’m not sure what it looks like on a PC screen, I was forcefully squinting by the end.\n\nAt the end of the day, Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a great addition to any puzzle lover’s game collection and though I was gifted it for free, the cheap $0.69 price tag is quite agreeable.","March 18, 2015","true","10.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/white_rider/recommended/284950/","white_rider","White Rider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/white_rider/","682 products in account","So it's a jigsaw puzzle game with pictures of famous Japanese tourist spots and attractions like Himeji Castle, Osaka Castle, the gardens of Nijo Castle, and more. Controls are pretty self-explanatory, click and hold the left mouse button to drag pieces around and if you want to remove a non-locked piece from the field, you press the right mouse button. Fairly simple premise, but I mean, it's a jigsaw puzzle game, it shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nWhat's annoying about this game is how the pieces behave when they're not on the playing field.\nAll of the pieces of the puzzle inhabit the border surrounding the upper and left sides of the frame, and these pieces don't stand still. Instead they're like little cardboard pieces continuously floating in any random direction while in a body of water. And it's really annoying when there's over 200 pieces in the puzzle and each individual piece is tiny. You can click and drag away the pieces you don't need and they'll teleport to another part of the frame. There's no "safe spot" aside from within the puzzle frame to store pieces for later and again, when there's over 200 pieces to work with, it's hard to keep track of some pieces and knowing whether you'll need that piece now or later.\n\nAnother minor problem with this game is the lack of a save feature. What if I don't want to do the last 350 piece puzzle all in one sitting? I guess I would walk away from the computer, but what if I want to stop and play another game on Steam? It doesn't matter if I've just put down the first five pieces or I've finished a quarter of the puzzle because I have to decide if I want to see that puzzle to the end or completely drop my progress and start fresh the next time I start up PPJ. It's a minor annoyance, more so for the later puzzles.\n\nSome other small nitpicks...There's a restart button and a home button that's very close to the bottom of the frame of the puzzle. I've never accidentally hit either of these buttons while doing a puzzle, but basically...there's no prompt. If you hit the reset button, the entire puzzle resets. If you hit the home button, the game takes you right back to the main menu. A prompt would have been nice. There's also no real reference of the picture of the puzzle that you're trying to complete. Every now and again after you correctly place a piece down on the puzzle you can fill this powerup that lets you see the completed picture for a few seconds, but I've rarely been able to take advantage of this ability. The only time I really, absolutely needed it was for the last (non-bonus) puzzle.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this game though. It's a pretty good substitute if you're like me and want to play with jigsaw puzzles but lack the surface area in real life to devote your time to a 1000 piece puzzle.","July 16, 2014","true","16.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Kinda waste of potential here, but it would have been fine, if only the interface was good. The whole idea of puzzles swimming in a pond might have worked, if the controls actually worked properly, it's fine untill you get to the puzzles with more pieces when it becomes a nightmare trying to get the piece you actually want to pick from the pond. The pieces stack on top of each other, with no way to tell which one is actually on top, you would think the one that appears on top would be the one you pick after clicking it, it doesn't happen. While it works like that on board, the pond seems to be completely random.\nThe hitboxes of pieces dont' match their shape, and are larger than the piece, almost impossible to take one if its covered, even if only half, without digging through all the pieces on top. Also, sometimes instead of picking one piece game randomly decides that you surely wanted to pick all of them in the cursor area and resets them all to the pool.\n\nTL;DR Standard puzzles, nothing fancy, except rage inducing controls.

I had a 1500-piece puzzle of a meticulously-detailed cartoon space station when I was a kid that probably messed me up for life, dooming me to an eternity of sifting through little cardboard pieces. Pixel Puzzles: Japan has managed to sate my hunger for puzzles for a good many hours, and for that I am grateful.\n\nYou get a total of 21 puzzles to assemble, most arranged in a series of levels to unlock. Once you complete a couple in your current level, the next level unlocks, with higher levels having more pieces. The smallest puzzles are 60 pieces, and the largest is only 350, so don't expect any marathon jigsawing here. Each image is a filtered photograph of some quintessentially Japanese thing, with your loose pieces floating around in a koi pond and the frame for assembly a sort of zen garden. The presentation is lovely and soothing, with peaceful music playing over the animated monk and fishes. You can even poke a few things in the background if you need a little break from puzzling.\n\nPieces snap into place once you get them in roughly the right spot, so you can do a little guessing to fill in harder parts. Sadly you cannot snap individual pieces together before finding their place on the board, but with puzzles this small that's generally not a problem. What is a problem is how difficult it can be to grab the piece you want from the pond on the larger puzzles. Something about the mouse selection is terribly random at times, which can be a bit frustrating if you're trying to nab an elusive corner piece. Still, there's a nice variety of scenes, and the pieces for each puzzle have different and unique connections that make them distinct.

Worse is that this could have been easily avoided. The puzzle pieces, when not on the board, float around. On top and under one another. When you see a piece you want to pick up, it will grab every single other piece first, and by the time you've cleared out all the pieces around it, it has moved under a new bunch and you have to continue on clicking pieces you don't want. This is NOT an exaggeration. And it doesn't matter if it's at the very top of all the other pieces. I clicked over 40 pieces (I counted) before finally picking up the one I wanted. This, coupled with the fact that two pieces will not stick to one another (as they would in real life) unless they are in their final position, makes it very annoying to put pieces together just to move them again one by one when you find where they're supposed to go. Fix these two things, and it'll be the perfect jigsaw puzzle game. Currently, I cannot recommend.","May 11, 2014","false","3.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Consider the conclusion pf this review if you are thinking of buying it for the full price.\n\nFirst, let me say this; I am extremely addicted to all kinds of jigsaw puzzles. I have completed at least 50 different jigsaw puzzles which have 1000+ pieces, including the former world record 24,000 piece puzzle. I have played endless amount of different jigsaw puzzle Flash games I've found on the internet. I often see myself doing jigsaw puzzles in my dreams. Hell, while trying to fall asleep, eyes closed, I see myself connecting puzzle pieces.\n\nSo, using my experience as a source of opinion, what I think the game is:\nPixel Puzzles: Japan is a jigsaw puzzle game which\n1) does NOT let you connect pieces with each other, instead you have to connect the pieces to the field\n2) the playing field has the exact same size as the puzzle itself, so you have no extra space and the field can get crowded quite fast\n3) does NOT let you rotate the pieces, which in my opinion, takes away quite a lot of fun\n4) has the pieces floating around in a tub, causing the player to pick up the wrong one even if youdid not misclick (when pieces are stacked it does not always take the piece from the top layer)\n5) has an extremely ridiculous storyline and not in a good way.\n6) is not much better than some of the free Flash jigsaw puzzle games found online\n\nSo why do I still recomment it? Because (besides the fact that I'M ADDICTED TO THESE TYPES OF GAMES; SEND HELP), the theme of the game is relaxing, all the pictures are spectacular and tolerable to put together. I myself prefer to hear my own playlists, but as much as I've listened to the game sound it is calming and when the game starts to frustrate me, the audio helps me chill down. And I'm not sure why, but if a game has achivements I immideatly consider buying it, so if you're into that one can get quite a fast 100%, if they have some nerve.\n\nAll in all, this game has a common playstyle like most of the Flash games found online, that are free, but what makes it stand out is the atmosphere of the game. For the full price I would not recommend this game since you can take any free game found online and listen to some Zen music on the background and get pretty much the same feeling, but 2€ is not that much for the actual feeling. I do not regret my decision of buying this game.","September 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I do enjoy the various piece shapes especially in the first column like the trees or the pagodas.\nHowever the main down sides are: 1)no save feature while in progress, 2) As the pieces become progressively smaller you see less detail. 3) While making the pieces in the tray float back and forth is pleasing visually it becomes an annoyance when you can not grab the piece you want because another piece either gets in the way or the piece is so small and the tray so crowded you grab another piece by mistake.\nOverall I'll give this a 6/10, it shows a lot of promise but still needs some work.

There aren't many, so I don't have much to compare it to. I used to play a flash game online called Jigsawce (which I'm not sure if it exists anymore) and it has a few ideas that I think would be an improvement:\n1. Multiplayer would be great. It's a relaxing game, and it would be great to put together a puzzle with your friends while talking or typing to each other.\n2. Puzzle pieces don't stick together. In this game, the piece will only lock in place if you place it in the correct spot on the board, which means puzzle pieces can't stick together just by finding the correct adjacent piece.\n3. Random images. The game shows you what the puzzle will look like when it's completed while you're choosing the level you want. It's more rewarding when you don't know what the puzzle will be when it's finished. My friends and I would always try and guess what it was going to be a picture of before we got too much put together.\nBut if you like relaxing jigsaw puzzle games, you'll like this.

Ya got a million pieces and you gotta put 'em back together, simple as that.\n\n\nPixel puzzles Japan does a good job at recreating the experience of a jigsaw puzzle, not that that's entirely difficult, but it's still a rather enjoyable experience. The core of the game, other than just putting puzzles together, is to complete a number of puzzles that picture Japanese landscapes and structures so that your monk dude evolves or something into a better monk, and you unlock more puzzles. There are six 60 pieces puzzles that you start out with before eventually unlocking five 112 piece puzzles, four 153 piece puzzles, three 220 piece puzzles, and finally one 350 piece puzzle. After some updates, the game also has two extra 220 piece puzzles that you can put together at any time.\n\n\nThere's an options menu, because that's the most important thing about this game:/s:, where there's two volume sliders for music and SFX, along with toggles for V-Sync, HD-Mode (Whatever that is), and fullscreen (Which can also freely be toggled during a puzzle). What a time to be a PC gamer amirite? Other options that can be seen when working on a puzzle is the ability to change music tracks (Though I never found it too useful, there's not a whole lot of music and a few of the tracks are simple 3-second shamisen riffs or something), and the ability to change the color of the sand behind the puzzle pieces, which I can only assume is there purely for asthetic purposes.\n\n\nAnyway, the puzzles themselves! It's mainly just what you think it is, you put pieces together to eventually form a complete picture. There are some advantages to it being a video game and not a physical puzzle though, such as the inability to lose/destroy pieces. All puzzles are also cut into abstract shapes unique to the puzzle you're working on, like pagoda or tree shaped indents; it's pretty cool and give some character to the puzzle. Most significantly though is "Power of the I-Ching" feature: Around the board will be hidden yin-yangs that you collect when you put down a piece; collect eight of them and you can activate the Power of I-Ching to see the complete picture for a brief period of time, helping you get some particularly tricky pieces into place; you can do this multiple times depending on how many yin-yangs you collect. You don't have to use it though, and you can activate it any time after you collect eight yin-yangs.\n\n\nThat's about where it ends though, other than that it's just a bunch of puzzles with calming, unintrusive Japanese music playing over them. I found it very relaxing, and I did eventually make my way through all the puzzles.\n\n\nBUT!\n\n\nThat doesn't mean there aren't any problems with this game! Infact, it has quite a few simple, yet glaring, problems that make the game harder than it needs to be.\n\n\nFirst of all, every piece that makes up the puzzle will be floating in a koi pond near the side of the board. They all just kinda slowly drift into and bump off of walls until you pick them up and put them on the board. It's a nice effect, but hot dayum does it cause problems down the line. Each piece has a HUGE hitbox, so lets say you finally found a piece you've been scouting out for, and when you go to click on it, you pick up 37 1/2 of the other pieces before you finally get the one you wanted if you didn't lose it in a sea of virtual cardboard picture fagments. On top of that, when you drop a piece into the pond, it teleports it and every piece around it to a set "Spawn point" (I'm fairly certain this is because letting go of the left mouse button drops a piece, but instead of coding the game to simply drop the piece, it right clicks where you dropped it (Right-clicking sends every piece you click on back to the "Spawn point")). So if you're rapidly picking up pieces you don't want and dropping them carelessly, you can end up teleporting the piece you want back to a cloud of other puzzle pieces.\n\n\nOh, and remember how I said you can't lose pieces?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6PlRXhI.gif\n\nSince pieces on the board aren't highlighted, or don't highlight themselves when you mouse over them, I've had multiple occasions where I'm about to finish a puzzle or a section of the puzzle, only to lose last piece I needed because it decided it's goal in life was to turn into a chameleon and hide among the completed puzzle. Maybe it's just me, but that usually got me stuck for a few minutes, especially since there's no button to send every unplaced piece back to the pond, just one to reset the whole puzzle.\n\n\nBut those can be seen as simple coding oversights or something. While I think those are due for some fixing, the true crime is that you can't save your progress! Once again, this doesn't entirely matter on the easier puzzles, you'll complete them within ten, maybe fifteen minutes. But as you go on, puzzles can take almost an hour to complete; the final 350 piece puzzle took me over an hour and a half! You'll have to sit there until that puzzle's completed, or you'll have to window the game and let it run behind other things you're doing. That's dumb, why in the world is that a thing? Even with the Power of I-Ching, many pieces are so small that they'll be a solid color that belongs in a much larger blotch of that color, meaning I-Ching is powerless when it comes to anything near a couple hundred pieces.\n\n\nHowever, in spite of these issues, I did manage to complete all of the puzzles the game had to offer. I would suggest to the devs at Decaying Logic try to fix these problems, considering that this is only one in a series of, currently, four jigsaw puzzle games they've created, all of which probably have the same problems (Not that I'd know yet). All in all, I'd say it's a rather promising game if you're into Jigsaw puzzles, or need something to kill some time, or maybe you're grandmother has a Steam account, I dunno. The game is seven dollars, however, and I'm not sure I could reccomend full price. Maybe if it goes at a 50% discount?\n\n\nI guess it's also got trading cards.\n\n\nThis is all, of course, my humble opinion in the end. Cross-reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you.\n\n\nBottom Line: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a game to get if you're a casual. Or not, who the hell and I to know? Probably better than Angry birds.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","May 11, 2015","true","17.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I mean who doesn't like a good jigsaw puzzle? This is just it, only in digital edition. As the title says, this is about Japan so you get pictures of various motives and places from Japan to puzzle out. On one side this is somewhat easier than normal jigsaw since you can get lucky and randomly hit the right place for your piece which is then locked there. On the other, this adds another dimension to normal game by having you pick floating pieces of the puzzle from the water. With that we get to the only real problem the game has. Said picking of the floating pieces flat-out sucks in the latter puzzles. You will see the piece you want, you will click on it, and you'll get another, seemingly random, piece. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥. I got around it by moving some of the pieces to the table, that reduces the number of them in the water which then pretty much solves the problem. Of course it's not perfect since you'll then have a mess on the table but it worked for me. That said i was afraid when i got to the last picture, which is a behemoth of the 350 pieces, that i will never solve it due to the picking shenanigans but for some reason it worked perfectly there. How that is even possible is beyond me.\n\nAll in all i had a great 10 hours with it, even if it was frustrating at times, and i will gladly recommend it to anyone.

I bought it when it was on a 90% sale and it gave me around 11 hours of gameplay (without repetition). What I like about this game is that the difficulty increases as you do the set of 20 puzzles. There is however one very frustrating outlier - puzzle nr 12. Across the levels, the puzzles pieces vary in their shapes (e.g. some have "spears" poking out, others are curved) which keeps them interesting. I like the Japanese music and theme and I absolutely love that you, the monk, grow a beard and your hair turns grey the further you get into this game. Now with all of this being said there are 2 big issues with this game. First of all, there is no save feature! I had to leave my computer running overnight to complete a puzzle, because I simply didn't have 2-3 hours straight (and patience) to complete it. Secondly, the puzzle pieces keep moving on your screen, meaning that you will end up picking up the same piece a dozen of times, without wanting to do so, simply because it's on top of others/in the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/284950/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","The object is simple, grab jigsaw pieces floating in a pond along the top and side edge of the screen and assemble them into a picture in the middle. No timer. No real special abilities or upgrades. No contrived storyline. Just a neat little way to pass some time and look at some pretty pictures.\n\nComplexity is added along the way by increasing the piece count of new puzzles or by tackling a picture with fewer unique, easily identifiable features, but the most noticeable addition is the actual "cut" of the pieces with each new stage. Initially we're introduced to the more conventional shapes we'd expect to see jigsaw pieces to come in, but as you progress things are mixed up by having the interlocking segments of the pieces cut into shapes relevant to the picture for that puzzle. So, a watery picture might have pieces with interlocking segments in the shape of waves, for example, or another set might have tiny little temples or trees connecting each piece (though no Godzilla shapes are anywhere to be found, sadly). It's a really fresh take on an old formula that manages to hold your interest and keep you guessing for longer than it might have otherwise, but thankfully this really helps it to stand out.\n\nAnother factor which makes it stand out is its presentation. Everything is presented with an air of tranquillity, from the constant gentle twangs of various Japanese string instruments, to the flow and splashing of water throughout that makes you want to go to the toilet at least once every puzzle set. Visually, there's no great flare or anything flashy going on, everything is clean and simple and in keeping with the overall style and tone of the game helping it make for a sedate and pleasant experience.\n\nDuring my time with the 21 puzzles (19 regular, unlockable sets, and 2 "bonus" sets that are unlocked from the beginning but don't seem to count towards overall progress, oddly), I only found myself having any difficulty with two of the sets, which was partly down to the finale's piece count, but also the lack of distinct features on their pictures, which is one of the few minor complaints I'd have with the game. I know that the colours and shapes in each picture scene has to be kept relatively similar throughout, otherwise you'd find every piece way too easily, but that doesn't mean the images have to be uninteresting. It would have been nice to assemble something that was a greater showcase of Japan and its culture, like pedestrians crossing the Shibuya intersection or some talking toilets or a schoolgirl underwear vending machine. But, instead, we have to be content with some temples or golf courses. Which are OK... I guess.\n\nAnother minor gripe I had with it was the lack of a save feature. This isn't a problem for the easier early stages, but towards the end I could see it being a real issue for some as you might want to put an hour or so aside for a couple of the later, harder sets. Another, more pressing pain in the ♥♥♥, though, was actually selecting the pieces from the pond. Again, this isn't so much a concern at the start, but by the end the pond is so full of moving pieces that grabbing one out of it becomes a real problem, to the extent that more often than not the piece I clicked on wouldn't be what came out and I'd appear to have some near by random piece instead, with me having to remove all the unwanted surrounding pieces before finally being able to get the one I wanted. A really strange oversight in an otherwise well made game.\n\nSo, while it's not without its flaws, overall I really enjoyed my time with it. Full disclosure, I got the game free as part of a promotion on a bundle site, but even had I paid full price I'd still be happy with it. So if you've got a bit of spare time, a little patience, and some extra money to blow on a throwaway purchase, then I could easily point you towards this game to satisfy your crazy, insatiable jigsaw lust.","March 24, 2015","true","9.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","8"

Click it and the complete image is visible for a while.\nOther than that, you can see the all pictures in "EXTRAS" menu.

But the last level (level 5), the pieces is somehow easy to pick. I always got the pieces I want.\nThe puzzle progress can't be saved until finished.

How about this one? No again? Which piece, please be more specific. This one? Here you go. No? What do you want from me?!" Cue the facepalm.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPixel Puzzles: Japan offers a casual, calm, and relaxing (most of the time) setting where, if you hadn't realised by now, you piece together a jigsaw puzzle. Sounds simple enough... but wait, there's more! This is where the relaxation part tends to ends: the floating pieces. These pieces have no sympathy for your tears or cries of frustration, they will float and evade your mouse pointer to their hearts content. Confused by what I mean? Well, check out the game trailer to see!\n\nAnyways, let me do a breakdown for you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPros+ Various difficulty levels makes it a decent challenge on some of the jigsaws\n+ Easy game to load up and play casually; play it in small doses however... I'll elaborate in the con\n+ Achievements are very easy to pick up and should be of no trouble. Easily collectable as you complete each level\n+ Some of the puzzles are absolutely gorgeous - they range from realistic pieces to cartoonish paintings, but really offers a glimpse into the culture and life of the Japanese people\n\nNeutral± Some of the puzzles were hard to piece together, but if you work outside-in, then you'll definitely be able to solve it\n± There were times when I enjoyed the soundtrack and sound effects, but I ended up turning off the soundtrack because it became too repetitive. The sound effects were fine though\n\nCons- There is no save feature, which is horrid, so make sure you play this game when you have nothing else to do.Otherwise just keep your computer turned on. I made the mistake of thinking there was an automatic save feature -  a gaming derp moment - and "x'ed" out of the game. Waves of regret flooded the gates\n- I would not suggest getting this game at its $6,99 asking price. Instead, I would suggest $1,99-2,99 as more appropriate. While it is a good game, it has bundled and been given free many times. Its lowest price has also been $0,69 on Steam, so you're better off waiting for a sale. At the end of the day, I spent 6 hours in order to complete the game, and the rest was spent idling for cards\n- One of the most frustrating aspects of this game - and why I say "play it in small doses" - is the "pick up" feature. You're eyeing a piece that you need, honing in on it, and them "bam!" You end up picking another piece up. So you drop that unwanted one and try again. *Click!* You pick up another piece. Then you sit therre madly clicking until you finally get the piece, but in frustration you let it go and it DISAPPEARS. I don't know how many times I ended up seething and mumbling under my breath and had my friends ask me why I'm getting so mad over a puzzle game\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nPuzzle games are always good fun, but beware of the slight issues that plague Pixel Puzzles: Japan. While I enjoyed the game enough to complete it, I wouldn't consider ever opening it up again just because of the small agitating features.\n\nPlay it sparsely or splurge if you would like to instead; definitely not the best jigsaw game, but also not the worst.\n\nOverall5.5/10","June 5","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

While the game has a very nice atmosphere and can get you entertained enough to complete them all, there are some issues I still have. Alas, cons aside, this is a nice game if you can get it for dirt cheap if you're into Jigsaw puzzles. I am giving this a positive review, but I am on the very edge between decent and... not worthy. I will explain why.\n\nThe Pros:  Great Ambience  - Puzzle aside, the game does a decent job of putting you in the role of a monk who does zen stuff like this all day long. Your pieces are placed in a water pool alongside a fish, you have a nice water timer and also the music is pretty relaxing.\n\nDiverse Edges  - Almost every puzzle has different gaps on the edges, so you actually feel like playing a new game everytime you play, and not just switch to another picture. These also change the difficulty, as having to squint your eyes to observe the ones with more bumps and holes isn't that comfortable as plain, big, single extrusions.\n\n20 Puzzles, 6 Settings  - 20 puzzles, getting increasingly difficult, and having more pieces. From 60 all the way up to 240+\n\nEasy Achievements  - Even though this doesn't affect my general score of games, this is usually a point that I make every time I review a game. This games achievements are earned purely by completing the game. Great for achievement hunters who love to flaunt that "Perfect Games" counter on their profile.\nThe Cons: Bad User Interface - Even though the menu says 1080p, the general textures of things look really blurry and upscaled. Also, the buttons are aesthetically not pleasing. Won't bug you from completing puzzles, but for a game so easy to make, I would have expected more when it comes to such a basic aspect.\n\nPiece Selection Flaw - The game can be very anoying. I mean VERY anoying when you want to get a specific puzzle piece you see in the pool. Even if you click exactly on it, you will most probably end up pickung another one, as the game chooses to automatically choose the first piece in the placement sequence, if you go from top-bottom and left-right. This leads, besides the annoyance of having to dig through the pieces before getting the one you want, also is the mother of a very useful exploit, that makes any puzzle, no matter how big, so easy to solve it takes NO skill. You can easily find out about this in the Community Guides.\nConclusionIs this game worth it? Mabye. It was pretty satisfactory to complete the puzzles, although the cons I've presented are some pretty serious ones, and I wouldn't reccomend paying the full price for this game. I had the chance to snatch it for free in a mass giveaway, and given it was free, I really enjoyed it. If you like it, grab it while on sale. Full price not worth it, at least not without a potential update.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

Puzzle. Though the creator went out of his way to do everything to take the PUZZLE element out of the game.\nWhat's left? Well... do you know the experience of cutting & pasting multiple lines in a textfile? That's what this game is.\nLet me eleborate:\n\n1) You do not "rotate" the pieces, they are pre-fixed to be alligned correctly the moment you "fish" them out of the pond.\n2) Double clicking somewhere around the area automatically fixes the position of your puzzle piece and thus takes away the challenging element. They stay fixed in that position also, so you already know you got the puzzle piece at the right spot.\n3) The shapes of the pieces are so easily distinguishable that you don't even have to look at the overall picture to arrange them together.\n\nWhat's fun about puzzle games? Not knowing which direction the puzzle piece goes, not knowing where to put it and having the joy of finally fitting one with the other after a long time of "puzzling".

What frustrating is that the moving puzzles tends overlap each other which makes it hard to grab the puzzle piece that I want. As the game progresses, the jigsaw puzzles get even more challenging to complete, due to having many puzzle pieces floating around in the water; hence why I said 'time and patience' to play the game.\n\nThe achievements for this game isn't that hard to obtain at all. They are obtained by completing each of the jigsaw puzzles.  Nineteen achievements for nineteen jigsaw puzzles. There are other achievements that are linked in completing the puzzles. Like for example: Completing "X" amount jigsaw puzzles earns you an enlightenment achievement rank.\n\nThe music is relaxing but it can get very repetitious for certain extended period. It can be turned down in the game's option menu but the setting isn't saved at all for the next time. Remedy for this problem is to turn down the volume on ones' own computer.\n\n\nIf you look beyond the frustration that comes with this jigsaw puzzle game it can be relaxing and enjoyable to the very end.","March 19, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/284950/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a well-made game that provides a good if quite not complete simulation of jigsaw puzzle-solving on a PC.\n\nThere are a good number of puzzles to solve, with a fair variety of pictures. Each one using a nice mix of colours and joins\nto keep the challenge fresh and the puzzle-solving experience interesting.  While the learning curve may about right for casual players the overall difficulty is pretty easy. Even the hardest puzzle is just a question of applying time, patience and perseverance to reach the final solution. Probably the only thing missing is that pieces cannot be rotated which though significant isnt really an issue.\n\nI enjoyed it. Its not my sort of usual game but its relaxing enough to while away some time between larger more complex or action-oriented games. If you have ever received a physical jigsaw puzzle and enjoy solving them then you will enjoy the challenge the game provides even if it is not a complete representation. If you have never tried solving puzzles in real-life then this may be ideal for you to try and see if you like it.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Casual Jigsaw Puzzle Simulation.\n\n02. SETTING: Japan themed pictures.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: n/a.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Single-player. As its name implies the game allows you to play (make) twenty-one unique jigsaw puzzles of various sizes and difficulty, with themed pictures from one of my favourite cultures - Japan. Smaller puzzles those with fewer pieces must be completed in order to progress to harder ones those with more pieces.\n\n05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Overall the design is spartan with the only focus being to complete the puzzle. The makers have included almost all the few facets required to keep jigsaw-puzzle solving great fun and the range of pictures ensures boredom wont set in.\n\n06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The aim is of course easy enough.  Rearrange the pieces to complete the original picture.  Playing pieces are cut differently between most pictures. You can call upon a picture reveal feature to receive hints in-game. Different joint designs ensure that players will not get used to one style of grooves which keeps playing fresh.\n\nThere is no mid-game saving unfortunately. Which is not a problem with the smaller puzzles but if you want to take a break during an attempt on the larger puzzles you will need to complete it or restart from scratch.\n\nPieces of the jigsaw cannot be rotated, so this makes solving them a little easier. Even if the addition of a 'stream' to keep the pieces moving was added to replace this, it makes picking up pieces that much more fiddly. To the point that it becomes fairly annoying when after five or sixe tries on the larger puzzles, you cannot pick up the piece you want.\n\n07. ENEMIES: N/a.\n\n08. A.I: N/a.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Mostly its a question of mouse-driven point and drag. Letting go where you wish to place the current selected piece. Moving the cursor over the piece that you wish to select isnt as straightforward as you would imagine. Especially with the constant movement of all pieces in the stream. Though strangely, this seems to be an intended 'feature' not a bug. Likely something to replace the lack of rotating pieces which you would get in RL.  At least when a piece is dropped there is a nice sounds to inform players that it has been placed on its correct position.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Decent well-drawn/computerized pictures and portraits of Japanese themed subjects. Nothing amazing but more than adequate.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A melodic Japanese themed score that chimes along at an apt rate in keeping with the slow methodical way in which many players (I expect) will be attempting to solve their puzzles.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: N/a.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Fairly easy. Especially the first few puzzles. There are a few harder ones providing more of a challenge later in the game.  Plus the variation in joint design adds to the problem solving as progress is made.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: Picking up intended pieces as they are constantly moving in the stream. Though as explained this likely a feature with a non-pinpoint mouse cursor. I was also unable to capture screenshots using the Steam overlay.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Easy to complete. Almost all are triggered on solved the puzzles available in game. A further two are quick fun interface achievements.\n\n16. DLC: None. There are other games in the series that use other themes if you want more of the same.\n\n17. MODDING/ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: N/a\n\n18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Anyone who like solving jigsaw puzzles and has a computer will enjoy it. Bonus if you like all things Japan.  IF you are a lover of hardcore or action games you may best our time on other games!\n\n19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: I suppose if you dont mind replaying the puzzles over and over you could potentially play this infinitely or at least many many times. Otherwise there is a good 10h+ if you are just happy to play through each puzzle once and only once.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Great on a sale. I wouldnt necessary recommend it at full price though it depends, on how many times you intend to replay the puzzles. Personally I don't feel the retail price offers value for money unless you aim to replay the puzzles every so often. As this is the first in the series unless you are put off by the Japanese theme or prefer one of the other titles (Zombie, Birds or Anime...) I suggest you pick this up in a a sale.","December 8, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not spectacular at them or anything but I enjoy them. Guess I'm a boring dude! Needless to say I figured this game would occupy me for a few hours and be worth the trade I made for it. But it suffers from a some flaws.\n\nThe difficulty curve is non-existent;\n\nBeyond piece count increasing there's no challenge. There is no piece rotation so each piece is always in it's correct orientation. Then the way some puzzles are "cut" the pieces are TOO unique and spotting a pair is a breeze. Pieces lock to their place on the board so any time you're stuck you can drag and drop around until you get "lucky" if you're really determined to get rid of a piece. But pieces will not lock to each other freely outside of their spot on the board, so there's no putting together a few pieces out of place and moving them all together into place later.\n\nInteraction and interface is um weird;\n\nYou have your build space but no open space to pre-build (not that you can anyway like mentioned above). All the "loose" pieces are floating in a upside-down L-shaped koi pond and they are constantly floating around and moving. And there, I swear to you, lurks a little gremlin of monumental proportions! And it isn't the koi fish... You can't see him but I swear to you he is there. No matter what. I dunno how the game does it. But no matter what. The piece you want to click to pick up will NEVER be the piece you want if there's another piece remotely close. It is absolutely uncanny. I actually get excited when I get a piece I was actually trying to snag, that's how rarely it happens. I thought it was just with edges, that it didn't like edge pieces, but nope. There's a effin' gremlin in there mocking me and making my mouse click pick up anything but the piece I want. This issue gets more and more ridiculous as the amount of pieces increases. The koi pond stays the same size and more and more pieces go in it as you get to later puzzles. pieces will begin to overlap four or more deep in later puzzles. And the gremlin will just laugh at you.\n\nThen there's the normal small dev team stuff you could normally overlook;\n\n-Puzzle pieces in the koi pond are much smaller than on the board creating visual discrepancies.\n-When you "drop" a piece back to the pond it doesn't go where you drop it, it goes to a specific starting point in the middle of the action. So you cannot attempt any organization of pieces.\n-Sound settings made in main menu don't save to in-game. I wanted music off and SFX on. But then in-game its just everything off or everything on.\n-Messed with windows 10 title bars when played fullscreen and minimized to desktop.\n-Always launches in fullscreen even if you switched to windowed last play.\n-No saving mid-puzzle.\n-Etc.\n\nJust can't recommend it. At any price.","December 21, 2015","false","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When that times comes for you, stear clear from this one.\n\nThe music isn't bad. The weirdly cut puzzle pieces aren't bad. The pictures aren't bad. The idea of the moving/floating puzzle pieces, while strange at first, isn't bad, theoretically. It doesn't allow easy organization of the pieces, and basically asks you to go about it one piece at the time. That could potentially have made the puzzles harder, but in an interesting way.\n\nHere's the problem: If you are basing the whole concept of your take on a traditional game on a mechanic that doesn't work, you are doing it wrong. And the "floating pieces" idea doesn't work, because the click detection on these floating pieces simply doesn't work. The game consitently fails to recognise the piece you click on, even when it is clearly on top of every other piece and you clearly click in the middle of the piece. The detection rate is so horrible, that it makes the game frustrating. It's plain and simple flawed execution of the main game mechanic.\n\nThat aside, there is a rather limited number of puzzles (16 or so?), probably finishable in under 8 hours (many of my hours up there are just idling). The lack of any type of save function is another fatal flaw.\n\nSo, no, this isn't a good puzzle game in any way. Get it really, really, really cheap with really low expectations.","September 23, 2014","false","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Let me describe to you what is so irritating. The play area is made up of a table which you assemble the puzzle pieces on and there's a river/pool along the left and top edge of the screen that the unused pieces float around in. Now in the early levels where there's less pieces and the pieces are larger this pool is fine and works great. However, when you progress and the pieces become smaller and more of them it's almost impossible to click on the piece you need. The majority of the time spent on this game has been trying to click on a piece I need and picking up pieces that my cursor isn't even touching. I wish this game wasn't digital so I could flip the table over.\n\nNow if you can get passed the irritating pool the game is fine and enjoyable. It's a jigsaw puzzle game. You piece the puzzle together and you complete the puzzle.

Also prepare for a lot of rage explosions while trying to pick the piece you want but you pick all the other ones … but the one you actually want. Great puzzle (literally) game over all. Do recommend.","September 3, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although the selection of puzzles is a bit small, I did spend quite a bit of time completing them all. The added difficulty of fishing the pieces out of the koi pond was a fun challenge, though it was difficult to see the pieces without yanking them all out of the pond once I reached the harder puzzles. I could have also done without the oddly shaped pieces in some situations as well (particularly the swirl-shaped edges of one puzzle).

But it doesn't come without it's share of problems that distract from the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nFirst to deserve mention is the inability to save your progress (at least, I could not find any such feature or mechanic anywhere).  If you start building a puzzle, you need to commit to finishing it.  For the earlier puzzles that have fewer pieces this is not a problem.  But getting along to the more advanced puzzles with a lot more pieces, it takes one quite a while to complete a puzzle, which you now have to do in one sitting.\n\nWhich leads me to the second distraction.  When building a puzzle, all of the available pieces are floating along the left and top sides of the screen.  You pick a piece up from these areas and drag them onto the puzzle for placement.\n\nFor early puzzles this is easy.  However, once the puzzles get to have 100+ pieces, the areas get a bit crowded and picking up a piece becomes a mini-game in itself.  A frustrating one at that.\n\nYou can clearly see a piece floating about that you wish to pick up, but click on it and somehow you will have picked up a piece underneath it or floating off to the side of it.  Sometimes it takes up to 10 tries just to pick up the piece you want.\n\nAnd dropping an unwanted piece results in all of the pieces around the drop point to disappear and reappear somewhere else.  Thus, you sometimes inadvertently lose the piece you actually want, because you dropped an unwanted pick-up on top of it.\n\nLastly, there are only 21 puzzles to build.  Once you've built them all, the game is pretty much over unless you wish to re-build a certain puzzle.\n\nThese are some minor niggles and personal experiences that shouldn't detract from the overall game, but I feel are worth mentioning.\n\nIf you like building puzzles, you should give Pixel Puzzles: Japan a go.  If you like building puzzles but get frustrated easily, I'd lay caution in the road as you might fall to pieces while trying to pick up the pieces....","September 12, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the later levels there are constant overlapping pieces floating around to grab. Even if you are clicking on a piece that is on top it will randomly grab a piece.

Let me describe to you what is so irritating. The play area is made up of a table which you assemble the puzzle pieces on and there's a river/pool along the left and top edge of the screen that the unused pieces float around in. Now in the early levels where there's less pieces and the pieces are larger this pool is fine and works great. However, when you progress and the pieces become smaller and more of them it's almost impossible to click on the piece you need. The majority of the time spent on this game has been trying to click on a piece I need and picking up pieces that my cursor isn't even touching. I wish this game wasn't digital so I could flip the table over.\n\nNow if you can get passed the irritating pool the game is fine and enjoyable. It's a jigsaw puzzle game. You piece the puzzle together and you complete the puzzle. It's as simple as that and done well in that regard.","September 10, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would be better with more and larger puzzles, combined with a save game option. Picked it up at a sale (<€1), completed approximately 2 puzzles / week. Took my time enjoying puzzling. Perfected the game (100% achievements) in 17 hours and moved on. Probably never replaying Pixel Puzzles: Japan again, since there are other Pixel Puzzles versions on the market I want to complete.

It's very piece-ful (get it?), and the puzzles are of decent challenge. The hardest part and my biggest complaint is the way you pick up the pieces. Floating around is nice, but the game hardly ever picks up the piece you are clicking on, and if you drop the piece you didn't want back in the water, it often resets the position of the pieces underneath it, making you lose track of the piece you were originally looking for. (Whew! That  was a bit of a run on...)\n\nI'd give the game an 6/10.\n\nPros:\n\n- Puzzles are decently pieced to provide a challenge.\n- Graphics are decent for a casual game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Music track is repetative and has a loud noise in it that gets annoying. (I mute while playing.)\n- Cursor tracking during piece pick up.\n- No saving!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/recommended/284950/","mowshu","«mowshu»","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/","267 products in account","Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a casual jigsaw game. It is the first jigsaw puzzle game on Steam and it is relaxing and fun.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and self explenatory, just like in the original board game you have to fit together puzzle pieces to form a beautiful japanese scenery. There are 19 different puzzles, ranging from ones with 60 pieces to one with 350 pieces. Each puzzle in this game has a different picture but also the puzzle pieces differ as well. This game offers an unique experience since some of the puzzles have pieces with shapes that you won't see in real life. Unlike in real life you can see the image of the puzzle you are working on just before starting the level. There is a power-up that fills up and shows the original picture for a few seconds if used. There is no time or objectives, so the game is very relaxing and you have nothing to worry about. Also, there is a fish swimming in the river that you can play with, for fun. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this game. There is no save feature mid puzzle so if you leave a puzzle you have to start it over. That is a big problem in the last levels since they take a lot of time to finish so your only option is to leave your PC open. Another flaw is selecting the pieces you want. The puzzle pieces float around a river around the ''table''. That is a good ideea, but when you try to click on the piece you want you will probably end up selecting another piece and having to put it back into the river and sometimes the piece you want disappears into another point of the river.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice and the japanese pictures very beautiful. The music is relaxing just as the gameplay.\n\nI recommend this game, casual, relaxing and fun, 8/10.","March 28, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/284950/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A jigsaw puzzle game where you can't do many of the things you would likely do when putting together a physical jigsaw puzzle.\n\nFirst off, when tweaking with the options setting such as changing from fullscreen to window (no resolution options available), music, and sound effects, none of the settings stay the same when you start the game up again; you'd have to retweak all that stuff to their desired place. The options menu itself doesn't really contain all that much anyway.\n\nPuzzle pieces can't be rotated but are apparently already turned the right way so there'd be no need for that.\n\nYou can't piece together matching jigsaw puzzles; each individual piece can only be snapped on the canvas where they belong even if there are no other pieces around. This means that you can basically grab a puzzle piece and keep dragging & dropping the thing all over the canvas, if desired, until it snaps into the place where it's apparently supposed to go.\n\nThe puzzle pieces you're supposed to grab outside of the canvas don't stay still; they slowly float about on a pond outside of the field bouncing from walls, a few sometimes get stuck on a wall and just stay still for whatever reason. It becomes more of a bother than a challenge (if it's even supposed to be a challenge of some kind) since the pieces will always overlap one another, so way too likely you won't always grab the puzzle piece you want even if the mouse is on the desired piece. This is much worse later on when the pieces become smaller and higher in number. You can drag the puzzle pieces out of the pond to the canvas but that's more than likely to just block the view of the canvas itself with clutter.\n\nIf you were to leave a puzzle-in-progress it doesn't save and there's no option to. If you need to exit the game you'd have to start whatever puzzle you were doing all over again.\n\nI was hoping this jigsaw puzzle game was more of the things I'd do with a pyshical one and not just a game where I just drag piece (A) to point (B) with the addition of technical nuisances.","April 1","false","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is said to have some light gameplay elemtns mixed in with putting together jigsaw puzzles. Putting together puzzles without all the mess of getting the pieces out, making sure you get them facing up, clearing the space to put it together, and then putting it away later is nice. The actual act of putting the pieces into the puzzle is fun. Some other virtual puzzles I've done are far too forgiving on how close you need to put the pieces, but this game does a good job of making you put it in the right place before it'll stick without it being too horribly specific to make you second guess yourself constantly. Some of these puzzles were fun to put together with neat pictures as a result. Also, there were some interesting edges and piece shapes which gave the different puzzles a little life and challenge to put together. The jigsaw puzzle part is good. My issues come in when you're looking at the gameplay elements that have been included to spice the game up. Either these elements should be eliminated, or there needs to be more of the elements.\n\nThe elements that are there are mostly annoying or useless. Being able to pick up a fish and move it around isn't really challenging or fun, it's just useless. Completing puzzles to unlock more is also a bit useless, as anyone doing this for the sake of doing the puzzles is going to do them all anyway so having them all available to pick from would be nice. Plus, leveling up for completing puzzles just to unlock other puzzles is also fairly useless in the grand scheme of things if the only reason for them is to play more of the game you were most likely going to play more of anyway. The annoying part is how the puzzle pieces are stuck in a pool of water around the corner the table. So the pieces will freely float around, covering each other up and bouncing around, which makes them difficult to sift through. There's also an annoying priority going on. See, they have somewhat of an order. Pieces go from top left to top right, then down a row starting on the left again, and so on. So if you click in an area that would select multiple pieces, whichever one is highest on that priority list will be picked up, even if you clicked mostly on a different piece or didn't want that one. Also, if you drop a piece back in the water it, along with any other pieces it lands on, will sink and respawn in a spot in the water on the left. So the constant movement, piece priority, and sinking situation all make for a very frustrating puzzle experience. There's not really any penalty for these things. It just takes longer and is more frustrating. It wastes your own time and tries your patience, whch I don't think is a good reason to have the elements. The only useful element is that, once you get enough pieces in, you can click on the sun and reveal the entire picture for a few seconds to refresh your memory... even though most people would be able to look at it the while time when doing a real puzzle.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be MORE elements and it'd make the game more fun, or at least have it make more sense. For instance, maybe something with time. A time limit, or just a timer to record your time. Some type of score for using the piece you grab and taking points away for throwing a piece back. Reasons to go faster and be more precise, plus giving a point to the tedious design. Getting better ranks to unlock perks or just to unlock puzzles. Having online leaderboards to compete for scores or times with others. There are plenty of things that could be added to make the current model of the game make more sense and possibly make it more enjoyable as a video game. Even just a save feature would be nice. In real life, many people will take breaks from big puzzles. Without a save feature, you can't do that here unless you want to leave your game running the entire time, which not everyone wants to do.\n\nA few of the puzzles were made up of similar looking things to the point of resorting to random placement to find where anything went. Maybe my eyes just suck, but they were not fun as trial and error challenges. Like the one with all the flowers... my word. Also, most of the puzzles look rather similar to each other anyway, which makes some sense with the common theme of Japan, but I still think more variety could've been had. I only found a few of the pictures interesting to look at and try to solve.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that Pixel Puzzles: Japan falls just a bit short of being a good puzzle simulation, and falls very short of being a fun interactive gaming experience. There needs to be more or less features to make this work well either way, at least for my taste. I played all the way through it, aside from the bonus puzzles. I got all the achievements and did all the main puzzles. I was very worn out near the middle but kept on going to see if it got any different. It really didn't. This game was ten hours of the same thing that, despite doing more puzzles and being a decent amount of puzzles for the price, wasn't a fun experience towards the last half. Changing the elements would make it better and possibly could've made me enjoy this game as a whole. However, I just can't say I enjoyed it. The first few puzzles were fun, but it gets old fast. I got this for free and... as mean as it sounds, I still feel like it was a waste. At least the last half was a waste of my time as I didn't enjoy it, but I wanted to review it and give it a fair chance for reviewing purposes. I feel I've done that, and I honestly cannot recommend it as is, especially at the 7 dollar asking price. Pixel Puzzles: Japan gets a 3/10 for having potential to be a good puzzle simulation or puzzle video game, but failing to do much justice to either camp.","March 23, 2015","false","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Forget about going for specific pieces; you can click all you want on the piece that caught your eye, the game will still give you the piece it thinks you deserve instead. Since they're constantly moving, you'll helplessly watch them drift away from you over and over. The pieces do not `click`, with each other, they just snap to their place on the main grid. So much space on the screen is wasted with useless graphics and blank space that could have been used for much needed game space. The lack of a quick save is a big flaw as well.\n\nThe pictures are alright, if a bit uninspired and the shapes of the pieces are all nice and varied. The sounds are fine, but they do get grating after a while, especially since it's always the same, over and over.\n\nThe game is still playable, and you'll barely notice its flaws in the smaller puzzles, but it's all uphill from there.

This game has the worst z-ordering ever.  Compounded by the blasted pieces moving around in the frustrating pond.\n\nThe floating koi pond gimmick would be nice, except all the pieces cluster in the bottom left.  So it's nearly impossible to find a piece unless it's got a very distinctive color.  There is no other way to look at the pieces, of course, so you either end up hoarding them in the puzzle area, or tossing them back so they can hide every other piece you're interested in.  Normally, finding edge pieces is relatively easy, but because I couldn't sort through them individually and they conspired to get in the way of my clicks, I ended up hunting for edge pieces for nearly half an hour.  Normally that's the easy part.\n\nFinally, even if you know pieces go together and try to connect them, they won't connect to each other.  They will only snap in at their very specific places on the board.  Which is a huge step down from real puzzles, and some other puzzle games I've played.  Of course they wouldn't have a feature to name and group puzzle pieces together and get them out of the way.  It's the pond or nothing.\n\n44 minutes and I'm done.

Now... I really hate to write negative reviews, as I try to look at the effort and love that were put in to games. But sometimes there are just games that I can't give a positive review to. And sadly? This is one of them.\n\n=Complete Review= (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)\n\n\n=The Gameplay: 2/5= It's rather mediocre, in terms of gameplay. Puzzle pieces snap in place when placed on their correct spot on the grid, which would be better if the pieces snapped to eachother instead... But I can understand developer-wise why they wouldn't do that, due to the fact it would be a bit of a hassle if a player put a combined-piece back in to the pond. And, it's still better than the pieces not snapping in to place at all.\n\nSpeaking of the pond, it's probably a big player in the game's issues. It would be fine if it only moved the pieces around, that's a bit annoying, but I get what they were trying to do. But because of the pieces moving around, it makes picking up pieces just flat out annoying because of it sometimes glitching up pieces. You'll try to pick up a edge piece, and wind up picking up a piece that's practically another whole piece away.  Half the time I just move all the pieces from the pond on to the board, just so that way I can pick them up right.\n\nThe powerup in the game is also... Strange. I only used it once so I could see how it worked. It changes the background to show the rest of the image so you'll know where to put the pieces, but personally I found it more fun to just put the puzzle together without it.\n\nAnd the koi, don't get me started on the koi. Just don't... About the best part involving the koi is sticking it in the sozu. I'd say that's a redeeming feature, as the bloody fish got in my way a number of times when picking up puzzle pieces. But some people would likely just find that cruel, so it's a your-mileage-may-vary thing.\n\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= Now this, is a redeeming feature of the game. The graphics look  nice in my opinion! The UI is done well, the actual images for the puzzles are of good quality, the pieces having different unique designs to mix things up in the more difficult levels. It's quite asthetically pleasing!\n\nBut it's not to the level that would be considered eyecatching, and breathtaking. Well done, but not embellished much. Which, well, that's good or bad, depending on your preferences. For the concept, a simpler style does work well. But for those wanting a more ornate, and intricate looking style, this would likely not be all that pleasing to the eye for them.\n\n\n=The Audio: 1/5=  Ugh.. Now this is the part I absolutely hated. It was fine for maybe the first two puzzles. But the music with the haphazard sound effects tossed in just doesn't work... I mean, sure, the sound effects fit the theme, sort of. But the mixed volumes of the sound effects and the music would be more prone to cause tension as opposed to relaxation. Which, is what the theme aims for: a zen-style.\n\nI personally muted it and played more relaxing tunes to it. I'd suggest that you pick your favorite zen or relaxing music and turn that on instead if you play this.\n\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\nA pretty pleasing jigsaw puzzle game.\nHas achievements that are fairly easy to get.\nThe pictures are lovely.\n\nNeutral\nYou get to put the koi in the sozu.\nThe graphics are pretty simple.\nPuzzle pieces snap to the frame rather than to eachother.\n\nCons\nThe game is a bit glitchy because of the bloody pond.\nThe music and sfx are terrible IMO.\nYour progress on the puzzles are not saved.\n\n\n=The Conclusion: 4/10=\nIt's a decent game if it's on a sale above 75%, but if not, it's definitely not worth the full price. It was a cute idea, but the execution was not done very well. I've played much better jigsaw puzzle games for free, of which I'd link, but that would be in poor taste. A quick google search of "Flash Jigsaw Puzzle" should come up with some.\n\nI appreciate your time, and thank you for reading my review.","September 26, 2015","false","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, good luck finding these in the "pond" where the pieces float around instead of waiting to be sorted - and if you have found them that doesn't mean the game will give them to you when you click them.\n\nYou might decide to bear this for the 21 puzzles that are included, or you might decide to get something better instead. I'll do the latter.\n\n[Update: I'm playing this after all for the achievements, and the most aggravating thing by far is that it won't give you the piece you click on half of the time.

This is not a game for anyone who actually likes puzzles.\nThe pieces that are not being used float around the border in a pond. Endlessly trying to fish out pieces and consistently getting the wrong ones is frustrating. (Or that stupid fish if you're really unlucky) I'm not sure if the person who made this game has put a puzzle together, but that's not really how puzzles work. It would be nice if there was a way to turn off the animation so I can end this simple frustration.\n\nIn additions, pieces will not stick together on the board. They only stick to the proper place. Meaning, if you found four pieces that go together, tough cookies! You have to wait to find every border piece so you can find the "spot" for this thing and put them all in place before they will actually stick together. Again, that's not how puzzles work!\n\nWhile I appreciate having goals, having to do the easy puzzles to get to the hard ones would be just fine if I didn't get motion sickness thanks to the damned pond of pieces. The music got annoying after two puzzles, It's just a few plucks on a koto in an endless loop. Not sure if you unlock different music later, but after a bit this was more grating than relaxing.

No saving\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. You cannot connect pieces together that you know should fit to make sections. This game makes you pretty much work from the sides and then crawl from there. You might think well isn't that is how people do puzzles? Yes, but when you do these, when you see other pieces can join up with each other, you can start piecing them together and save them aside for the bigger picture. This game does not allow to do so. The way it works is that pieces will only 'fit' on the board if they are on the eaxact location, so if you were really bored.... you could grab each piece click drop over the board till u find it locked in place.........\n\n2. Mouse aiming. Terrible in this game, you end up half the time picking up other pieces instead of the one you want. If you then, proceed to drop this piece ontop of your desired piece, then enjoy searching for it again from the spawn pool as for some odd reason they decided to add an effect which pretty much makes the dropped piece bomb the other pieces as well to make them disappear. The "HD" graphics don't even feel HD at all.... more like low res and the scaled up... Hell.... MSN jigsaw puzzles where more HD than this.....\n\n3. Floating pieces, I didn't mind it at the start but then it got annoying. Each time you pick a piece, you can drop it back in the water and it disappears and goes back to the 'spawn point'. At first it was nice, but with the terrible mouse aiming, there is a good chance that you will be chasing a piece for a good minute (and hope it is not near the spawn are, because then all the other pieces you dropped will just reappear there).\n\n4. No save?! Forced to play the whole puzzle until completion? Alright...... I don't see that happening with other jigsaw puzzles I do..... I don't see some elf scrambling the whole board at night to wake up to see my puzzle reset.","July 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game at full price.\n\nThe reason is rather simple: This game fails on almost every level.\nIt is supposed to be a jigsaw puzzle game, yet the engine is seriously flawed:\nYou cannot attach pieces to each other even if you know they fit. You can only fix them to their final position. This makes it "kind of" easy to solve every puzzle: Choose a position, drag every puzzle piece to that position until one fits. Rinse and repeat.\nWhen several pieces are on top of each other, it seem to be pure randomness which one is selected by clicking. It may be the bottom-most one. It never is "the one visible that I want to click". Sometimes you have to shovel several pieces away from one position to finally select the one you want.\nThe "pond" is a nice idea, it's implementation however heavily collides with the idea of a relaxing jigsaw puzzle game. Instead of having a quiet atmosphear, there always is something moving. The form of the pond (at least on my resolution) results in pieces cluttering on one side of the screen. As all pieces swim, I sometimes had to "hunt" a piece along the screen: It always tried to "hide" beneath other ones yet the one selected on click was a different one. The kai was disturbing as well but at least that could be removed (see achievements). The other puzzle game from the developers hints that they have a very strange idea about what relaxing jigsaw puzzle games should look like...\nThere is no area to sort pieces. When for real puzzles, you might want to sort "border pieces" or "blue pieces" to one stack, you can only heap them up on the playing area, here. You might consider using the pond but every piece thrown into the pond changes location. Not only does it flow away over time; it immediately is put to a random place when dropped. This also is very frustrating when "digging" for a single piece by throwing everything else back into the pond: You easily throw away the desired piece on accident and then it's hard to find again.\nI've played freeware puzzle games that allowed to customize the puzzles (choose your own picture, choose number of pieces). This game does not support any of this. When even the addition of new puzzles is worth an update post, there's something seriously wrong with the engine.The puzzles themselves were not too bad although I sometimes thought they were missing contrast to tell the pieces apart from each other. Most later puzzles I solved with a lot of the "Rinse and Repeat"-tactic. The music bored me to hell but may seem relaxing to some.\n\nStill, the most positive thing I can say about this game is that it's rather easy to achieve 100% completion on it. You don't need any skill, just some time.","December 14, 2014","false","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it is a gorgeous aesthetic, the shifting flow of pieces around the board was incredibly annoying to me. I organize my physical puzzles by color and the inability to have any organization or structure made the game much less enjoyable. Plus it was very difficult to selevt what piece you wanted. While the music was good, there is only one track while you're working on puzzles and one track while in the menu as I recall, and that gets incredibly repetitive when you're spending 20+ minutes on a puzzle. There are also only 19 puzzles, and I finished this game in a couple days. I would really give this game a neutral rating if that was an choice, but with how grating the music was and the incessant annoyance of finding the piece I wanted, I had to go with the negative option.","October 18, 2014","false","10.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtAden/recommended/284950/","LtAden","A'den","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtAden/","479 products in account","Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a couple of terrible projecting misconceptions, leading to creation of playable game - but only if you are really obstinate to complete it.\nThis game is a typical jigsaw puzzle, rarely found on steam (if not unique). It includes around 20 different images. As suggested, all of them are japanese-themed. So, you complete puzzles, and by this you level up this tiny monk in bottom-left corner, from acolyte to someone who looks as if was abducted by aliens. Higher monk levels unlock more challenging puzzles, and he levels up when you complete all but one pictures from tier. Actual game is simple: pick piece from the pond and move it to right location, where it will be automatically locked. While regular jigsaw puzzles allow you to see the complete picture - here it's a bonus. You unlock a glance at the picture by placing pieces in correct locations. Unfortunately - even in the biggest puzzles you can use it 2-3 times.\nStated at the beginning - this game is a collection of terrible projecting misconceptions. Firstly - while not a problem at smaller puzzles, try picking specified piece on more difficult ones. It's literally impossible. If the pieces are in swarm (and in this tiny pond they are almost all the time), game picks not the one you selected, but one closer to left top corner (this leads to exploit - check guides at game hub for more info on this). Second thing that bothered me terribly - game settings restart after you turn off the game. It's pain in the butt - mute the game (as the soundtrack and effects are quite annoying) everytime you play. Finally, due to limited access to big picture - some puzzles have to be completed by trying to fit each piece in every place (like in picture with cherry blooms).\nTo sum up, this game is a great example of production with wasted potential. Jigsaw puzzles are scarce on Steam, so it's a shame that game like this is done so badly. Good things? If you try really hard, you may have fun. Plus, achievements are pretty easy to get - completing the game gives you all of them.","May 18, 2015","false","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/284950/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: A fine jigsaw puzzle game that however gets irritating later on because of the lack of saving feature and unreliable jigsaw piece catching.\n\nPixel Puzzles presents one of the simplest forms of puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, now ported from real life to computer screen. As you'd expect by the subtitle, the theme is Japan. This shows itself both in the puzzles themselves and the interface.\n\nIn the interface there's a metagame of you being some kind of a Buddhist guru who levels up and becomes ever more enlightened as you solve more puzzles. The puzzles are at first quite easy (i.e. few pieces) but as you "get more enlightened" more difficult (i.e. larger) puzzles are unlocked.\n\nPuzzle pictures look good and usually contain various temples, parks, cherry trees and castles from the classic Land of the Rising Sun - you won't find anime girls, video game references or weird game shows here, IMO rather unfortunately actually as it would have introduced more variety. Instead, all is serene and beautiful and the music is somewhat relaxing mix in a traditional Japanese style. I frankly muted it after a while and listened to my own music because it was making me sleepy.\n\nGameplay is the important part. The jigsaw pieces are floating in a pond next to the puzzle table and you have to pick them up with mouse cursor. It's sometimes difficult to pick the one you want as the pieces can float over each other and for some reason the one you are pointing with mouse might not be the one picked up - that's rather annoying especially in the larger puzzles where the pieces are smaller.\n\nObviously some simplifications have been taken in the design. The pieces are of fixed orientation, so they never need to be rotated. They also lock in place if you drop them close enough to the intended spot. You also can't see the whole picture but before the puzzle and after gaining enough "insight" (i.e. completing large enough part of the puzzle) and then only for a short time. As a minor note, the pieces on the board obscure what's underneath, and once you are close to finishing they might be camouflaged in within the puzzle pattern and there's no way to highlight them for easy notice.\n\nIn my opinion the major flaw of the game is the lack of saving feature: once you have started a puzzle, you need to complete it or start over again later. This is especially frustrating for the largest puzzles (300-350 pieces) of the end-game as they can take an hour or more to complete. Actually 8 hours of my game time was accumulated when I cracked and left the game running for the night to finish the halfway done last puzzle I started the previous night.\n\nOverall I didn't enjoy it very much, but that's not because of it being a bad game but because I grew frustrated when I couldn't progress with the larger puzzles and then couldn't save to continue later. The puzzles are actually quite nice, the jigsaws varied and the challenge is okay. Only in larger puzzles did I get a headache trying to find and the pick the pieces I wanted. In my opinion, there could have been more "revelations" of the puzzle picture to speed up the game, and I found the lack of saving horrendous. With that it's a mixed bag with slightly more goodies than ickies.\n\nIn effect I spend about 15 hours with it completing every puzzle except the very large optional ones. For a patient, casual player it's a good game except for the lack of saving feature. It might even work as a team game, played together with a friend. For a less patient one, perhaps get it on sale or bundle like I did.","June 30, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","7"

The main problems are:\n\n1) When there are multiple puzzle pieces layered over each other, the one you pick up isn't the one that's on the top.  It should definitely be the one on the top, as the way it is now you don't ever know what piece you're getting.\n\n2) When you place a piece back into the pool of pieces, they all spawn in the same place on the left.  So all the pieces tend to congregate in one place after a while.  When you combine this with point #1, it makes it impossible to pick up the piece you want.  The returned pieces should spawn where you placed them in the pool, or even just in a random place.\n\nThe bad UI isn't such a big deal in the earlier puzzles since there are less pieces, but the game is nearly unplayable after a certain point.","August 20, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For being a game that is supposed to be 'zen', it has some features that make it pretty frustrating, particularly when doing puzzles with more pieces. At first, the game starts out being pretty relaxing, but as the game continues, the pieces floating around get smaller and smaller. This makes it hard to see what's on them sometimes, but that wouldn't be a problem in itself.\n\nThe main problem is that once there gets to be more pieces, it's incredibly difficult to get the piece you actually want, especially before it floats under another clump of pieces. Even if the piece is on top, it feels like more often than not, whenever you click, it will select a random piece from within a centimeter or so radius. And forget about just dropping the piece and trying again - when you drop a piece, it takes itself and all the pieces around it back to the single spawn point in the water for the pieces. Soon, all the pieces will be all clustered together there and you'll basically just need to pile all the pieces up on your playing board if you want any of them, espeically a specific one.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to actually select only the piece you are clicking on. It would also be very helpful not to have a piece go back to the spawn point when setting it down and have it actually stay where you set it. The ability to turn off the floating of the pieces would also be useful, particularly once they get pretty small.\n\nAnother feature that this game is lacking that I've seen on free puzzle games is the ability for pieces to 'stick' to their neighboring pieces. Basically in this game, pieces only lock into place on the actual board. Even if you find two pieces that obviously go together but don't know where to put them yet, they will stay as separate pieces. It would be really nice if the pieces could click together and then be moved together. Maybe the developers didn't want to include this feature on purpose and I could see where having large chunks of pieces already stuck together would clutter up the board, but maybe it could be a feature that players could choose to turn on or off.\n\nDespite these annoying flaws, the game still does have some pros, including nice pictures and pretty neat edge styles that vary from puzzle to puzzle. It is a fun game, but it would be a lot less of a headache with the addition of the features I mentioned earlier.

Let's reviem them :\n\nIt has a nice, relaxing soundtrack (however, it may stopfor no reason at any given time, and restart a few seconds later).\nPieces have varied and interesting forms, and images to reform are great.\nScaling difficulty (up to 350 pieces for the last one)\n\nAnd there are the flaws :\nThe first, major flaw is the reason for my downvote : you may have noticed the moving pieces around the board. It is supposed to bring interactivity in the game. The reality is there, however. It is a hassle to find each piece, when you have found it, it is hard to follow and nearly impossible to pick (when you click on it, you pick a random near piece, the only way i have found is to isolate my piece (while it's moving) and then grab it). This problem intensifies as you go on to harder puzzles and the number of pieces increases. This functionality should be possible to disable, because it makes the whole experience frustrating.\nMy last complain concerns the model of the puzzle. Instead of having a small window showing the complete puzzle (where you could, for example, zoom on it), you have a "power" which, when ready, will show you the model (superposed to the board), for a brief instant. Then, it disappears, and you're again missing it.\n\nTo sum up, it's not actually a bad game, but it is a frustrating experience for one who, like me, is fond of jigsaw puzzles, thus, I don't recommend it, except if you would enjoy hunting (literally) for your pieces. However, the lack of good jigsaw puzzles on computer is the real ace for this game which contains 15 (or so) puzzles.","September 8, 2014","false","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The smallest puzzles can be done in ten minutes while the bigger ones can take up to a few hours. The music is relatively bland but a lot of players will use their own music anyway so it doesn't really matter.\n\nSome features clearly show that the dev team has a lack of understanding about jigsaw puzzles. To begin with, and although it can seem soothing, having the pieces move around in a pond is a really bad idea considering most people who play such puzzles like to organize their pieces, or at least remember approximately where some of them were. Additionally, it would have been nice to have a small picture of the completed puzzle somewhere in the layout, as a reference. It could be argued that not having it adds to the difficulty but the point of jigsaw puzzles has never been to recreate a picture that you saw during three seconds before starting to play.\n\nThat being said, those two flaws are incredibly minor compared to the main problem of the game: when there are a lot of pieces in the pond, the cursor detection to grab them is incredibly bad. It's so bad that you really wonder if they actually tested it. To be clear, it's not like you misclick from time to time and grab a piece you didn't want. I literally had to click twenty times on some pieces to get the one I wanted. I even gave up on some of them because they were floating among too many other pieces. Sometimes, even with no piece in a close proximity, you still end up with the wrong piece grabbed. In a way, it's quite amazing to witness. You could even laugh it off if it didn't happen every five seconds. This should have been a game to relax and this flaw alone makes it incredibly infuriating during the long puzzles.\n\nI only beat this game out of spite.","September 7, 2014","false","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So why do I recommend this game? For one point really: it's highly relaxing.\n\nSometimes I want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a game and maybe work my brain a little too. This game does just that. I got this game for free over at the IndieGala website, and when I first downloaded it, I didn't expect to like it at all, but I was completely wrong.\n\nI load up this game after a long day at school or doing homework for hours on end. It's a great way to escape stress and just let go. Most games I play require my full attention and for me to constantly be doing something. With no timer, Pixel Puzzles: Japan lets to solve beautiful puzzles centered around famous Japanese monuments and landscapes at your own pace.\n\nWhile the game is fairly simplistic, there are a few minor complaints. The first would be the higher level puzzles. As you progress, puzzle pieces become more and more strange. They're not your ordinary jigsaw pieces anymore, they're abstractly cut and hard to piece together. One way you can solve this is by starting with the sides and corners first.\n\nSecond, and it is a small minor complaint, but I don't like how the pieces float around so much. I understand that they move around to make you have to look for them more, but I wish it was just a little bit slower.\n\nAnyways, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing and simple game to help take stress away from their lives.

Nice puzzles. But after a while the controls are getting really annoying. The pieces are floating around the board and are constantly overlapping each other. This won't be a big problem if there are few pieces. But while you progress the pieces per puzzle are increasing, but not the space where they are floating around.\nIn the last puzzles I couldn't pick a specific piece but got a random piece.\n\nSadly there are some bugs. For example when you pick up a piece and drop it on another piece the will reset all to a "spawn point". Too bad if you teleport your piece away which you tried to reach.\n\nAnother bug apears, when the pieces are floating around for a while. Especially when there are a huge amount of pieces. The get stuck. This sound nice, because you might pick them up easier. But they also stack while the are stuck. So you might not find your missing piece ;)\n\nToo bad you can't turn off the floating.\n\nA level editor to add own images would be nice. And if the pieces wouldn't be oriented correctly would give a new challenge to the puzzles.

So why do I recommend this game? For one point really: it's highly relaxing.\n\nSometimes I want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a game and maybe work my brain a little too. This game does just that. I got this game for free over at the IndieGala website, and when I first downloaded it, I didn't expect to like it at all, but I was completely wrong.\n\nI load up this game after a long day at school or doing homework for hours on end. It's a great way to escape stress and just let go. Most games I play require my full attention and for me to constantly be doing something. With no timer, Pixel Puzzles: Japan lets to solve beautiful puzzles centered around famous Japanese monuments and landscapes at your own pace.\n\nWhile the game is fairly simplistic, there are a few minor complaints. The first would be the higher level puzzles. As you progress, puzzle pieces become more and more strange. They're not your ordinary jigsaw pieces anymore, they're abstractly cut and hard to piece together. One way you can solve this is by starting with the sides and corners first.\n\nSecond, and it is a small minor complaint, but I don't like how the pieces float around so much. I understand that they move around to make you have to look for them more, but I wish it was just a little bit slower.\n\nAnyways, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing and simple game to help take stress away from their lives. Sit back, grab a nice beverage and enjoy this wonderful little title, Pixel Puzzles: Japan.","March 29, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nice puzzles. But after a while the controls are getting really annoying. The pieces are floating around the board and are constantly overlapping each other. This won't be a big problem if there are few pieces. But while you progress the pieces per puzzle are increasing, but not the space where they are floating around.\nIn the last puzzles I couldn't pick a specific piece but got a random piece.\n\nSadly there are some bugs. For example when you pick up a piece and drop it on another piece the will reset all to a "spawn point". Too bad if you teleport your piece away which you tried to reach.\n\nAnother bug apears, when the pieces are floating around for a while. Especially when there are a huge amount of pieces. The get stuck. This sound nice, because you might pick them up easier. But they also stack while the are stuck. So you might not find your missing piece ;)\n\nToo bad you can't turn off the floating.\n\nA level editor to add own images would be nice. And if the pieces wouldn't be oriented correctly would give a new challenge to the puzzles. But only if you can pick up the piece you want to.\n\nDue to the bugs and frustration I only recommend it to you if you are patient.\n\n5/10","April 13, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This really kills your feeling of actually having any skill. There's also no visual indicator of which pieces are locked in their correct position, and which still need to be placed.\n\n- Pieces are ALWAYS oriented correctly with the puzzle. They never rotate.\n\n- If you find matching pieces, but don't know where they fit on the board yet, you can't keep them snapped together. You can't even put them beside each other somewhere out of the way, because there IS no "out of the way" area.\n\n- All the loose pieces move around in a koi pond beside the puzzle. You can take pieces out of the pond, but the only place to put them is on the puzzle board itself.\n\n- You can't just look at the box to see what the finished puzzle looks like. You have to correctly place a bunch of pieces to earn a five second glimpse of the finished puzzle.","November 11, 2014","false","14.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/284950/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Pixel Puzzles is exactly what it looks like: a jigsaw puzzle game.  Unused pieces float around the top and left of the puzzle in an appropriately-themed koi pond until you grab them and place them in the puzzle.  All pieces are oriented correctly with no rotation function.  Pieces will lock into place when close enough to their correct location no matter if adjacent pieces are in place or not.  Pieces will not lock together when not already placed in the correct location in the puzzle.\n\nPuzzles increase in difficulty as you progress through the game by increasing the complexity of the image and the number of pieces in the puzzle.  In the later puzzles the pond is so packed with pieces it's very difficult to locate a specific one and I took to just dragging random pieces out onto the board.  Each puzzle has different shapes for pieces and some of them make it very obvious when two pieces fit together.\n\nThere is one large problem with the game however.  When picking up pieces, the game has a really nasty habit of picking up any piece EXCEPT the one you actually clicked on.  I've clicked on a piece that was completely alone in the pond and had the game grab one an inch away instead.  It gets quite frustrating seeing a piece and not being able to grab it before it floats off to get lost in the jumble of other pieces again.\n\nDespite that one major flaw, it's a competent jigsaw puzzle game which I don't believe there are many of on Steam.  I'd rate it an "indifferent" if I could.","June 25, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/recommended/284950/","crypticcat","Merdakah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/","212 products in account","All puzzles completed, including DLC to date.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=269499644\n\nPixel Puzzles is a nice jig-saw simulator. It has a wide range of puzzles with pastoral scenes of rural to ancient Japan that individually range from ho-hum to downright beautiful. The puzzles go from 'easy' 60pieces to what I would call 'journeyman' 250pieces.\n\nThe setting is weirdly enough chinese... As you solve a puzzle, a chinese monk is pondering the I-ching and as you successfully place the pieces of your puzzle, he achieves enlightenment which gives you the chance to tap into this enlightenment to see a representation of the completed puzzle.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is tiered and you only unlock the next tier by levelling up your monk which you achieve by completing a set number of puzzles in a given tier. The way it is set up gives the impression that you can go your own way, but the only freedom you have is by deciding which puzzle in a tier you want to do first.\n\nThe puzzle-screen is workmanlike and efficient, which I like. The screen's layout successfully focuses your attention to the part where you work on your puzzle. There's no information on the screen that can grab your attention away from the puzzle. No weird animated stuff, no dancing gibbies, no unasked for anime-crap (which the developers could easily have fallen for, I admire their restraint.).\n\nThe music is light and unintrusive, though I must echo the complaints about the waterdrip garden-ornament. I never experienced the old sound-effect as it was patched before I bought Pixel Puzzles: Japan, but it still serves to shatter my concentration now and then. I would like to see an option to disable/enable the waterdrip garden-ornament so that players who don't want the sound-effect can play the game without it.\n\nBordering the puzzle-table is a koi-pond in which the pieces float around. I guess the idea is that the player is rummaging around in there with their hands to grab a piece. I think it's a fun idea, but it doesn't translate well once in the game and trying to fish out the piece that you want can be a source of mild annoyance.\nThough the developers did went the extra mile here. For a cute laugh, catch the Koi and drop it on the puzzle-table. ^^\n\nThe actual completing of the jig-saws is fundamentally flawed though. The pieces don't snap together, but they individually snap to the grid. This means that you can't make clusters like you can when you piece together a real jig-saw. I think that this is a glaring oversight.\nSecondly, it makes it extremely easy to cheese completion of a jig-saw as you can move a random piece around until it snaps in place, made even easier because the snap-to-grid mechanic is very forgiving. I have oftenly seen that I pushed a random piece aside only to have it snap to the grid!\nAnother thing that missed the intended goal I guess is the form of the pieces. Though the developers probably thought that the sometimes outlandish shapes would make the puzzles harder, (did they recognize the problem with the snap-to-grid action too?), it actually achieves the opposite. I oftenly found myself looking for a specific shape rather than trying to find a piece that graphically matched the picture. The weird shapes make it too easy to piece together the bane of every jig-saw fanatic; large sections of clear blue sky.\n\nThere is no scoring in Pixel Puzzles so completing a puzzle without using the monk's enlightenment goes unrewarded. Pixel Puzzles further does not block the computer from falling asleep, or to start the screensaver. Pixel Puzzler also doesn't believe in tooltips so it isn't readily clear what a button does unless you click on it to find out.\n\nWhile I do like the game an sich, as it does exactly what it says on the tin and nothing more or less, which with today's games is somewhat of a blessing as it has been a while since I've bought a game that did what is promised, I dislike the fact that when it comes to piecing together a jig-saw, Pixel Puzzler fails. The snap-to-grid action as opposed to fitting pieces together, coupled with the fact that with the weird shapes the piecing together is nothing but a 'find the weird shape that fits another weird shape affair', works to render the game alltogether too easy and robs the player of a challenge.\n\nStill a fun game that provides a good diversion and most certainly not overpriced. But it fails where it matters and that's a shame.","June 9, 2014","false","18.4"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

A nice theme, some pretty challenging puzzles later on, but there are just too many small annoyances that make you think: 'why didn't the developers fix this? They surely must have played their own game?'\n\nThese are the things that make a possibly calming game into an occasional teeth grinder:\n\nPuzzles can't be saved mid-game. So when you have been playing Pixel Puzzles while waiting for something to finish downloading you can't save your current state of the puzzle. This destroys the whole casual nature of the game. It's either finish the puzzle or start the puzzle over the next time. And with pretty masive puzzles in later levels, that's just not cool.\nThe puzzle pieces literally float around a fish pond that surround half the puzzle field. In later levels the amount of pieces increases. This also makes the puzzles pieces very, very small. It becomes quite hard to see them and properly discern them from one another. And to add to the problems with this...\nThe mouse pointer is incredibly inaccurate. Imagine wanting to click-drag a puzzle piece from the pond onto the table, and having to click six or seven times, because the pointer keeps picking up pieces besides the one you want. Oh, and remember that the pieces float around? Yeah, terribly annoying.\nThe sound is supposed to add to the meditative, monastery-like atmosphere of the game. Too bad the sound quality is pretty low and several sound effects have a slight static to them when they play.\nFor €6,99 there's just too many obvious things unnecessarily working against the player. Around €2 would be acceptable and I then would also recommend the game, because the puzzles are challenging and have a pretty big 'just one more puzzle before bed' feel about them.","April 3, 2015","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the game has two major issues.\n\nFirst, puzzles are easy.  There is no piece rotation, which makes it rather obvious where pieces will go.  The distance that you can be off when you place a piece is rather forgiving, making it easy to place pieces by guessing.\n\nSecond, the user interface is fatally flawed when playing larger puzzles, to a degree that large puzzles are exercises in frustration where you often simply cannot pick up the piece that you actually desire to pick up.  Unplaced pieces float in a pool around the board, and with large puzzles you have large clumps of numerous pieces.  The fatal flaw is that piece selection does not appear to be based on what the screen shows, and it appears to be nearly (if not entirely) impossible to pick up certain pieces if others are nearby.  One would think that the game would grab the top piece under the cursor, but it often doesn't.  Not only will it often refuse to grab the top piece of an overlapping stack, sometimes it appears to vacuum in nearby pieces that aren't even under the cursor.  You can know exactly which piece you want to pick up, but find it impossible to actually get the game to pick it up.","April 3, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/recommended/284950/","PrismaticRebirth","PrismaticRebirth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/","777 products in account","Introduction: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a casual game in which you solve a variety of jigsaw puzzles by clicking and dragging a puzzle piece from the river surrounding the board to where it belongs on the board itself. While the game does several things correctly, it ultimately has too many problems for me to truly recommend it. It is a decent game, but falls just short of greatness.\n\n\n\nGameplay:  Being a jigsaw puzzle game, there is only a certain amount of gameplay to be expected. You solve the jigsaw puzzles by clicking on a puzzle piece from a flowing river around the edge of the board to the board itself. It's simple; however there are a few annoyances.\n\nThe river constantly moves the puzzle pieces around, which is quite neat for the smaller puzzles. However, the puzzle pieces bounce off each other and the edges of the river. This results in puzzle pieces being clumped together on the larger puzzles, even getting stuck in corners. In one such puzzle, there were about seven puzzle pieces stuck in a corner, overlapping each other.\n\nPicking the puzzle piece you want in this mess is an annoyance as the click detection seems a bit off. Despite my mouse being directly over the desired puzzle piece, I would often pick up the puzzle piece just beside it, over and over. Even though I knew the piece I wanted, I struggled against the game to actually get it. Dropping a puzzle piece back in the river spawns it to the bottom left part of the river instead of the spot you dropped it, which further adds to the "clumping" issue.\n\nFor the small puzzles, the river is actually quite a refreshing concept. For the larger puzzles, it quickly turns into an annoyance, making it take much longer than it should to solve the puzzle.\n\nUpon correctly putting a puzzle piece in the correct spot on the board, you will randomly get a piece of the yin and yang symbol. Upon fully completing the symbol, you will be able to temporarily see the completed puzzle on the board and the pieces you have already placed. This is an interesting concept, but it ultimately felt...a bit pointless. In most cases, I felt like this made it even more difficult to see what I had placed and what was left. I only found the feature useful on the last puzzle. It is also random when you get a piece of the symbol; however it happened often enough to not be an issue. It may help solve the puzzle, but I feel it could have been done better.\n\nThere are 21 puzzles in the game to complete, which is very reasonable for the price tag. Not all of the puzzles are available to complete right way, however. The player must complete the smaller puzzles to unlock the larger ones. This gives a sense of progression, which is interesting for this genre of game. There is actually an, albeit brief, cut-scene that plays showing the player's avatar "levelling up". Completing every puzzle in the game took approximately 9 hours. The puzzle sizes range from 60 pieces to 350 pieces.\n\n\n\nArt & Graphics:  The game captures a Japanese feel to it quite well. All of the puzzles carry a Japanese theme, and the board the player assembles the puzzle on also has this same theme. The graphics are simple - about what you would expect for a puzzle game. I had no difficulty running the game on a 1920x1080 monitor while also using dual monitors.\n\n\n\nSound:  Unfortunately, the game only has one music track that plays both on the main menu of the game, and when assembling puzzles. This music track carries a Japanese theme and is relaxing for a time; however I had to disable the music after completing a few puzzles as it got tiring. Besides the music, there is not much other sound to speak of. There is no sound that plays when inserting a puzzle piece to the correct place unless it randomly gives you a piece of the yin and yang symbol. There is no sound when the player "levels up" their avatar. There is no sound when completing the puzzle. The game feels very quiet. As a result, I hope you love the one music track that plays, or you had best play your own music in the background.\n\n\n\nReplay Value:  Once you complete every puzzle, there is no incentive to do so again. Every puzzle has the exact same pieces every time and your avatar only levels up to a certain point. While the developers have added two free puzzles to the game in the past (the game originally had 19), it is very unlikely more puzzles will be added. There are 26 achievements for the game, although nearly all of them are only for completing the puzzles.\n\n\n\n\nPrismatic Complaints:  There is no save feature for the game. If you exit out of the puzzle, your computer crashes, or your power goes out: you are out of luck. Completing a puzzle saves your progress of course, however your progress on the puzzle itself is not saved. This makes it a difficult game to play casually, as you either have to complete a puzzle in one sitting or leave the game running to finish it later. There is also no Steam cloud support.\n\n\n\nClosing: While Pixel Puzzles: Japan does several things right and tries new things, it ultimately falls a bit short of greatness. The game is fun, and I enjoyed my time on it, however the annoyances are a bit too frequent. The lack of many sounds, as well as the lack of saving, also brings the game down a bit.\nIf you're a fan of jigsaw puzzles, you will likely have a good time, but be frustrated by the annoyances the game has.","April 3, 2015","false","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hadnt made a jigsaw puzzle since childhood and ill guess its 25 years ago since i did one of this magnitude (200-300 puzzles) and i bought this one with the intent of a bit of a casual gaming and to get the achievements.\nFirst of all when doing jigsaw puzzles its common to arrange the puzzles in some order before really getting started to get a good overview of the colours and for that sake the puzzles themselfs. In this game the puzzles starts floating around in a pond and its difficult to get that sort of overview as the only place you can do that is in the field where the puzzle is laid. So the player has the choice to have a messy area where the puzzle is put together or grabbing the moving puzzles in the pond where they keep moving over and under eachother and it gets pretty random which one you get.\nThe mechanics of this game is like when you move the puzzle and you get to the place where its supposed to be it locks onto the spot without the option to remove it again so its quite easy in that way. As i mentioned earlier in this review i partially if not mainly bought this game to get the achievements but it seems this games achievments are pretty broken atleast to some degree as ive gotten two involving picking up a koi fish and another one regarding the same fish. Ive played the first 6 tables (i believe it was 6) and solved them all and even done  one or two of them twice but i still havent got a single of the puzzle achievements so im pretty infuriated to have wasted my time on this game.\nIn the end if you like puzzles ill recommend doing a real one because of the before mentioned issues of this game and for myself ill guess i wont do another jigzaw puzzle for the next 25 years and it certainly wont be this one.","May 19, 2015","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzle pieces float around in a "pond" on the edge of the screen.  I can often see the piece that I want to pick up.  Let's say it's a side piece, and I know where it fits.  Even if the piece appears to be floating relatively alone or it's the top piece in a pile (and therefore the one I'd expect to pick up when I click on it), I get a random center piece when I try to pick it up.  It's like the game avoids letting you pick up the useful piece just to make things more difficult, but this is absurdly annoying.  I end up throwing puzzle pieces all over the place trying to get the one that I want.  It's not exactly hard, just really annoying.\n\nWith this gameplay, the only reason I would recommend this is to get card drops and an easy 100% game by using the "stacking cheat" method to complete the puzzles.\n\nEDIT: After spending some more time with this, I feel the need to come back to and reiterate that it's a real crap experience.  The main challenge appears to be piece management - as in, actually seeing your pieces and picking up the correct piece.  I often found myself thinking, "This puzzle would be really easy if I could see the pieces and pick them up."  It's like doing a puzzle on a table which is too small, while the pieces are running in circles and piling on top of each other, and you have arthritis so you struggle to pick up the pieces even after locating the correct one.\n\nWhen I do a puzzle in real life, I lay out all the pieces, start with the corners, then do the sides, then fill in the middle.

ARRGHHH!!! Very rage inducing, in what should be a very relaxing, slow paced game. The whole experience would be much better if the pieces stayed still, and if the mouse selected the piece that is immediately below the tip of the pointer.\n\nPuzzle dynamics are otherwise good, although you can't connect two pieces that match together unless they are in the exact correct spot on the board.\n\nWould not recommend.","May 20, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At higher levels, when the number of pieces increases, the annoyance of occasionaly grabbing the wrong piece grows exponentially. It is no longer an random glitch but a game-crippling bug. 9 times out of 10 you don't get the piece you grab, but some other close by or below it. When doing the edge pieces of a 300+ piece jigsaw, I ended piling all the wrong pieces to the board, then stored the edge pieces to another area of board and dumped the centre pieces back to the stream. There must be something wrong with the selection algorithm, didn't bother to test if the screen resolution effects it.\nMy old review below still holds, it would be a nice game without the effing bug! At it's current state it is only playable with low piece counts.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nPretty good small puzzle game. I was a bit wary about the "floating pieces in koi pond"-thing, but as the pieces are not rotatable and puzzle sizes are small, it is works quite well - it is easy enough to spot the pieces  and there is no need for extra temp storage trays. A couple of negatives: you can't build separate sections of the puzzle (the pieces do not bind unless they are in their correct final position), and picking the pieces from koi pond is not always wysiwyg - you sometimes get the wrong piece even though your mouse cursor is pointing for the correct one. There seems to be something wrong with the grabbing logic.\n\nIf you are in search of a relaxing simple puzzle game, this fills the need.","February 23, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This REALLY IS a puzzle game. A game where you actually put pieces of a picture together so you can form a whole picture.\n\nThe game starts out with big, simple pieces so you can solve the puzzles easily, as well as help you get started with how the game is played. As you move on to the next level, the pieces get smaller as well as having to deal with more pieces at one time.\n\nMy only real complaint is that you can't put pieces together to make a whole piece and then try to place that whole piece in the spot it belongs. You have to "know" where each piece goes on the board. So the point is you have to find where the piece goes on the board without being able to make clusters of pieces.\n\nOverall a very good idea for people who are into "puzzle" games. Think about it, when you buy this, you get  40 puzzle boards to complete. Each board you pass gets harder to solve because the pieces get smaller. Versus getting a "REAL" puzzle, you can't lose pieces, and you can't lose the game.","January 5, 2015","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When it gets crowded with a lot of pieces in the more difficult, larger puzzles at the end of the game, you very rarely grab the piece you are clicking on.  Gets annoying and adds more time to the puzzle.  Also, when you grab a piece and don't need it and drop it back in the river it doesn't land where you put it and just disappears and gets mixed up with the rest of the pieces again (so you can't set a piece to the side for later).\n\nIf you like jigsaw puzzles you'll like this game and for the price you can't go wrong.","March 22, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? Well, two reasons, mostly.\n\nFirstly, the game doesn't care if you find two connecting pieces and put them together, which is how I (and most people) usually go about completing a jigsaw. Instead, it only cares if you put a piece in it's correct position on the picture, because yes, I absolutely knew that random piece went in that exact spot when it's closest neighbours are 6 pieces away.\n\nSecondly, while I actually like the little pond with pieces floating around, constantly shuffling, the fact that 9 times out of 10, I can't just click on the piece I want and actually get it, rather than another piece floating in the area, is extremely frustrating.\n\nDue to these two glaring design flaws, I cannot recommend this game. I'm sure there are some people who will be satisfied with it, but I'm also sure there are far better alternatives out there.","February 19, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then it becomes extremely annoying.  The puzzle pieces you want become impossible to grab from the pool of the unused ones - I had to click like ten times until I got the one I wanted (I think this is a bug - they sort of float around, moving constantly, passing over each other, but even though the one I wanted was on the top, clicking on the pile kept giving me the bottom ones that I didn't want... and by the time I got through the pile, others floated over the one I wanted again. EXTREMELY annoying.)\n\nOverall, the game has nice environment, a few jokes incorporated into it, not-so-special pictures as puzzles (I didn't find the photographies used particularly beautiful - they look like snapshots a tourist might take when visiting Japan), and no option to save your unfinished work.\n\nOverall, I'd give it about 45% - it could have been worse, but there are better games to spend money on out there.","March 7, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At higher levels, when the number of pieces increases, the annoyance of occasionaly grabbing the wrong piece grows exponentially. It is no longer an random glitch but a game-crippling bug. 9 times out of 10 you don't get the piece you grab, but some other close by or below it. When doing the edge pieces of a 300+ piece jigsaw, I ended piling all the wrong pieces to the board, then stored the edge pieces to another area of board and dumped the centre pieces back to the stream. There must be something wrong with the selection algorithm, didn't bother to test if the screen resolution effects it.\nMy old review below still holds, it would be a nice game without the effing bug! At it's current state it is only playable with low piece counts.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nPretty good small puzzle game. I was a bit wary about the "floating pieces in koi pond"-thing, but as the pieces are not rotatable and puzzle sizes are small, it is works quite well - it is easy enough to spot the pieces  and there is no need for extra temp storage trays. A couple of negatives: you can't build separate sections of the puzzle (the pieces do not bind unless they are in their correct final position), and picking the pieces from koi pond is not always wysiwyg - you sometimes get the wrong piece even though your mouse cursor is pointing for the correct one. There seems to be something wrong with the grabbing logic.\n\nIf you are in search of a relaxing simple puzzle game, this fills the need.","February 23, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In theory this should be good, but with a lot of pieces floating around (level 3+ puzzles) even if you click on the piece you want to pick up, you're offered other pieces instead, countless times. For me this is bad coding, plain and simple, because any tester can notice that and for sure the system is not supposed to work like that.\n\nThen there's the audio. Effects and music seems to have been recorded with a cell phone or something similar, I usually play with headphones and the background noise was terribly annoying.\n\nMany reviewers pointed out also that this game lacks a mid-puzzle save feature, but I have to say that it took at most one hour to complete puzzles (played 10h to complete 15 puzzles) and even if you're really bad with puzzles I can't see how you could spend more than idk, 2 hours trying to solve any of them, therefore I don't think the save feature is really something that is badly missing.\n\nSo, again, I fully enjoyed playing this puzzle game, but because of the above I'd probably not recommend it to anyone, just buy a real physical puzzle instead.","April 26, 2015","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a bad game per se (I personally enjoyed it) but it has a lot of flaws that makes it hard for me to recommend it to everyone. I still would recommend this game for jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts but, preferably, only when it's on sale.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR:	Those who love solving traditional jigsaw puzzles.\nThose looking for a relaxing casual video game.\nThose who like or appreciate Japan and its culture.\nThose who have the time and patience to complete puzzles.\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR:	Those who don't like solving puzzles of any sorts.\nThose who couldn't care less about Japan and its culture. You'll be looking at pictures from Japan for hours so you have to be appreciative of it otherwise it might bore you.\nThose looking for an adrenaline pumping game. Unless you find solving jigsaw puzzles to be intense...\nThose who don't have the time and patience to complete puzzles. It doesn't save your progress while you're in the middle of solving puzzles. You can read more about it on the rest of the review.\nTHE REST OF THE REVIEWFor the people that actually like reading walls of texts.\n\nSAVE THE WORST FOR FIRST\nI remember a long time ago when I used to piece together jigsaw puzzles of different sizes. I remember how I'd feel really good about myself each time I complete a puzzle and I get to show it off to the rest of the household. I also remember not being able to complete some puzzles in one sitting. I'd piece together parts of the puzzle and when I get bored or have something else to do, I just leave it as is until I can come back to finish it.\n\nThat last part is important. Some jigsaw puzzles take time to complete (depending on the size) and not everyone has the time to finish a puzzle in a single sitting. The ability to save progress in the middle of piecing together a puzzle is present in physical jigsaw puzzles. But sadly, it's a feature that's absent  in this game. And it is, in my opinion, the game's biggest flaw.\n\nYOU CAN'T SAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF PIECING TOGETHER A PUZZLE.\n\nI'm not sure why such an important feature is absent from this game. The first couple of puzzles only took me about 10-20 minutes to solve so it didn't bother me at the start. But as the puzzles start getting larger and more difficult, it easily became more apparent that this game needed a save feature. The last couple of puzzles could take more than an hour (if not hours) to complete and not being able to save your progress until you've actually finished solving the puzzle was really frustrating.\n\nNote: The devs seem to have learned from this mistake and made sure that you can save progress in their latest Pixel Puzzles games. But sadly, they seem to have no plans (or they're not able) to patch in a save feature for this game in particular. So, it's beyond...SAVING (bad pun intended).\n\nWHO DOESN'T LIKE JAPAN?\nI like Japan. The land of anime, manga, vending machines, sushi and other weird yet oddly delicious food, among all other things. It's probably the number one in my list of countries I want to visit one day.\n\nThe game's focus is on the traditional Japanese setting which might seem boring to those who are not interested at all about the country. If you're not into Japan and it's culture, then you probably won't like the game. But if you're like me who can appreciate the beautiful pictures of traditional Japanese locations and such, then you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nSOME WEIRD GAME MECHANICS\nSome of the jigsaw pieces in the later stages of the game take on really weird shapes. It makes the game a lot harder but also interesting and somewhat fresh.  This is a positive.\n\nThe player also gains a 'power-up' of sorts after piecing together a certain amount of puzzle pieces into the board. What this power-up does is show the entire picture for about 5 seconds. Now, that would've been neat but I feel like 5 seconds is too short especially in the later puzzles of the game considering that getting the power-up itself is no easy task. So in all honesty, I feel like the power-up is not really all that helpful.\n\nThe puzzle pieces that have yet to be properly placed into the board float in the pond and keep moving around. It's very clunky and unnecessary. The pieces don't stop moving while floating in the pond and it makes it hard for the player to pick up a specific piece. Try to imagine solving a physical jigsaw puzzle. Now, imagine that all the puzzle pieces that have yet to be properly placed on the board keep moving around. It makes the game harder than it should be and it does get very annoying.\n\nRELAX, IT'S JUST A GAME\nJigsaw puzzles are relaxing brainteasers. Sure, puzzles tend to be frustrating at times to finish, but you have all the time in the world so you can solve puzzles at your own pace. This game is no different. It's made for relaxation. The pictures and the peaceful ambient music help support this.\n\nSadly, there are some negatives about this. One is the save feature which I've already explained. It could've been a much more relaxing game if you didn't have to worry about losing your progress while piecing together a puzzle.\n\nAnd the second one is the music. It's relaxing. Maybe a little too relaxing. Relaxing to the point where you just feel like taking a nap instead of finishing a puzzle. I had to play my own music in the background just to keep myself awake while solving the puzzles. This would not have been a problem if only it had a save feature where you can just quit the game, take a nap, and finish it at a later time.\n\n(Again with the save feature...it's like being able to save your progress is the missing piece of the puzzle that would've made this game much better.)\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs a traditional jigsaw puzzle game, it's good. You have a variety of puzzles to solve and they even take on different wacky shapes later on in the game. But it's plagued with flaws; most notably a lack of a mid-game save feature which made me decide to give it a "Not Recommended" review. If it's on sale and you're into jigsaw puzzles, then maybe you should pick it up.\n\nThe devs have also learned their lesson and included a mid-game save feature on their latest Pixel Puzzles games which is great. But until the same feature is implemented to this game in particular, my "Not Recommended" rating still stands.\n\nREVIEWER'S CREDIBILITY\nSolved all the puzzles.

The atmosphere, music, and puzzles are quite immersive and the go-at-your-own-pace (non-timed) element makes this great for young and old alike.\n\nThat said, there are some obvious flaws within Pixel Puzzles - Japan:\n\nThere is no mid-level save feature. This is the biggest issue that can easily flip a recommendation. The beginning levels are easy enough to sit through in one sitting, taking anywhere between 5-20 minutes each (or more if you're really taking your time). Once the puzzles get harder (and the amount of pieces start increasing), the probability of you wanting to take a break will shoot up. Your only options for taking a breather will be either to 1. Tab out of the game and leave it running until you want to come back to it or 2. Close out of the game and restart the entire level. Both options are pains in their own ways.\n\nPuzzle-fishing can sometimes be more annoying than the puzzle itself. Puzzle pieces float around in a pond that borders your puzzle mat (it's actually a zen garden -- fitting). There is no pause feature for the pond so you're left trying to grab the piece you want in the middle of all the others. Clicking or click-hold-releasing a piece over the pond will make it poof and teleport somewhere else in the water. When you've been clearing out a pile and you accidentally clear out the piece you want as well.. it's a little frustrating. It's easily avoidable if you're not a dolt like me.\n\nPossible catch-release bug? Not quite sure if it's my laptop/touchpad/mouse but it sometimes takes me a couple of clicks to pick up pieces. Some of them get "stuck" on the board (when they're not in the right place) and takes several tries to grab. I'm running Windows 8.1 in case the problem's on my end.\n\nCons taken into consideration, I would still recommend this game if gifted or purchased on a discount. I don't think the retail price is worth dealing with the snags that may make you want to rage-quit (or completely abandon the game) but it's a good little single-player casual to fiddle around with.","March 18, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mind playing them sometimes, but I wouldn't consider myself being fond of them.\nIf you are a big fan of those, maybe the points I'll make won't be negative for you. If that's the case, feel free to disregard my opinion.\n\nThe main gimmick to this game is that the pieces move around. It wouldn't be so bad, but the way they made it, is incredibly frustrating.\nThe pond where the pieces float is rather small. In the beginning it's not a problem, since the pieces are big, and there is not a lot of them. Later on though, pieces get smaller, and there's a whole lot more of them, but the pond stays the same size, which results in hundreds of puzzle pieces being on top of one another, in giant pile that you can't do anything about.\nAnd what's even worse, even if you somehow happen to see in that pile the exact piece you need at the moment, you won't be able to pick it up, unless there is no other piece next to it. That is because the controls are somehow broken, and the game will pick up any piece BUT the one that you are pointing at.\n\nAnother big flaw is the lack of saving your progress.\nLater puzzles, combined with those broken and frustrating controls, can take several hours to complete, and you have to do that in one sitting or you'll be forced to start over.\nIf you prefer it that way, great. But not everyone has the time and patience to do so, and such not even having the option to save is just bad design.\n\nOther than that, it's just a regular jigsaw puzzle with regular photographs of Japanese scenery, which is why I also feel like I've been lied to a little bit. With a title being "Pixel Puzzles" I expected, what else, pixel art, and I've got none of that.","May 5, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In theory this should be good, but with a lot of pieces floating around (level 3+ puzzles) even if you click on the piece you want to pick up, you're offered other pieces instead, countless times. For me this is bad coding, plain and simple, because any tester can notice that and for sure the system is not supposed to work like that.\n\nThen there's the audio. Effects and music seems to have been recorded with a cell phone or something similar, I usually play with headphones and the background noise was terribly annoying.\n\nMany reviewers pointed out also that this game lacks a mid-puzzle save feature, but I have to say that it took at most one hour to complete puzzles (played 10h to complete 15 puzzles) and even if you're really bad with puzzles I can't see how you could spend more than idk, 2 hours trying to solve any of them, therefore I don't think the save feature is really something that is badly missing.\n\nSo, again, I fully enjoyed playing this puzzle game, but because of the above I'd probably not recommend it to anyone, just buy a real physical puzzle instead.","April 26, 2015","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EXTREMELY annoying.)\n\nOverall, the game has nice environment, a few jokes incorporated into it, not-so-special pictures as puzzles (I didn't find the photographies used particularly beautiful - they look like snapshots a tourist might take when visiting Japan), and no option to save your unfinished work.\n\nOverall, I'd give it about 45% - it could have been worse, but there are better games to spend money on out there.","March 7, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still would recommend this game for jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts but, preferably, only when it's on sale.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR:	Those who love solving traditional jigsaw puzzles.\nThose looking for a relaxing casual video game.\nThose who like or appreciate Japan and its culture.\nThose who have the time and patience to complete puzzles.\nNOT RECOMMENDED FOR:	Those who don't like solving puzzles of any sorts.\nThose who couldn't care less about Japan and its culture. You'll be looking at pictures from Japan for hours so you have to be appreciative of it otherwise it might bore you.\nThose looking for an adrenaline pumping game. Unless you find solving jigsaw puzzles to be intense...\nThose who don't have the time and patience to complete puzzles. It doesn't save your progress while you're in the middle of solving puzzles. You can read more about it on the rest of the review.\nTHE REST OF THE REVIEWFor the people that actually like reading walls of texts.\n\nSAVE THE WORST FOR FIRST\nI remember a long time ago when I used to piece together jigsaw puzzles of different sizes. I remember how I'd feel really good about myself each time I complete a puzzle and I get to show it off to the rest of the household. I also remember not being able to complete some puzzles in one sitting. I'd piece together parts of the puzzle and when I get bored or have something else to do, I just leave it as is until I can come back to finish it.\n\nThat last part is important. Some jigsaw puzzles take time to complete (depending on the size) and not everyone has the time to finish a puzzle in a single sitting. The ability to save progress in the middle of piecing together a puzzle is present in physical jigsaw puzzles. But sadly, it's a feature that's absent  in this game. And it is, in my opinion, the game's biggest flaw.\n\nYOU CAN'T SAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF PIECING TOGETHER A PUZZLE.\n\nI'm not sure why such an important feature is absent from this game. The first couple of puzzles only took me about 10-20 minutes to solve so it didn't bother me at the start. But as the puzzles start getting larger and more difficult, it easily became more apparent that this game needed a save feature. The last couple of puzzles could take more than an hour (if not hours) to complete and not being able to save your progress until you've actually finished solving the puzzle was really frustrating.\n\nNote: The devs seem to have learned from this mistake and made sure that you can save progress in their latest Pixel Puzzles games. But sadly, they seem to have no plans (or they're not able) to patch in a save feature for this game in particular. So, it's beyond...SAVING (bad pun intended).\n\nWHO DOESN'T LIKE JAPAN?\nI like Japan. The land of anime, manga, vending machines, sushi and other weird yet oddly delicious food, among all other things. It's probably the number one in my list of countries I want to visit one day.\n\nThe game's focus is on the traditional Japanese setting which might seem boring to those who are not interested at all about the country. If you're not into Japan and it's culture, then you probably won't like the game. But if you're like me who can appreciate the beautiful pictures of traditional Japanese locations and such, then you'll probably enjoy this game.\n\nSOME WEIRD GAME MECHANICS\nSome of the jigsaw pieces in the later stages of the game take on really weird shapes. It makes the game a lot harder but also interesting and somewhat fresh.  This is a positive.\n\nThe player also gains a 'power-up' of sorts after piecing together a certain amount of puzzle pieces into the board. What this power-up does is show the entire picture for about 5 seconds. Now, that would've been neat but I feel like 5 seconds is too short especially in the later puzzles of the game considering that getting the power-up itself is no easy task. So in all honesty, I feel like the power-up is not really all that helpful.\n\nThe puzzle pieces that have yet to be properly placed into the board float in the pond and keep moving around. It's very clunky and unnecessary. The pieces don't stop moving while floating in the pond and it makes it hard for the player to pick up a specific piece. Try to imagine solving a physical jigsaw puzzle. Now, imagine that all the puzzle pieces that have yet to be properly placed on the board keep moving around. It makes the game harder than it should be and it does get very annoying.\n\nRELAX, IT'S JUST A GAME\nJigsaw puzzles are relaxing brainteasers. Sure, puzzles tend to be frustrating at times to finish, but you have all the time in the world so you can solve puzzles at your own pace. This game is no different. It's made for relaxation. The pictures and the peaceful ambient music help support this.\n\nSadly, there are some negatives about this. One is the save feature which I've already explained. It could've been a much more relaxing game if you didn't have to worry about losing your progress while piecing together a puzzle.\n\nAnd the second one is the music. It's relaxing. Maybe a little too relaxing. Relaxing to the point where you just feel like taking a nap instead of finishing a puzzle. I had to play my own music in the background just to keep myself awake while solving the puzzles. This would not have been a problem if only it had a save feature where you can just quit the game, take a nap, and finish it at a later time.\n\n(Again with the save feature...it's like being able to save your progress is the missing piece of the puzzle that would've made this game much better.)\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs a traditional jigsaw puzzle game, it's good. You have a variety of puzzles to solve and they even take on different wacky shapes later on in the game. But it's plagued with flaws; most notably a lack of a mid-game save feature which made me decide to give it a "Not Recommended" review. If it's on sale and you're into jigsaw puzzles, then maybe you should pick it up.\n\nThe devs have also learned their lesson and included a mid-game save feature on their latest Pixel Puzzles games which is great. But until the same feature is implemented to this game in particular, my "Not Recommended" rating still stands.\n\nREVIEWER'S CREDIBILITY\nSolved all the puzzles.

Reading the forums, this has been a bug for a long time and has never been fixed (that's really bad as it should have never even be this crap)... But as another user says, the easiest is with these 220 puzzles, to not drive you insane, is to just put the wrong piece on a pile on the edge of the board and dump them later back into the pond..\nMind you this only seems to happen with the 220 puzzles, all the others don't really seem to have this problem.\n\nAnother minor point is the two extra 220 puzzles above and below the 350 one, if you finished them, they stay greyed out..\n\nI bought this when it was on sale for 1.40 euro, and I think that's a good price, but I can't recommend it full price due to the annoying bug (and the fact the developers haven't fixed it even though they have released a couple of other pixel puzzles after that one).","February 19","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this one, you have all the pieces floating around randomly in the water and when you put enough specific pieces in place, you can get a brief preview of what the finished image is supposed to be.\n\nFor most of the puzzles, this is all fine and dandy. However, when you get to the last few puzzles that are over 200 pieces, trying to find that piece that you're looking for floating in that mess is quite annoying. And then, I don't know how, but somehow the computer knows what piece you're going after and gives you every other piece BUT the one you're going after. It'll even give you a piece that's not where you're clicking, only near it.\n\nAnother thing that I didn't care for in this title is the method that the pieces snap into place. On this one, the pieces snap to the board. I much prefer that the pieces snap to each other since it makes it easier to see if you got any pieces laying around on the board when you're wondering what the hell you did with the last few pieces.\n\nOne thing I really did like about this was the interesting ways the pieces were cut. It made the puzzles seem more unique and fun.\n\nIt took me about 13 hours to go through all of this. My overall rating lands just on the not recommended side.","February 10","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, you can catch the fish.  No, you cannot catch the lily pads.  Yes, you can put the fish into the water feature in the bottom left corner of the screen.\n\nquirk 2:  This one did bother me a bit.  There is no "save" feature.  If you do not finish a puzzle, but close it, you will have to start that puzzle all over again.  This was not an issue on the smaller puzzles at the beginning, but the later ones take a while.  I ended up leaving the game up and running errands and then picking it back up when I came home.....\n\nThis is still a recommended game and it was a very nice change of pace.","November 21, 2015","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstermanmfr/recommended/284950/","monstermanmfr","MonstermanMFR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstermanmfr/","1619 products in account","Recently I was extremely bored and looking for games in my massive steam library to get 100% achievements on. I ran across Pixel Puzzles: Japan which I picked up from some bundle offer at one point and installed it. My girlfriend came home from work and I asked her to play a video game with me, which is at times very hard to get her to do. She agreed and I decided to fire up this game, as she is quite the puzzle-holic and loves jigsaw puzzles. After hours of playtime, we got all of the achievements in the game and had a good time doing it.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Japan is basically a set of normal jigsaw puzzles on PC. There are 19 different puzzles in the game, which get incrementally larger the farther you go. Putting together the puzzles is fairly simple and works well overall. One large annoyance we experienced consistently is attempting to grab a piece from the "pond", where the pieces you have yet to put down float around until you grab them. Whenever you try to grab a piece floating with others, the majority of the time the game will not grab the correct piece, causing frustration. This can be remedied by just pulling out a bunch of pieces and throwing them on your board, until you can grab the right one. As you place pieces in the correct spot, they lock onto the board to aid in speeding things up as well. The puzzles are all based on Japanese locations and themes, hence the name of the game.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Japan was a nice game to play over a few evenings to 100% achievements, and I recommend it if you can find it at a budget price.","October 14, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are in line with the higher difficulty settings, one because of its high piece count, and the other because of its unusual piece shapes.\n\nThat's one thing I really like about this game, it plays with the overall shape of the pieces and with the interlocking edges. While there are a few puzzles that utilize the traditional silhouette, most of them mix it up with non-uniform sizing and unique key designs (spirals, arrows, prongs, pinking sheared, jagged scallops, etc).\n\nAs far as the puzzle gameplay is concerned, the format is simple. You start out with a blank "sand garden" space where you build your puzzle, surrounded by an L-shaped koi pond that houses your unused pieces. You then use your mouse to pick up pieces from the pond and move them around the game board. When a piece is dropped close enough to the correct placement, a sound effect with play and it will snap into place.\n\nOverall, the game is as basic as it gets. You can change the colour of the sand, you can adjust the volume of the music, and you can switch between fullscreen and windowed, but beyond that there isn't any additional functionality:\n\n- You can't save your progress mid-puzzle. If you exit a puzzle screen, either to the main menu or to the desktop, you forfeit any work you have done so far (completed puzzles stay completed, however).\n- You can't turn off the water feature. The unused pieces in the koi pond are constantly floating, moving, and overlapping each other, and the pieces that appear on top of the pile are not always the ones that will be picked up by your mouse. This is not really a problem when you are dealing with 60 pieces, but on the harder difficulties you will spend half of your time trying to fruitlessly and frustratingly fish out the pieces you want from the pond.\n- There is no zoom mode. The board size remains the same regardless of piece count, so on the higher difficulty tiers it gets harder and harder to see the edges of the pieces.\n- You are unable to consult even a thumbnail of the image you are working on during a puzzle.\n- You can't build sections of the puzzle independently and then move those sections into place.\n- The 21 puzzles are always the same on every playthrough.\n\nWhile you are puzzling, you are entertained by occasional snippets of music. There are a handful of motifs programmed into the game, each one no more than 10-30 seconds long, and each one sounding like the introduction to a song rather than a complete melody. Sometimes you will hear a refrain and then 1-2 minutes of silence. Sometimes the game will play a medley of snippets back-to-back. Sometimes the game will play the same snippet back-to-back. It's possible that the music is somehow tied-in to what actions you are doing, but I couldn't discern any predictable pattern or rationale. Honestly, the snippets themselves were enjoyable, atmospheric, and in-line with the cultural aesthetic of the game, but their length, and the inconsistency of how they were played, was distracting and annoying. (What the music thought it sounded like: "Nostalgic touches of music, liltingly carried on the wind, falling on your ears like leaves falling from trees..." What the music actually sounded like: "A child haltingly and repetitively trying to learn shamisen in the apartment next door.")\n\nThere are 26 achievements for the game, which basically boil down to "play all the puzzles and mess with the fish." You will automatically unlock 99% of them in one playthrough.\n\nTL;DR - If you are just looking for a casual and basic jigsaw game with a good number of puzzles, creative piece designs, and featuring postcard-quality images from Japan, then this is 100% the game for you. However, if you are looking for a high-challenge, high-frill game with adaptive puzzles, sectional construction, zoomable game boards, a rocking soundtrack, and advanced save features, then this is simply not going to meet your expectations. For what it is, and what it claims to be, it does a pretty decent job.\n\nI received this game for free as part of a bundle, and got 11 hours of mostly-fun gameplay out of it. I would give it a 7/10.","May 15, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm unsure wether this is a regional tradition, or just a cruel joke on people who just want to get things done such as myself, but apparently the damn puzzle pieces flow in a river stream. A. River. Stream.\n\nSo, whenever you set your eyes on the damn piece you've been looking for since the beginning of the puzzle, it WILL end up being either submerged, or dragged in a larger clump of pieces. Is this bad for everyone? Not sure. Is it making me wish i could drown myself in the rriver for the sake of never ever being forced to fish up pieces ever again? You bet.\n\n"C'mon man, it can't be all this bad" you might say... Of course you never tried to get ahold of THAT single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of puzzle for 2 minutes straight, as your mouse pointer hovers over it giggling at your feeble attempts. Because, of course, even if you're pointing the piece you want as if you were an italian pointer dog, it WILL fail. Repeatedly.\n\nIf the whole point of the game is supposed to be relaxation and patience, may I say it fails kind of hard in both regards. Even the music, which is kind of interesting to listen to at first gets kind of unnerving after a few rounds of "catch the ducking piece" enchancing the whole "i hope this damn stream explodes and just leaves the damn pieces lying around the board" sensation.\n\nAh, and "dulcis in fundu", you don't even get a damn clue on what the final image will look like ingame, so have fun trying to figure out where each piece belongs based purely on INSTINCT and, idk, supernatural powers of farseeing.\n\nI won't say anything about the puzzle selection menu, which is a game per se, in which the sole objective is to START THE GAME because I can't muster enough strength to bash it as well.\n\nI got this game for free, as a gift, and at first i did believe it was a gesture of friendship. Now i know i've got a mortal enemy out there, keeping an eye out for me, taking adavantage of my weak points.","June 5, 2015","false","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost everything about this game goes against everything I've ever known about putting together puzzles.\n\nFor instance, y'know when you get two seperate pieces that fit together? I'm not sure about you, but my first instinct would be to fit them together. Unfortunatley, the way the game works, is that each individual piece can only snap into place once it's directly where it needs to be in the picture. So instead of being able to put the puzzle together peice by piece, you're forced to leave all the pieces you need scattered on the board, which brings me to the next biggest problem of the game: The koi pond.\n\nSurrounding the top left corners of the board is a koi pond where all of the peices of the puzzle reside. While being an interesting idea in theory, turned out to be this games biggest negative aspect. Again, lets think about how a real-life jigsaw puzzle works. When you're looking around at the countless peices you have to choose from, seeing which colors might match what you're trying to fit in, wouldn't it be great if all of those peices were constantly floating around in a sporadic, aimless fashion making it extremely frustrating to take the peice you want? No. No, that isn't great in the slightest.\n\nThat isn't even the least of the koi pond issues. More often than not, you'll end up grabbing a piece you didn't mean to pick up, so you'll put it back down in the pond. Where does that peice go, you ask?  It reappears in a random spot in the pond. While this might not seem like that big of an issue, when you're trying to get the peice you need as it meshes in with all the other peices in the pond, if you pick it up and drop it accidentally it flys to a completely different location, further wasting your time. Not to mention there is a koi fish in the pond that you're able to pick up, which will often get in your way of picking up the pieces you want.\n\nThis game just seems like a whole new species of headache inducing terror, which is a real shame because I really do enjoy the Japanese theme it was introducing, and I really do feel like it could have been great if they reworked those problems. There just needs to be another jigsaw puzzle game like the one from OMGpop.com a few years ago, it was a flawless jigsaw puzzle game that really embodied the experience of putting together a puzzle with your friends. But until then, I guess I'll have to check out Pixel Puzzles: Anime. God help me.","July 27, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/safaridiscolion/recommended/284950/","safaridiscolion","SafariDiscoLion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/safaridiscolion/","738 products in account","I love doing jigsaw puzzles but I never thought to see if there were any digital versions on Steam. I found this during a Humble Bundle sale and thought I might as well try it for less than $2. It certainly hasn't made me want to throw out all my real jigsaw puzzles, but for what I paid for it, it's a fun distraction.\n\nPros:\n-I like the music and sound of the game. It's very minimalist and zen, very traditionally Japanese. It's nicely relaxing for a game like this.\n-The images are all Japan related, so if you like that kind of thing, you'll like these.\n-The "level up" aspect is sort of neat, levelling up your little monk to do harder and harder puzzles.\n\nCons:\n-The puzzle pieces floating around in the koi pond is kind of annoying. It makes it hard to see what you have left or to spot corner and edge pieces without. Plus picking up a piece and dropping it drops it in a specified location where that piece 'spawns', not where you dropped it.\n-Pieces can't be put together on their own, they have to be dropped into their space on the board. So you can't put together a section separately and then move it into the main board when you can. This also means that just moving a piece onto the board to help find its space can sometimes accidentally have you drop it right onto its spot without meaning to where it snaps in, which spoils it a little bit.\n-The pieces are all always right side up. You don't have to rotate them or anything like that.\n-The pieces aren't 'standard' puzzle shapes, they're all strange little curves and blobs.\n\nThe game's certainly not bad, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. And if you're a jigsaw puzzle 'snob' like I sort of am then the experience is pretty different. But for a cheap price and an hour or so of relaxing with a warm drink, this is perfectly fine.","August 7, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might even select a piece that's several centimeters away from your mouse pointer!\n\nThis one is my own fault, but I got it in part because I thought it allowed customization for kids to puzzles smaller than 60 pieces. It does not.  It scales up from there, but not down.\n\nWhile some of the features of this game are interesting, I don't know what value it adds over just doing a jigsaw either out of the box (much better though obv. not digital) or accessing one of the many free web puzzle sites.

I don't mind playing them sometimes, but I wouldn't consider myself being fond of them.\nIf you are a big fan of those, maybe the points I'll make won't be negative for you. If that's the case, feel free to disregard my opinion.\n\nThe main gimmick to this game is that the pieces move around. It wouldn't be so bad, but the way they made it, is incredibly frustrating.\nThe pond where the pieces float is rather small. In the beginning it's not a problem, since the pieces are big, and there is not a lot of them. Later on though, pieces get smaller, and there's a whole lot more of them, but the pond stays the same size, which results in hundreds of puzzle pieces being on top of one another, in giant pile that you can't do anything about.\nAnd what's even worse, even if you somehow happen to see in that pile the exact piece you need at the moment, you won't be able to pick it up, unless there is no other piece next to it. That is because the controls are somehow broken, and the game will pick up any piece BUT the one that you are pointing at.\n\nAnother big flaw is the lack of saving your progress.\nLater puzzles, combined with those broken and frustrating controls, can take several hours to complete, and you have to do that in one sitting or you'll be forced to start over.\nIf you prefer it that way, great. But not everyone has the time and patience to do so, and such not even having the option to save is just bad design.\n\nOther than that, it's just a regular jigsaw puzzle with regular photographs of Japanese scenery, which is why I also feel like I've been lied to a little bit. With a title being "Pixel Puzzles" I expected, what else, pixel art, and I've got none of that.","May 5, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is very pretty, there is a fish and lily pads too.\n\nHowever, trying to select the exact piece that you want to pick up and place is next to impossible. you can position the tip of your mouse pointer very carefully over the piece you have spotted, and it will continually pick the piece nearby that you don't want. ARRGHHH!!! Very rage inducing, in what should be a very relaxing, slow paced game. The whole experience would be much better if the pieces stayed still, and if the mouse selected the piece that is immediately below the tip of the pointer.\n\nPuzzle dynamics are otherwise good, although you can't connect two pieces that match together unless they are in the exact correct spot on the board.\n\nWould not recommend.","May 20, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzle pieces float around in a "pond" on the edge of the screen.  I can often see the piece that I want to pick up.  Let's say it's a side piece, and I know where it fits.  Even if the piece appears to be floating relatively alone or it's the top piece in a pile (and therefore the one I'd expect to pick up when I click on it), I get a random center piece when I try to pick it up.  It's like the game avoids letting you pick up the useful piece just to make things more difficult, but this is absurdly annoying.  I end up throwing puzzle pieces all over the place trying to get the one that I want.  It's not exactly hard, just really annoying.\n\nWith this gameplay, the only reason I would recommend this is to get card drops and an easy 100% game by using the "stacking cheat" method to complete the puzzles.\n\nEDIT: After spending some more time with this, I feel the need to come back to and reiterate that it's a real crap experience.  The main challenge appears to be piece management - as in, actually seeing your pieces and picking up the correct piece.  I often found myself thinking, "This puzzle would be really easy if I could see the pieces and pick them up."  It's like doing a puzzle on a table which is too small, while the pieces are running in circles and piling on top of each other, and you have arthritis so you struggle to pick up the pieces even after locating the correct one.\n\nWhen I do a puzzle in real life, I lay out all the pieces, start with the corners, then do the sides, then fill in the middle.  This does not simulate that experience.","May 19, 2015","false","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstermanmfr/recommended/284950/","monstermanmfr","MonstermanMFR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monstermanmfr/","1619 products in account","Recently I was extremely bored and looking for games in my massive steam library to get 100% achievements on. I ran across Pixel Puzzles: Japan which I picked up from some bundle offer at one point and installed it. My girlfriend came home from work and I asked her to play a video game with me, which is at times very hard to get her to do. She agreed and I decided to fire up this game, as she is quite the puzzle-holic and loves jigsaw puzzles. After hours of playtime, we got all of the achievements in the game and had a good time doing it.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Japan is basically a set of normal jigsaw puzzles on PC. There are 19 different puzzles in the game, which get incrementally larger the farther you go. Putting together the puzzles is fairly simple and works well overall. One large annoyance we experienced consistently is attempting to grab a piece from the "pond", where the pieces you have yet to put down float around until you grab them. Whenever you try to grab a piece floating with others, the majority of the time the game will not grab the correct piece, causing frustration. This can be remedied by just pulling out a bunch of pieces and throwing them on your board, until you can grab the right one. As you place pieces in the correct spot, they lock onto the board to aid in speeding things up as well. The puzzles are all based on Japanese locations and themes, hence the name of the game.\n\nPixel Puzzles: Japan was a nice game to play over a few evenings to 100% achievements, and I recommend it if you can find it at a budget price.","October 14, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reading the forums, this has been a bug for a long time and has never been fixed (that's really bad as it should have never even be this crap)... But as another user says, the easiest is with these 220 puzzles, to not drive you insane, is to just put the wrong piece on a pile on the edge of the board and dump them later back into the pond..\nMind you this only seems to happen with the 220 puzzles, all the others don't really seem to have this problem.\n\nAnother minor point is the two extra 220 puzzles above and below the 350 one, if you finished them, they stay greyed out..\n\nI bought this when it was on sale for 1.40 euro, and I think that's a good price, but I can't recommend it full price due to the annoying bug (and the fact the developers haven't fixed it even though they have released a couple of other pixel puzzles after that one).","February 19","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not gonna do it.\n-But I got Pixel Puzzles: Japan!\n-What time do you want me to come over your place?\n-Idk, around 7pm?

Thanks to Pixel Puzzles: Japan, not only did I have a gorgeous girlfriend and awesome sex every day, but we occasionally had threesomes as well.\nTime had passed, it had been 1-2 months, and I kept playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan. I had become addicted to Pixel Puzzles: Japan. All I was thinking was Pixel Puzzles. All I was dreaming was Pixel Puzzles. All I could see, hear, feel, smell, taste, was Pixel Puzzles. My girlfriend started to hate that game, because I prefered Pixel Puzzles over her companion. But I was fine. She wasn't. So, we broke up. Two days later, I lost my job. I got kicked out of my house because I had no money to pay the rent 1 month later. I'm currently living in a basement in London where I get WiFi from a neighbour. I haven't slept for 1 whole week. I cannot do anything. Pixel Puzzles: Japan became the love of my life. This game made me realise the meaning of life. Or, to be exact, this game is the meaning of life. I am now raising money to visit the Great Pixel Puzzle Monk in Japan. It's a dream coming true. Your help will be appreciated. Help me make the world a better place. Believe in Pixel Puzzles: Japan.

Sounds fun and mellow enough, just a classic fit the pieces together puzzle like your grandpa did on the table top. Your grandpa could always look at the box to see the picture, but I still can't seem to figure out how I made the picture pop up that one time. Then there are the absolutely tiny puzzle pieces floating in a pond. Floating all over each other, and generally being a nuisance to click, or find the one piece you want. I've had to click 10 times, randomly getting other nearby pieces, before finally getting the one I want. The pictures themselves are pretty, but several just don't have enough definition between areas of the puzzle. It turns them into a random "does this fit here?" mess of trial and error. Then I haven't found a way to save in the middle of a puzzle, you know like grandpa leaving it on the kitchen table til he can get around to it again. If you want to tell me how to save, or look up the puzzle, that's awesome, but it's something the game needs to explain in some clear way itself. Even better would be giving me some static place I can sort the damn puzzle pieces, without just tossing all of them on the puzzle board, where some will obviously randomly click into the right place. That's not how I want the game to work.\n\nIn short, something seemingly meant to be soothing is for me entirely aggravating.\n2/5","July 13, 2015","false","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
