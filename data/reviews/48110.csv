It can be quite fun at times and exciting. Unfortunately, the glitches and bugs out weigh any fun this game will give to you. With the corrupted save files, ghost ships etc. But, if these were the only problems with the game, hell, I'd say give it a shot. Alas, it is not. And the problem this game suffers from, is not the game itself, no no, It's the beautiful, glorious, riveting Ubisoft.\n\nYou've just installed the game. You hit the play button of course! Time for some fun, you'll give the game a shot. A few minutes later Uplay shows up to tell you that, "Hi! You need to create another account! Along with the millions and millions of other online accounts you already have! Ha ha!" So, begrudgingly, you decide to make another damned account. Twenty minutes later you're account is set up. Perfect. You've given them the product key and you're ready to play.\n\n\nHeck, maybe you even liked the game a bit. But a few months pass, you haven't played the game in a while, you uninstalled it because it was taking up room, and you thought, "I'll reinstall it if I ever want to play it again." So you get this odd urge to play a game on the high seas, sinking shipping and what not. You click the install button, wait a few, and you're off! Or, so you think. Uplay comes back and says, "Hi again! Please activate you're product by entering your product key to play!" Finding this strange since you already activated it once, you curiously do so. Copy and paste, and you're done. You reach for the OK button, you click. What happens? "Sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! This key is already being used by another account! Please contact our AMAAAAAAAZING customer support for more information! Ha ha!"\n\n\n\n\n~Ubisoft\n"Actually ♥♥♥♥ you."\n1986-2014~\n\n\n\n\nP.S Get Silent Hunter 3.","September 6, 2014","false","5.2"," 95 of 106 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","95","106","12","0"

You can get around the hell of Uplay, but the game is really really, really buggy. And the fact that most mods dont work with the steam version, your just sol. The game is visually beautiful, and there is something inertly great about being stealthy in the sea and then evaiding capture, but the bugs will have you ripping your hair out. Radar contacts sometimes dont work, and you'll be searching for multiple hours real time waiting to run into someone. AA gunners wont attack planes that are VERY relentless, let alone actually kill them. 6/10 times they wont even shoot at the plane when you have the gun armed, manned and ready; and when they do attack, 8/10 times even an experienced gunner wont bring them down.\n\nI wanted to love this game so so much, but Ubisoft failed us. There are no updates to the game in over 5 years; the only "news" steam has on it was in 2010, and thats just them saying "hey we have this now".\n\nThere is no explination of how to fire torpedos without manually entering eveything in. It took me a min to figure it out--online, not in game--and the way it was implimented was fail. You have numbers 1-3 on your projected torpedo trajectory, and you line up the numbers with the enemy ships numbers. Its really easier to just manually do it, but for new players both are very confusing and there is NO tutorial. Steam says in the description, "Now, every beginner can successfully command a sub free of confusion." That could not be any more of a lie. The tutorial is a joke, and you will actually have an icon at the top of your screen always telling you "use the mouse buttom to look around". That could just be a glitch i personally have, but either way it proves my points. In SH4, if you decided to not manually everything in, it was point and fire. Which if your a beginner, is fun and easy. It is not fun in SH5 for beginners, unless you take the time to learn manually doing everything.\n\nThis game could have been fantastic. And I do wish SH 6 would be made; but it cant be made by ubisoft. They will screw it up like they have since SH4. I have not played SH3, but many say it is the best one, so check that out first. The odd of anyone else making a SH game is slim to none, but one can dream.\n\nIts really sad Ubisoft rushes everything (i wont even start a Assassins Creed rant) always pushing out the next new product. They put the product out, then once it stops selling, they literatly DO NOT CARE if the game gets buggy, at LEAST in regards to SH series. "Whats in if for us?" they ask themself. "Why update the game when no one will buy it from us?". Well, thats because you guys released a buggy half ♥♥♥♥♥ game and didn't put the love into it. Thats why I dont love it. If you guy just made ONE update to the game, and cleared up the rampent bugs, MANY people who play this game would recommend it to others. But alas, your Ubisoft, and you dont give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSorry for putting words in your mouth Ubi, but you know its true.\n\nEdit: I'd like to update this, though it is more directed towards Ubisoft. As aformentiond, I do enjoy SH4 better, it seems more thought out, but bugs are still very much present in earlier patch(s) of the game. After doing some research, v1.5 fixes an issues with magnetic impact toggle not working, which is in my opinion a major hinderence to stratigical gameplay (though not game breaking of course).\nBut you should know that when purchasing SH4 from steam, you are only getting v1.3. In order to get v1.5, from steam, you need to also purchase the DLC U boat missions. This is ridiculous. I have never encountered a game where you need to purchase DLC in order to get a patch that applies to root game. Its really like they are trying to force our hand. I think the general point has gotten across. It definatly will be once you read the reviews for that game, everything advises you to not get it from Steam. Whats really sad, is that I'm actually very tempted to buy the DLC,  I want that update, because honestly this game series is the poster child for sub sims. They basically have a monopoly on it and look where that has taken us, the consumer. Is sub sim a nitch market? Yes. Although I would argue the genre is no more or less a nitch market then 4x games, or survival games; usually there needs to be market compitition for a genre to, for lack of a better word, get better. You need to try and build the game better then the other guy, but with the SH series there was pratically no compitition, which i believe let to SH5 sucking.\n\nIf only I appied the time I took to write this id apply to my school papers.\nI'm also quite happy the one time I gave a ♥♥♥♥ to write a review for a game it actually becomes the most helpful, albeit negative review. I hope sometime down the line, I can change this to a recommendation.","October 22, 2015","false","233.6"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","70","77","4","2"

A fleet of enemy warships are closing in and are unaware of our presence. "Easy prey" me thinks, so I order the sub to snorkel depth and have a looks about. Sure enough, a whole convoy has just sailed into my path. I ready the torpedoes and aim for an easy target. I fire four of them, thinking I will hit more than one ship. Two torpedoes are duds and a third misses entirely. The fourth one, however, is a brave little torpedo and he keeps chugging along. He misses the majority of the convoy and it looks like mission failure. But a little past the convoy is another ship that happened to stray off from the others. My brow is sweating in anticipation as I watch. It's quickly closing in on the target, but too close to tell if it will hit. Then it happens. The enemy vessel explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire as the torpedo strikes it on the starboard side. The ship is destroyed instantaneously.\n\nWhat was that? Suddenly our sub is rocked by something big. The hull is breached and water starts spraying through the rivets. The engine room starts flooding. It appears that the rest of the convoy has discovered us and are bombing our location. "Dive!" I scream and the crew reacts immediately. "Give me more depth!" The sub slowly starts descending to 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 86, 87, 88 meters. "Stop!", 89, 90, 91, 92 meters. "Why isn't it stopping?" I yell. "I don't know" the Chief Engineer replies, "We can't control it Captain!". Rapidly we decline, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 meters. It looks like we're about to sink, but by some strange miracle the sub starts to steady itself at 101 meters. The crew and I wait and listen to the bombs being dropped from above and echoing off the hull. The engines are stopped and the crew works around the clock to stop the flooding and fix the hull breach. Everything is starting to look good and we wait.\n\nHours slip by and the enemy fleet has not eased up on its relentless pursuit of our sub. We have in affect ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the entire Royal Navy. The Sonarman is continually reporting contacts and it appears that they are circling our location. We start up the engines on battery power and rig for silent running. We release decoys and make heading for the nearest friendly port in a desperate bid to escape the attacking fleet. It's no good. The enemy can track us anywhere we go. The ship is stable and the leaks have been fixed, but our batteries are running low. It would be suicide to surface with the enemy circling us like sharks at a feeding frenzy.\n\nThe batteries finally give out and the sub sinks to the depths below. There is no good ending to this heroic tale. Somewhere in the Mediterranean sea, beneath the murky waters, lies the brave men of U-Boat 260.\n\n10/10, would die again.","May 14, 2015","true","64.6"," 91 of 114 people (80%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","80","91","114","42","3"

On the other hand, they shouldn't be asking money for it either.\n\nThanks to insanely die-hard fans of the series, there are numerous mods available online to improve the game.

First hurdle is the old and no longer supported Ubi game launcher that will give you a message that the servers are not available. Save yourself some time by uninstalling the launcher, and download Uplay from Ubisoft. (which looks like a simplified version of the steam app)  Then you might get as far as the intro movie (without sound) which after the game just crashes out of existence. Apparently, a fix is going to the executable of the game and change properties in cmpatibillity to stop high dpi scaling (this is all described in the steam community pages) All in all I still have to play a single minute of this game, but the experiance of the last hour trying to get it to run justifies this review: 22 euros for a technical runaround on a game that seems terribly implemented for the way Steam delivers games.

The game does crash for me after an hour of gameplay before I found subsim.com and got the mods to fix the game and make it actually play and work. In theory it is an expansion of Silent Hunter 3, but this is Ubisoft here they have been failing the PC community for a decade now. This game I luckily only payed $4.99 for and in my opion this is the correct price for any and all future Ubisoft PC games since they. Seem to call a half finished port/game a fully functioning product without much optimization except to get it to running on there computers since Yves Guillant, probably had a say in this game for those who don't know. He is there CEO and made up a ridiculious theory how 93-95% of all PC gamers pirate there games and steal from him and his company and the game developers everywhere. He got the brilliant idea back in 2008 which is where uplay came from to as he puts it will fix the piracy problems of his games and should put an end to the 93-95% number he made up.

On Win8.1 at least, had to uninstall every 2008 edition of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable just to load past the menu, as it would just crash upon loading into the game. I don't know why it was that specifically, but thanks for the heads up, internet. Do your research before calling it a day.\n\nThe vanilla game itself feels considerably rushed. Fewer subs, poor AI, graphical glitches out the wazoo.\n\nSure, it looks nice, but the changes from previous games are, at least initially, disorienting if you're coming from an earlier game. It might seem petty, but remapping all the controls to fit in the finnicky 'walk around the sub' mechanic (which is admittedly a nice touch) screwed with my muscle memory for at least an hour. Managing to get my sub glitched inside a larger ship thanks to time compression didn't help either.\n\nIt does a couple of things right for casual players though. Having a toggleable map might take away some of the challenge, but it does wonders for situational awareness. Crew management is, for the most part, a non-entity, which for me personally is a... semi-welcome change from SH3, but again removes a lot of the challenge. Instead of rapidly throwing crew members from room to room to min-max their rapidly decreasing energy in SH3, we get running around the submarine talking to the senior officers. At least, I think that's the intention, but you never seem like you're forced to do it. Morale doesn't increase or decrease at a noticeable rate, except when you botch a conversation for the first time.\n\nAI crewmen can't be set to fire the deck gun or AA gun without you expressly selecting a target, which might seem fine for ships, but is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ when trying to pick out planes. And yes, I know sneaking away from the planes is the preferred solution, but if you're going to give us the option, Ubisoft, why make it so darn difficult?\n\nHonestly, some of my gripes would probably fade away over time, but I don't believe Silent Hunter 5 is a product worth investing into, especially not for the asking price.

Even played the orignal 2D game. However no matter how much I want to I can not recommend this game to anyone. I have modded this game front and back and it doesn't matter. This is arguably the most immersive silent hunter game however the immersion is contantly broken when the bugs come out and ruin just about everything. Want to try and enjoy the game? Well your going to have to download a MINIMUM of 10 mods just to get the game into a playable state. The only thing this game does right is the graphics can be pretty amazing. However you can get the same graphics with SH4 and have a polished and enjoyable experience.\n\nCasual players should definitely stay away as there is no more "auto-lock" the only way you can score hits now is if you learn how to do it manually (which is actually harder than SH3/SH4 as they removed the useful interfaces) or you just start spamming all your torpedos and hope one hits.\n\nThe community is amazing and they always have been however even the hardcore guys like Subsim are having a hard time justifying playing this game over SH4 and SH3 which are both without a doubt much better and polished games.

One that holds back what could've been a fun game. I went into this expecting something inferior to 3 and 4 which, realistically, you can't top. The problem with this game is that it tries to do two things and fails at both. 1.) It tries to be a Sub Sim and 2.) It tries to involve the player more in the setting. It fails at both.\n\nThe game takes a new approach to the series and allows you to wander the vessel as you please. This could've worked amazingly well to sucking you into the experience, but any and all effort to do that is squandered. It's painfully clear that Ubisoft Romainia had Das Boot playing on a loop through out the entire development process. It could've been done, but it never is. While you can interact with the crew, never once do you get anything out of it other than gameplay choices. Not once do you hear your young radio officer mention his wife back in Munich or some where and how he misses her. This could've been a pretty artfully crafted experience in that regard, offering a less than jingoistic view of war that doesn't hit you over the head with its simplicity. But, that's never done. Turning Silent Hunter 5 into an artistically crafted game could've been done and, sure the core audience would've been alienated and upset but I could see them coming around and enjoying the experience either way.\n\nNow, more damning still is the sub-sim aspect of the game: It's gone. Lazy is an understatement. Gone is the more realistic area based damage model that represented actual damage and, in its place, we have healthbars. Yes, health bars. Ships tend to take an obnoxious amount of damage before sinking. In addition, everything is dumbed down and automated. They took the sim out of the game all together. With that additional simplicity, surely that must mean more content given how much easier it would be to add boats. Right? Maybe even some wild stuff, like Seehunds? No, you got the Type VII. You get 3 flavors of Type VII. Now, don't get me wrong: the Type VII is the iconic boat of the U boat flotillas, but that's essentially one single play style. There's no tiny but nimble Type II that offers you a unique challenge with its strengths and weaknesses. There isn't a wonderfully obselete boat like the S-18 and S-42 that can given you the enjoyment of having to work around its short-comings. There isn't even the satisfaction of using the badass incarnate of a Balao or Type XXI. You have 3 variants of Type VII and that's it. On top of that, the game is lazily put together with men staying on conning towers as subs dive and even running on the decks of ships as if nothing happened while they're slipping past the 50m maker in depth after being sunk.\n\nSo, in short, it's a game that tries to dumb down Silent Hunter without adding in anything else.\n\nIn the end, of the 3 games on modern systems, Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic is the weakest. Sure, it looks great, but that's it. It's actually a lot like dating. Silent Hunter 5 is a model. Sure, they look great, but they aren't very fulfillling. They don't offer much other than looks. Silent Hunter 3 and 4 might not beat it there, but they'll stimulate you so much better. You'll find them to be infinitely better companions. It's not a necessarily bad games, but it suffers from not even half-realized ideas.\n\nIt will not endear itself to fans of the series all that much. Sure, some will pick it up on sale and mod it. That would make it decent, but the core game itself is just poorly executed. Fans of the series and subsims will leave due to the lack of depth when compared to the previous. Newcomers might pass on it due to the lack of excitement. Despite its forsaking of its roots, it still possesses that slow and calculating tension that Silent Hunter does so well. This will bore most others.\n\nIn the end, I can't recommend Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic. It's half-realized and lazy. Those looking for Sub simming goodness need to get 3 and 4.","April 15, 2014","false","4.1"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","1"

The most frustrating one for me is the time compression which will get stuck and slam you into port regardless if you have travel mode set or not.  The other major glitch is that the game does not record kills properly so you can't achieve mission objectives and you "fail" said objectives.  There is a major glitch after the second campaign (if you fail it) which prevents you from continuing onward unless you restart the game and reload.  There are just too many bugs.  The game itself is missing elements like complete crew promotion and command and control within the sub.  As captain you have to personally man the deck gun, flak gun, etc. despite issuing orders to your officers.

(but it could had been cool if they added more models of diffferent U-boats from Germany so you exspand the experience a bit, and Sh 4 had a few different models you could chose between)\n\noverall i would recommend this even through SH 4 is my favorite as SH 5 still needs some of the things that SH 4 had.","October 29, 2013","true","41.1"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","0"

Right out of the gate it wouldn't even load because UPlay reported that some Ubisoft service was down. I finally worked around that by downloading UPlay from Ubi's website and launching it that way. The tutorial in this game is horrible -- it shows you how to shoot at surface targets that don't move. It doesn't enable control panels that you're supposed to use during the tutorial. At no point does it teach you about diving your submarine, how to operate submerged (i.e. running out of oxygen, depleting your batteries, etc). The first mission brief after the tutorial asked me to choose one of two missions and neither one was available to select on the map. After restarting the campaign a few times they finally showed up so I selected one where I needed to sink some merchant vessels. While on that mission I surfaced my submarine but the game thought I was still submerged (even though I'm walking around on deck). Because the game thinks I'm submerged my deck crew won't come up topside and my CO2 is continuing to accumulate. After sinking a few ships I check my mission status and find that it has not recorded any of my kills as progress towards the mission goal.\n\nI spent more time restarting, saving/loading, and searching forum posts for workarounds than I spent actually playing the game.

The only problem I have run into is the targetting system for your torpedoes, they dont always go where you want them too. One drawback is running out of torpedoes, just because these old subs did not carry very many, so when you run out, you must head back to your base and refit because so far no other german ship will refit you in the open waters. So depending on where you are, it could be a very long trek to refit. But there is a feature that lets you speed up the game and does cut down on your travel time, but when you do this the enemies can pop up right in front of you and next thing you know you are getting blown up, been there done that lol. So whatever you do, do not turn up the speed of the game and walk away to have a cigarette or eat dinner, chances are you will not survive. Also, keep checking with your dive officer of the depth because I have dove and hit the bottom and was killed. The minimum specs on this game is a little higher than what is needed, my first shot playing was with a core2duo 1.8ghz, geforce 9500gt, win 7, 3 gigs of ddr2 ram. The game played just fine with that setup. I recently upgraded my processor to a core2duo 2.5ghz and went up to 4 gigs of ddr2 ram, the rest stayed the same, and it did not make any difference in game play, still played smoothly.

The game does include a time dilation feature, but the autopilot will have serious difficulty navigating at higher speeds, unless you're in deep open water. This game will appeal to hardcore simulator buffs, but if you're turned off by the idea of spending hours just finding something to shoot, this is not the game for you.\n\nAlso, this game requires a internet connection and the Ubisoft online launcher to play. When I buy a game through Steam, I already have a layer of internet DRM. I don't appreciate it when a title requires me to install a second internet DRM launcher to play it.\n\nAt the end of the day, while I enjoyed wrecking convoys, the time it took to find and intercept the convoys plus the extra Ubisoft DRM has prevented me from picking the game up again after my initial binge.","January 2, 2012","true","18.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My first silent hunter was number 3 and then bought 4 and the uboat expansion. uplay has only given me 1 problem but the auto saving in this game helps if you forget to save on your own. I do enjoy being able to walk around your submarine but i still wish it had shotcuts to the different positions for faster reactions.( I bet mods have put that in). In my opinion this game is easier and harder then the other silent hunters. easier in that in the hours i have played I have not experianced 1 dud torpedo and a lot of my kills are are only involving 1 torpedo, unlike the other games were it mostly takes 2 and 3 for the bigger ships. but it is more challenging in the part were there are many more destoryers in this game in my opinion and do a fairly good job at hunting you down. also a trillon planes off the coast of brittan that bomb the crap out of me. For me this game is great without any mods, and probably better with them. but like I said the only parts about the game I dont like is there is not any postion short cuts and your flack and deck gunner crews are almost pointless and you should do it your self 100% of the time.","June 29, 2014","true","33.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sadly, this game does NOT live up to the high standards set by its predecessors.\n\nThe main flaws include the following:\nUplay DRM to play the game.\nGame-breaking bugs and flaws that will sometimes prevent you from even progressing, or on occasion, will reset your progress to a much earlier point.\n-Examples of this include:\n-When opening the periscope view the game instantly crashes to desktop with no crash dump, report, or warning.\n-Some enemy units will disappear in full view of the player without explanation or warning.\n-Certain story objectives are not acomplishable due to the game not tallying kills properly.\n\nThe main reasons to enjoy your time in this game:\nAll gamebreaking bugs aside, the game looks beautiful, and is a good platform for mods (assuming you are allowed to, I wouldn't know as I have only played the stock game).\nThe mechanics from the old Silent Hunter games are somewhat present, but the game is much easier than it's predecessors.\n\nOverall:\nDon't buy this game, buy Silent Hunter IV or Silent Hunter III\n","December 5, 2014","false","64.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Why can't I just use my officer's intercom to ask him to use his special ability? Why was the game released in this condition? AND WHY DOES IT TAKE 3 TORPEDOS TO SINK A ♥♥♥♥ING CARGO SHIP? IT'S LIKE THE SMALLEST ONE TOO.","July 15, 2012","false","14.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

I have been the biggest fan of silent hunter since the original NES version with the black squarish boxes that passed for ships back in the 80's (and silent hunter 2 the secret missions).

I have to take my brand new $1200 4ghz 1TB SSD to a professional to rid it of this god damn FLICKING program. Do not download this MALWARE that masquerades as a game. I am seriously considering bring a lawsuit to ubisoft to cover the cost of completely scrubbing this from my computer.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Good, hold on to those memories, because this game has got none of that going on.\n\nIn a sad attempt to make things more "cinematic" they force you into a first person mode through the entire game.  Want to check your map?  Walk to the map room.  Want to check periscope?  Walk over to the periscope and push a bunch of buttons.  Want to make a lightning fast surface raid on an unescorted convoy? Tell helm to surface, manually lower periscope, climb up two ladders through the conning tower, open the hatch, climb out (to find two other guys already up there, somehow), climb back down the outside of the tower, walk over to the deck gun and manually fire it.  Uh oh, an enemy destroyer appeared?  Need to crash dive?  Walk back to the tower, climb up the outside... yeah, you get the picture.\n\nYou're not the captain.  You're a crewman.  In fact, you are every crewman.  You are running that entire submarine yourself in a room full of animatronic mannequins.  It's like being on the wrong end of some u-boat creepypasta, the eternally damned captain on a ship full of ghosts or something, doomed to repeat the same dull sequence of needless actions for eternity.\n\nThis series peaked at 3, nose dived at 4, and now at 5 has finally come to rest at the bottom.  The graphics have never been better and the gameplay has never been worse.  I could go into the details on the bugs, the incomplete features, the downright wrongness of so many of the games dates & stats, but I don't feel like writing another sixty paragraphs nor should I have to.  Even if it wasn't your typical Ubisoft pile of spaghetti code it would still be a thumbs down just for having such flaccid gameplay to begin with.","July 20, 2015","false","12.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Delete the Ubisoft Game Launcher crap that it installs on your computer because it's not going to work. You need to go to download UPlay instead and maybe even do a couple other things. As long as you're willing to potentially spend about 20-30 minutes on google trying to figure out how the hell to get it to work it's a pretty good game.\n\nSinking enemy ships with manual targeting on High Realism/Full Realism is very gratifying once you figure out how to do it. The new UI isn't that great and is a bit of a pain to get used to but being able to walk around your submarine and interact with things directly is pretty neat. If you're a stickler for historical accuracy there's a website called SubSim that carries a lot of mods that do things like improve the game's graphics and give the Germans historically accurate flags. Y'know since swastikas are apparently illegal in some places.\n\nAll in all pretty decent game.

Silent Hunter 5 is bursting with visual flavor, making it one of the more stunning Simulators out there. water and lighting effects are suberb, and the team took a real dedication to the detail inside your submarine. But after long hours of watching circles and triangles cruise around maps, only for about 15-20 minutes of actual Wolf hunting action; it does get a little dry at times. But if you're a simulator fan and love some eye candy, she's definitely worth the price.","March 30, 2014","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The latter seems to pose the greatest threat.  Silent Hunter 5 reeks of a game that has been rushed out the door in order to meet a deadline. The game is no more finished than an early beta release, but is being sold as a completed project. That's unfortunate because this game could have been a gem.\n\nMissing are some of the basic controls you would expect in a submarine simulator. For example, you have no way of checking your depth under keel. This remarkable oversight would have sent every sub in WWII to the bottom, literally. There is no way to adjust game controls such as mouse tracking speed. This is incredibly frustrating since the tracking speed while in first person is incredibly slow.\n\nThe AI is unpredictable and often just plain stupid. The safety of your home port is the most dangerous place in the game, as friendly ships will slam right into you with no attempt to avert the disaster. This is especially prevalant while time warping. You have to always save the game before time warping, otherwise you will find you ship destroyed due to the game's failure to pull you out of time warp when there is a danger (as it is supposed to do). Once my time warp was ended with the crew screaming about damage that had been sustained to the ship. That's not unusual. That happens all the time when the game fails stop time warping. However, what was most interesting was the fact that my boat was inexplicably on dry land, well inland.\n\nThe graphics are, at times, absolutely gorgeous. It's to the point where I think the developers spent way too much time working on the graphics and didn't have enough time left to work on the interface.\n\nFortunately, there is a modding community out there working on the countless bugs. If you choose to buy this game, you will need them. I'm just sad that this game, which is actually fun and interesting, was shoved out the door for the sake of a quick buck. I would only recommend this game to hardcore submarine or WWII enthusiasts who don't mind tweaking and modding the game to get it working halfway decently.","January 6, 2015","false","39.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll let you know how buggy it is (major bugs) for now I do not recommend the steam version,, unless ubisoft decides to patch this game again for steam in stock version.. it's funny I notice with the final patch with silent hunter 3 that it crashes from time to time and also if you press the buttons on the crew management to move the crew automatically it crashes it you press the cruise mode button a couple times,, when you get mods for it it seems they fix the problem at ease as compared to the developer... isn't that funny...

It's a fantastic game with the Grey Wolves mod.  So I was excited to give SH5 a go.  What a disappointment.  I can’t even provide a review of the game itself as I can’t play it due to issues with UPlay.  I have several other Ubisoft games and was able to run them on Uplay a couple years ago but a Uplay update changed all that.  I haven't been able to play a Ubisoft game that requires Uplay since.\n\nI have spent many hours trying to resolve these issues as well as seeking technical support from Ubisoft.  I was able to reach tech support thru chat but found the support completely ineffective.  Worst I have ever experienced.  Ubisoft will try to tell you it is an issue with your computer and it’s settings and send you off on time wasting wild goose chases.  I have many games installed with zero issues reaching various game servers and I have followed their suggestions (again many hours of work) so I no longer believe Ubisoft’s story.  The known issues with the UPlay servers has been going on for 5 years now!  Even a cursory browsing of the steam and Ubisoft forums will reveal the nightmare that may be instore for you if choose to send your money towards Ubisoft.  Just read their forums to verify for yourself.\n\nI have never given a negative review before but here is my first.  Consider carefully before sending your money to a company with values like Ubisoft.  They have amply demonstrated their disdain for their customers.  They have sub-standard tech support and game may very well not be playable by you.  Send a message to bad companies like Ubisoft by not supporting them with your money.  Support the many excellent companies that do value player satisfaction.  Do your own research if you are skeptical and buy if you agree but you owe it to yourself to not buy without informing yourself of the risk.\n\n","October 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It Can be a pain in the butt to implement.\n\nI run windows 8.1 on a pretty powerful gaming PC\n\nBought this game as part of a package deal with SH3 & SH4  Both of those work great right after downloading.  SH5 can be a dud. It REQUIRES an internet update program be running when you launch the game (at least once) That program has caused problems for countless people. (Really, I didn't count them!)\n\nI've watched the game in you-tube let's play videos and would really love to try it but so far all attempts at remediating the problems (even following long checklists on subsim.com) have given me no joy.\n\n\nI did FINALLY get the game to play. All I had to do was...\n\nReport problem to Ubisoft and plead for help there and in the subsim.com boards, then...\n\n1) Uninstall the Ubisoft Game Launcher from the Control Panel\n2) Go to Program (x86) folder and deleted the Ubisoft Folder containing the Game Launcher Folder\n3) Run Registry Cleaner & Reboot the system\n4) Down-load a new Game Launcher from here:\nhttp://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/675733-Ubisoft-Game-Launcher-Download-Forums\n5) Reinstall the Game launcher\n6) Go to the Game Launcher folder & Open the folder and go to the 1st Game Launcher .exe application icon and run as administrator (disabling the proxy option)\n7) Enter my validation code and got an ubisoft screen with Play Silent Hunter 5 prominently featured in the center .\n\n8) Go to the Steam/SteamApps/Common/SilentHunter5 folder and\nRightclick on SH5.exe then choose Compatibilty Tab then set the X on "Disable scaling on High DPI) worked like a dream. (just for good measure I also ticked the box about "run as admin")\n\nEasy Peasy! Now why didn't I do that right the first time?\n\nAs to the game-play itself. Life aboard a submarine was tough. This game simulates that. Many may find gameplay to be repetetive at points and at other otherpoints very uneventful. If you're like me you may get just as much enjoyment out of watching others play (hopefully with the boring bits cut out) as from playing it yourself.","December 22, 2014","true","423.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game gives you realistic control of a German U-Boat in the start of World War Two, in late 1939. Your goal is to complete missions by sinking Merchant ships coming from the Americas, and other countries. Ships can travel in large groups and are sometimes escorted by British Detroyers, who will hunt you down and try to kill you.\n\nMy personal experiences with the game are great. I do not know what other people are talking about with constant crashes. I have not had a crash to date, and also bugs, not a thing that happens to much. All games have bugs, this game has more than average bugs, but they are not severe. I have not installed any mods (mostly because I don't know where to find them), but I am guessing this is helping the fact that I havn't crashed yet. My computer is not to great. Is is not a laptop, but it is a decent step up. I run on Low/Medium graphics, but the game still doesn't look too bad. On a scale of 1/10, i give it a 9. It has bugs, it isn't perfect, and may be the only sim game that doesn't crash (for me at least).","November 21, 2014","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, If you can handle Ubisoft’s stupidity and enjoy simulator then by all means pick it up.","December 4, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You run it again from steam and it runs an install for the game and opens Uplay, which then doesnt have the game int it, you close uy play and click run in steam, it then opens u-play but not on the pager where installed games are, so after finding that tab you click play, and it runs another install in u-play, opens steam with the game code, and then opens uplay again....so you can cut and paste a code.  Followed by the game starting and downloading something from the publisher, and the thegame starts with a hortribly acted movie.  so you start a campaign and want to actually start and the steam code message is covering up the steam button, after figuring that out and starting the campaign the game trys to start acampaign and on a high end system with an ssd array, about a minute later you kill the game because it still hasn't setup the campaign ans actually let you play.\n\n\nTWO THUMBS WAY, WAY,  WAY DOWN.\n","April 9, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That aside, giving you a first person view, crew interaction, and pretty damned good graphics was pretty interesting and cool. It dosent make up for the negatives in my opinion though.

So WHY does steam sell this piece of crap when the game is unfinished? What the f**k!\n\nSlightly longer rant:\nWhat a piece of elephant dung. This is the last time I ever buy a game from UBI soft ever. They have done these sorts of stunts before and this was the last straw, go join Electronic Arts in the shame corner. I bought this game on steam because I really loved Silent Hunter 3 (and I’m quite good at it if I might brag). Well, the similarities between Silent Hunter 3 and 5 is they both are games about submarines. And that’s about it. Silent Hunter 5 is a bug infested frustrating random event generator of horror. The graphics are great, sure. When it’s not flickering out of existence, casting opposite shadows randomly when moving the camera around and that sort of stuff. The sound isn’t much better. You move about the ship and somehow they managed to miss the most common bug of ones character making an insane stepdance sound. The lord of the ♥♥♥♥ing riverdance occuring neatly on a sine curve every minute.\n\nAnd hey, it’s a submarine game. I know, let’s man the deckgun to shoot down THE HOVERING ♥♥♥♥ING MERCHANTS flying around in the air. Oh, I forgot. I can’t man the deckgun because IT’S BUGGED! What a ripoff. There is no way they missed bugs as these in these numbers. It was an intentional scam. But I must admit some hilarity ensued when my crew hanged around on top of my submarine keeping lookout while I was submerged. Nothing beats that Pirates of the Caribbean feeling. And then it keeps going with integral game mechanics that randomly stops working, stuff disappearing between saves, etc.\n\nTo sum it up the state of this game is somewhere in pre-alpha. And hey, UBI soft also installs some hefty DRM for you to make sure you enjoy this experience to the max. Sometimes crackers fixes the bugs for the lols when they crack copy protections. I wonder if they have done the same with this game? Maybe UBI-soft should ask them for help.\n\nI gave up and concluded that surely there must have been some hickup in the patching and went to the official forums to get the latest patch. Lo and behold, UBI soft came out on the forums and officially stated thay they ABANDONED THE GAME. They will never fix it. This game came out in 2010. Why is Steam selling this 2013?\n\nSilent Hunter 4 was also a disappointment but at least it wasn’t so buggy as to be classified as a scam.\n\nMy advice to you who wants to play a good submarine simulator. Go get Silent Hunter 3 instead. Install Grey Wolves pack and all the mods. Have realism on max. It’s really good. Enjoy.","April 20, 2013","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You  can mod it up but that may stir up more bugs. The most annoying to me is where the tonnage bar on the campaign map may not fill after you sink a ship. I haven't been able to figure out why this happens, I originally thought it had to do with mods but now I'm not so sure. I don't know how many other people have this problem. The ability to walk around and interact with the crew is nice though and the controls may not seem as intimidating to beginners as some of the others in the series.

DO NOT LAUNCH IMEADIATELY AFTER DOWNLOAD! go to https://uplay.ubi.com/#!/en-US/ and download uplay before launching the game. also make an a ccount with http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=2748 and download the High def realistic interface it seriously helps streamline the tools and makes access to everything easier.(might note that the tutorial isnt going to teach you any thing so skipping it will help) also because it causes a bug with the first mission. the only issue i have so far is the game randomly crashes when i am playing sometimes i get farthur than other times but i think it has sometyhing to do with either uplay or running on windows 8.1 but i can treally complain since i save regularly\n\nThe video just goes to show you what the game can truely look like:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp3FS98kAR8\n\nMods i used:\nhttp://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=1728\nhttp://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=2748\nhttp://www.subsim.com/radioroom//downloads.php?do=file&id=1607\nhttp://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showthread.php?t=166178\n","July 22, 2015","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very immersive and tons of fun to play.  Yes you have to play through Uplay.  If you play any games such as Farcry 3 or 4 you will already have it setup.  I downloaded some free mods from subsim and I played for about 6 hours straight and had a blast.  I haven't played this series since the original so I can't comment on those ones but I think this game is great.  This is not an arcade game.  You will spend hours hunting for targets, but the first time you are in trouble and sitting near the bottom listening to depth charges going off around you, you'll be hooked.","July 10, 2015","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
