BUT as bonus difficulty you have to meet todays standards for RTSs, because now you want to be an RTS also.\n\nDespite being in development for a very long time now, the game is very light contentwise. It's a bit of a backtrack to the first version of Godus, although you have to do less now.\nYou are there to level the ground, so that your people (which you can't control)\ncan build their houses on plots(which appear automatically)\nto generate belief (which now gets collected automatically, one of the few positive aspects).\nWhen you have enough belief, you build a fort (out of your houses that merge together automatically to a chunk with battlements) where you can recruit soldiers.\nThese soldiers are somewhat controllable, although their pathfinding is terrible and the mouse response is too, and you send them to conquer and destroy the enemy village.\nAlso the animations are clunky and ugly, the collision detection doesn't work that great resulting in corpses hovering above ground and blood splatters spread widely although the corpse is already gone.\n\nThat's it for the beginning, so at the moment the game is neither fish nor meat, as RTS it falls flat on its face because there are way better ones out there, and the god game aspect is mainly moving around dirt to make way for plots, not very interesting either.\n\nVERDICT:\nI gave the first Godus the benefit of the doubt, rating it positive, because it showed promise and I changed my rating to negative when the support ceased and the game died.\nThis time I will do it the other way round, so it gets a negative rating from the start (because it absolutely deserves this), BUT this version of Godus also shows promise, so if it gets way better and deeper than it is now, the rating might also change. As for now, NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\n(PS: And dear developers, get rid of that cheap mobil-ish feel of the game, as long as your plan isn't to use PC gamers as beta testers for mobile AGAIN, this won't do you any good.)","February 3","false","1.4"," 240 of 267 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","240","267","0","1"

An attempt to sweep the reviews under the carpet, it still has the godawful sculpting mechanism that forces you to click and click and click and click, except now instead of running on a unified engine, it switches between Unity and I -think- WebGL (I can't be sure, but it's a pain in the rear because it bounces back and forth like a hyperactive kid who missed a ritalin dose). Every time I want to switch resolution, it needs time to think, every time I start a map, it needs a moment.\n\nIt reminds me of Battlelog. That's not a good thing. The RTS mechanics? Oh they're simplistic, you generate units, you send them forward, the pathing AI is terrible, with units unable to react if hostiles enter their firing vicinity, units pathbugging the moment they try to fire upon buildings. It's bad, oh god it's bad. It's like 22Cans thought slapping a REALLY BAD version of Divinity Dragon Commanders' RTS (and that wasn't even a particularly shining RTS example to be fair) on top of their already creaky god sim was a capital idea.\n\nSo where does this leave the entire Godus experience, and what does this say about Mr. Molyneux?\nUnsurprisingly, GODUS was a splotchy mess. GODUS Wars is also a splotchy mess. Fable was a lovely splotchy mess. Most games that Molyneux has been involved in have been to some extent, a splotchy mess. There's a recurring pattern in among this. The successes have come about when the rest of the team have been able to refine the splotchy messes and turn them into something that resembles what is actually either going on in Molyneux's head, or a marketable game, or somewhere between the two. It's tricky to figure out where the magic is, when it hits, like Black and White, it opens up whole new ways of looking at games in general, but unfortunately, you wind up seeing a lot of splotchy messes between the rare flashes of inspiration.\n\nNot that it stops him. Now this would be perfectly human and forgivable were it not for the fact that Peter has a ... well, an almost Steve Jobs like "Reality Distortion Field" that he projects. It's as if there are two different worlds in existence at any one time when Peter talks about his games, and when he talks, we're getting a glimpse of the game -he- sees, and not the one -we- see. Case in point would be "Curiosity : What's inside the cube". Peter called it a profoundly lifechanging experience. Pete, mate, IT WAS A GAME WHERE YOU CLICKED CUBES. IT WAS COWCLICKER FOR APPLE DEVICES. THAT IS NOT A LIFECHANGING EXPERIENCE.\n\nThe sad part is, the person who won Curiosity still hasn't got a single penny from the fund that was supposedly reserved for him, he may never see such a penny.\n\nIs there any hope for 22Cans?\nOne day someone will tether Pete to the ground, and then we may once again see a return to form like the Bullfrog games of old, until then, we're going to see splotchy messes, infused with occasional strokes of genius, but often way, way oversold and far over marketed by Mr. Molyneux himself. Take anything that comes from him OR his dev team with liberal quantities of salt, and look up information about the game from other sources, then make your own decision if things like GODUS and GODUS Wars might appeal in the long run.\n\nRight now GODUS Wars is barely a game, it's two very distinct halves cut and shut together into one ugly, frankensteined whole, and that's created a horrible, malformed monster baby out of code, and out of game. I wish I could describe just how terrible it feels, but the best description I can come up with is that it's the worst elements of Divinity Dragon Commander (which had a lot going for it, but the RTS -was- the weakest link), Battlefield 3's battlelog system (which made people invent new swear words), GODUS (which was frankly appalling), and the horror that comes from letting Peter Molyneux off the leash with nobody to force him to stick to a singular vision.\n\nWould I recommend the package of GODUS or Godus Wars on it's own?\n\n...\n\n...\n\nThat would be asking me if I recommend Lutefisk. Only to the very worst of my enemies.\n\nThe most observant among you may notice that some of this review was taken from my initial GODUS review, that's because like GODUS, big chunks of it have been taken and dropped, liberally into the "new" game, and much like GODUS, lots of it holds true here. I see no reason to change parts of what I said then, as it's just as valid now. If Pete feels the need to recycle terrible mechanics like that horrific land shaping thing, then I shall recycle what I said about his work prior.\n\nVerdict : Fly, you fools!\n\nPandalicious: Any time a reviewer is forced to grapple with the culinary genocide that is Swedish cuisine, it is a clear indication that the manure has not just hit the fan but splattered itself across the wall in a fashion that any modern painter would be proud to take credit for under the name "An Ode to Brown".","February 3","false","0.8"," 210 of 230 people (91%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","91","210","230","35","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/422420/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is by far the dullest strategy game I've played in my entire life. And I've played a lot of them.\nWith an opening like that, it's questionable if you actually need to read any more, but let's take a look at what's up with Godus Wars\n\nFor some reason 22cans decided to work on two games at once, based on Godus. They scrapped the original store page for Godus and started anew with Godus Wars (you still get the original Godus if you buy Godus Wars). This is something that several developers have done in the last year or so with games that have received very negative reviews, and while I can't say for sure that they did this to hide the old negative reviews, I can't help but think it might at least have been in the back of their minds.\n\nGameplay\nGodus Wars advertises itself as a mix between a strategy game and a god game, and it does combine elements for traditional RTSs and games like Populous. This is not inherently a bad idea, though it's not a new one, Populous 3 did this to some degree (though it leaned heavier on the RTS part).\nThe god game part is simple enough, you click on a piece of land and drag to either raise or lower it. You click on things in the world, such as rocks & trees, to remove them. In order to do your godly deeds, you need followers who generate energy, the more followers you have, the more energy you generate, and the more godly deeds you can commit which in turn can help you make more room for your followers to build their houses. It's simple enough in theory, and quite similar to the basics of Populous. The issue here is that the controls are terrible. Raising and lowering land feels imprecise, and the land has a tendency to "snap back". Raising or lowering land by more than one level is a chore, in particular raising it. It's not fun, and unless this part of the game receives a complete overhaul it never will be. Something like say left click to lower the land around your cursor and right click to raise it would work a lot better. But simply put, there's not any joy in the god game part of this game, and generating the power needed can feel slow.\nWith the god game part being really bad, how does the RTS part fare? Worse. This is quite possibly the most simplistic RTS I've ever played. In order to build units you need to build forts, this is done by having a bunch of houses that your followers live in being merged together. The more houses that are merged, the larger the fort. Larger forts can support more units. Once your archers are built you can just send them out to fight, and if they win their fights they will get a bit more powerful. It would seem like unit preservation is important, but in reality combat mainly boils down to "who has the most archers?". If a unit of archers die, you can just build a new one at no other cost than time. Capture an important building that the enemy has and you win.\nMoving units across the field is a slow process, having them kill enemy units is a slow process, having them attack enemy buildings is a slow process, and capturing the main enemy building is a slow process. Everything is slow, slow and dull. The game lacks any real sense of strategy, it's just try to clear as much land as possible, spam archers, and if you're feeling brave, use some boring godly powers to make your units slightly stronger. The RTS portion of the game would, much like the god game portion, need a complete overhaul to be enjoyable.\n\nGraphics & sound\nEverything is highly stylized in Godus. If you like the style, well that's up to you, I personally find it a bit charming. Animation quality leaves a bit to desire, and there's not a lot of things going on at any given time, making things look a bit dull after a while, but at least everything feels consistent.\nThe sound is monotonous and boring. There's not much going on, nothing feels like it has any real impact and the few sound effects that exist are played over and over again. In their current state, turning off the sound actually had very little impact on my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of the game, and that's not good.\n\nFinal thoughts\nGodus Wars is an incredibly dull & boring game. Sometimes with early access games you can see potential, they might have a few warts & wrinkles, but with a bit more work they might turn into a gem. Godus Wars does not have potential. It would need to be re-worked from the ground up to be worth playing, and considering it seems to be quite far into development, I doubt that will happen. Everything is slow, and there's nothing to do, no real strategy is involved, playing this game just feels like a huge waste of time. And I would not consider playing this on my phone either, I have better strategy games on it as well. This is quite simply the dullest and most boring strategy game I've ever played.","February 7","false","0.5"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","94","99","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frij/recommended/422420/","frij","Frijoles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frij/","784 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou know, I actually didn't mind Godus. Sure, the clicking was annoying, but I did spend a fair amount of time in there building things up and exploring the lands. It wasn't terrible. But this? I don't even know what to make of it. There's only one reason I can think of as to why a company would release a game in this state, and that's money. They should simply call it, "Godus - We Need Money". Where to begin? I'm going to do my review backwards from what I usually do.\n\nThe UglyWhy, in all the holy lands of Godus, does this application launch a second full screen application when I try to battle? I can't even fathom how this works. Are they using some sort of battle engine in Godus that they didn't want to port over to Godus Wars? What happens if I uninstall Godus (I may try this)? I'm completely flabbergasted on this. I wanted to ask in the forum, or maybe it's in the FAQ, but...\n\nThe BadThe forums are currently locked. Any time a company locks the forum and allows no discussion, right away you know it's to avoid negative threads. And this game, AS IS, will only be negative threads. They knew this was a pile of ... going in to it, yet they pushed it out anyway. Was there no way to simply wait a few weeks until the engine could be fleshed out? They put up absolute garbage and praised it, despite it being several orders of magnitude worse than Godus.\n\nThe battles themselves, when they work, are fairly simple. This (I hope) changes later on, but I haven't gotten very far yet because the game keeps crashing. Perhaps it's releated to it trying to run another process and getting confused somewhere inbetween. The few times it has worked, I had to manually select the second window it opens.\n\nOne of the major complaints in Godus was all the clicking. The clicking is still in this game, but luckily it appears you don't HAVE to do it. It feels more like a bonus click now. The game generates points on its own, but you can still click the rocks and trees to get additional points. I put this in the bad section because I fear it's going to feel like I still have to click all those rocks if I want to stay ahead.\n\nGraphics-wise, the cards it shows me are blurry if I click on them. They don't appear to be very high resolution (I was running on 1920x1200). The rest of the engine in the battles looked fine since it was the Godus style, but the other windows that were tacked on for this just don't have a crisp look to them. I understand this is EA (very very early EA I hope), so maybe they can be bothered to drop a slighly higher resolution image in sometime during the EA period.\n\nThe starting God Powers, sculpting land, seems a bit pointless so far. I can't destroy the land under my enemies and destroy their village. I hope there's more later on (at this point I wouldn't put it past them to not have other powers), but I certainly don't feel very powerful here. Esentially the first few maps are:  Click this building, build a unit, send them to the enemy, go to next map. If your map is going to last 30 seconds, why bother? Make it a bigger map. Especially if you're going to screw around with my resolution and desktop switching from application to application.\n\nThe GoodLike Hearthstone, this game has a spinner at the start. Unlike Hearthstone, this one actually matters. It changes the battle from making items/cards cost more to giving you bonuses or debuffs. I like the random nature of this, and if it works right, it would add a lot of replayability.\n\n... boy, not much else to say that's good. I rarely do reviews. Godus Wars is clearly a cash grab disguised as.. I don't know what. If you still have Godus in your library, stick with that. It at least has a calming effect, unlike this that just causes anger.\n","February 3","false","2.0"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","89","94","0","0"

This very limited and flawed reboot of GODUS comes after a 12month period in which no major content updates were made to GODUS. The release of this game is the first meaningful communication from 22Cans in five months. As a potential customer you need to know they do not serve their community, they serve their wallets.","February 3","false","0.1"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","75","80","0","0"

Instead this is just more highly questionable behaviour used to distort and twist things in a long history of shady practises from this company.\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking this is a positive step or signs of life. It's just 22Cans attempt to cover their ♥♥♥ and avoid the fallout of being accountable for lying to customers and killing off a game by releasing something else and saying "Oh no, this is just a continuation of another aspect of the Godus experience!"\n\nIt's not the next step taking Godus further, it's not adding to Godus nor is it as 22Cans claim "A action packed extension to the Godus experience". It's something 22Cans have had a small sub-team throw together in Unity during the year or more of Godus development being dead and buried to try and bury Godus and the crap they pulled.","February 3","false","0.8"," 281 of 377 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","281","377","0","26"

(You can use those one-time cards to make everything even faster!)\n\nStrategy:\n1. Harvest Belief from environment while first house completes\n2. Build 1-star Capital as soon as possible (costs 500 belief)\n3. Start production of a platoon\n4. Select the not yet spawned platoon and place their flag at the enemy base\n5. Harvest more Belief while platoon is being constructed.\n6. When the platoon is ready, right-click the platoon's portrait to center the camera on them.\n7. Use the speed buff.\n8. If the enemy has not created a capital on your platoons arrival, capture their belief tower. VICTORY!\n\nelse if the enemy has a capital, use your Damage buff, then attack the capital. Switch to enemy troops if they manage to construct any and use your Leech buff to keep your troops healthy. After their capital goes down, capture their belief tower. VICTORY!\n\nIf the enemy has multiple troops you have been waaaay to slow and must now slowly construct an army, attack their towers while keeping your troops alive so they level up and then take down the enemy troops and capitals. Pray that you are able to direct your troops accordingly, as it can be hard to select enemy troops near and behind buildings.\n\nFEEDBACK:\n- The environments in each level doesn't change how the levels are played out.\n- The random rules doesn't appear to be random. (another person got the exact same rules for each map, the same goes with the reward card selection)\n- The rule that increases the cost of god-powers doesn't change the shown values accordingly.\n- When you get to the second continent you keep your cards and keys, but the new continent kinder got the same cost of keys throughout as the first continent. Actually.. The whole Key thing is rubbish in its current state.\n- Enemy troops hit-boxes should take priority over buildings when ordering an attack, but they do not.\n- The readability of what the troops are attacking is low.\n- The readability of your troops target could be improved. (There is a difference between when you target enemy troops and enemy buildings, but it could be clearer)\n\n\nWhy the Key mechanic is stupid:\n- To play a level you must not only consume keys to unlock it, but you are also required to have completed a level next to it.\n- The reward for completing a level is at least the same amount as is required to unlock it.\n\nThe only case where the function of consuming keys to unlock levels is meaningful, is when a player unlocks a level, but doesn't complete it. The only sensible reason for this behaviour is if the player has taken on a too difficult challenge and simply cannot beat the unlocked level.\n\nSay the player uses 8 out of his 12 keys to unlock a level that he can't beat.\nNow he can only choose new levels that costs 1-4 keys to unlock.\n\nThat is a huge problem. The mechanic only serves to future hurt an already frustrated player.\nFuture purposing of the keys can't be an argument, it will simply be a horrible excuse for a currently bad design.\n\nA better way to do it is by simply not consume the keys in the first place.\n\nSo instead of:\n5 keys - 3 keys + 4 keys = 6 keys\nit would be:\n5 keys + 1 key = 6 keys\n\nBam! Just like Super Mario 64 and most other games. Also.. why something so generic as keys? Why not keep to the theme of conquering? Like.. Castles? Cities? Might? Strength? Power? Houses of God?\n\nIf there is supposed to be another purpose to the keys, then I'm sure seperating the keys from the unlocking of levels is only for the better. Else.. I can't wait to be proven wrong.\n\n70 UNIQUE AND DEFORMABLE LEVELS\nThat bring all the same circumstances and doesn't change your approach whatsoever!\n\nThe only meaningful difference between levels can be found in your starting area as you will sometimes have to clean it up. Well there is more, like differently placed and different amounts of junk to get belief from and some heights that will depled your belief as you sculpt, but none of it is memorable.\n\nThe quality of the level-designs are worse than randomly generated maps in other RTS's (like Age of Empires). Or maybe I should say it's the same quality? As I feel sorry for whoever had to sit and create these junk-levels. There is simply nothing to design a level from.\n\nOther games have meaningful mechanics to base the levels around. A game like Heroes of Might and Magic got plenty of entities to fill the map with. Games like Warcraft got ressources to control and units for land, water and air. An obscure title such as Gruntz got important equipables, powers and triggers around the maps.\n\nGodus Wars has nothing, but the opposition. It got mechanics that should allow for an ever changing battlefield. It got a Swamp spell that can make one way seem less favourable than another, it got a sculptable environment. The sculpting is however not reliable and impactful enough to use strategically in any big way.\n\nThe current levels are all symmetrical Skirmish maps, the enemy AI is weak, but the current mechanics of the game doesn't allow for a more interesting AI, as it will only be able to create a boring tug-of-war against the player.\n\nMany other RTS's actually suffer the same problem, as it is not easy to make an intersting AI for such levels, infact, most RTS's singleplayer heavily relies on completely different scenarios. Populous: The Beginning's singleplayer maps tend to all be unfavourable to the player as he has to invade enemies already established bases while the enemy at times sends units out. The obscure game Gruntz main singleplayer mode is actually a Puzzle game using the exact mechanics as seen in the Skirmish maps, this creates a great environment to learn the player the full extend of the mechanics. And popular RTS's like Starcraft tend to give player a limited squad and various objectives throughout a map while the enemy units are spread out and only attack when provoked.\n\nGodus Wars store page says "Maps that change as you play with the unique deformable land - No two battles will be the same! " - and yet every battle can be put in a straight line.\n\nINClUDES FEATURELESS STUFF!\n4 playable Deities with a range of abilities\n\nA playable deity means you get 1 permanent card and 1 consumable card, that is it. So you pretty much get to choose your first permanent card between 4 choices. The consumable has no impact as you will get those more often than not after each victory and the one you get with the deity is not of a different quality than those you get from victories.\n\nThe first permanent card you get with your deity also has no real impact in the long run as you will quickly gather similar permanent cards throughout your campaign.\n\nSaying that each choice of Deity are with "a range of abilities" is simply misleading.\n\n2 Deity opponents - including Bryan Henderson!\nPoor Bryan\n\nVERDICT:\nThe current build is not made with the consumers in mind.\n\nP.S. The Premium Content debacle is insulting and the store page was misinforming: Only the first line of what is included in the build mentioned content locked away behind a premium purchase while all the other lines boasts about content which includes the content that is locked away! This is obviously not meant to help the consumers make an informed purchase. It is decieving and misleading.\n\n"The Early Access build includes:\nFirst continent included as standard - Second continent available unlock-able via premium addon.\nOver 70 unique and deformable levels\n4 playable Deities with a range of abilities\n2 base unit types - Archers & Catapults!\n20 cards with 10 power levels!\n2 Deity opponents - including Bryan Henderson!\nOriginal Godus included"","February 5","false","2.2"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","67","70","0","2"

You're lucky if you can get through a match without it crashing, but then crashing is basically a part of the design because when the game crashes it will open itself again throw some bunk at you about how "embarassing" this all this and then just GIVE YOU the rewards for playing the match. This makes tweaking things around quickly an actual strategy to just win a level without having to put forth any effort.\n\nEven more amusingly each level has a random modifier, one of which can be that sculpting is completely disabled. Removing the one real aspect of being a god left in the game and reducing you to the rank of glorified shaman buffing your soldiers as they run into battle.\n\nYes this is early access, but so was godus for ages without any real progress and what we have here is nothing new save for a shody grannery to hold belief and some soldiers and a new menu interface. Frustratingly there are keys required to open new sections of the map as well as cards that can be used up repeatedly continuing the bad aftertaste of this being some sort of Mobile+ game.\n\nPass on this or at the very least wait several months to see if any real progress is made.

In Godus Wars, you wait until you can build one of two types of unit, then click on the enemy, then repeat that until you move on to the next stage where you do the exact same thing. In Godus, the player waits until they can move small amounts of terrain around so buildings can be built, then they wait some more to do the same. There's apparently a victory condition, but there's a persistent bug that prevents players from moving on.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Godus Wars patch is a bug-riddled, slapdash mess that can barely keep one window functioning properly, let alone the two it currently requires.\n\nOutside of the previous lovely art direction and momentarily interesting terrain manipulation, there's nothing about Godus Wars worth recommending. If it hadn't been in development for three years, I'd write it off as a bad game, but given its history, I can't believe it's anything but a scam.","February 4","false","1.0"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

Sure, we all know he never said there would be two seperate games.  We could just go back and look at the Kickstarter if we really wanted to.  The reality is that the original Godus was pushed into Negative Review oblivion and instead of continuing to update that hunk of junk, or you know, actually finish it, they released this as a seperate game to get out from all those negative reviews.  The only problem is that they would have to give this new game to all the people who originally backed Godus and feel completely betrayed.  Further proof that Peter and team treat their fans like idiots.  Did they think we would forgive them or think this crap RTS makes up for anything?\n\nIf you must have this game for some silly reason, at least wait until it makes it out of Early Access and gets completed (Hah!)\n\nIt is not the game I was originally promised and it probably never will be.

Only for the firewall window to popup and for the screen to freeze, I then noticed that the game was running in a different window.

So I restarted the game, and somehow I had won something, but only for nothing to have changed in the game, so I attacked the same island. The game was still windowed and seemed to freeze, or it wasn't being made clear what I needed to do, so I just quit.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and this is what I get after how many years. At the end of the day there is little to show for after 3 or so years. And it is clear that this is designed for mobile, just look at the style, everything is large text and thick borders.

Saying that the game was always envisioned as two separate entities is a downright lie. As it currently stands, most of the bugs from the original (failed) Godus are present here, plus some extra.\n\nAs for the game play, it barely counts as an RTS either way. Unit control is spotty and AI is braindead.\n\nSave your money, don't buy this.

First this was a horrible attempt to side step all the negative reviews for the original Godus by renaming the game to Godus Wars.  Even ignoring the train wreck from the first attempts at a free2play mobile game, this new game is just as bad but with new bugs and tech problems.  The game launches two windows, a strategic mode window with the world map and another that runs for the battles.  This second window is almost never in focus or even on fully on screen.  Furthermore, you can't fullscreen the second new window and end up unable to read parts that windows task bar overlaps.  Unity selection is flaky and often times ends up making you deform the terrain instead.\n\nThere are new card and map mode changes to Godus Wars that make it feel even more like a free flash game.  Add to that when it was released they had paywalls for DLC content for a $20 unfinished game.  It really tells you what kind of company/developers they are at heart.

And now I am so suspicious of early-access games; Godus has decimated my desire to help indie companies in fear that it will be their "retirement" game. The game they never finish, just collect enough money so they can go pension somewhere. The game's tagline is completely misleading.

Many had presumed Godus was dead and buried, but to our surprise Godus Wars comes along.\n\nThe "combat" update...This was the start of the long-awaited "combat" update for Godus - which is now being framed as a stand-alone RTS game.  The original concept for battles existed in the 2013 alpha builds, but was pulled with the version 2 "it's not free-to-play focused, honest" revamp. Unfortunately, the F2P ethos still lives large (as does the mobile-focused gaming engine, Marmalade) and this is more real time sculpting than it is real time strategy.\n\nThe "strategy"...I've never seen a strategy game with such a linear path before...\nPick four cards (if you even have four)\nSculpt the ground for a bit\nBuild houses\nBuild a citadel, maybe two\nTrain armies (by clicking a button)\nTell the army where to go\nWatch the army get trapped because it uses the same broken pathing logic that Godus did\nFive minutes later, start a fight - and either win or lose.\nIf you win, stand around the opponent's silo for 30 seconds.\nI gave up after ten levels - which is handy as the first paywall would have kicked in soon after!\n\nBeware the DLC hype...As with Godus, 22cans are eager to promote what functionality "will" exist in the future, and eager to blur the lines as to what is included in the base price of £10.99 ($14.99) and what is paid-for DLC.  At the time of writing, only the first continent is available in the base package, the second continent by DLC ($4.99), and the remaining five to be determined at a later date - it's possible the final game will cost more than $40.\n\nIn summaryWhen you add in the primitive enemy AI, the continuing game crashes from Marmalade and the pointless mechanics such as keys (which appear to restrict your ability to deviate from the intended path) - it's a concept that suffers as a mobile RTS game, and fails as a PC one.\n\nDespite the "early access" label, three years on Godus Wars is no closer to an RTS game than Godus itself is to a "reimaginating of the god game".  It's going to need some serious work to achieve either of those goals.\n\nIf you are looking to spend £15/$20 on an RTS game - there are dozens of better alternatives out there, games like Rise of Nations and Age of Empires II have stood the test of time and I'm sure Steam can recommend plenty of modern classics too.","February 4","false","2.4"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

Peter Moleneux, the maker of games like Black & White, has come to this malformed piece of @!#". I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes without hating myself for wasting my money.\n\nFirst of all, if you're going to label this as a seperate game, WHY THE HELL put a choice between Godus and Godus Wars on the opening screen? IF I WANTED TO PLAY GODUS, I WILL HAVE CHOSEN IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY. Sorry for the use of all caps but that was a point I wanted to make clear, and absolutely clear.\n\nWhen I get in the game, I was asked to pick a God, so I did. Poof. Game died. Restart:  I'm greeted with a globe and images of a God in red and my God in blue. When I spin the globe for some reason, little sprites of blue followers fly out for some reason (like you do, I nearly fell off of our planet the other day) and I don't mean 3 dimensional little people, but crappy 2D sprites, flying off in a 3D view, that you can view from any angle, and, as you can imagine, if you look down the middle then fortunately these thingies go. So after I spend a good minute wondering wth that globe thing is for I realise the glowing red continent is what the game wants me to go on, so I click it and click "Next".\n\nSo I'm in. Or am I? It seems I'm in an overview of this continent, with my people, or whatever you can call them, at one side of the continent and the enemy at the other. Or, I assume they are. I mean with this game, who knows. I am then directed to send my people to some innocent people who are next to mine. So, I go to battle with them. WHAT'S THIS? I'M IN GODUS?? Oh yes, apparently they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to package the Godus code and stuff into a different application so they just went and fudged it and linked it to Godus. Because I don't have enough applications open. So, I play along, and I have a village and the other village, the enemy village, is on the other side, simple. So I have to summon my archers through the "Citadel" and the send them to the village. I do so, and my archers are sent to massacre the innocent people of this island. They do so, and a house topple over on to it's side. But, guess what. When it toppled over, the underside of the adobe has a transparent texture, for christ sake.\n\nTo finalise, do not buy.

I even updated it several times so it reflects the latest changes to the game. But in the end, my opinion never changed: Godus was an epic failure. For Godus Wars I don't intend on investing a similar amount of time, it's just not worth it.\n\n\nJust as the original game Godus Wars has some potential, but, in it's current state, is not worth the asking price. The sculpting mechanics are still not precise enough and the tacked on RTS elements are very basic. Even though they claim otherwise the whole game screams mobile port.\n\nOn it's own Godus Wars currently seems to be a nice 5-bucks time-waster. Neat graphics, simple gameplay and short missions are great for a quick session on your phone. As a PC game however, it still as a long way to go. There might be a good game here somewhere, but, given 22Cans history, I highly doubt that they will ever find it. This could have been the next "Populous: The Beginning" but at the moment it's just a shallow RTS with some sculpting mechanics clearly designed for mobile platforms. Avoid.\n\n\nAnd, for ♥♥♥♥s sake it has micro-transactions in it! AGAIN!\nAfter you finish the first island, just a few battles in, you have to pay 5 bucks to unlock the rest of the content. Great!\n\nUpdate - 2016-02-08Okay, micro-transactions are gone now.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/422420/discussions/0/405690850603772892/\nIn the mean time, its been brought to our attention that the extra content being a premium add on really isn’t a popular choice. Whilst we think that it does represent good value, especially considering that Godus Wars has been delivered as a free update to hundreds of thousands of users and the lower purchase price of the main game we understand previous Godus owners frustrations with this.\n\nTherefore, based on your feedback, the extra content will be available to all free-of-charge\nHowever guys:\nContent you promised would be in the game is not extra content. Technically this update is free, but given that the base game feels like 90% of its promised features are missing it is nothing you can charge us for.\n\nI know that not getting paid for your work sucks. But, from our point of view, not getting what we paid for sucks even more. And if you than add insult to injury by hiding the majority of your singleplayer-only content behind a pay wall you shouldn't be surprised that people get upset.\nThis would have maybe been okay if Godus Wars would come with a procedurally generate skirmish mode that adds replayability to it. But since the campaign is all we get you really can't expect us to pay for anything past the first few missions.","February 4","false","0.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

I’ll recommended it because I’m honestly having fun playing it, even though I’m fed up with Peter and his treacherous company. I still disagree with you guys basically abandoning Godus and splitting these two games up. So please merge them together and make us a real game. You messed up with your payment model which was clearly based off of your first game entirely, so pick up the pieces of what’s left of your game and put it together.

Not sure how Phillips, who’s now supposed to be acting as a CEO, let this new game and DLC slide.\n\nSo much for gaining our trust, you guys simply never learn, are greedy, and are terrible when it comes to business. They ended up removing the paywall, but the damage has been done and the game’s history will be forever recorded. Whoever made this call, just costed 22cans’ failure unfortunately. Another thing, for a game in early access, there is little to no updates along with the original Godus which continues to be an unfinished game. These games are abandoned. It shouldn’t take a game more than a month to patch an early access game which the entire staff is working on. I don’t trust them, you shouldn’t either. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE GAME!","April 24","false","1.8"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

I also suppose they will somehow combine both games into one to make it more holistic and the revolutionary game they initially wanted to create. At the moment this is only presented as a separate game to Godus. You are given a world map with continents and try to conquer each part of the continent one by one. There are cards you obtain and deities to choose from but they really make very little difference to the strategy and gameplay. One opponent is at one end of the map and you are at the other. Very easy to conquer and very long but overly linear to reach the goal. After you have finished one continent the same process is renewed with other continents. Not sure what happens after you have conquered all continents but, as stated, the game is too tedious to try to find out.\n\nOn a side note (since I'm a graphic designer and feel the need to comment on it) the "blood" aspect is way too present : The title screen, the animation... we get it, it's war. However, as it doesn't really fit in with the already existing graphic style (which is neither "gore" nor "dark humor"), this much blood makes it too deliberate and incompatible.","February 15","false","21.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

So basicly you can have up to 4 windows at one time and in win 10 dual monitor setup it isn't even full screen on any of them it just pop out in the middle and you have monitor borders dividing you game screen.

However, it seems like 22Cans is so concerned about creating something "new" that will make them significant residual income that they (or more likely Peter) refuses to accept that fact. Were they to scrap the cards, make the terrain sculpting easier and more powerful, allow buildings to be torn down to make room for larger abodes, and took away the player's direct control of units and instead gave them Godly powers to indirectly influence the civilians, you'd pretty much be there.\n\nAs it is, this seems to be a poor attempt to run away from the negative reviews of Godus by simply rereleasing it under another name, with an RTS game that is incredibly simple and also includes some terrain sculpting. It's just not fun.\n\nPeter, buddy, just keep repeating that above line to yourself. You can turn the game around, and people would buy it because they loved Populous.

Then I noticed Godus Wars had appeared in my library. So after looking around to see what the hell was going on, and learning how shady it all looked, I downloaded the game and tried it out. I never had much invested in godus or paid much attention to its development, so this is a review of Godus Wars on its own as a game that mysteriously appeared in my steam library.\n\nI launched it and after being presented with a group of 22cans employees' portraits under the heading "Your Team" (my team? can I fire them if I dislike this?), I was shown a selection titled "Choose Your God"... and a box down below explaining that I need to choose my god. The overbearing tutorial continued. I was told to unlock a land, so I did, then a second window popped up. I clicked on the other window out of curiosity, upon which the new window disappeared visually, but was still there and blocking input to my background windows. Since it seemed nothing was happening, I closed both windows, and then tried to restart the game, but steam said it was already running. This is a level of technical quality that even for an early access game that mysteriously appeared in my library for free, is enough to merit a negative review from me. So I came to the store page to leave a review, and while trying to find the box for the review, Godus War's Separate Battle Window™ popped back up, and it was a completely scripted tutorial. Upon completing following the directions, most of which involved waiting for my archers to burn everything down (couldn't I have just seized the farm and made use of it?), the window closed, and steam finally decided the game was no longer running. I started the game back up and it remembered that I won the battle, which may have been the first time the game worked properly, so that was nice. I was thrown back to the continent map. Overbearing tutorials are annoying, but in most cases they end. However, Molyneux has decided that's not quite annoying enough, and the tutorial continued, directing me to where the second battle was to take place. After a bit of poking around, this turned out to not only be the obvious next place to try, but the only place I could possibly have gone.\n\nThis game is a travesty, and it's a travesty all its own. The technical quality of the game is apalling, even for early access,  and especially from an industry veteran like Molyneux. The lies, broken promises, and general sleazyness of 22cans only provides more reason to avoid this game, but they're not required for a negative review.","February 6","false","0.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I don't think any game has ever received such a high percentage of bad reviews compared to good ones. Godus: Wars has even managed to beat Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. It is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600) of our time. Seriously this is so bad it may warrant a new "Do you recommend this game?" choice that is lower than "no". If you can think of the worst thing possible to ever exist and multiply it by 2, you would have this game. It's like when you go see a live performance that is so terribly bad you feel embarassed for even being there to behold it.\n\nThis game is a collection of gameplay elements that sound fun if done properly, but don't work well together or the way they were implemented. Some worked with Vanilla Godus, but some were still bad and were even worse when combined with combat.\n\nAll in all you have to be a real masochist to enjoy this game. It is frustratingly punishingly slow and annoying to the point of actual outright suffering. I can't think of anything at all in this game anybody in their right mind would consider fun.\n\nThere are so many annoyances in this game. I don't think there could be more annoyances if they were trying to pack as many in there as they could ON PURPOSE. I mean seriously, did none of this come up in the meetings? Did the developers even try to play this before they released it? It is so bad it is hard to say where I should even start.\n\nFirst of all I have never liked the terraforming. It has been implemented in a way that just does not work well with a mouse. You end up clicking and dragging the same spot 500 times just to make a tiny area of land. This might not be so bad if it weren't such an important part of the game and if it weren't combined with the need to get it done fast because now you have an enemy doing the same thing but he doesn't have to ♥♥♥♥ around with a mouse. The terraforming ♥♥♥♥ implemented as it is now does not work well at all for a combat-oriented game where everything is time sensitive. Leave it for the casual game, not the war game. If anything, let the NPCs do it.\n\nSecondly, the pathing is ♥♥♥♥. The troops tend to run back and forth not knowing where they need to go, or run around in circles while being shot at. You are pretty much forced to control the warbands independantly because the pathing is even worse when you try to combine them into an army. They should replace the combat units with headless chickens, it would be more realistic.\n\nOne of the most annoying things about this game is the lack of any way to navigate the map with any convenience. Your troops are slaughtered so you need to make another army fast but your base is on the other side of the map so you have to slowly scroll there while your armies are fighting and dying. I guess Godus is too cool for a minimap.\n\nHalf the time when you add a new warband to your army it just sits there and doesn't bother trying to get to the rest of the army. I wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥ either if I were them, it's not like they will do any good anyway.\n\nWhen attacked by enemy troops, your army will shoot buildings and just let the enemy kill them. I guess I would be suicidal too if I were a character in this terrible game.\n\nWhen the enemy is standing on the mission objective you cannot target them. Even when they are sitting out in the open with nothing near them it is STILL hard as ♥♥♥♥ to target them. It's like walking over to this building is more important than shooting something that is killing you.\n\nYou have to deactivate a god power before you can click on anything else. Very annoying, especially when you forget it is activated. One would expect it to be automatically deactivated when you try to do something else. God powers are pretty useless anyway. Might as well remove them completely. In fact remove the whole game and replace it with RTS elements that are already established that people expect to be in a RTS game becuase they work.\n\nYou can still squish houses to your base even after it is maxed. There is no feedback at all letting you know if it is even doing anything anymore. I liked it better when I could just use gold to upgrade a base. "Squishing" doesn't make anything more fun.\n\nEach zone of each island is exactly the same. It feels like there is no progression at all. How can this game take up 3 gigs when there are only like 4 art assets?\n\nReward cards are terrible. Really I just spent an hour so I could get 4 extra followers for the next stage? Maybe if they were PERMANENT it would be sort of worth it.\n\nIf you alt tab out of the game and get back into it, the window is now slightly underneath the windows task bar. Congratulations now you can't see half your UI.\n\nWTF 2 game windows? How does this enhance the game again?\n\nIt is a repetitive game of attrition. Make armies, go shoot houses until your armies have intentionally killed themselves, repeat (and hopefully you slowed down their army generation by at least 1%). How is this fun?\n\n\nPeter, if you are going to try to be innovative, why not do it with something we WANT to see like a sequal to Populous or Theme Park? So bite the bullet and pay for licensing, it would be cheaper than total failures like these. I couldn't even tell you how to save this one, it is such a big failure I don't think anything can be done.  The only way to make this game more fun that it is now is if it did everything itself and all you had to do was watch.\n\nThen again maybe I am wrong about all this. Maybe they were trying to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on purpose to win some 'worst game of the'.. EVER... awards. Well, "congrations, you winner !".","February 5","false","2.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","17","20","4","0"

Well. It's actually a pretty good game, it is! But while it’s seems to be a game where you kind of do the same kind of war over and over, it also gives you a sort of relaxation that I don’t find in many games, especially in games that has to do with war of any kind. Now, with that said, this relaxation also gets replaced with stress that comes from a feeling of having to hurry op. Now don’t think this game is a time management type of game, it’s not. No the stress comes from never knowing when the game is going to crash yet again. A crash is extremely likely in this game.\nI am a very patient person in general. I don’t mind a game crashes once in a while. But there is 2 factors here that make my blood boil:\n1: this game crashes a lot. I mean really often.\n2: there is no way to save the game in a battle.\n\nWith these 2 factors combined I get kind of angry. Because this means that when the game crashes, you will have to start a battle all over again. The game does sometimes notice a crash and try to compensate by giving you keys. Keys you get after each battle to open for a new area. I’m not sure if you’ll lose any temporary cards though - cards that you use in battle to get advantages.\n\nBecause of all this I am not going to recommend this game, unless this is going to be fixed.\nI have no clue if that will ever happen, because of the disaster around Godus – their first game.\n\nNow also please do notice that this game is in early access. This means that it is not a finished product. But yet again, I do need to see them fix the severe bugs and actually finish the game before I am convinced it’s going to change, and with the memory about Godus still very clear in my mind, they need to make an effort to convince me that I can go from NOT recommending to recommending this game.","May 12","false","15.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

Which they still have not finished. This game was made with Godus Kickstarter and Early Access money while the original still is a piece of ****.\n\nWhats even more incredible is that this thing is EVEN worse than Godus. In my brief time with it I've had it launch THREE seperate executables, none of which followed the audio and resolution settings I set upon starting the game. They launched in windowed mode with random resolutions while the original executable is running in Fullscreen WIndowed mode.\n\nNot that it would have mattered anyway. This game is a worse version of an already terrible game, the fact that they have huge techincal issues on top of it is just icing on an already badly polished turd.\n\nPeter Molyneux is one of the greatest scam artists in the video game industry, he tricked me into buying this god awful thing becuase I believed I would get something akin to the great games of Bullfrog, but it has become plainly obvious to anyone who pays attention that those games must have come from talent other than Peter himself.","February 8","false","0.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","3"
