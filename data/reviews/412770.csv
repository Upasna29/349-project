"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/412770/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","The Gist of the Story\nA young boy named Thomas moves into a new house, where he can make memorable memories that will last him a lifetime. Little did he know there’s a creature there that lurks in the darkness of the night. Thomas finds the tape recordings of a young girl named Alyssa. In the recordings, she and her sister describes the boogeyman, a monster that loves to visit at night for a chance to nibble on them. She notes that she has left her trusty flashlight, the monster’s weakness, under the bed. Grabbing it, Thomas stays up during the night to protect himself from this relentless attacker.\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nThe game consists of surviving during the nights similarly to the FNAF (Five Nights At Freddy’s) games. It’s not a carbon copy as it is a little different from FNAF. Thomas is armed with only a flashlight, a tool that will prevent the Boogeyman from entering his room. This is a magical torch will drive off the boogeyman with its beam of light. It’s an ancient technology capable of bringing down the most devilish monsters out there. If given to the wrong hands, the world will be driven to the brink of destruction. This means that Thomas is the one, the one boy that will protect humanity and save all of us from evil… or so I would like to think. He’s probably just a normal boy and it’s probably just a normal flashlight.\n\nAnyways, the first few nights are quiet. It picks up around the 4th  night and so forth. The Boogeyman has four ways of getting in Thomas’ room: The vent, the closet, the door and the window. On those occasions where the Boogeyman isn’t present, there’s a high possibility that he is hiding under the bed and this becomes a problem when you need to put new batteries for your torch because of course the extra batteries are there. Unfortunately, there’s a chance that the batteries will not be there. (For me, the batteries were almost never there. That’s me. Lucky Lucy)\n\nThe game is heavily dependent on sound cues and learning these cues will help you survive the night. They’re simple and distinct from one another. However, during nights where there’s a snowstorm, for example, it will be hard to discern which direction the boogeyman will come from because the storm will mostly drown out almost all the sounds in the room. This problem and the fact that there are other distracting noises, like the booming white noise from the television that will keep you from hearing the cues.\n\nThere are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard mode. The only difference that I found between the difficulties is the rate of battery drainage. Obviously, on hard mode, the battery will drain faster and on later nights like 5 and 6, grabbing the extra battery from under bed becomes paramount if you hope to survive the night. Just cross your fingers it’ll be there.\n\n---\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of the game, on the scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), I rate Boogeyman a 2 out of 10 (2 being, “Sorry, I meant to scare but failed.”)\n\nFirst of all, the model for the Boogeyman is a bit laughable. I don’t mean to be disrespectful but it could be more menacing. It tries to scare you. For instance, he whispers in your ears, “I’m hungry.” Of course I must respond with, “There are leftovers in the fridge, man! Let me sleep!” If I have my way, I suppose there wouldn’t be a game. I say this but I did get somewhat freaked out when he started walking towards me. He is a silent esshole (let’s see if Steam bleeps this one).\n\nThe game lacks a threatening monster but the well placed ambient sounds do make up for it. It’s not enough to create a scary atmosphere but it can bring about an uneasy tension that the monster fails to elicit. I especially enjoyed the times when it’s raining or snowing outside because the weather noises paired with the supernatural occurrences (e.g. boom box malfunctioning or music box randomly playing) happening in the room makes for a more interesting game.\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nThe game is built on the Unreal Engine 4 and considering the setting is in a little boy’s room, graphic wise, it’s fitting. It’s not extravagant. There are several graphical options so there is room for tweaking if the game isn’t running up to par with your machine. If it’s still running slow, the developer(s) seems to be very active in sending out updates and responses from the looks of the forums.\n\nPersonally, I didn’t encounter any bugs nor had any crashes but that’s me.\n\n---\n\nMy observations\nHonestly, the game becomes dull and repetitive by the 30 minute mark. Whether it’s on easy or hard mode, I barely felt the difference between the two modes. That’s me personally.\n\nAlyssa’s (spelling?) little story was more intriguing than the actually game itself. She and her sister play a valuable role since they discuss the boogeyman in more detail in their tape recordings. They do act as part of the tutorial but the sisters’ conversations are a highlight for me. Whoever voices them, does it very well.\n\nAlso, at times, you can see an apparition of a young girl and I wonder if that’s Alyssa or her sister haunting Thomas.\n\n---\n\nWrap Up\nFor 7.99, will I recommend this? I say, get it on a discount. If you enjoy games like Five Night’s At Freddy’s, maybe this is a game that you will enjoy since they are similar in structure.\n\nIt’s not the best game I’ve played, but it’s not the worst. It made me laugh and I know that’s not the developer’s intention to tickle their players but I need laughs in my life.\n\nI’m reading that Boogeyman scares the beejesus out of some players so maybe I’m just weird.\n\nThanks for reading :)\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n\n- Great dynamic sounds that plays an important role in gameplay\n- VR support\n\nCons:\n- The Boogeyman character model could be more menacing\n- Becomes dull and repetitive fairly quickly\n- There aren’t any noticeable differences between easy and hard mode\n\n---\n\nBy the way, if you have the time, watch me fool around in Boogeyman\n\nBoogeyman Video\n\nLastly, for more information about Boogeyman or other news and reviews of other horror games, check out  Scaredtoplay.com [www.scaredtoplay.com]","November 22, 2015","true","3.9"," 108 of 123 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","108","123","15","1"

But I'm well aware that there may be certain strong similarities between that particular game and this one.  I have, in any case, played the first three FNAF games, and can thereby make comparisons to those.\n\nI'm relieved to report that this is probably the best FNAF "homage" that I've played thus far.  Have I played them all?  Again...NO.  I play a lot of horror games, and not all of them have to resemble an ever-so-mildly "ground-breaking" title from as far back in the annals of human history as the year 2014.  But I have played a few Freddy "rip-offs", and this is probably the best.  Well, okay...the best which features a first-person perspective, like Freddy's.  Go To Bed: Survive The Night is probably on a par with this.  But it doesn't look like this.  But it is set in a bedroom, where you have to keep beasties at bay, sometimes using light and...\n\nOh Lord, do you see how difficult this is getting?  This is because I know what a bunch of tribal ferals the FNAF fans are.  Self-righteous little turds who think that because something got released while they were just growing their first pubic hairs, it's the most revolutionary thing to come down the turnpike since SLICED ♥♥♥♥ING BREAD.  Every generation does it, I'm sure.  I'm sure MY generation did it.  Hell, a fair proportion of MY generation thought that we invented rock 'n' roll (it was actually called "grunge", and contrary to some reports, WASN'T actually the first time in recorded human history that someone had plugged in a guitar and screamed over the top of it).  So anyway, can I get on with my review now?  Now that I've acknowledged that, yes, I'm aware of a series that this game takes some, ahem, "inspiration" from?!  A series which is barely over a year old as I type these words?!?  Good.  Thank you.\n\nBoogeyman is actually rather good.  Not revolutionary, but good.  Not the most original game in all of gaming history, but really, really solid.  And as an added bonus, and unlike some other super-recent FNAF "clones" (Emily Wants to Play?  Emily Wants to Suck My Big, Fat ♥♥♥♥, more likely!), it lays down its rules simply and clearly and just ups the stakes from there.  In other words, it's clever enough, without being TOO "clever" for its own boots.  Sure, it messes with you, but it's mostly quite fair and doesn't wallow TOO much in "cheap deaths" the way that many FNAF wannabes - and the FNAF games themselves, for that matter - do.  And I suspect it would be better still with one of them Oculus Rift thingies.\n\nDefinitely recommended, not ONLY to Freddy fans, but to horror fans in general.  No great shakes - maybe a few decent scares, at best - but a very solid premise with very solid gameplay and a few minor tricks up its sleeves.  Nice.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS All you "Freddy" fanatics DO know that there was a very famous horror "Freddy" long before the Fazbear?  Just a minor example of how you little tiddlywinks DIDN'T invent ANY ♥♥♥♥ing wheels.  Google it if you need to.)","December 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","69","31","45","19","2"

Following on the tails of the new popular genre of management horror, as made popular by Five Nights at Freddy's, Boogeyman is a fresh take on this genre and does not clone other popular management horror games- even if it comes with the Fazbear brand cassete tapes to start the nights off.  A lot of love and care has gone into the details of this game, making Thomas's room very detailed and putting a lot of time and effort into the animations of the various monsters and items in the room. Boogeyman also has very, very good sound engineering that makes audio the main focus of surviving the night. Not only in the survival portions of the night but the collection portions as well. The atmosphere is also very well built with the lore and consistant with its tense build up of threat instead of throwing jumpscares at you like most horror games found on Steam. It is an overall challenging and fun experiance!\n\nCONS ( but mostly recommendations to the developer ): Something that I noticed is that Boogeyman has heavy VR support and I did not play it with a VR set up, which would definately intensify the survival parts of the night- but the developer shouldn't forget to include the players who are not using VR and to make sure to have full control support ( i.e. mouse sensitivity settings ). There were a few glitches when I was playing that resulted in having to suicide under a vent or restarting the program- this being that when I opened the menu while in the survival portion of the night that no keys would let me close the menu therefore resulting me in having to close the program. The second glitch which I encountered was the shelf in the bathroom would become inaccessible since I could not fit between the bath tub and the toilet- meaning that when the flashlight was in that location that I would not longer be able to access the rest of the game unless I suicide or re-start the program. Lastly, when it comes to issues, I felt that the difficulty level majorly increased- I went from being able to complete to night barely looking at the screen to being completely unable to make it one hour into the night ( which may be my own fault ) but with the trailor, I cannot imagine getting far past where I currently stopped.\n\nBut despite this, I would recommend this game for the $7.99 that the developers are charging for it. You will definately get a few hours of fun and challenge, especially those that you are into games like FNAF.\n\n","May 2","true","1.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

I don't personally find this game very scary personally, But I still enjoy playing this one quite a bit. In this game, You're armed with only a flashlight, As the boogeyman tries to come at you from four different directions, However there's a few catches. The boogeyman is loud, And each place he tries to come from has a distinct sound, Making audio a key factor. When you hear him, You simply have to shine your flashlight on him and he goes away. It's apparent he doesn't enjoy the light very much, So when the sun comes up at 6:00 AM, He's done for the night. A very basic concept, And it's faily well exectured.\n\nEverything seems to have a good amount of detail to it,  The lighting seems perfect, There's various distractions such as weather changes, An owl, A plane going across the floor, A ball rolling off the shelf, Your nightlight will randomly go out, The hallway lights will also go out, And the television will occasionally turn on with quite a bit of white noise to it. I personally feel all of these little things add some extra tension that just wouldn't be there normally.\n\nIf you happen to run out of battery (You really shouldn't in most cases.) You can still save yourself as there's batteries under the bed with I believe a 50% chance of getting a battery, 25% chance of nothing, And 25% chance of the boogeyman trying to eat your head off. The batteries you do get vary in how long they last, Having red, green, And blue batteries. Blue being the best with a realtively low chance.\n\nThe one thing I'm neutral about is more preference than anything else, The boogeyman has a seemingly goofy appearance, And while it fits the game's art style pretty well, I don't personally find it to be that frightening.\n\nNow, We'll mention some things about the developer. He/She seems very passionate and appears to care greatly about the game, As a result of this he fixed complaints, Bugs, And adds suggestions in a relatively fast manner. This is always a great thing. He's been very active about responding to posts, Whether it's for technical help, Suggestions, Bugs or criticism he seems to be taking it well. It's always comforting to see developers actually work on their game in the indie field, As recently we've seen a lot of broken games or buggy games that just suck with no attention given to them. This is NOT one of those games. I have nothing but good things to say based on what I've seen in this department.\n\n-Pros\n• Great atmopshere\n• Good art direction\n• Plenty of things to distract you while playing, Making it sometimes easy to not notice the oogy boogeyman\n• Changing weather, With rain and wind.\n• Good gameplay for the type of game it is\n• An acceptable amount of game options, But note that it lacks sound options\n• Incredible developer who seems very passionate about the game, And has released a patch almost everyday since I've acquired the game (Not everyday, But close enough), Sometimes doing two patches a day.\n\n-Cons\n• A somewhat goofy creature trying to get you, Despite fitting the game's art very well, He doesn't seem too menancing.\n• There's no sound options at all (It's apparently harder then expected, And it does sound like He's looked into it, But I still have to list this as a con. It doesn't bother me personally, But it may bother you.)\n• For some, The price may be an issue.\n\nAt the current time, This is currently all I have to say so far. I plan to update this review if I experience other issues, Or have more things to add. Thanks for taking the time to read if you did, And hopefully this review helped you in some way.","November 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

Do not play if you have a heart condition, and I will absolutely only play with headphones because of how quiet the boogeyman becomes in later levels. Suprisingly, this game actually has a story too, through audio logs. 10/10 for sure, no glitches or anything at all wrong with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donttouchmyurl/recommended/412770/","donttouchmyurl","smaug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donttouchmyurl/","155 products in account","BOOGEYMAN\nThis game is probably one of the best horror games i've ever played. In fact, this may be the best horror game i've ever played.\n\nGameplay/why you should buy/tips\nWhy I think you should buy this game is because the game has the most eeriest atmosphere, knowing that you are stalked and he will not stop stalking you until you fend him off using your flashlight while he can enter through 4 entrances (Ventilation, Closet, Window, and Bedroom entrance), and I noticed in the game that when the boogeyman speaks, you can hear him say something about his brother, his brother is most likely the boogeyman that mysteriously gets under your bed somehow, but now that I know that this boogeyman has a brother, the brother must have crept under the players bed while you were away at daytime.. He can also appear under the bed after 2 nights, but i'm not sure if he can appear before those 2 nights. You would wonder why you should check under the bed, it's not because the boogeyman goes under you bed, but it is because there are batteries under your bed so you can further survive the night. Don't use the flashlight for long periods of time, you want to conserve your battery power in your flashlight, only use your flashlight to flash the boogeyman's eyes and make him go away. Also, there will be alot of things to distract you, such as an owl, a ball, and your lights going out. All of these distractions make noises, so be weary of what noises the boogeyman creates while trying to get to you.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575206467\n\nGame Design\nThe level of detail in the game is very well, your room seems to be a childs room with various toys and pictures. You can also see some references to people who have played the game (CoryxKenshin board game, Tiny Box Tim from Markiplier, etc.). Every night has a different weather, the first night it is silent with chirps and such, the second night it is gusty and stormy, etc.. The sounds are very well executed, and really makes you pay more attention towards the Boogeymans noises. Also, outside the window are houses and a tree, which gives you a sense of that you are in an urban neighborhood. The childs drawings are well done, for a child, and there is much to look at in the room when you are exploring the game and not playing it, such as the world map with animals and the board game's names. The lights are very well done, you have to stare at a position with the light so you can focus on the spot, but whenever you look away, you will have to refocus. The animations on the boogeyman are smooth, but at some times the hand of the boogeyman can just disappear out of thin air. It could also be that I am playing on low graphics because my computer cannot run it that well, even though its a nice computer. The boogeyman's model itself is disturbing and creepy, and resembles a body of a frail, desperate humanoid creature, and it's eyes glow white so you know when hes watching and he knows when your awake, he knows if you've been bad or goo-- nevermind.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575206606\nExperience\nMy experience with this game was phenomenal, unlike any other horror game I have played so far. But what really makes the game is the effects, sounds, and how you play the game.\n\nPerformance\nThe performance for this game is a little laggy for a run of the mill cheap gaming desktop. If you are not certain you have a very good computer you  should PLAY THE DEMO before buying this game. If you do happen to have bought the game before playing the demo, you should go to "HELP" above the shortcuts to the community and store and go to steam support and click on  "Gameplay/Technical issues" and on the side there should be a request for refund button on the middle right of the page. Don't abuse the refund system, like if you played it and enjoyed it and finished the game under a weeks time and won't play it again so you can get your money back and pay for another game. The money the developer recieves from your purchase helps him on updating the game and possibly make more games like this.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575200265\n\nThe Developer\nThe developer of this game has really outdid himself, he updates the game every week or so. The developer also put a demo on the store so you can check it out for yourself so you can see if you would like it. The developer looks to be determined to have this game be the best horror experience you could get for the price of a small toy.\n\nPros and Cons\nI will be stating a list of whats good and whats not good, it is really hard to find anything that is not good about this game, so good on you developer.\nPros\nGameplay\nSounds\nLevel of Detail\nPrice\nOculus Support\nCons\nHow well the game can run on an average computer (PLAY DEMO BEFORE BUYING!)\nRecommendation\nI think you should definitly buy this game if you are into the horror genre. I haven't had a good jumpscare like this in quite a while. The game is updated every once in a while with new features, and I have heard rumors of a multiplayer, which sounds very, very fun I could totally buy this for another of my friends to play with me if I had the money. This may be my first legitimate review because this game is very very fun and I hope you see how much fun this game is if you decide to buy it.

However, speaking for myself--and I do love the FNAF games--this game has the potential to be more frightening to me. Why? I'm not even slightly afraid of animatronics and as a child, I was horrified of the dark and being alone. Yes, it does get simple and predictable, but that is being worked on. The main change I would like to see is the closet attack: seeing the boogeyman come out is honestly way more goofy than scary. His long, sharp claws and appendages are horrifying, but his body is honestly kind of hilarious. I would make it so that the closet opens and you don't see the Boogeyman, you see a long shadow start creeping out--this would make even more sense with the flashlight mechanic.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game and want to see it grow to be the next great horror game. It's worth trying and testing, but probably not worth sinking your life into.","November 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

You can check it out in action below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTkQgZLdi6U\n\nIt features a lot of dynamic sounds in your environment that keep you on your toes and distract you from your main goal (keeping track of / deterring the boogeyman) while adding in random jumpscares.\n\nPros:\n+ Lighting and graphics are great.\n+ Really cool game mechanic of eye dilation. If you stare into bright lights, it gets harded to look towards the closet until your eyes readjust.\n+ The sound plays a huge part in this game and you feel like you're there. Even the weather can try and work against you. (And Alicia is adorable, also)\n+ Concept. Being a defenseless kid with so many things happening around you really strips you down to your core fear: Getting caught unaware.\n\nCons:\n- Some of the looping weather sounds can be noticably looping. Can pull the player out of the immersion.\n- Frame drops sometimes randomly happen, but then seem to self correct. Could be just my system or could be a small leak somewhere in the code.\n- Short Nights; For me this is a positive, lol, but I can see some people finding it as a negative in regards to tension etc.\n\nWill Update as I play further to see if there are any additional complaints/praises. :3","November 24, 2015","true","1.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","11","17","3","0"

At night he discovers that he is not alone.\n\nYou are on your bed with a flash light in your hand and your objective is to survive till the dawn lighting a creepy creature  that tries to kill you.\n\nThere are for places where the monster appears: the window, the door, the air vent and the closet and you must light it as soon as appears to scare it.\n\nYou control Thomas using the mouse. You can look around, push one button to turn off/on the flash light, push one button to zoom in/out and push one button to search under the bed some batteries to refill your flash light. You can also use an Oculus helmet if you are one of the lucky guys that have one.\n\nThe game is built on Unreal engine 4, but in my opinion graphics must be better, because you are always in the same place and the game don't need to do any expensive operations that downgrade the frame rate.\n\nLight effects are quite good, and sound creates a great creepy atmosphere and play a main role in the playability\n\nThe first night of the game made me feel really nervous but later, this feeling disapears because the game don't evolve and repeat the same mechanics night after night.\n\nThis game is more an expirience than a game, satisafcatory during the first hour, repetitive from there.\n\nI have the same sensation than I had some time ago, the first CDROM games didn't exploit all their potential, now the first  VR games neither do it.\n\nIt  has not achivements but it's trading cards.\n\nBuy it on sale if you want to scream a couple of times\n\nPD: Thanks to Shade00","November 25, 2015","true","3.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Don't let this make you believe this is unplayable, because if you're lucky you can find extra batteries under your bed, providing your friendly neighborhood Boogeyman hasn't set up base camp under there first.\n\nThe graphics are good with great use of HDR (High Dynamic Range) light rendering meaning your characters eyes have to adjust to the varying levels of darkness to see properly.  But good graphcis do not a good game make for horror games.  Immersion is in the sounds and this game nails it.  Did you just hear the Boogeyman open the vent?  He could have, but he might have just left it open to attack from it later in silence.\n\nEven if the developer considers this game unfinished (pre version 2.0) this is still very much worth your time and money.  Even if you blast through the first few nights, the later levels will leave you feeling with dread and anticipation.\n\nSo stop reading my review, buy the game and play it yourselve.  Don't like to play horror games but like to watch others crap themselves?  Watch me play through all 7 nights here ->  YouTube\n\nBuh-bye for now.","December 29, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since then, it has become so much more. And the game is much better for it.\n\nI love that before surviving the night you get to explore the house and look for different tools to help you. (You have to find your flashlight too, and since its the monsters' only weakness it's pretty much essential.) In these segments you get a feel for young protagonist Thomas's home life. His family seems disjointed and disconnected, as Thomas never wants to go to him for help.\n\nThe voice acting on the tapes, along with the story itself are grand. You learn the tale of two little girls in their fight against the boogeyman. Then towards the end of the game the story gets turned on its head and you learn that it might not be as simple as you originally thought.\n\nThe game isn't difficult, but it's worth experiencing. And five hours for one playthrough (stuck on the last level for a couple of them) is pretty good for the price. So far this qualifies as a horror GOTY for me because of its willingness to take a formula and inject new ideas into it.","February 8","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, unlike most FNAF clones, Boogeyman brings some new features to this beloved concept which highly enhances the experience. To be blunt, I think Boogeyman is scarier than Five Nights by a major degree.\n\nYou play as Thomas, an eight year old boy who’s recently moved to the suburbs with his family. October is coming to a close, and Halloween looms just around the corner. But the world’s scariest night isn’t the only thing approaching. After settling into his new room, Thomas finds an old tape hidden within an older radio set. The recording is that of a young girl, Aryanna, who once lived in the house with her older sister, Ellie. She warns the listener of a horrible monster described as “The Boogeyman.” It had haunted them for many nights, ripping the sanity from their lives. Thomas has unwillingly taken their position, and must struggle to survive until Halloween’s end.\n\nI’ll start with graphics, and for a game as simple as this, they aren’t half-bad. Shadows reach beyond brightly lit walls and cast thick, dark trails across the carpet. Light shines and reflects off of surfaces in a godly manner, and I believe the dev put some serious effort into these effects.\n\nGameplay, as you’d expect, borrows heavily from FNAF. You’ll be confined to the foot of your bed, looking about the room for the Boogeyman. There are no cameras to monitor, no doors to open and close, and no lights to flicker. Stripping these features away makes the game more intense. All your attention and effort is devoted to keeping the monster out, and there’s nothing to distract you from that.\n\nThe Boogeyman has four separate access routes into the room: Closet, door, window and air vent. Each time the Boogeyman attempts to enter through any of these points, a sound affect will trigger. This is where sound comes in, and let me tell you, sound is this game’s BIGGEST mechanic. Shinning your flashlight on the Boogeyman is your only manner of defense, and in doing so, he’ll flee. However, if you fail to stop him from opening an access point, he’ll be able to enter without making a sound. So it is crucial that you prevent this from happening, especially on later stages. There's even a weather system. Each night, there's the possibilty of a rainstorm or blizzard. These  make hearing more of a strain.\n\nYour flashlight is your key to survival, and, as expected, it runs on limited power. I tried using it sparingly, only when the Boogeyman is on screen, but to regain battery life, you’ll have to look under the bed for batteries. But there’s always a chance the he’ll be down there, which makes the risk all the more suspenseful.\n\nMy favorite part of this game is the animations. Similarly to FNAF, most of its clones lack any movement, and monsters are confined to still images. But not in this case. The Boogeyman is lanky and horribly fast, but lingers long enough for you to admire its sickening presence.\n\nApart from some cheap moments when there were undoubtable two Boogeymen attempting to enter the room at once, I really did love this game. However, it is a bit pricey. Unless you want to beat the game on a harder difficulty setting, there really is no point in playing this twice, but I’ll be damned if that first time through wasn’t scary enough. If you want a cool and superior take on FNAF’s mechanics, give Boogeyman a shot. It’s worth it.","December 8, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I could just use the secondary stick to rotate in som fashion I would be much happier about it.\n\nAlso whenever I use the action button on the controller or the left bumper the character for some reason rotates 45 degrees to the left while it is held in, and since you need to hold down the left bumper while opening doors it makes for a very weird experience\n\nAlso the very first time I was standing in Thomas' room for probably 5 minutes thinking the game had started, but turned out you had to walk into the closet and go through a door there to actually start the game. In some ways the game is good at giving instructions for how to play, but they also just leave you standing in the middle of the room without letting you know that the game hasn't started yet.\n\nAlso the excursions after a night is over is very strange since the boogeyman can just leap at you from anywhere without any hints, and a couple of times it was camping the flashlight after the first night so it was seemingly impossible to survive it sometimes. No idea if that is intentional or not.\n\nSo for a complete beginner that has never seen or heard of the game before it is extremely confusing to sit down and just starting to play it.","May 8","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Very simple, you are on your bed, flashnight and have to survive the night and keep the boogeyman at bay by flashing him. With the flashlight pervert ;). Only thing I did not care for was they did an update that adding a recording from two girls, it was super annoying. I thought the game was perfect as it was in the video which was before updates. Not sure what has been done to it since the last update that I played but hopefully not to much. Sounds are good, atmosphere is great.

However I feel this game does the concept better from a gameplay perspective as I feel it is more skill based then FNAF.  You really feel in control of what is after you if you know what you are doing.  However, you have enough lack of control to make you very uneasy.  This is especially true if the Boogeyman just pushes an entrance open so that he can make a quick and silent entrance (which is a really cool idea btw.)\n\nThe new update 2.0 has made this game no longer fully comparable to FNAF.  Barry (the games creator) has entered a territory of his own with making a hybrid where you explore the home before each night to find your flashlight.  These nights have been the most terrifying for me.  Although the "nights" are still scary but they could be more scary (more on that later).  A great job is done making you feel like something is ALWAYS watching you, just waiting for its chance to get you.\n\nThe only complaint I have is some animations need a bit more polish, as they are just okay (especially the closet and basement animation). However, no animation is by any means bad.  I also feel like there should be multiple animations per entrance so you dont see the same thing over and over.  Don't get me wrong, it is stil scary regardless... but different animations would throw you off guard more and offer more variety.  Other than that, this is a great horror game for being made by one person.  It is definitely worth your time and money if you like horror games.\n\nI can't wait to see more from Barry in the future.  He definitely knows how to make a good horror game and I can't wait to see what he does next and I hope it's also a horror game.  But first I think he should polish this one up a bit more.  Regardless, as it stands right now, it is still worth a purchase.","January 31","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has the atmosphere, the sounds, and of course the creature. While playing this, it gave me chills and made me feel really nervous. I do recommend this game to all the horror fans. I actually can't wait to see what else is in store for me when I continue the nights. I also really like how all you use is the mouse to turn on the light, it makes it easier to remember what I need to do exactly to survive. I also like the Five Nights at Freddy's games, so I knew I would like this game.\n\ngraphics are really nice, love the sounds, really make you scared when you hear them. The creature is really creepy looking, esepcially when you see it crawling on the floor.\n\nI'm glad that I came across this game and I did my first let's play for it, so if you want to see my reactions, you can see it here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfJoECmXqQY","November 6, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I utilize a laptop with no middle mouse button and still managed to make to Halloween night first try before getting killed or even searching under the bed for batteries[normal difficulty, have yet to play the Don't Blink version]\n\n-Alternative versions of the boogeyman, or even alternative monsters. May appear rather far fetched and contrary to the purpose of the game, however I feel it would only be more to the player's enjoyment to experience the game against various nightmares. This is more towards the modding community rather than the developer's regardless.\n\n-Alternative bedrooms with equally alternative event items such as a ceiling fan, books being knocked off a shelf, clothes or clothes hangers falling, little dancer in the box, etc. Not asking for the more noises to relay the boogeyman's position, simply possible alternatives to the ones already in place, in differing situations/bedrooms. Events to a themed environment essentially. Halloween candy being spilled onto the floor during halloween night, snow gradually piling on the window sill during a blizzard that would may or may not be shoved onto the floor as the boogeyman climbs in, etc.\n\nWhy the game should be supported:\nThere is so much potential for this game, which is one of the reasons I enjoy it heavily in contrast to other immobile jump scare horror games[I despise most "horror" games that center around jump scares rather than atmosphere, this is one of the few exceptions due to how well it is executed in unity with promising gameplay] as the circumstances make sense in relation to the context. A little boy paralyzed with fear is very likely to remain in the safety of his bed with a flashlight when faced against the terror of the boogeyman, knowing that should he attempt to escape he may simply be dragged under the bed, whereas the idea of an underpaid security guard actually having the utter stupidity to not abandon their job and night shift when faced with animatronics coming to life is simply absurd[*cough* FNAF *cough*]. A child on the other hand is underdeveloped and vulnerable, in that they are far more likely to find themselves in that situation of being too frightened to move with nothing to defend themselves aside from a dying flashlight, especially when they are essentially confined/cornered to what should be their sanctuary and environment of security: the child's bedroom.","April 4","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is amazing. Graphically not a strong game but it's definitely not required in this case.\n\nFrom the start of the game they tell you where the Boogeyman can come from so you know what to look for; the window, the closet, the door and the vent. These 4 entrances make specific sounds so if you hear one of them you know he's coming for you.\n\nTo survive you need to use your flashlight on the boogeyman. Beware not to use it too much because your battery power is limited. You can recharge your flashlight by looking under the bed for batteries. This is risky though; everytime you look under your bed there's a chance that the boogeyman is there. What I did is use it very sparingly and use the squint feature to look in the dark.\n\nAfter a little bit the game gets harder. The sounds the entrances make are randomized. The way the boogeyman enters are randomized. There is no way to tell what he's going to do, how and when.\n\nIf you want some quick jumpscares for little money then this is a game for you.\n\nCheck out my video below for my reaction to the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmZnHavX7U","November 5, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

More hitting my head against the back of my chair for me :D\n\nIf your into horror or want to get into the scaring experince try this. It doesn't take long to download.
