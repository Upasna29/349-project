Despite the unique effects that the turrets apply, the enemy dies too easily and gun turrets are so cheap by comparison to make the other turrets viable.\n\n-End Game can essentially be acheved before Wave 10 by placing max level Gun turrets at each\nenemy spawn point. I had between 5-6 at each of the three spawn points, and that was way overkill.\n\n-100 Waves is a bit extreme since you only fight the same 8 enemies each wave making the\ngame feel tedious after wave 10. Enemy numbers should increase per wave. Maybe implement an option to set wave count?\n\n-Advancing waves quickly will cause a glitch where enemies turn invisible; Turrets within range will fire until despawned enemy is deemed "Destroyed" by the game.\n\n-Looking at a max level turret glitches the upgrade button, preventing me from upgrading the selected turret until the dialog box is closed.\n\n-Game tapped out after wave 70 and wouldn't allow me to advance to next wave. Probaby due to advancing waves too quickly.\n\n-Pressing Exit in-game closes to desktop (I just wanted to return to main menu)\n\n-No difficulty ramp despite session being 100 waves. The game should get more challenging with each wave propting the player to place more turrets, upgrade turrets, use different turrets, and possibly even alter the layout and placement of turrets.\n\n-Camera sometimes jumps to abitrary location when selecting turrets.\n\n-Turrets can be knocked into one another while trying to place additional turrets (perhaps raise the turrets up a smidge to avoid unwanted collisions?)\n\n-Enemies sometimes spawn on top of one another and destroy themselves at spawn.\n\n\nI'm going to say No for now, but I want to continue watching the development. The use of Google Maps to create a game environment is impressive and I'd like to see where they go with it in the future. My first impression was disappointing, but I have high hopes for the future.","March 20","false","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Each of the three or four totally different versions are very different. As for whether this game is good that's your personal choice. This game provides one new thing that tower defenses have never done before and that's physics.\n\nAre the physics necessary? No. Do they always work out? Typically not. Is it actually inovative for its genre heck yes! Only one person coded this game, with help from his brother sometimes. So having generally working physics at this level is pretty impressive. However the issues shine through like oil in water, but isn't that what Early Access is made for?\n\nI recommend this game because we should always learn from the mistakes of others, but consider the good they bring to the table.","January 8","true","6.7"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","13","22","3","4"

Uses google maps to allow you to defend anywhere in the world, your own house, your friends house, the space needle, golden gate bridge, the possibilities are endless! never defend the same place twice!

In what universe is that not fun? Next stop is to visit the neighborhood I grew up in where we used to chase each other with air guns while playing Army.  Only this time it is for real (well, sort of)!  The game is well worth the $4.49 on sale price.\n\nI have never played a tower defense game before so I have nothing to compare the game play mechanics to.  The addition of physics is a big deal I guess?  But with nothing to compare it I don't know how it affects the game play.\n\nSee my forum entry for some improvements I would like to see but here is the good and the less so:\n\nPros\nGood graphics - yeah, I know it is satellite photos\nNo learning curve\nVery intuitive game play - NOT a game for master strategists\nFor all intents and purposes, an infinite number of maps\n\nCons (most of which might be Google maps limitations)\n"Use My Current Location" crashed the game every time so I used the next card and typed in my location and it worked\nNo real first person/street level gameplay\nMap jumps around sometimes and hard to find your base\nNo apparent damage to the weapon turrets\nUsing very old satellite photos\nSome locations do not work.  Tried to do the street address where I used to work and it works fine in Google maps but no idea where I was in the game\nEnemy units always spawn at the bottom of the map","March 13","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a bit more work to do, but it's coming along really well.  Frequently updated, new stuff just shows up, and I'm amazed at the developers' insight to what Tower Defense not only "should" be, but COULD be.  You get to defend your OWN HOUSE!  Or Disneyland, or whever the GPS points you to on earth.  Very cool idea here.  Looking forward to future updates!","January 13","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
