I own the physical copy, plus the expansion, that I bought from the actual developers at GenCon in 2014.  I even tossed in to KickStarter this digital bad boy, at the Paper and PIxel's level, which has been pretty rad so far.\n\nBut this is a NOT so great mobile port for this game.\n\nThis is a great game, with brilliant bit art, and fantastic gameplay...\n\n... that is rendered almost unplayable, at times, by the unintuitive UI.\n\nNow, I love mobile games.  I play them all the time. So, using this knowledge, I tried to apply and translate "swiping" and "touching" for pointing, clicking, and scrolling.\n\nThis is easy to do.  Until it is not.\n\nMuch of this game is slowed down by having to click at the top left of the monitor after viewing cards.  Why is this not easier?  Why can I not, say, left click on a card, then right click on it to make it smaller?\n\nWhy are things so slow?  Why do we have animations slowing things down?  Why is the user interface getting in the way?\n\nI think MUCH can be learned from the UI of, say... Magic: The Gathering 2012 though... present.  Or many of the other digital card games available now.\n\nWhat is annoying is that it is too too easy to miss opportunities to use abilities because... I didn't know what the interface wanted me to do.\n\nIt's frustrating to lose games because I had the opportunity to select abilities... but because I didn't know when, or how to draw cards... or where to pull them from, or how to put them down... or when to put them down... or how the game wanted me to put them down... I'll lose a match.\n\nWhich is not cool!  Not because I lost.  I lose all the time at stuff.  I've grown quite comfortable with losing.  I'm fine with losing, But I want it to be because I suck at the game.  Not because I'm tripping all over the flippin' UI.\n\nHonestly, I didn't get to play more than 3 games because on the third... the game just... stopped.\n\nI had no idea what it wanted from me.  It was build phase.  I selected a room.  I picked over which room I wanted it to replace.  It was a trap room.  I had an advanced trap room.  Everything looked great.  The game was like, “Sweet dude.  I got this.  You’re good.  Look how I’m ready for you to hit done.”\n\nBut there was no “Done”.  No way to advance the turn.\n\nWas I doing it wrong?  I Don't Know!  The game gave me NOTHING.  I tried to put it over another room that was technically invalid, and it discarded the card.   ...which includes a tiny animation and wait... and this happens like... FIVE times as I'm trying to troubleshoot what is going on.  EACH attempt resulting in one of those painful discard animations... which feels like EONS!!!!!\n\nIt wasn't actual eons, obviously.  But it felt like it by that point.\n\nThis KILLS ME to do but… I can’t recommend this mobile app port right now because… it makes me sad.  And I know it will make other’s sad.  And that’s what reviews are all about.  Opinions.\n\nHey… support these guys, sure.  They made a great game.\n\nIt’s just being murdered by the UI.\n\nFix the UI.  Make this a Steam friendly game.  Do that… and I’ll fix my recommendation.\n\nKeep up the good work guys.  Feels like this should be an easy fix.\n\n[YouTube]\n\nI made a quick lil' YouTube just to illustrate my gripes.  Like I said, it's nothing insanely major, but it dampens the enjoyment a bit unnecessarily.  If you're wanting to buy, but concerned on how clunky the game is, I hope this video will help.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/g9X_7zpPVgw\n\nAnd here's the same hangup I described earlier in the review that we ran into during a cross-platform multiplayer match.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/recommended/362350/","oen386","Oen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oen386/","1125 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGood game, but a bad port. If you want a number score, I would say 3/5.\n\nFirst, I've played Boss Monster a few times before this electronic version showed up on Kickstarter. I do not own the mobile version.\n\nLet me start by saying I own a Surface Pro 3, a Windows 8.1 tablet. I thought having a digital copy of this would make it fun to play on the go. The problem is the port has some critical bugs they need to fix. Story time...\n\nThe major game bug I had is with touch devices, after a while the game loses focus. When you're tapping the screen you're actually clicking behind the game window. When you finally Alt+Tab to the desktop you'll see all these programs open because you've been clicking your shortcuts and items on your desktop. This bug is terrible, and would happen every 3-5 minutes without fail, when not using a mouse. I would have to hit the Windows button a few times to bring up the start menu, then click the program in the task bar, or I would have to hook up a keyboard and forgo the ease of using the Surface as a tablet to recover the game.\n\nThis bug seemed to happen in fullscreen, so then I thought "I'll just play in Window mode". Surprise! Here is the first clue this is a cheap port of the mobile version. You get 4 options in the Settings menu. Music volume, sound effect volume, game speed, and fullscreen on/off. "Okay, no real graphic settings, but at least I can make it Windowed" I thought. This brings me to the next major bug. If you have a high resolution screen, like on a Surface Pro 3, the game window is tiny, card text is unreadable. Then you discover you can't resize the window, or make the window take up the full screen. You have two options, tiny unreadable window, or fullscreen. :(\n\nFine fine... I loaded the game up on my main desktop PC and figured with it's lower resolution screen at least it would be readable in Window mode, and it was! I then figured, "Alright let me play a few games!" That is where I ran into the next issue, again because it is a poor port. This game has minimal Steam features, which tends to be the trend with mobile ports. This means there is no Cloud Saves. To unlock extra Heroes, which is DLC I own, I have to win 40 games... that means I have to win 40 games on each device I own because the save game isn't transferred between my devices or carried over after I reformat. :(\n\nLastly, some game design choices are weird. When using a touch devices you have to double tap everything to activate, when using a mouse it is a single click. Also the Halt button seems like a waste. There is no reason for the Halt button. The game should show you the 3 buttons, Pass All, Go (Pass Once), and Play Card. If you choose Play Card, then it should pause/halt. There is no reason to have to open a menu 95% of the time just to get to "Pass All". It seems very unnecessary, except as an attempt to save visual space on a mobile device.\n\nNow. Why the thumbs up? It's a fun game, and I hope they fix these issues, it was just released and I trust they'll look into it. Though even things like the "In-App Store" just scream it's a very weak mobile port. I figure once they iron out these bugs with touch devices, and maybe add some graphic settings (at least resolution options or scaling) the game will be perfect for a quick purchase and play on a trip.\n\nPros:\n* The pixel graphics are nice.\n* The music is nice.\n* Faithful to the card game.\n\nCons:\n* No Steam support (other than trading cards), which means you're save isn't transferred between devices.\n* No graphics options\n* Poor touch screen/device support\n\nTo make this game 5/5, it would have been awesome to have Steam Workshop support, allow people to make custom cards, or at least add new images to existing cards. I feel Steam features, and mods/customizing is locked out to keep the PC/mobile ports the same, and to sell DLC unfortunately. One can dream though...","May 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

I feel you, my friend. If you are looking for some place to fight some heroes, luring them into your deadly traps or cast some mighty (and again, deadly) spells, Boss Monster might be the right choice. But be aware, the other Monsters aren’t your allies so don’t expect them to help you.\n\nSimply put: Boss Monster is the adaptation of the indie-card game of the same name where different bosses try to be the most evil villain trough hero slaying so If you expected a game like Dungeon Master, you should stop reading right now.\n\nLet’s get started quickly. At first, choose between single - or multiplayer. You can play worldwide, invite friends, play hot seat or simply fight against the AI. Picking your boss monster comes next. We have Mummy Cleopatra, Xyzax the Lich, Seducia the Siren and many more, each with a unique Special Ability that can be activated only once every game. So what is the Main Goal of every match? To win, you have to be the first boss that collected 10 Hero Souls and to do so you have to slay, of course, heroes. But be aware, heroes making it through your sidescrolling dungeon will hit you with 1 wound, epic heroes even 2 wounds. To make sure that you don’t take the maximum of 5 wounds and die, playing your cards wisely is inevitable. Build rooms, use synergies, activate abilities and cast spells if necessary. Heroes need to be attracted, that’s why every room has at least one Treasure Icon. If you see that there is a mage in town and you want to lure him, build more rooms with a spellcasting icon. Same goes for fighters, clerics and thieves. The game comes with a tutorial, right before the first match or always available in the settings, making me stop the basic overview now.\n\nBoss Monster delivers old-school 8-Bit Graphics and a NES-like Soundtrack that tends to get annoying after a while. The virtual cards look great and have funny descriptions, the same goes for heroes and our beloved villains. But some issues affected my gameplay and are already discussed in the forum. Just to mention some: The game has been released for iPad as well and thus suffers from a bad resolution in terms of Text-Boxes and general User Interface. The overall gameplay seems to be slow since you can interfere with every move heroes or opposing bosses perform. To do so you always have to check different buttons instead of just playing cards like spells that can be instantly performed, meaning Clicks, Clicks, Clicks…\nPlaying with more than 1 opponent means you have to click on the other icons to check the rooms they built, since there are only 2 bosses displayed at once. Playing solo is fun indeed but the lack of story condemns Boss Monster to be a game best enjoyed in Multi-Player. Thus I tried to enter a worldwide match, waiting for 45 mins until I cancelled the queue. Let’s sum it up.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\n\nPro:\nGreat idea since Boss Monster is the adaptation of an indie-tabletop game\nRetro Graphics and Sound fit into the setting\nVarious Bosses, Rooms, Spells and Heroes to choose from or interact with\nSingle and Multi-Player available, Hot Seat is fun and works with “Turn your head, mate”\nShort but satisfying Games - expect 15-25 Mins for KI-Matches\nCard-Gallery sums up every available card so far\nCon:\nInterface needs an adjustment for PC\nSolo-Game lacks a bit of replayability since there is no story-content\nWorldwide Multiplayer is dead (Okay, Early Access and Launch 8th May 2015)\nKI could be harder\n6,99 seems to be too much for a game that looks like a mobile port (Appstore, Buttons are well placed for big thumbs)\n\nSummary:\nMy inner demons are still fighting while writing this so I should make it clear. I recommend this game, yes. For its idea, its “easy to learn, hard to master” gameplay and the overall retro-look, sound and artwork.\nThis game is still in Early Access and needs not only lots of improvements regarding UI and getting rid of all these unnecessary clicks it took over from the mobile port but also more content for solo-players. Devs are working on Bugs, crashes people were talking about didn’t occur for me while playing about 10 games, so progress is happening. Gather your friends and invite them to online matches and increase the worldwide player-base or take your girl/boyfriend and hate each other in a Hot Seat match.\n\nIf you are not sure about it, don’t buy it now, wait for a sale instead. 6,99 Seems to be more of a future investment than a price that reflects its current state.\n\n6/10\n\nI will update this review to make sure that further progress is happening and the thumb stays up.","May 28, 2015","true","5.8"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","6"

I haven't encountered any noticeable bugs since I played it, so that's that.\n\nI've always wanted to try the actual card/board game, but never got any chance. Now I've tried the electronic version, it's pretty okay. You set up line of rooms with attack power, treasures, and special effects. At each turns adventurers will come, and different adventurers will be attracted to different treasures, and they'll activate the room's effects one by one.\n\nThe only significant downside from this electronic version right now is the very obstinate UI and lack of proper tutorial/rulebook/tooltips/whatever that actually teach you the mechanics of the game. There's tutorial, but it's very limited. I learned the game from trial and error myself, but that's totally not how you're supposed to sell a game, don't you think?\n\nStill fun game, and pretty cheap, so you could buy this in a discount to check if you'd like to buy the actual game for your group.","April 28","true","4.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Boss Monster was actually released a couple of years ago as a popular card game, and I was excited to see it available on Steam.  You play as the final boss of a dungeon, and the goal is to build a dungeon, lure heroes to it, then kill the heroes!\n\nThe graphics remain true to the 8 bit design of the original cards - I'm happy to see they kept the retro look.  The cards have a lot of references to geek culture (ie I played a counterspell card that featured Harry Potter fighting Voldemort).\n\nBefore starting, I had the option of playing the tutorial, which I highly recommend.  Having a tutorial with pictures really helped me to grasp the concepts of the game (rather than a typical word-only instruction manual).\n\nThe layout of the game screen is organized and straight forward.  I could see how many room cards & spell cards my opponent and myself have, how many souls and wounds we accrued, and what type of hero we could lure into our dungeon.\n\nMy favorite feature in the game was the ability to "pass all", where the game ran on autopilot, allowing me to just watch heroes run through my opponents' dungeon.  I got a bit carried away watching my opponent take hit points that I forgot to build my dungeon though.  So don't do that! :P\n\nAll in all, a very fun game.  Stays true to the original card game.

Worth buying if you're a fan of the game or have been interested in it.\n\n---\n\n(Note that this is from the perspective of someone who owns and enjoys the physical game. The review is a combination of the actual game and its port.)\n\nFor the card game itself...\n\nDo you like casual card games? Do you like sprite art? Do you often get nostalgic over the 8-bit and 16-bit platformer days? You'll probably like Boss Monster. It's a fairly simple game where you play as - well, a boss monster in a video game. Your goal is to build a dungeon that can both attract and kill any heroes dumb enough to step foot in it while competing against other boss monsters attempting to do the same.\n\nBesides building your dungeon, you also have access to spells that can change the outcome of the game dramatically if used properly by buffing heroes in another boss' dungeon, disabling their rooms so they can't affect the hero and so on. Every room has an affect of its own that can sometimes interact with other rooms within your dungeon, offering a decent amount of strategic options for placement without really racking the brain too much.\n\nOverall, it's an extremely fun casual game to play with friends and relax with. It makes a great 'opening' or 'closing' game to a board/card game night and it's highly recommended from me.\n\nAs for the port...\n\nIt's adequate. It has a large amount of visual polish and the tutorial is sufficient in teaching a new player how to play. The UI is a bit unintuitive, however, as it does very little to offer feedback to the player. The tutorial does nothing to explain the UI either and makes it a bit worse and leaves the player to sort of poke around until they figure it out for themselves... which may involve a destroyed room or discarded card on accident. The UI was pretty clearly made with touch screens in mind first and PC players a distant second. The little summaries of all of the bosses are quite nice and help keep track of the game state very well.\n\nThat all said, though, it isn't exactly a puzzle. Most of the functionality is fairly obvious. Want to use a card's effect? Click it. It does lack solid visual feedback for selecting cards - especially at the beginning of a game where you need to discard two cards from your hand. In the case of a dungeon with a lot of traps, activating the effect of one trap room immediately sends you back to the card selection screen without any positive indicator that you've actually activated it until you click OK. More feedback as to what the player's selections and actions are would be nice.\n\nAnother thing is the Halt button. It's unnecessary and misleading. Clicking it actually doesn't immediately halt the game - it just presents options, including probably the most important one of all: Pass All. This skips all of your actions for the current dungeon being adventured through. If you have no spell cards in hand and it's currently your opponent's adventuring turn, for example, there is no reason for you to stop the game. If more people knew about this, the games would go SIGNIFICANTLY faster. Rather than have the Halt button, just make the three options (Play A Card, Pass Once, Pass All) visible throughout the entirety of the adventuring phase.\n\nOverall, these are mostly minor issues that don't detract from the experience overly much. Since the game is still in early access, I expect the developer to make a few passes over the UI before its 'actual' release. What's here now, though, is perfectly playable and still enjoyable. It's still Boss Monster. It is not integrated into Steamworks and goes purely through their own servers (likely to prepare for crossplatform play similar to Ascension,) but online play has so far been smooth for me. I haven't tested inviting friends to private games yet nor have I tried the hotseat play option so take this review for what it is: a first impressions review.","May 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's right up my alley. When they opened a tabletop game bar 1 minute away from my home and I found out they had a copy of it, I was really excited to try it.\n\nBut soon after that, Boss Monster went on sale on Steam and I bought it. And I almost regret it. But that doesn't mean I recommend it.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Boss Monster is a solid game, and it's probably as fun as I thought it was gonna be. But I think the creators made a mistake in bringing it to Steam the way it is now. It just left Early Access (soon after being on sale), but there's still a lot of room for improvement.\n\nWhile the game itself is nice, the rules are great and the cards are relatively balanced, the port to Steam is almost unplayable to me. There were many little annoying issues that I hope they solve in the future (but I don't know, since this game stayed in EA for basically 1 year), and I'll try to focus on the worst parts:\n\nTerrible pace -- Sometimes the games is really slow, making you wait for hoards of heroes to walk past dungeon and, sometimes, you can't do anything about it. Other times, the game moves too fast, giving you little time to choose cards, to read cards and so on. So the game drags when you want it to go fast and flies when you want it wait. Also, the lack of sound alerts when it's your turn makes it easier for you to miss it.\nToo little information -- First of all, the tutorial in incomplete. It teaches a few basic things, then abandons you as if you had learned everything you needed. You have to read the manual outside the game to be able to play it if you're unfamiliar. Also, there's no action log. Sometimes, all you get is a speech bubble saying "used a room ability", but you don't know which, you don't where, and by the time you find out, you missed your chance to act.\nMultiplayer is dead -- You need a friend to play this. I've never found anyone online in "worldwide" menu.\nNo in-game chat -- Not that you'll find someone to play who's not on your friendlist. Still, having to look away from the game screen only makes it more likely that you'll miss a turn.\nLittle improvement over 1 year -- As I mentioned before, I think this game is too simple to still have that many issues after 1 year on EA. It makes me unwilling to believe stuff will ever get fixed.\nNeeds a lot more playtesting -- Some things don't work as (I think) they should. Two examples that I think of: (1) a card that was supposed to revive a hero an opponent killed seems to activate only the next turn, althought the card doesn't mention it (it should be the next tima available, but it didn't happen, and I lost because of it); (2) another time was when I used a card when another card had been played and it was discarded (its effects didn't apply). I wanted to play that card on the same monster, not as a counterspell. If it couldn't be used as a counterspell, I shouldn't have been able to use it as such (even with a room card that allows me to use any spell card as a counterspell, I would have to select the room's ability first).\nSo the bad news is that I probably won't ever play Boss Monster on Steam again. The good news is that I found out that I do, indeed, wanna play the physical version of this game. And when they release it here in Brazil in Portuguese (I think it's gonna be soon, but I'm not sure), I'm probably gonna buy it to play with my friends.\n\nI still think some people could have fun with this version of the game. Here's a little guide for you to know if this is for you:\n\nDO NOT BUY this game if you don't have a clue about it, or if you're not into tabletop games (try the physical version first, if anything)\nDO NOT BUY this game if you wanna find out if you like this or not (again, probably better to just try and play the physical version)\nDO NOT BUY this game if you love the physical copy already and always have friends to play it with... you'll probably be disappointed, and friends are always better than strangers =)\nBUY this game if you're a fan of Boss Monster, especially if you played quite a few matches, but you don't have anyone to play the physical game with.\nTo sum it all up (TL;DR): Boss Monster is a good game, but, as of now, the Steam version falls short.","April 28","false","9.6"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","36","57","0","0"

It is not a complex card game at base level but add in the strategy and thought process to each player competing and it can get as complex as you'd like.\n\nWhat I like about the PC version is the support for online games, being able to play anyone is amazing. The layout is really decent for the type of game it is, not cluttering when adding more A.I players. The auto attack equation helps, especially if someone new to the game can't outright figure out if they can take on any heroes. The unlocks once they are out will make this game even better than it is. The quality of the images for the cards and the overall colour and detail is really good, and makes the game much more impressive.\n\nThere are only a few niggles with the game that I would like to address though. One is the pass and play feature. Although this allows 'couch multiplayer' of sorts, for me personally, would prefer to sit at a table and play this game with physical cards, which only leaves the single player A.I and the online capabilities. Another worry is the sounds. I know they are there for fun and interaction with the cards but they can get a little irritating as they are played after every attack in a room. If they only made the noise once (maybe when they are built) I would be fine with it, but ergo I have had to turn off the sound in the settings. One tiny idea from me would also be to put a total attack number somewhere in your play area, not for me as a player personally who plays the physical game and has to, but for new players who don't want to be adding up their attack total each time.\n\nOverall though, its a perfect game for card beginners to learn what Boss Monster is about and have fun with it with friends, so I highly recommend it for those looking for something new, but if you have the physical edition, its only qualities are what I've said before, the A.I and online. For pass n play multiplayer, I will probably stick with the cards, but when I have no one to play with, the PC edition is where I'm going to go for my Boss Monster urges.\n\nPlus at a price of £5, theres no argument if you dont have the physical game, as this is cheaper than the physical edition, and will allow you to enjoy it as much as me.","May 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Inspired by 8 and 16 bit games as well as fantasy RPGs, it has a retro feel with quite a bit of humor thrown in.  You build your dungeon, using treasures in each room to lure hapless "heroes" into your dungeon, only to kill them with a variety of tricky trap rooms, brutal monster rooms, and fiendish spell cards that you can cast.If you take damage from five heroes, you die.  But if you manage to collect 10 heroes souls you win!\n\nOh, but did I mention there's another boss monster out there with his own dungeon?  Because he's competing with you to lure hapless adventurers into his own dungeon.  Playable against the computer or against friends online, with up to four players (or solo with 3 AI players) the challenge is real.  There's just enough randomness in the cards drawn to balance out the strategy needed to win.\n\nI would suggest people give this game a shot if you've never played the card game.

Seems reasonable for a phone, as the way you would hold the phone, it would be simple to hit it with your thumb, on either side actually.

It stood out from all the other card games because it featured pixel art, and the box was reminiscent of a NES game box. So we picked it up and took it home with us. We had such a blast playing it and sharing it with other friends. That card game was Boss Monster.\n\nImagine my excitement when I found out a digital version was coming to Steam, with online multiplayer.\n\nThe digital version isn't  perfect, but for an early access title it's pretty solid. It's rather easy to pick up if you're familiar with the card game. If you haven't played then you might be turned away by the sudden wall of text you have to read which is the tutorial, but once you get it down and play a few rounds it begins to make sense.\n\nThere are many options and possibilities for different kinds of dungeons. Some will work well with your boss character, some will not. It's also possible to get a really unlucky hand and just be stuck at the bottom the entire game, but it rarely happens. You win some and you lose some.\n\nA couple things I would personally like to see is a better tutorial which teaches through experience rather then having to memorize text, and an option to turn off the timer in multiplayer as it gets a little annoying sometimes, especially if you're fairly new to the game.\n\nOverall it's a fun game that deserves to be played. Buy it, play it, love it.","July 7, 2015","true","15.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The UI and some mechanics are very much from a mobile device, and that is really my only gripe. Even so, it is still in Early Access and could still be changed/improved. The gameplay is fun and challenging and has a small learning curve, unlike some other card games.

For those of you unfamiliar with the game, you're essentially an evil boss that must lure heroes into your dungeon and kill them off before they get to you (think "Dungeons" by Realmforge/Kalypso).  If you manage to accomplish this, you'll gain souls...earning ten first wins you the game.  However, they can inflict wounds should they get passed your rooms (which you can customize via cards) and five wounds is enough to eliminate you altogether.  Despite not having played the card game, I won my first game against the AI (though there is also multiplayer and hot seat options available)...in other words, it didn't take me long to figure everything out.

None of the glitches are game-breaking, and I am pround and Happy I spent money on this game. I could go on and on about how great this game is, but I would like to say this.\n\nIn what game can you play a retro old school dungon building card game that makes YOU the boss?\n\nWhat game can you play where you can be the sorceress of sexyness and have a motel filled with monsters where males come in and get killed?\n\nIn what game can you be a robot that can destroy EVERYTHING and cause havoc?\n\nIn what game can you be the equal to that of Bowser?\n\n\nName a game with that, and I will be impressed, because the only game I have seen with that and 20x more awsome is boss monster.","June 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I love playing it in person with my friends, and I was soooo happy when I realized that it was on steam. Even happier when I bought the game, along with all the expantions, for only 8$. That being said I think I got the bang for my buck. Within the first day I got the game I accumulated more than 5 hours. I dont know where that time went. Be warned though. Do NOT get this game unless you are getting it with friends. The game is no fun when you are playing just against AI. There is a worldwide mode, but I am not sure if it doesn't work, or not enough people play it. There are also a lot of bugs with the rooms and spells. Some of them say they will do something, but the effects don't work. Also, the abilities for some rooms take too long and can waste your entire turn. The game is just out of early access too, so hopefully bugs will soon be fixed. Personally, I would recommend buying the actually card game, because you don't have to worry about any bugs, and you can play at a pace you want to play at. I will recommend this game, but only to people who will have friends to play with, and are willing to deal with a few bugs.","May 3","true","11.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The interface, being ported straight off the iPad and Android versions, could also do with some serious work.\n\nI had fun playing single player and 1-on-1 with a buddy, but when we got 4 human friends in one room the bugs popped up fast and hard.

It is an amazing game. I helped kick start it and I helped kickstart this port. My negative recomendation is not for the Boss Monster game but for this Steam port.\n\nAnyways, now on to the review of the port. I will try to cover everything that was my initial impression:\n\nThis port feels very rushed and poorly done.\n\nThe Good:\n-Music is nice.\n-Card art is pretty as ever.\n- The digital exclusive cards are great.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The UI is extremely unituitive. I managed to destroy one of my rooms without even realizing it (which was hilarious.) It's hard to tell where to go to play certain things and what is going on/what phase you are in.\n\n-  Play moves at glacial speed. One of the fun things about Boss Monster is the speed at which you can knock out a game with a group of buds. With this port it takes unbelievably long to play a match. I understand why the need for the 'halt' window is needed but a vote to skip function would be great. (So when playing with one friend you guys can just mash that button when not waiting to play a card).\n\n- The control scheme feels like a direct rip of a mobile port. When selecting some things the only way to do so is click and drag the list of options, which while intuitive on a phone feels very clumsy on a computer. Srolling doesn't work.\n\nTo sum it up: Boss Monster is as good as ever and I love it for what it is. However, the port is poorly done and needs work. I couldn't even sit through one game with my friend because of the glacial play. It just takes so damn long to do anything.\n\nI will update this review if they make updates to the UI or can speed up play.","May 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","21","45","0","0"

First round someone got DC'd, got locked out of game, Why no spectating among friends?\n\nSecond time, the adventure phase kept being skipped and shooting us back to build phase. Several in our party ended up with full dungeons before we even got a hero in one of our dungeons, even tho we each had plenty of lures and were not tied. When they finally came they took forever to animate through the dungeons. We are talking like 10 minutes+ for one hero to move through.\n\nThird time our game started off fine, the UI isn't great but we were having a normal game but then again animations of heros moving through our dungeons brought the game to a grinding hault. We laughed while we sat through an excessively long adventure phase (easily 15 mins) which continued on even tho we already had a clear 10 point winner on our team. We stopped playing.\n\nI own the card game and was really dissapointed about the functionality of this game. I could get used to a bad UI as long as the game is still playable but this isn't. Obviously this is Early Access, but why try to sell expansions and make more money off a product that's essentailly not playable yet? tsk tsk.

I've backed all Kickstarter Campaigns on high tiers and because of which I got this game on Steam as an addition to that. The over-all mechanics are solid and it's a well developed game. Boss Monster is a fun game.. ..but the PC version is not.\n\nI guess I should say it would be if it worked. Which it doesn't. The interface isn't intuitive at all. As a Boss Monster veteran I'm often baffled at how to exicute the simplest of mechanics. That is if, as many would naturally assume, they actually work. Which, again, it doesn't. Spells do not at times go off. Room abilities will often fail to activate. The whole experience is brutally grating and terribly rage inducing.\n\nAgain, I essentially got this for "free" along with my Kickstarter pledge. It seems to go for $5 on Steam and for one of my favorite table top card games that seems like a steal considering it's both multiplayer and cross platform.. however the heartbreaking truth is that developement for Steam was a side thought to hedge in more donations and thus shotty. Updates are few and far between. The community is constantly swinging between the consensus of abandonware or just poor developement.\n\nIf you like Boss Monster or have interest I'd suggest wishlisting and following for now unless you don't care about throwing $5 away. Even as a free game I only play it once every few months, run into game breaking glitches and bugs, and promptly uninstall it. Rinse and repeat. As my record shows I've had this since launch and every few months I can only stomach maybe half an hour before I can't take anymore.\n\nMaybe it's just me but I have a hunch that ISIS formed from the original outsourced BETA testers for the Steam Version of Boss Monster.

This version however suffers greatly in the UI design. It feels like the original designers, while able to make a great tabletop game, didn't know enough about the process and or hired the wrong Devs for the job. I cannot imagine any Devs worth their salt, making the counter intuitive design choices I see being made here.\n\nUnless a player has previously mastered the tabletop version and all of its timing, memorized each of its cards including the expansion cards, and has experience playing a wide variety of other card games with strenuous timing systems, there is a good chance that a new player will be utterly lost here. I see even veterans of the Boss Monster tabletop game struggle to get their cards effects to work with this UI.\n\nThis UI provides no sense of timing, nor targeting of any kind. This game also provides no explanation of events, obvious or otherwise. Players simply watch as things happen with no explanation as to why. Such as when one of the opponent's triggers a card effect causing you to discard. There is no hint of this, you simply watch a card leap out of your hand for no obvious reason. You aren't even sure of which player caused it.\n\nSome actions require you to drag and drop a card over a specific spot while others require you to click on to zoom in on a card, then click in a green box then "I guess" double click that green box, to make something happen. I honestly cannot tell how to make some cards work, even after playing numerous games over several hours.\n\nEven an experienced player needs to see, or at least be told, what they are doing & why. Instead of just watching a card be discarded or their spell vanish as it was being played.\nInstead the UI just provides a generic cue such as "choose 3 cards" or "choose 1 card". Not explaining that you are drawing or discarding those cards or something else entirely. This also happens with choose a player, choose a hero, choose a room, choose a spell. All blind cues with a short timer.\n\nThe multiplayer turn timer is also very short. This short multiplayer timer has no way to change or disable it in settings.\n\nThis game is not only unpolished in the most obvious way, but it also suffers from rampant bugs. Such as from the "counter spell" card which doesn't light up for use against all opponent spells as they are cast, but only the ones they specifically told it to. They have obviously missed a few here.\n\nIf not for this dreadful UI, Boss Monster should have, would have, & could have been a hit here on steam and on PC. Sadly, as it is here upon release, it will likely never be what it might have been. Honestly, I really enjoy Boss Monster the game, and as much as I would like to recommend this title here, I just can't.","April 29","false","19.6"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

However, Boss Monster the video game is hardly a substitute for the real thing. Marred by a clunky UI that has quite a large learning curve to master and quite a few instances of cards not even doing what they are supposed to, it's safe to say that you will get what you pay for on this one.\n\nIn addition, the several expansions that have been released for the card game are completely missing from this game, as is any opportunity to make use of the customizable rules detailed in those expansions. Allowing for the "Infinite Lives" game mode or deeper mechanics like item cards or multi-treasure seeking heroes would go a long way towards making the game feel like what Boss Monster the card game has become in 2016, but sadly none of that appears to be even on its way.\n\nCheck back in on this one every now and then to see if the creators have decided to fix up some of the bugs or add in some of the newer content from the game if you really have an interest in this side of Boss Monster, but if not, skip this game, and go play with the amazing card version instead.","May 2","false","0.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

Keep in mind this is still in early access as I'm writing this.\n\nFirst is just something that I don't really expect to see and is just a preference thing, but the game is only competitive, you can't play this together with a friend, only against.  Some people may consider this a petty complaint, but it's important to me.  No co-op play makes a game very uninteresting for me.\n\nThe biggest problem, however, is the bugs.  Yes, it's early access, so these are to be expected, but I've yet to complete a game because the game hangs up at points.  If you want a good demonstration of this, just play the tutorial.  This is like the demo for Superman 64 where the part that's supposed to sell you on the game just shows you a glaring problem with it instead.\n\nSo at this point, I can't recommend it.  Once it's out of early access, or even a few patches after this review, the hanging problems will likely be fixed, but at the moment, it's unplayable.\n\nOh, one last thing, I'm not sure what the point of the Start Game/Quit screen is for... why not just have all of the options on the first screen that comes up?

Having my "character" selected completely at random was weird.\nThen there was the less than intuitive system for starting a game. It LOOKS like everything is locked out, but in fact allowed me to start a game as long as I did not select any of the game modes that it showed. I had to be higher level to unlock those... apparently...\nThe games rules are explained only in a slideshow thing, which does NOT help me to remember the rules. Maybe other people are fine with it, but it left me either having to drop back to the main menu, or go to the internet to look up rules.\nInterface was odd, often requiring you to click on things you might not expect in order to proceed, and a misclick takes you back, or worse: advances the turn without you taking an action.\nAI seemed good for the opponent, but it rapidly became apparent that it was either cheating, or just lucky ALL the time. I almost won twice. The first time, I had half my health left, and in the middle of the AIs turn, with a hero stomping up the middle of its' dungeon, the screen flickered and announced that I had lost, game over. The second time, with the AI a single move short of losing its' last point of health, and me still having ALL my health, the game abruptly closed itself.\n\nMaybe there are bugs being fixed, and maybe the rules will be better explained, but between all that and the startlingly limited number of cards I could find in the game, this feels like a party wipe.","May 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The PC version is a shoddy port of the mobile version that has clunky controls that require a dozen clicks for everything, and everything is all 'click and drag through'- i'm sure it's OK on a touch screen but FFS this is the PC port, better mouse support!\n\nThen comes the port of paper to digital. Let's be honest here: Boss Monster is not a game you ('most gamers') will sit down specifically to play. It's what we call a filler game. Waiting for Pizza, 'couple players in the D&D group are late.. any time there's a bit of time to fill, you can break it out and have a few minutes of silly fun.\n\nThere is precisely ONE benefit of the digital edition over the physical edition: the price. Outside of that, there's NO reason to go digital.\nThere's not a lot of synergy and strategy to the game, so the digital doesn't help you 'practice'.\nThere's not a lot of convoluted maths that the digital edition streamlines.\nThe mechanics are not particularly engaging, nor are they complicated.\nThere isn't a real 'story' to the game.\nThere's not much in the way of fun graphics.\n\nIn other words, this is a PC port of a mobile port of a tabletop card game, and it plays just like a tabletop filler card game, without any real advantage over the tabletop edition.\n\nAlso, the only expansion so far that's out, requires you to win the game /40/ times to get? Blood hell. I'm not sure I've actually played the tabletop edition 40 times yet, and definitely haven't won it 40 times.\n\nIt occurs to me that this game is still in early access, and the developers might read reviews looking for things that need improvements, so I will add some things which could change my rating:\n\nImproved UI with better mouse support.\nA few less clicks to accomplish basic tasks. (The 'halt' button, for example is needless, there should be a countdown bar with 4 options: Play spell, use room, go, go-all.)\nThe ability to select the boss you play, or at least get dealt a new one.\nAbility to increase the game speed.\nAllowance of 'house rules' (increase/decrease hand size, alter starting card distribution, alter souls/wounds required to win/lose, etc.)","May 13, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

First of all, it's a bad pc version of a mobile game, the control are not intuitive, and even after playing a bit i still mess up the few basic action (like hitting esc to go back when all it does is open the menu), or i just guess to use my arrow keys to switch between cards !!!\n\nThe tutorial doesnt explain everything, i didnt even know i had to play against someone, how the treasure system worked to attract heroes to YOUR dungeon and not the opponent (if you can read between the line and tested the game before hand it make sense, but when you never played it once or heard about its gameplay ... well, its confusing). I had other pleople with no experience with the game and they made the same mistake. It's something relatively basic to make your game tested by different people without explaining them what to do or how to do it (expect with the information the game provides you) so you dont make that kind of mistakes.\n\nWith the functionnality and polish the game provides it wouldnt in no way bought that game : No deck management, no control on where you set your rooms, graphics could have been a lot better even for a 2D card game, like i said controls are awfull.\n\nI played a bit multiplayer with a friend and we it was just okay.\n\n\nSo i dont recommend it to you unless you are a real fan and what to play it with someone else on pc who doesnt have the mobile version.

The video game however, is a big, cheap, disappointment.\n\nFull Video Review With Insight On How The Game Actually Plays:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru4L0nb1m7s\n\nBelow is entirely focused on the port:\n\nGameplay:\nBoss Monster PC is ported from Ipad and it shows. Menus aren't designed for a mouse and keyboard, windowed mode barely works with their being a pseudo borderless that alt-tabs the game without minimizing but requires you alt-tab to get back in which makes it frustrating when you are on a timer. Windowed mode shrinks into a tiny box that you can't make bigger because the game features no resolution options. Controls are at times incredibly sloppy. Some buttons are incredibly close to the corner of the screen which will cause you to "alt-tab" out of the game at times when you click off-screen. Multiplayer is a joke with no one playing and even if you find one person you are given a timed window to get other players, you can't wait long, you can't get AI. Basically, every random game you play online will be 1v1. On the technical side, Bad AI and bugs aren't common but they do happen. Sometimes cards won't work and AI will do stupid things. The porting issue rears its ugly head as it screws with your controls. It can be very easy to make a mistake and you have very few moments in the game where you can correct those mistakes. The game also sells DLC because of course it does. Now I would be fine with this but with the multiplayer as dead as it is, it just hurts the game even more because you will be using these expansions against AI. Now the biggest nut-kicker is that Tools of a Hero-Kind is a pay-for expansion just like in the original card game. The original game had some early-on balancing issues where one player could be completely screwed by hero output and bad RNG. Tools of Hero-Kind helped fix it, they didn't decide to add this or any of the other DLC to make it feel like a complete experience.\n\nVisuals:\nBoy oh boy does this hurt me the most. Animations are incredibly static. While the cards are animated decently, almost everything else is lifeless. When heroes move between rooms in your dungeons it is just the same as how you move them between rooms in the actual card game. Heroes pop out of their cards only to slide across each room without move any body parts, boss have no idle animations at all. They just stand their in an incredibly disappointing manner. While there are actual backgrounds that are what you expect, there are no animations or anything interesting happening in them. Static, boring, uninspired, environments. The only thing they got right is the UI, it's incredibly-well layed out with a decent tutorial to back it up. Except they manage to screw that up and not include a counter or a deck or any indication of how many heroes are left in each deck. I thought the whole point of a video game adaption was to bring a card game to life. It certainly isn't going used for playing with others online because as I mentioned before, online is dead.\n\nSound:\nSound is the closest thing I can consider good about the game but they still don't cross mediocre. There is one music track in this game, it's good but there's just one. Why not have some dynamic music where when it's your turn but you are low on health but about to win the game with no spell cards to protect you from a player attack that could absolutely wreck you. Where's that tension I would get when playing with friends? That music would have at least accounted for the slow pacing in the adventure phase. Otherwise audio is decent with sound effects being nice to the ears but they do re-use a lot of them.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI am disappointed. This is an incredibly low-effort adapation and port of a great game. If you have friends and you really want to play Boss Monster without meeting at someone's house, this isn't a horrible way to do it. For everyone else, just save up for a copy of the base game. You will get more enjoyment and more value out of it. Until they can fix all these issues most would steer clear of this port.","April 28","false","1.7"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","2","15","0","0"

It's what you get when you almost literally try to take a card game and make it a video game.  I'm glad I spent the $2 for this, and not the $20 for the card game, since it doesn't appear to be fun, whatsoever.  The game itself is barely out of pre-release, and you can tell.  It is barely animated, confusing as hell, and simply poorly done, gameplay wise, at every turn.  The game makers however happily inserted numerous pages devoted to you purchasing the expansion pack items.  I'm glad I only got this on sale for one, however I will be immediately refunding it.  This game is nothing but an unfun, waste of time.  After playing 3 games, 2 tutorial (just to be sure I was getting the bad concepts of this crappy game) and 1 normal, and losing 2/3 of the games, I was sure it was as bad as I feared.","April 28","false","0.8"," 2 of 21 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","2","21","2","3"

If it were to work out some of the bugs, I would feel comfortable saying this game is fantastic. The bugs aren't such a huge problem, but it can get kind of annoying. I mostly see them manifest in card effects just not happening. I have learned to avoid using certain cards because I know that their effects just won't work. I am a huge fan of the actual card game so having a digital version has been pretty fun. I would be really happy to see them patch the bugs out of this game.","May 24","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
