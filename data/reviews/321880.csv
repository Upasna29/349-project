"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/321880/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","A few days after the defeat of Gwendyal, Edward's wedding day is marked by the fact that Lydia used a disguise to be his wife. And Mel is seeing a strange ghost, Nox, kinda looking like her. Given the fact that the Orb of Death has been completed, your young thief/spy sets her eyes on finding it on another island. However, her old team can't travel with her: Stella is convinced that it's a trap, Edward isn't even aware of her departure, Lydia couldn't care less unless she uses that fact to be the sole ruler, Ulf prefers to stay and learn, Galahad and Tej'Imal are living on his native hometown, though our dear ex-vampiress is sulking about the fact that she's not anymore a blood sucker and her man is very happy about that fact. So, when Mel finally reaches her destination, she will find new allies: June, an apprentice magician, Yvette, a shapeshifter and Spooks, a strange thief...\n\nAveyond 3 was fragmented in four chapters. This one is the sequel to the first two and as usual, the story is well-written and full of humor: animals can talk in another village, with their own fight, June is very joyful, Yvette has some sarcasm in her, Spooks is creepy and the other characters retain their personality, though Lydia revealed herself as power hungry. I would have preferred her in a role less darker and the fact that I've bought her robes in the previous game is making me regret to have a spent a cent for her.\n\nThe game mechanics are still the same, though now, you don't have any healer anymore: June and Yvette have offensive and defensive spells, Ulf and Edward are only using weapons and Spooks is leaning towards Mel's skills. You can still level up to improve yourself but now, June can also increase her spell powers by using them during the fight. Also, the HUD above the characters during the fight changed and is more visual. I've also discovered that you can swap characters during a battle, something I thing you couldn't do before. Also, in the animal village, you have an alchemist shop where you can mix ingredient to obtain potions, serums or even pies. You'll find recipes all around the world.\n\nSome quests needs to be done in order to advance in the story, while they're appearing as being a side-quest just for the money. Others are just bonus. But given the fact that you need money to buy stuff or to fast-travel, any quest is worthy to be done. Besides, when defeating enemies, you can loot them and find also money or items. You have also chests to open or bags to find.\n\nAs you lost your pirate ship, your only way to come back to Harburg, Thais and any other town on the mainland is a special ferry. But you can also use warp eggs (the red is taking you back to the Moo Hatchery, the purple one to the animal village). The fast travel mirrors are still useful and when you're in the dead realm, you have also the Reaper that can connect you to the Vampire realm.\n\nAveyond comes also with three difficulties: Easy where you're stronger and where most of the enemies don't spawn again after a defeat (yeah, I'm playing in this difficulty), Normal where every is balanced and Hard where you'll die more frequently - though even in Easy, I've been wiped. Well, if a character dies, you can ressucitate them but if your team is wiped, it's game over and it's up to you to load the auto-save (when entering a new screen) or a save of yours.\n\nAnd while I appreciate keeping my levels for my characters, I've lost all my money and all my gears. Just because Lydia made your life a little hell... So you don't have any good gear to begin with. Besides, even Edward didn't take Excalibur. I was disappointed.\n\nAveyond dates from 2009-10 and from an earlier version of RPG Maker but the graphisms are still good. Besides, the landscapes are still varied: while Thais, Stormbend, Witchwood and Harburg are still present, you're discovering now other towns: an oriental town, a medieval one, a eastern style, a port, etc...\n\nI've spent 14 hours in it, showing that every Aveyond chapter takes time. However, strangely enough, I did felt like this was the shorter game. I don't know why.\n\nAveyond 3-3 isn't the best Aveyond out there. I largerly prefer the second chapter. Maybe because it was the lost of my gear, of my team (and my healer) and my ship that I felt like I wasn't going to like the chapter. It's still enjoyable, however, without Tej'Imal and Galahad, I've lost powerful teammates, without Stella, I don't have any good healer and many questions are still unanswered like Nox (though I've cheated and looked into the Aveyond wiki, well, I wasn't really far from the truth about her). Still, the game is worthy.\n","February 29","true","14.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

June's spells do get uesd, but mainly to level them up. Once they're all rank 5 there is littl reason to use any other than poison and confusion. Her normal attacks often will be stronger. Yvette's first form has a useful group attack. Other forms have some gimmicks. But she's not bad. If the allied effects were group cast she'd be a lot better off.\n\nTraveling in this one is a huge pain. There is a LOT of back and forth between many areas.\n\nKeeping your team properly geared requires a bit of farming. A bit too much for me personally. I don't mind it a little. It often means you're skipping too many mobs. But in this one you can kill everything between traveling points and still only get 25% of the gear you need at the next stop. Generaly left moving to the next area and trying to survive for the higher gold worth. Since combat isn't exactly anything special, this gets kind of dull fast.\n\nThe next new gimmick is Alchemy. Like gearing up, it requires a lot of repeated moving around. Luckly it's really not all that useful overall. There are a few quest points that require it and maybe two potions worth caring about(one for a quest, one for travel assistance). So it's not too horrible. But is kind of a let down for these reasons.\n\nOverall the rest of it should feel like the last two. There's a less exploring to do, gearing up can be a chore. The rest can be ignored.","November 7, 2015","true","14.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
