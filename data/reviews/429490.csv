I would give a neutral review, but there is no such a option so let it be a slightly positive review because I believe the AI can be fixed. The game is quite new and updates are still coming out. Environment and weapons looks pretty good and music is just terrifying.","January 12","true","4.4"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","64","75","6","0"

(Takes 6 shots from a laser shotgun, AKA the slugger)\n\nWEAPONS   This game has a lot of weapons, and there may be more more later on.\nThe Game currently has:\n-3 Melee weapons\n-4 Pistols\n-A Crossbow\n-2 SMG's\n-2 Shotguns\n-2 Assault rifles\n-2 LMGs\n-A Semi-Auto Rifle\n-A Sniper\n-A Rocket Launcher\n-A Flame Thrower\n-A Minigun\n-2 Alien Weapons\n\nGRAPHICS   I think this game just looks awesome, especialy the ocean in the shooting range, since the sounds of the waves are synced with when they crash down.\n\nSOUNDS   JIMBOB did a pretty good job with the sounds, for example, I may seem crazy, but I think I hear some bird noises in wave survival. Either way, The sounds are great except for the aliens footsteps, which tell me exactly where they are coming from (Perhaps there could be an echo effect indoors later?), as well as when you swing a melee weapon, it sounds like you hit something even if you didn't (Maybe it could be a swishing sound?). One last thing, with shotguns the sounds that plays when you kit an enemy is overpowering the sound of the actual shotgun, which kind of feels like a bummer since you should see them ragdoll away with a big bang. At least in my opinion.\n\nANIMATIONS   Even though the enemys kind of flop when they die, it's awesome in my opinion You can see yourself as well as your flashlight isn't fixed to a single spot since it's attached to your gun.\n\n\n\nBUGS -None at the moment\n\nRecomendations Just some things I think would be cool for the future, you don't have to add them though. :)\n-The blaster aliens could drop the weapons they have when they die\n-A kind of boss monster that appears in every X number of waves (not the tripod)\n-Maybe a debuff for the slugger, since it kills everything in one hit (on hard) except the tripod\n-Maybe secret ways to get into the currently closed off areas for better weapons\n-A kind of armor system that takes away damage, but has to be repaired. You could put in an item that's rare, but you can find 2 around the map, that breaks after a certain amount of hits. It could be limited to a game mode or not.\n-A weight system that determines how fast you are moving because of how many/which guns you are carrying. For example, if you have the minigun, that could make you go much slower. But if you have a smg, you can move much faster. This could also influence the stamina system.\n\nYou should get this game I really like this game and I recommend that you guys get it, especially if you're looking for something that doesn't cost much and will give you at least a couple hours of fun, get this.\nKeep up the good work JIMBOB!","January 1","true","25.2"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","53","61","5","11"

It MAY seem like they flop dead when they die, but seriously, is it really that bad?\nAnimations are really good... Expect for some of the enemy animations. Those are a bit wonky but Jimbob can improve them, it's hard to make animations anyways.\n\nUnity Assets are the worst!Okay, I hate when people say a game is bad because it uses Unity Assets.\nI myself am a Unity3D game dev working on my own game and I am using some Unity Assets, what's so bad about someone using a simple Unity Asset? The game has a lot of assets, I know that. But JIMBOB can't make hundreds of models himself so he used models from the Unity Asset store. Why is that so bad? If someone can't model, they are still a game dev and that's what matters.\n\nB-But S-Something else is bad...?What else is wrong? The game has bugs, okay every other game does too.\n\nNow for the review. after explanation why it isn't bad.The game has a ton of weapons right now. Enough to keep you occupied for awhile. There are about 6 or 7 Alien types so far. The game has several maps and the game looks BEAUTIFUL! Nice survival food and water system and good detail on everything. When you look down you can actually see your body and the Flashlight is very realistic, by that I mean when you run with the Flashlight, wherever your gun is facing the light goes onto there.\n\nRating            Graphics        10/10                Gameplay        8/10                Controls        7/10                Replayability        8/10     Content 8/10   Overall Rating 8/10\nI know a lot of you are gonna dislike this review, but you probably are gonna dislike it only because I find it a good game. If you really are that way you should have some affection for the hard working developer.\n\nShow some appreciation for the this Indie Developer.\n\nIf you don't like the game... Wait for new updates, okay?","December 26, 2015","true","9.2"," 52 of 78 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","52","78","6","6"

Example, drop one or a few and then move to another spot.\n* A bit longer reloading time for the minigun..right now it loads faster then a pistol.\n* The RPG should do more damage I think.\n* A 40mm grenade launcher like the M79 would be wicked to have.\n* "Inventory" hotkey that pauses the game so you can pick a weapon, see the ammo, etc..\n\nGood, but very weird in a good way, variety of bad guys.. and some shoot back which definitely increases the challenge..;-)\n\nFor those that don't live just for playing online against often rude players.. this game  is a good and cheap alternative.\n\nThanks.","February 23","true","25.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

The graphics are good, weapons are good and what I found interesting were the in game settings. You can change the time of day, the lighting, brightness of stars, size of the moon, stuff like that which I found cool because you can have the experience you want. There is a survival mode I haven't tried where you have you have to eat and drink the food and water scattered around the map. As I said before the AI is horrible because all the enemies do is run at you, and seem to always know where you are. Another thing I didn't like is that it only has one map, it is a good one but the lack of diverse environments kind of sucks. I give this game a 6.5/10. This game has a lot of potential and keeps getting patched so hopefully more content will be added and the AI improved.","January 9","true","0.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

For example, there are a vast selection of guns, but some do a small amount of damage, while the rest do the exact same (A Sniper rifle, magnum, LMG, and Assault Rifle do the exact same amount of damage, they all just have different clips and distances they can shoot). There are alot of enemies, but many of them, once more, do the same amount of damages and are basically the same monster reskined to look different. And the Food and Water system is honestly out of place and just feels like something the dev added in to be able to say "And look! Survival!"\n\n2) Enemies are honestly overpowered, while you are horribly underpowered. Every single enemy (Including the boss) Runs slightly slower than you and NEVER stops running, meaning that you cannot stop to reload at any point during a wave, and you cannot run while reloading. Some weapons, such as the magnum, are totally useless further on in waves because it does the exact same amount of damage as a sniper (The sniper would be useless as well, but it can shoot longer ranges than all weapons, which barely gives it enough slack to make it ok), and becuase you have to wait 2 seconds in between each shot. There are 3 enemies that do a large amount of damage: Rock giants, Aliens with blasters, and the mini bosses.\n\nThey all run, once more, slightly slower than you, so you can only sort of outrun the giant. The aliens will stop and shoot at you, and their shots are IMPOSSIBLE to avoid, and they do a good amount of damage. Same with the mini boss who shoots a lazer at you, high damage, runs ACTUALLY FASTER than you, and unavoidable attack. What is even worse about this is that the boss glitches through all placed objects (Minus buildings), so if you try to hide behind a tree, it just passes through it and hits you anyways.","January 18","false","1.6"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","19","29","4","7"

A base building, open world, wave survival is just what gamers want.\n\nThrow in a little multiplayer here and there and your looking at a very good foundation to begin a masterpiece!\n\nIts obvious that the developer keeps in touch with his gamers, releasing regular contect ect.\n\nThe game is obviously so far away from even discussing a completion date, but I bought this game in the hope that this developer will continue his work and really make somthing of this.\n\nSeriously, good luck.","April 12","true","0.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Now that I have 13+ let me say this game FAR exceeded my expectations. Sandbox mode sounded INCREDIBLY mediocre, but let me tell you; everything seen in the survival maps can be customized in sandbox mode. You can create your own maps with an overwhelming amount of prefabs and make your own buildings! I do not think you can totally play them yet, but of course this is still very much alpha. Buy this game.\n\nOld Review below\n\n\n\nHonestly let me start off by saying; it would be hard as hell to find a developer as commited as this one. ( UPDATED )\n\nThe game is GORGEOUS and the MASS amount of settings makes it all the better.\nGunplay is pretty basic, but still really fun to just spray hordes of aliens.\n\nThe game has a few bugs, however. ( All bugs have been fixed in the 3 days since I posted\nthis review. )\n\n-Unalligned ADS\n-graphical quality glitches\n-Really buggy LMG\n\nThe maps are small, but that's to be expected both of such a new game, and the fact it's wave style.\n\nIf you have $4 to blow and feel like a little bit of mindless shooting then I can't recommend this enough.\n\nI'll definately be keeping a close eye on how this game progresses!","February 3","true","13.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Considering all the junk out there, the fact that this game operates so smoothly with it's ragdoll physics and intense creepy monsters...  This game basically just needs steam leaderboards and it's done.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiXOmspKq1c\nMy entire previous review was not actually true because there was a critical flaw in the game where the sky and sun were not working.  So I had to redo my video now that we could see, and it completely changes the game.  Sight is an amazing thing!\n\nSo now I can see even fewer flaws in this game.  Now I will only complain about the game's performance.  I have built a new computer and I haven't tried a whole lot of games out yet but this one is one of 5 I have tried and it performs very poorly.  New system is a 24 core Xeon E5-2685 (12 core dual socket) with 32GB DDR4, Radeon R9 290.  When I play GTA5 or Witcher 3, I get activity in maybe 5-6 cores and overall it's like 1% CPU usage.  With this game for whatever reason it uses ALL of the cores.  When I'm not recording, it was like 40% split across them all and when I was recording it was 80% (across 24 cores!!!).  Not exactly sure what is going on, it could be just a unity thing, I will try out some more unity games today.  But I figured it was worth mentioning that there is something unusual in how this game is threaded.\n\nOh, 5:13pm edit: I was also getting like 20 FPS in GTA5 just now somehow randomly and was getting 60FPS yesterday.  Turned out that the new AMD Crimson driver was cooking my video card by locking the fan at like 10%.  So the card was at 100 degrees the whole time and if it caused bad FPS in GTA it probably caused bad FPS in Resilience.  So keep that in mind, I need to make a third video now... *sigh*, but at least in this 2nd video you can at least see what it's all about.  Stay tuned.  But I have not known of an overheating video card to give 80% CPU usage on its own so I still think the game has a threading issue.\n\nThat's about it.  So far it looks like a fun game.  I'll add to this more later I just wanted to remove my complaints about the pitch black world, it doesn't make sense once you play the updated version!","December 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 33 of 62 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","33","62","5","11"

The opening sequences allow a lot of customization on the map itself and offers a dummy training ground.  The recent update of 42 with the promise of a new map in the next update gives promise to a game that should still be in the kickstarter early access phase.  An interesting premise; Aliens invading and you are the sole survivor in this small town(a large map)fighting back endless waves of Aliens and Zombie AI.\n\nI've taken the time to create a video including update 42 and some idea of where the game stands today.

I gave a review after only playing one mode of the game, that being sandbox, now I have spent a little longer playing and now want to say that this game has really great potential. If the developer spends some time fixing things and listening to the players on what they want to see it could be one of the top games of the genre. Im gonna list the good and the bad for game.\n\nPros: + Nice graphics (I was playing on max)\n+ Nice assortment of weapons\n+ Large amount of enemys including boss enemies\n+ Different game modes to play\n+ Great concept\n+ Developer is very active and responds to comments and updates the game on a regular basis\n\nNow the bad\nCons: - Ui can be annoying at times\n- Not enough time between rounds\n- Sandbox mode is hard to figure out (For me it is, others may not have this issue)\n- Animations are mediocre\n- Weapon models need working on\n- Driving the buggy allows you to see under the map\n- Bugs as all Early access games experiance\n- Price has increased and really should not have yet\n- Dont have leaderboards that I know of.\n\nThese issues are really nothing groundbreaking and can be fixed with no problem. I really had alot of fun with the small amount of time I spent playing. My hrs on the game are more than listed. I would say I have around about 5-6 hrs. Also its a good game for the price but its went from 3.99 to 5.99. Thats about a third of the original price. I think its too soon for the increase but I dont know his situation so I may be wrong.","February 15","true","0.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

The game I suppose is okay for the price but would I recommend it?  I don't know.  If you are looking for a way to pass time in waiting for a phenomenal game to download, this game is a good way to pass time in the meantime.  I got bored within about 10 minutes of gameplay, however.  The enemies are all clones of each other, the AI is horrendous.  When you climb up a ladder the enemies will run into the object you are climbing up, not knowing to climb up after you, until you inevitably fall down cause the game makes it difficult to climb down or maneauver around the poorly placed "safe" zone.  My character randomly switches weapons.  My health depletes when I cannot find the last couple aliens to kill in a wave.  My character also cannot swim, he just "floats" very slowly in water while the enemies walk into and under it at full speed like it isn't even there.  The landscape gets pretty boring as well and it seems like that is the only map you will be given in the game, as I have no interest in progressing in this game any further.  For the price, I'll let most of this slide, but improvements to the game with a higher asking price as compensation would've been greatly appreciated.  Is it fun?  Yes, somewhat.  Does it have nice graphics?  Sure, but it's very repetitive and seems unfinished.  Overall 3/10.","January 3","false","1.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","3"

There is a wave survival mode, and there is an alpha option that anyone can try. The dev is focussing on the alpha, which is like a playground to screw around with new features, which is surprisingly fun. The wave survival mode is kinda boring but can still be fun. It's only 6 bucks so I would easily recommend it.","June 2","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
