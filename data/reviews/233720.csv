Anyway, you control his fingers and thumb using the keyboard, which works well at simulating a hand. The controls can get a little frustrating, however I think that was a little on purpose. Now, most of you are all wondering the same question: Does it have a good story? Yes. It shows a man who poses a lack of hand motor skills and has a dream of becoming a surgeon, the best surgeon, but you are the only one who can fulfil his dream.\nThe story and game play intertwine nicely and always makes you ask the same question: Was it worth it? As you stare down at the life insurance fee, was it worth it...? That aside, the game has three different types of surgery: Heart Transplant, Kidney Transplant and the Brain Transplant. They all are extremely fun and varied and include funny references, while you Tomahawk Chop someone in the skull. There is also a few secret levels, which I won't tell you about since they are...secret. Just go easy on the heavy (I've given my condolences to enough Team Fortress characters).\n\nIn a nutshell, Surgeon Simulator controls well,  Has frustratingly-fun levels and even the starting menu provided for several minutes of fun.\n\nNOTE:  This is my first review, so I know it isn't that good, however I hope to get better as I write more.","September 30, 2014","true","11.3"," 143 of 158 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","143","158","18","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/233720/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Most of us are well short of the level of education and subsequent anatomical knowledge required to successfully perform a heart transplant. Still, who wouldn't mind experiencing the awesome wave of heroic accomplishment that washes over a surgeon each time he or she saves a person's life? Surgeon Simulator 2013, a game from Bossa Studios, won't help you be a surgeon. It won't help you save lives, either. Hell, I'd even go as far as to say it has a negative influence on your personal knowledge of what invasive surgery actually entails. What it does do, almost in spite of itself, is haphazardly simulate the thrill of ripping a man's heart out of his chest and replacing it with another one.Surgeon Simulator 2013 replicates surgery the same way Enviro-Bear 2010 simulates a bear driving a car; with one hand and deliberately obtuse control. You play as Nigel Burke, or, more specifically, you play as Nigel Burke's left hand. Each of Nigel's fingers are controlled with your fingers on the A, W, E, and R keys, respectively, while Nigel's and your thumb is left to the space bar. Yes, that's completely insane, and yet also sort of logical position for your hand on a keyboard.Surgeon Simulator 2013's clumsy control is more of an endearing hook than a frustrating point of contention. It seems impossible, but, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head, an operational degree of control is gained with a bit of practice. Plopping Nigel’s hand down on a scalpel and watching him haphazardly pick it up like a cave man holding a pencil is both effectively hilarious and functionally acceptable. Hovering the hand over an artery and dropping it to replicate some sort of crude sawing motion looks absurd, but typically manages to get the job done. Playing Surgeon Simulator 2013 for a couple hours grants an almost expert level of control, but being a novice is almost more enjoyable simply because of how ridiculous everything appears when swinging Nigel’s dumb hand around the operating table.It helps that Surgeon Simulator 2013’s proposed method of surgery is almost completely unrealistic. Despite being mostly about goofs up to this point, there's a neat little game packed in Surgeon Simulator 2013. If you wreck Bob's guts too much he'll start bleeding, and if he bleeds out completely you'll murder the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fail the surgery.Spontaneity is perhaps Surgeon Simulator 2013's finest asset. Being physics-based game loaded with a ton of props, it's prone to numerous instances of accidental mishaps. Since Nigel's arms controls like your arm if it had been numb for three years, knocking all of the extraneous crap over on the operating table is a common occurrence. Likewise, accidentally dropping your scalpel, bone saw, or plastic spoon inside Bob's chest cavity is frequently unavoidable. From getting a scalpel lodged in your palm to accidentally administering hallucinogenic drugs on yourself, Surgeon Simulator 2013 is loaded with random and surprising tomfoolery.Obscene humor is the reason to play Surgeon Simulator 2013, and it delivers that asset in spades, but down the line it actually morphs into a legitimate challenge. After failing twenty or whatever times, I was sweating bullets the first time I managed to complete the kidney transplant. The sheer amount of things that could go wrong, not the mention the sloppy control, made for a true feeling of accomplishment upon completion. It's nothing like real surgery, obviously, but I did feel the overwhelming need to high five every one around and celebrate once I finally got it right.Half the fun is mentioning the premise of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to a buddy and then watching him or her come to grips with the outrageous task before them.And there you have it. Surgery Simulator 2013 is a joke, and its creators are well aware of that fact, but it’s effectively the best game about completing surgical procedures with a phantom limb ever made.","December 28, 2014","true","28.7"," 122 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","88","122","139","38","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/233720/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","Surgeon Simulator is ridiculously stupid yet somehow manages to be frustratingly fun. Your role is simple. Play doctor and transplant specific organs without letting your patient die. Sounds complicated right? Well the game severely dumbs down the process effectively letting you rip out anything you don't need to focus on the task at hand.\n\nLearning the controls is actually half of the fun. You only get one hand in the game, but you have to control that one hand with two hands of your own using both the keyboard and mouse. The mouse moves your wrist and arm and the keyboard grasps your fingers to grab tools and organs. It's quite tricky to get the hang of because it just feels so unnatural and it can be quite a challenge to hold tools at just the right angle to make that precision cut.\n\nAlthough the title may give a false sense that it showcases some realism, there is no doubt that Surgeon Simulator is designed for purely amusement purposes only. And it certainly excels in the amusement category. An extremely original concept plus very innovative gameplay make this a game worth trying at least once.","April 10, 2014","true","5.2"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","78","86","0","1"

You take the role of a surgeon named Nigel Burke. Mouse movements control your doctor’s hand, up, down, left, right, and rotating. A, W, E, R and space bar are all used to control individual fingers on the hand, this is used to grasp the utensils, The game play consists of the player trying to complete a number of different operations on your patient, the first being something as simple as a heart transplant.\n\nOnce completing the first operations, you then unlock different scenarios, such as ambulance operations, ad space operations, which incorporate bumping round tools and zero gravity,\n\nThe graphics are nicely presented and everything looks clean and polished, I don't think photo realism graphics would be something I would be looking for in this type of game anyway. The soundtrack is mainly the general hospital/emergency theme tune the whole time, I had to turn it off after the first hour or two as it just grew very repetitive very fast, all of the sound effects in game of the grinding, sawing and squelching are all very nicely produced.\n\nThis game is hard, like, hard as nails hard, I am nowhere near completing it, and I have played for almost eleven hours, your hands start to ache if you play any more than an hour due to the intense holding down of the buttons and thought that goes into picking up a single item, it is unbelievable, I did try out using a controller using Pinnacle Gaming Profile (quick shout out to them while I am at it), and this did make the controls a little easier to use, but it was still stupidly difficult.\n\nI haven't found any technical issues, I would think a potato could run Surgeon Simulator; it's a well optimized game.\n\nA lot of the time I spent on this was playing with friends, just playing around seeing how messed up we could get, and that's what this game is all about, just having a laugh and giggle, it's hard to sit down on your own for hours at a time on this game just because of how strenuous it is on your hand and thought process just to pick something up. But I do recommend that people pick it up, just for the novelty value and for some couch gaming with friends.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But there is yet hope as a band of unlikely heroes unite to vanquish this foe and send it back to the vile domain from whence it came. Play the roles of plucky Pinkie, the young but eager son of a blacksmith, Ring, the exiled princess trying to win back her rightful place as heir to the throne, the short-tempered Middle with a past shrouded in secrecy and an apparent score to settle, Thumb, the stoic and noble paladin sworn to defend the realm, and their brave leader Index, who together form the brotherhood of The Hand of Nigel, as they set forth on adventure in a world filled with peril at every turn.\n\nFace hideous, demented foes throughout the course of your journey such as the snake-like Intesties, the oozing Liveros, and the worst villains of them all, The Board of Medical Examiners. Lay siege to their fortress of bones, but choose your weapons careful, as only the right tools will grant you access to their grotesque dungeons. Mere tiny blades and cutting devices will ne'er be enough to pass, but with steadfast determination and a mighty hammer you will see your way through to the inner sanctum. Once inside be prepared to face the horrible wretches that lie in wait for you, the bosses within the bowels of each twisted lair, including Master Pump, The ♥♥♥♥-taker, and the most sickening of them all... Big Brain. Only when these are vanquished will you truly be able to call yourself the Hero of Infirmary and claim the hand of the fair maiden Trisha.\n\nIt is not a quest for those faint of heart or lacking in skill or valour, but great rewards await any warrior brave enough to take on this challenge as you traverse the wastelands, do battle astride the back of high speed carriages, and even magically voyage through the cold, dark void of outer space on your intrepid excursions. Find glory and pass into legend, or succumb to the forces of evil and meet your doom, but whatever you do, tread carefully lest you summon the wrath of the greatest danger of all, the all-knowing, omnipresent...

It's a weird, hard to control, bizarre game. People compare it to QWOP and to the extent that it relies on playing twister with your fingers that's true, but it's much more than that. Each surgery is like a puzzle, trying to figure out which tools work and don't, finding the most efficient route through it. Achievements incentivize creative play. I mean, the most amazing thing about the game is that it exists at all, it's so absurd. But I think if you get past the initial curve you'll find a compelling score/time attack game.\n\nI'll also add that if you have people over to your house, non-gamers LOVE watching this. A casual hammer to the skull here, a drill dropped in a chest cavity there, accidentally throwing the replacement heart away. It's all good.\n\nYou're looking at 8-10 hours for completion of every surgery with good scores, maybe 12-15 if you want to go to A++ on everything. The developers have also repeatedly updated the game with new free content, so I think it's fair to say that if you're the type that buys games to support a developer, this is a good choice.","November 29, 2013","true","7.7"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

You have probably seen all that on You Tube.\nBut after about 20 minutes (varies from person to person), but the chaos gets old really quickly. And then comes the frustration.\nYou'll be trying to actually finish a surgery, only to be constantly pestered by your character's inability to perform simple tasks, such as picking up items, cramming his hand into tight places, putting more than 20 centimeters between his hand and the patient, inability to peek around his arm, and last but not least his spontanious fits of cerebral palsy.\nWhich is to say that sometimes your character will fail to pick up items despite his hand being straight on top of them when you flex the fingers, the reach of your arm is so short you cannot reach the farthest edges of the operating table, and in surgeries where the patient is upright, you can barely get your hand over your patient's head, making it nigh impossible to avoid smacking your patient in the face with whatever you're wielding. Besides that, your arm will almost constantly be blocking the view of either your tool or the organ you're trying to sever, and you will constantly drop things despite having a firm grip on them.\nThese arduous controls are what make the game fun for the first twenty minutes of intentional chaos and carnage, but are also what makes the rest of the game time horrible, and filled with unintentional chaos and carnage.\nIt does have plenty of good humor, though. I particullalartly liked the TF2 easter egg.\nI have decided not to recommend it, but this is only because I would not recommend it at its normal price. I bought it during a sale, and that is probably the primary reason I am not overly disappointed with the game.\nIf you like chaos and mayhem and randomness, then you'll probably have a good time. If you like to get stuff done, then this is really, really not the game for you.","June 12, 2015","false","13.4"," 123 of 206 people (60%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","60","123","206","20","4"

Finally, an accurate portrayal of my day-to-day, and a chance to hone my skills.\n\nI used to be apprehensive about taking on those tricky triple heart bypasses in the zero gravity facility I maintain in my basement. But after just minutes with this highly realistic training tool, I feel like a veritable machine on the operating table! What's more, it turns out I didn't need my right arm anyway!\n\nIt can get awfully dull down here. But now at least I've got the confidence to take my new-found expertise into the wider community, and it's all thanks to Surgeon Simulator 2013.\n\nInterested in the field?

It is about manipulating a hand in minute detail using overly-specific controls. To wit: you can rotate your wrist, raise and lower the arm, and contract each finger separately. This hand of yours, you use it to manipulate objects in your environment to remove internal organs and replace them with new ones. In the process, hilarity ensues.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this, and I actually do think the emergent comedy of my in-game physical ineptitude is amusing, it's just not that fun to play. A lot of trial and error as I try to figure out which awkwardly held item is the best one to use to remove X-bit of anatomy, then awkwardly moving the arm around to get the correct grip on the tool, then awkwardly hacking out the bit. A lot of awkward manipulations going on, and at some point I'll mess up, or hack at the wrong thing while trying to hack at the right one, and the patient will bleed out, and I'll have to do it all over again.\n\nI can see someone having fun with all this.

Ask anybody that owns it about why they bought the game and they will most likley say "Because it looked funny". I think the only reason you would buy this game is due to the fact that it looked freaking hillarious to see a scalpel jammed into some poor man's eye. I mean, who really want's to buy this for the pure challenge of preforming sugery on a patient? I would assume you want to buy this as an escape from the daily life, to the inner realms of video games where everything that happens is supposed to be a fun experience, and I think it does this fairly well.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI think that the gameplay is pretty hard, and the fact that it is hard is just the point of the game. The devs as gamers thought about the most annoying things you could implement, and afterward implemented them. I think that the devs never expected this to be a really good game that people played and speedran just due to the fact that it was only intended as a quick laugh and nothing more. When it comes to the Pros and the Cons of the game I don't like adressing them just due to the fact that as previously stated, the cons were intended for the end product long before the release of the game. I can't judge the gameplay of this as it really depends on your sense of humor and expectations of what a game should be.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSince this game was mainly to make a funny statement about something, I don't feel like you should even consider playing it like a real video game, but to play it as a form of comedy that you may come back to after a hard day of work. To actually play it as a fully fledged video game is just foolhardy, and if you want a FAIR challenging experience, I wouldn't really recommend it in any way shape or form. 100%ing this thing was really pointless in the whole scheme of things, and in all honesty it ruined the experience of ever playing a game like it again. I think if it's on sale (which it usally is) go for it, there is no crime in laughing at a fake man's misery, or doing psychologically questionable things to his organs, however, I urge you to never ever play it like a real game, but to only ever play it as a silly satire on the "Simulation" genre of today...\n\nSide Note:\n\nIf I could give this a "Mixed" or "So-So" review I would use that instead, but alas I am stuck with the current steam system of reviewing something.","July 15, 2015","true","37.8"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

You use three keys to flex your fingers, and spacebar for the thumb. Left click can be used to move the arm up and down, while holding down the right button controls the rotations. There are items which, when you grasp near them, sort of “stick” to your fingers.\nThe amount of content in the game is a little sparse, you can finish everything it has to offer in a couple hours. There are 3 main procedures, 3 variants to these operations, and 2 extra missions. After you have completed all of these there is only the fun of goofing around with the game to add to play time.\nThere are also several bugs, like the hand got stuck in the table and you have to restart the operation. Sometimes the syringe does not work. Also a frustrating thing is that if an item falls a little too far on the table, you have to restart, because you can not reach it anymore.\nSurgeon Simulator 2013 is not a brilliant game, but a brilliant joke, in the form of a game.\n\nSounds 5/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 4/10\nAtmosphere 6/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","February 17, 2014","true","13.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","0"

There are a lot of stupid things that you can do with the patient and I found both playing around with the patient and completing each of the surgical operations really enjoyable.\n\nBarnardshire had a couple of surgery options available. Unfortunately Bob had a lot of ailments which left him no choice but to have heart, kidney, and brain transplant. As Nigel, you'll have to do all the operations in different environments. As you go on and become more dexterous you can make Nigel become practically licensed. I had the most difficulty getting A++ doing the brain transplant inside an ambulance, paying attention to what happens in the environment can really help in making Nigel the best surgeon in the world.

Do not vote for this game, I said, for it is just monkey cheese nonsense being sold to dumb internet people.  But somewhere between not enjoying the demo and receiving the full version, this game grabbed me between it's shaky noodly fingers.  Between the awkward controls and the wonky physics is a game that actually works under it's own weird set of rules.  Sure you might drop a fresh organ or two on the floor, or lose a couple out of the back of a moving ambulance, and oftentimes it won't be your fault, but at the same time you'll likely just nod your head and realize that it's just another facet of the game and reload, ready and eager to take another crack at Bob's insides (was that one entire sentence?)\n\nPoint being, this game is a celebration of the human condition, and a real testament to courage and the power to overcome obstacles that seem impossible.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll make your janitorial staff quit out of protest, but most importantly you'll learn to love and live.

You wanna know why this game is so popular?  It's because of all those Million+ viewed videos of people screaming in frustration as they try to hack past a sternum and kill their patients.  It's another game like 'I Wanna Be The Guy', but the controls are purposefully horrible instead of being purposefully designed to kill you every second.\n\nThis isn't a game you play for good fun or trying to be a real surgeon.  Surgeon Simulator 2013 is a joke app made by a bunch of chuckle ♥♥♥♥s in a very short time and is kind of a hollow gimmick once you get past the awful controls.\n\nThe hand has a VERY limited range of motion, it can't turn any objects to any kind of natural position for precision, it's sluggish like you're moving through molasses, the hand lags a half second behind the mouse, and it's incredibly hard to grasp anything in your fingers without stuff flying all over the place and putting them in a worse position or out of reach.  (My arm actually started getting tired from trying to meanuever the mouse so much.)  This thing will be what you will control the entire game with from the Menu screen to the dozen or so surgeries you'll have.\n\nYou also have to do it under a time limit as the more you cut and crush drains your patient of blood and you'll very soon have a countdown timer (blood loss) till the patient dies.  Get ready to start pulling your hair out as this exercise in frustration will leave you cursing at the screen for a long time like why the god damned hand doesn't grasp anything properly.\n\nI recommend looking through the Diskettes on the main menu that you can pop into the Commodore computer.  They show you shortcuts on how to more effectively cut the tiny arteries, scooping intestines, etc.\n\nThere's not much content outside of the bare stages where instruments are strewn about.  You're a single surgeon inside an operating chamber and you have to perform a transplant of some kind in several different environments.  Heart, kidneys, and brains in a surgeon's ward, ambulance, and space.  There's a Team Fortress 2 level that's ripped from the Meet The Medic trailer and an alien autopsy.  That's it.  There's nothing else to do except try to go for a highscore, but it's worthless.  Once you're done, you'll probably want to quit the game and uninstall it.\n\nI get the "joke" of what this game is.  It's like a trainwreck made of organs and flying utensils, but the controls aren't worth it.  Avoid this crap.","January 23, 2014","false","5.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Poor controls are taken as a core design philosophy and buttressed with any restrictive obstacle that came to mind. This is not the hilarious but humbling exercise of realizing how difficult complicated basic movement really is, this is a constant fight against a game that not only has to struggle to understand what the player wants it to do but also has trouble preventing objects from phasing in and out of each other. The lesson this game has to teach, what it demands of its players, is that they put aside the anger born of uncooperative controls to practice patience and precision in a world that has none. It's quite clever really. Shame all that's left to look back on is annoyance after annoyance, which increases level by level in the name of some sense of progression.","April 2","false","16.6"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","24","41","2","7"

But worse;\n- You may fulfill your sadistic instincts by killing your patients with surgical tools;\n- You may hit yourself with your own anesthesia syringe, which will make your vision psychodelic.\n\nCONS:\n- Controls are awful, VERY awful. Five keys on the keyboard control the closing of your fingers and the mouse will control the movement of your hand, just like a remote-controlled robotic hand would be;\n- There's no automatic adjustment of the objects to your hand, which means that you'll pick up objects any way you can, they will never be in the right position and will easily fall from your hand, again similar to a mechanical hand;\n- Your arm is always in the same horizontal position and will get in the way often;\n- If you drop something on the far corner of the table or let it fall to the ground you can't reach it anymore, it's lost forever;\n- It's too difficult to succeed, but possible if you try very, very hard and have a lot of patience (I don't);\n- Your patients are completely sedated and won't react to your sadism in case you like this kind of thing;\n- Your patients basically die by blood loss (there's a blood counter measuring how near it is to death), so whatever you do will have the same effect. The only difference is the speed of bleeding.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nInitiallly fun because of the absurdities, but infuriating thereafter.

Why?\n\nFirst have a look at this video: https://youtu.be/t6wyFRLe4X0\n\nNext, let me explain some of the things about this game:\n\n1) Glitchy collision models. Your hand and instruments will always keep getting clipped inside something or something gets stuck inside your hand or between your fingers. VERY frustrating when going for the challenges/achievements.\n\n2) Operations are 50% luck when it comes to finding the right spot where to cut. You can easily spend several minutes trying to find the spot you need to cut to proceed. Most frustrating being the eye transplants, where you need to stab Bob in both eyes with a scapel for example, but good ♥♥♥♥ing luck trying to get it in the eye, since it's apparently random when it decides to go in. The angle, force, position of the eye, NOTHING like that matters. The scapel goes in when it wants because ♥♥♥♥ the player. And don't even get me started with the Corridor -operations, where the RNG decides what you get next as random trolleys pass by, which BTW do NOT respawn the instruments that have fallen off. Good luck if they spawn clipping inside eachother and thus just exploding everywhere!\n\n3) Speaking operations and challenges, how can the Hell can you still have a game with such glitchy achievements? 180 spoon flip? Nah, barely 20 degrees did it for me. And don't even get me started on the achievements that fail to realize that you've completed them. And the biggest insult in challenges: "I can see miles... per hour." First the description: "Complete the eye transplant in an ambulance in 1 minute and 60 seconds." What the ♥♥♥♥ even is that? Did the devs REALLY fail with even a simple task of writing a DESCRIPTION?! If they can ♥♥♥♥ up even a simple description then how can they program the challenges, let alone an entire game properly?!\n\nI could go on with the flaws this game has, but I don't think the devs deserve the feedback.\n\nI will complete this game to show that I did manage to beat this piece of ♥♥♥♥, but NEVER expect me to buy a single game from Bossa Studios EVER AGAIN!\n\nYOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME WITH YOUR LACKING PROGRAMMING!\n\nEDIT----------\n\n9th of February 2016:\n\nCame back to tell you that I have now reached 100% completion of this pile of junk. And let me tell you people, the inaccuracies are everywhere, especially in the Alien Operations! I also realized how much this game relied on YouTubers by adding achievements and alien organs after them. Yeah nice marketing trick you got there: make an organ or achievement after a YouTuber to have them play the game and get free advertisement.\n\nBut let me tell you people, the amount of relief when I saw the last achievemnt pop up and then hitting "Delete Local Content" was much better than actually playing this game.\n\nTata and good ♥♥♥♥ing riddance","February 7","false","28.7"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","21","38","6","1"

This game is an incredible amount of fun, though if you're squeamish at the prospect of flying digital guts and blood...well why are you looking at this game?\n\nBut in all seriousness, the style is smooth and visually grabbing, the controls only mildly frustrating when you're on a time crunch (Use two hands, Nigel!), and the enjoyment factor is up to extremely satisfying. My favorite bit is that it even includes a side mission related to my favorite game Team Fortress 2, which if you haven't played, do. The menu is also them most uniquely extensive I've seen, and so much fun to interact with. Warning: You may become so distracted you forget there's an actual game attached.\n\nThe only time Surgeon Simulator has frustrated me was when I was going for a couple of especially difficult achievements, but even then I still liked it. I mention this because if you have patience issues, you may find less enjoyment in it than I did, but I'd still urge anyone to try this game.","December 23, 2013","true","8.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040868056/recommended/233720/","76561198040868056","ZuTheSkunk","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040868056/","181 products in account","Surgeon Simulator is one of these short joke games where the core of the gameplay is the hilarity that stems from overcoming intentionally awkward controls and buggy physics. You play as a newbie surgeon - or to be more precise, a clearly disembodied hand - who has to successfully complete various surgeries despite being clumsy as all hell.\n\nDon't look for any kind of anatomical accuracy or realism in this game - ripping off the patient's organs and throwing them on the ground just to get to the one organ that needs replacement is a regular practice in the game, and the mission is considered completed if you manage to throw the new organ onto the spot where it's supposed to be. Even if said organ falls out immediately afterwards while the game merrily displays the success screen (which clearly suggests that the patient wasn't going to survive one way or another). The only thing you have to worry about regarding the patient is making sure that the blood level doesn't reach zero. And yes, you can still finish the mission even if the patient is left with as little as 1 ml of blood. This game exists to be a source of dark humor, not to be realistic.\n\nYou are given plenty of tools to accomplish various tasks and it's only up to you to decide what is going to be useful. Obligatory scalpels, various saws for cutting bones, drugs that either slow down or speed up the blood flow, and even axes, hammers and drills. Many of them, more often than not, are going to be only a hindrance in your desperate efforts, blocking your way to the actually important tools, bumping into the patient and making him lose blood, or even getting you high. And that's just the beginning.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game isn't very long; there is 9 levels total, plus 2 hidden, and the exact time it will take you to complete them for the first time will vary depending on how badly you'll be initially doing. There are 3 kinds of surgeries in 3 kinds of environments, so at some point you'll end up in a situation where, for example, you have to do a brain transplant in an ambulance that rides on a bumpy road, with the objects jumping up at random and the back door opening from time to time. Probably the funniest moment you are going to see in this game is successfully completing said surgery and then watching as the brain you just put in the patient's head falls out right away and ends up on the floor or even on the road. The mission is still accomplished, so who cares!\n\nSurgeon Simulator is the kind of game that you either just can't stand, or love coming back to it despite how badly it frustrates you. And yes, after the initial hilarity wears off and you get better at playing it, you'll most likely start seeing the game's frustrating elements more and more. Probably the biggest one of them is how it can be a pain in the butt to actually grab things; there's NO indication whether you actually grabbed the damn object or not, usually resulting in you spending some time on the ritual of pressing the buttons to grab something and then raising the hand to see if you actually grabbed it.\n\nAnother problem is that the game gives you next to no information on how various things work. There is no tutorial at all; the only thing you get is the info on how to control the hand, which is displayed on the computer in the main menu (and the said menu uses the exact same hand mechanics as well, to make matters even better). The rest you either have to figure out yourself (most likely failing numerous times before you successfully complete a surgery at least once) or just Google things up. The game DOES give tips on certain things, but that's only AFTER you completed a surgery, and only if you figure out that you can put floppy disks into the computer in the main menu. And let me tell you, doing so can be frustratingly hard as well, since the computer will only accept them if they're perfectly aligned.\n\nIn the end, Surgeon Simulator is a little curiosity that some people will like, and some people will hate. My recommendation is to first play the demo provided by the creators of the game and see how well you'll do in it. If you'll end up loving the absurdity of the game, then I think you'll like the full game as well. But if you'll instead end up getting frustrated and/or freaking out over the patient dying, then I think you're better off giving up on this one.","June 26, 2014","true","48.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you press the keys you really think that you're, in fact, the hand that performs the surgery. The funniest part of the game is trying to use the tools, maybe if you watch a gameplay You will probably say: "Seems easy, I don't know how this idiot can't use a drill", well It is not so easy as it looks.\nThe idea of the game is not "have a good game story", It would be most like: "There you have, a human being, kill or try to heal him, good luck".\n\nIt combines a hilarious theme and the seriousness of a surgery, having as a result this masterpiece. That's what makes this game one of the best inde games that I've ever played.\n\n9/10","December 1, 2013","true","13.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's a creative mix of artstyle and cartoony fun, with an amount of education on human anatomy tossed in. It's hours of entertainment, because the game isn't meant to be played seriously. Nobody stresses themselves to be A+ grade surgeons and get the best times. People play this for the limitless ways you can either succeed or fail the ridiculous surgeries!

But  actually it's not that interesting at all.\nI only enjoyed it in the first 3 minutes by making some hand gestures like showing the middle finger.XD  Then it frustrated me when I began to give an operation and I decided not to waste any more time on it. I didn't play it for that a long time, most of which was hung by idle master.\n\n-lack of guidance\nAt least there should be some description about some specific items else it's difficult to know that the green needle tube can slow the speed of hemorrhage. However, nothing is explained or stated. Usually you need to watch videos of how others finish the operation or you may feel confused.\n\n-awkward and dumb controls\nI know that the developers intended to make the controls like what they are in the game now and it's also the key factor to increase the difficulty. But it's really frustrating and time-wasting. The aim of this game is to give people pleasure in my opinion. But that weird physics would deplete your patience. It would cost a lot of time to pick up a item, then the process of aiming and operating is another terrible experience.\n\n-glitch collision\n\nThis game fails to express its black humor and fun due to the dumb gameplay. It sucks and don't buy it unless it's in a charity bundle.

I became a alcholic doctor that had five shots of whiskey, half a bottle of vodka, seven beers, a bottle of rum, and drank almost two bottles of scotch."\n- Wise words from a near dead homeless psychopathic drunk that you play in Surgeon Simulator 2013\n\n\nLet's start this review from this totally silly and insane game, with the difficulty and gameplay.\n\nGameplay: This is hard. It's really flipping hard. My friends told me Fallout 3 was hard, but in comparistion it Fallout is like playing any Call of Duty game on easy mode. I do not recommend this game if you do not like hard games. I dont like this game very much. It's way too hard for a person like me. I shouldn't have to give you a warning! This game is about having to do surgery with one hand and having no one to help you. Remember what I say about the difficulty before buying this game, you little psychopath, you.\n\nSoundtrack: Amazing. Just......why wouldn't you like the soundtrack? Please go die in a nuclear fire if you dont like it.\n\nArt style: I love it. Nigel's hand kind-of looks like the medic's hand in TF2. There is actually a TF2 styled level! You're the medic and you replace the heavy's heart, just like in the Meet the Medic trailer. And.....it's harder than I thought.........So...yeah.\n\nWhy shouldn't I get this game?\nThe only reason I can think of is....again....is that this game's really hard. If you're like me, I enjoy sawing through peoples bones, but the blood goes quick and cutting through the bones and kidneys and hearts and lungs is really hard to cut through with one hand. But if you think you're a good enough doctor to do it with one hand. Go right ahead.\n\nWhy should I get this game?\nIt's silly, original, and you get to show the middle finger to your soon-to-be victim.\n\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game because it's something new! Something funny and silly! Get this game if you have bought the other awesome games of the sale. There may be better and more fun games than this, but this game will keep the glued to the screen for some time.\n8/10\n\n*Gaben voice* Thanks!

I'm still stuck on the first task: controlling the damn thing. Before I'm told to get better at it, let me say this. This game is very similar to QWOP, as in the controls are meant to be very difficult and the game is not meant to be taken seriously. However, QWOP is free. This is $9.99. I bought Bastion, one of the best games ever made, in sale for about $2.00 (I can't remember the exact price. Sue me). Speaking of the controls, the difficulty here is more artificial than anything else. Let's compare this difficulty to another difficult game- Super Meat Boy. I think JonTron says it best: "[It's] ball-renchingly difficult, but you know what? The controls are so tight that if you mess up, it's entirely on you, and that feels good. It's great. Difficulty isn't the problem. Cheapness is." Say you're doing the heart transplant and the heart gets stuck in the ribcage. Cheapness. That's one word that actually sums this game up pretty well.

I found it quite trivial thinking it'd be like another generic simulator game, being fun at first and getting boring later. That had apparently not become the problem.\n\nI had bought this game when it first came out. It was at $15 and I thought to myself, "Wow, that's bloody expensive! This better be worth it.", and ever since that day it had been the best $15 I've ever spent.\n\nThis gave me hours of enjoyment and something to relax with even though it may cause a lot of frustration and anger, it's quite relaxing knowing that you go in without any sense of wanting to complete the game for the story (since it has no story). The game is best played in company of others, while others may either see you fail the operation or complete it, it will either make them all laugh or praise you as "THE GOD OF SURGERY!".\n\nWatching Rooster Teeth's Michael and Gavin play the game together had given me an idea, playing the game with 2 players where 1 controls the fingers and the other controls the arm would make for a great party game or challenge. As it proves the synchroniation between 2 people for the greater humor or the professionality of the pair.\n\nWith everything said, I would recommend this game to all people who are looking for a game to enjoy with friends and company of other people.","July 13, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's not to be taken seriously, but the player has to be really skilled if they want to complete all the surgeries.  I enjoyed my short time playing SS2013, but the Ambulance Operations are way too difficult for my skill level, and couldnt even complete the first scenario.\nThe controls are awkward crappy, I've never encountered such a scheme in my life, but that's the way the developers intended the game to play.  Graphics are exactly as they should be, not too realistic, but bloody enough to still gross people out.  Amount of tools to use doing the operations are also a plus.  Since I have very little knowledge of the medical field, I have no idea what the best instrument for each job is.  I pretty much had to guess which scalpal to sever an artery.\nOverall, its a fun game, and if you buy it on a sale, you will get your money's worth.\n6.85/10.00","June 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was it trying to be sincere and doing a horrible job at it, or are the difficult controls a part of the joke? Thankfully it's the latter. This isn't surgery like a true surgeon would do... it's more like what I imagine an alien were to do if it found out its pet human needed a new organ. Just start jamming tools in there, removing everything that's in the way, then casually putting a new organ where the old one was.

But studying 6 years before they let you kill people on the table is too long? Can't wait that long? Well here is your solution: Surgeon Simulator 2013 lets you control  a whole left hand (!) with which to save / end the patients life! If you think you got the hang of it: Forget it, here comes the ambulance operation! If the G-forces of the racing ambulance are a mere joke to you: Forget about gravity, operate in space! And now they have even added Alien operations!\n\nThis game is really fun to play and really hard to master. The first hour is extremely fun because the game is quite silly. So if it's on sale, go grab it, it's worth a good laugh! Beyond that, you can spend hours trying to improve your performance during operations in terms of blood loss or time elapsed. And there are some other cool achievements to get in this game. For example: Do you think it's hard to flip a spoon 180° and catch it again? Now do it in a clumsy surgeon sim!\n\nI honestly can't compare this game to any other game I've played before, but what I can do is recommend you give it a try!\nBecause if you don't like it or your surgery is going ♥♥♥♥ up, you can still let off some steam by taking a hammer and bash your patients skull in! =)","January 12, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Have you ever tried to do anything with that arm while it's still dead, like turn off the alarm?  Replace the alarm clock with a patient and lots of sharp implements (and also an alarm clock!), and you have Surgeon Simulator 2013!\n\nI bought the game for about the cost of a sandwich, which seemed fair.  I certainly got more fun out of the game than I would get out of a sandwich!\n\nedit: Look up the RAGE QUIT youtube video for Surgeon Simulator - it's hilarious, and some of the achievements are based on it.

Was it trying to be sincere and doing a horrible job at it, or are the difficult controls a part of the joke? Thankfully it's the latter. This isn't surgery like a true surgeon would do... it's more like what I imagine an alien were to do if it found out its pet human needed a new organ. Just start jamming tools in there, removing everything that's in the way, then casually putting a new organ where the old one was. Done and done.\n\nIf you love dark humor and a serious challenge, pick this game up.","August 28, 2013","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the cool thing is, once you get used to the controls, you can actually try and do procedures as quick as possible.It's nice use of AWER and Space actually feel pretty comfortable and better than something like QWOP. You have a grading system that grades your performance based on how much blood was lost, and how fast you did it. This offers up the way to figure out what tools to use, and when to use 'em. For what music there is, it's nice background noise too. The Team Fortress 2 DLC was a very nice addition, and it makes me think this game also has pretty good DLC potential.","January 7, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not something you will grind hours away in but it certainly has potential to keep you entertained.\n\nCompleting the operations isn't too difficult itself, completing them with half a degree of competency (by game standards at least) is another problem entirely. Half the battle is the controls, with the other half being lack of depth perception. Let's just try and cut tha... oh god please stop bleeding!\n\nI don't think it's quite prepared me for a career in surgery, but it has taught me that an axe is perfectly adequate as a medical tool and you don't really need to all your organs to live!","March 5, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, good enough to motivate me to create new content that will be largely ignored.  Some say it's a one-joke game that stops being funny after 15 minutes.  This is incorrect.  It has multiple jokes, and I laughed for at least 45 minutes.  The main joke, of course, is the concept of a clumsy surgeon, which is hilarious.  That's what the official trailer shows you.\n\nBut there's something the trailer DOESN'T show you.  After the joke gets old, after the laughs have died down, you'll find something quite unexpected: that you're actually getting kinda good at this.  Your brain is no longer fighting against the controls, but rather working with them.  And what you're left with is Surgeon Simulator 2013: the gratifying test of dexterity, where the life of one man repeatedly hangs in the balance.\n\nLet's get down to business.  Is it worth having less money in exchange for being able to play SS2013?  Yes.  Because $10* is less than $400,000**.\n\n*or $2.50 if you bought it on sale\n**roughly the amount of your med school tuition loans","June 24, 2014","true","30.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not to be taken seriously, but the player has to be really skilled if they want to complete all the surgeries.  I enjoyed my short time playing SS2013, but the Ambulance Operations are way too difficult for my skill level, and couldnt even complete the first scenario.\nThe controls are awkward crappy, I've never encountered such a scheme in my life, but that's the way the developers intended the game to play.  Graphics are exactly as they should be, not too realistic, but bloody enough to still gross people out.  Amount of tools to use doing the operations are also a plus.  Since I have very little knowledge of the medical field, I have no idea what the best instrument for each job is.  I pretty much had to guess which scalpal to sever an artery.\nOverall, its a fun game, and if you buy it on a sale, you will get your money's worth.\n6.85/10.00","June 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the thing is, you don't want to let them have a go because you're too busy hammering away at the patients rib-cage to even notice your friends are in the room.\n\nWhen you've only got a little while to spare, you'll find yourself opening up this game. Whilst the storyline is a little outrageous, the amount of fun that you'll have getting used to the controls and getting stuck right into a heart transplant (warning: contains no medical accuracy, whatsover!) far outweights the outrageousness.\n\nThe developers have given it a bit of a sense of humor too, even the title menu is a game all in it's self! There's secret missions, and hilarious achievements everywhere, waiting to be found. Just for the love of god, don't drop your wristwatch or a scalpel into the patient, it's a bit of a pain to get back out again.\n\nAnyway, usually I'm not a massive indie game fan, but this is utter brilliance. I've seen the price drop super low during the sales for this game, and I bought it myself at the lowest price I've seen yet, but I'd happily pay more than what I already have for this game, and that's saying something!","December 25, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not to be taken seriously, but the player has to be really skilled if they want to complete all the surgeries.  I enjoyed my short time playing SS2013, but the Ambulance Operations are way too difficult for my skill level, and couldnt even complete the first scenario.\nThe controls are awkward crappy, I've never encountered such a scheme in my life, but that's the way the developers intended the game to play.  Graphics are exactly as they should be, not too realistic, but bloody enough to still gross people out.  Amount of tools to use doing the operations are also a plus.  Since I have very little knowledge of the medical field, I have no idea what the best instrument for each job is.  I pretty much had to guess which scalpal to sever an artery.\nOverall, its a fun game, and if you buy it on a sale, you will get your money's worth.\n6.85/10.00","June 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, good enough to motivate me to create new content that will be largely ignored.  Some say it's a one-joke game that stops being funny after 15 minutes.  This is incorrect.  It has multiple jokes, and I laughed for at least 45 minutes.  The main joke, of course, is the concept of a clumsy surgeon, which is hilarious.  That's what the official trailer shows you.\n\nBut there's something the trailer DOESN'T show you.  After the joke gets old, after the laughs have died down, you'll find something quite unexpected: that you're actually getting kinda good at this.  Your brain is no longer fighting against the controls, but rather working with them.  And what you're left with is Surgeon Simulator 2013: the gratifying test of dexterity, where the life of one man repeatedly hangs in the balance.\n\nLet's get down to business.  Is it worth having less money in exchange for being able to play SS2013?  Yes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/recommended/233720/","TrevorJr","Trevor Jr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/","356 products in account","I would recommend buying the base game of Surgeon Simulator if you have been thinking about it. It is great fun and actually quite addicting, plus the achievements for this game are simple yet challenging enough to make you want to complete all of them. Or at least it made me want to try and get them all. The soundtrack is so good that I bought it (available on Bandcamp) and the game itself is really well optimised. So by all means buy the base game.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe new 'Anniversary Edition' content for this game I cannot possibly reccomend. The menus are completely changed to be more touch friendly and less mouse friendly, which is actually quite a big deal when you have to manually push each button with your virtual hand. The 2 new surgeries are pretty finickity and dull compared to the old ones, and for some reason they don't look half as good. Although this could be due to my next point. There is a new extended options menu in the DLC, this gives you all the options you would expect for a standard PC game. But, for some reason the new setting lag the game to crap. On the base game there was low, medium and high graphics settings. On my 3.2 Ghz i7 8GB ram PC I could run the old base game on high without any lag issues or slowing of any sort with no noticable drops in FPS. But with the new DLC the game lags even on the lowest settings, and the highest settings don't look half as good as they used to. This for me is the biggest problem with the DLC, it must have been shipped out in a hurry with little to no optimisation.\n\nThere's a new corridor mode and lots of new achievements (which you have available even without the DLC, making it impossible to 100% the Steam achievements without buying the DLC) but really this expansion has ruined the base game for me and after playing it for an hour I uninstalled the expansion all together. Unless there is an update pretty soon I'm going to be hoping Austrailia's court case for Steam refunds goes worldwide, and then ask for one myself.\n\nBase game 10/10\n\nExpansion -10/10 (because it also ruins the base game)","August 31, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Try and pick up the phone sometime, and you'll get a funny call from one of Nigel's friends. The best part of this game is the surgeries. "Takes someone's lungs, intestines, and ribs to replace a heart. I think the patient will live." The absolute neglect of carefulness with the patient (Bob) is hilarious. But hey, you can lodge a drill into a guy's skull, and that's always fun (I am not a murderous psycopath)! I highly reccomend this game.

YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO BE IN CONTROL OF A SOBER HUMAN, YOU PLAY AS NIGEL BURK, A MAN ADDICTED TO PILLS.\n\nHence why he has drugs on his desk (pills) and why you can inject yourself with the hallucinatory drugs during the operations.\nIf you still feel like I don't know enough about this game, I can tell you that I have all of the achievements :/\n\nI definately reccomend this game, it's long, it takes a while to learn, and it's fun. Slamming radios into people's ribcages is fun. Drilling a hole in your patient's head is fun. Making your patient a timelord is fun. Getting every mission A++'d is fun.\n\nThis game is fun. I reccomend it especially with the new update for the anniversary coming out.","August 13, 2014","true","144.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once, on a sunny spring day in grade school biology, I eagerly tore at a nugget of owl droppings. Then I moved on to the frog dissection. There the frog was, splayed out on the table, its limbs pinned down and ready for some scalpel action. A chance I had been waiting for, to cut some intestines open, a snip there, a stitch here, and "voila!" the frog would be healed from its current state of death, and it would go hopping off into the stream by the soccer field. A skillful procedure done with nerves of steel and a steady hand.\n\nThe abdominal cavity of said frog was some parts liquified, jelly-fied, and stank of formaldehyde. I didn't know what was what, or how the damn frog died in the first place. Thoughthe spaghetti-like mess of bowels covered my hands, I kept on cutting. Years later, I wondered if this is what Dr. Troy from Nip/Tuck felt on the day of his first scrub-in during his 3rd year surgery rotation. My own private practice plastic surgery center was in sight, with the lambo sitting outside. Finally, the last organ plopped out of the gaping incision... the frog remained dead with guts everywhere. I ended up with a D+ in biology that year.\n\nThat's what playing Surgeon Simulator 2013 felt like.","June 21, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nothing works. You can barely pick up a pencil from a table. What's more, the collision physics either sends things flying or has them slip away, even when you know what to do. That Jurassic Park Trespasser game from years ago already "blessed" us with a similar sort of absurd interface as it asked players to kill dinosaurs, so there's only one remaining course of action: perform transplant surgeries with zero in-game tutorials or instruction provided until after you've already succeeded.\n\nThis is absolutely not something you want to go to Youtube or GameFAQs for instruction on when you're stuck. That'll just ruin the game for you. For SS2013 is a game about screwing things up royally and not really minding too much that you've done so. In fact, most of the "achievements" are granted based on ridiculous ways to screw things up, not succeed. For although you're presented with all sorts of tools to go about your task, most of them are either useless or actively detrimental.\n\nNormally, this would all make for an atrocious experience. But the "Simulator" of the title is a complete and absolute lie. I originally had a paragraph elaborating on this, but the joy is seeing for yourself. Originally made in 48 hours, the "2013" version of this game was made in 48 days. The absurd novelty of it all it seems to be part of a slight swell of indie "perform mundane tasks in goofy fashion" games. There are 8 operations total, but only 4 unique procedures. Naturally, the toughest one of all--the heart transplant--is what they have you do first!\n\nI paid $3.39 for this and got about 9 hours playtime out of it.

You know, the sort of game that you buy for a laugh, play it for maybe an hour or two and then forget about it. This is somewhat unfortunate, but inevitable being the sort of game it is since Surgeon Simulator is actually a brilliant idea. It makes fun of itself with the title, it's only barely a "simulation" of surgery so if you were actually expecting Trauma Center or something then... no. It's not that. It's more like a skit on Surgery, there's no real tutorial, you're just flung into the surgery room armed with whatever you can pick up, no experience, you just have to perform heart surgery on this poor sap.\n\nOf course, once you get into the mindset of "this is a game about having a laugh" the game instantly becomes fun, if a little frustrating at time. It all comes down to the control system which is unique to say the least, you use the A, W, E, R, and SPACE keys to control the fingers and thumb of the surgeon's hand, the mouse is used to rotate the hand and move it around the operating area. You have to literally pick up the tools you think you require to operate on your unfortunate victim and use them appropriately, be it a bonesaw, a scalpel, a hammer, whatever.\n\nSurgeon Simulator isn't a game that I would pay full price for personally, but it's a great buy in the sales if you want a truly new experience in gaming.","January 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
