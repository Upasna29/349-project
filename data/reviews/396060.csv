It's only a couple of minutes in legth and you are done so you are paying over a $1/minute  If you see it on sale, say 50% or more off, then I would definently say check it out.  There are much better expierences at this price point and below.","April 7","false","0.1"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","33","47","2","2"

It's padded out with floating objects which in vr is the norm, and there's literally no story to it. Had high hopes for this - the trailer is basically the 'game'.\n\nIt is beautifully done though, and if it had been longer and more involving probably would have paid a little more for it, too.","April 14","false","0.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkido/recommended/396060/","rkido","|AZ|Rakon Kido","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkido/","465 products in account","The moment 'The Rose and I' started I knew it would be a fine example of a VR short movie, one that I would be happy to show off to others. It immediately felt right, because it takes advantage of the fact that you're in VR. Everything feels so present and three-dimensional. The texturing of the world is well-detailed, not flat and boring. I see interesting things happening where ever I look, and in particular, the main character and surrounding scene is made far more interesting by walking around it, peering into it, looking up close to it, standing farther away. Importantly, it takes place at a scale that viewers are not accustomed to when viewing a short movie, making it far more interesting than some of the other VR short movies that have been released this month, many of which could have just as well been traditional 'flat' experiences.\n\nI haven't even talked about what actually happens in 'The Rose and I', and there's a reason for that. Frankly, I'm not even sure what happened, or if anything really happened at all. At this early stage in the life of VR I'm unconcerned about such things. I was too busy marveling at how novel everything felt -- at how the authors really nailed the feel of a VR movie short -- to actually notice the substance of what happened. That's not a bad thing at all.","April 23","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not a game, but just a really nice short VR experience. Great to show off VR to non-gamers.
