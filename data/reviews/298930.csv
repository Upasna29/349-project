"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Otru/recommended/298930/","Otru","Otru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Otru/","75 products in account","Darkness Within is the most tasteful Lovecraftian-horror game I have ever played.\nThere is no tacked-on 'insanity' mechanic.\nThere are no jump scares.\nThere are no guns.\n\nBut most importantly, there are no references to Lovecraft's work in poor taste. The only direct references to him are in quotes on loading screens, and a single easter egg. His influence otherwise is purely sentimental, yet quite palpable in the atmosphere of the game's various domestic, occult, and dreamlike environments.\n\nThe developers at Zoetrope Interactive did not shoehorn Lovecraft's most popular motifs into their game, although it could be argued that the general formula of the narrative is quite Lovecraftian, and the exposition definitely is, but I believe it comes into its own. Anyway, Zoetrope has created a narrative with less-direct horror than any 'survival horror' game. This was executed through their implementation and pacing of the horror.\n\nThe environments in the game are beautifully detailed, both technically and atmospherically. Howard's apartment and office, and the houses that he investigates, all feel genuine and lived-in, and evoke a mixture of being comforting and cozy, yet quite off-putting. The dream sequences that partially take place in these environments are therefore very surreal, in that they blend these mundane, familiar environments, with bizarre, and horrifying encounters.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341437450\n\nThrough this detail, and the surrealness which follows, almost all of the game, not just the horror sequences, left me feeling uneasy. This uneasiness was accentuated as Howard begins to have trouble differentiating dream from reality.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345226810\n\nEspecially off-putting are the few encounters the player has with other, seemingly inhuman entities. These encounters are sporadic, and mostly quite indirect. With the exception of a single instance, Howard only ever encounters these 'things' either in his dreams, or through a crack in a wall. Therefore they never pose any real threat to Howard. Which might leave you wondering, 'How could they be horrific?'\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345226745\n\nAnd like good, primal horror: it's in the utter obscurity of the encounters and the things themselves, the already instilled fear from the context of the encounters, and how few encounters there actually are, that makes the game horrific. This is important to note because horror is about the build-up, and the obscurity. If scares are frequent, or the things that are scary are able to be studied closely, then they become so much less effective. And thankfully Darkness Within doesn't fall victim to either of these issues. It overcomes them more effectively than any other horror game I've played.\n\nAll of the circumstances are so well built up, that this infrequent horror is something truly unique for a 'horror' game. It is actual, Lovecraftian horror at its finest; it is morbid curiosity resulting in a brush with something, without ever really knowing or finding out what. The second factor in good, Lovecraftian horror is the irrational compulsion to continue, regardless of prior experiences. This narrative device manifests in solving the puzzles that are entailed in the central mystery of the story.\n\nThe puzzles are cleverly developed, and effectively intertwine the narrative and storytelling. This is executed in all of the clues for puzzles being hidden in pieces of writing, and various minute details that are quite believably strewn throughout appropriate places in the environments. I could list all of the detailed connections and implications made through the puzzles, dream sequences, texts, and other discoveries throughout the game, and how consistently they've been intertwined, but I would prefer to recommend you go and experience them for yourself.\n\nAnother important aspect of the puzzles is their believability. The presentation of just about all of the puzzles is so plausible that only a single puzzle in the game left me frustrated at its absurd specificity. Otherwise, the puzzles flow into eachother with excellent fluency, and the way they manifest prior exposition demonstrates the developer's forethought. Through this, they're engaging, compelling, and literally always directly and importantly entailing the narrative.\n\nI speak so confidently in my description of the puzzles because I developed that description directly from the puzzles themselves. Due to the density of the primary puzzles of the game, it would be redundant to give a necessarily detailed description of something better experienced than described.\n\nConcerning the narrative, if you plot out what actually occurs in the narrative, and remove it from the context of the game, then it may not sound all that impressive. It may sound like a Lovecraftian fanfic. But it's not the plot in itself that makes the narrative shine. It's everything above; the presentation, and faithful fulfillment of the criteria of Lovecraftian horror; that makes the story so special.\n\nNow, as I said, I won't list all of the positive, detailed connections and implications made throughout the game, but I will mention one very particular criticism I have of one very particular puzzle.\n\nThis puzzle is second-last in Clark Field's house, and entails quite the spike in difficulty. My main issue with this spike is the obsoleteness of the established mechanic of 'Howard's Mind.' Howard's Mind can piece together thoughts, clues, items, and observations to progress through puzzles by deducing solutions semi-automatically, so long as the player provides the correct clues. It's established as an important mechanic, but is frustratingly and suddenly not able to be utilized in Clark Field's home. And while it's occasionally useful throughout the rest of the game, it pretty much stops functioning during this puzzle, which leads to a key discovery in progressing through the game. What this essentially means is that the player is expected to decipher a plausible, but ultimately poorly executed puzzle, which is key to progressing in the game, but without 'Howard's Mind' to give them any guidance. Which was a very big issue for me when Howard is bombarded with numerous, meaningless, potential answers. It's a tedious puzzle, and is more needlessly than actually complicated.\n\nThere is also the minor complaint of an awkward inventory. It's annoying to deal with once Howard has amassed so many items that you need to scroll through it, but to be honest it really doesn't impede much otherwise.\n\nThe game's ambient noise also seems to be contentious. While I understand how the piano, creaking floorboards, and other noises can collectively seem overbuilt, I feel like they're most effective when they come apart. I agree it can be a little silly and overwhelming when everything is playing at once, but when those noises pause for a while and all you're left with is the ambient drone of the environments, it's worth it. It's how realized the isolation of Howard is at that point that's so striking. It's not necessarily the sounds themselves, but what they leave behind.\n\nApart from those last few points, the game is a very seamless experience.\n\nIf the name Lovecraft only brings to mind Cthulhu, the Shoggoth, Deep Ones, Innsmouth, etc. Then this game probably isn't for you. This game doesn't treat Lovecraft like a meme. It's a very respectful work after Lovecraft. It's also a game with an outstanding level of detail, which I would recommend to anyone impressed by such things. And if you have an actual appreciation for the style of horror and queer stories that Lovecraft, and other prolific writers, such as Algernon Blackwood and Ambrose Bierce are known for, then you are this game's target audience.","November 13, 2014","true","74.2"," 198 of 221 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","198","221","0","0"

Lovecraft, Supernatural Horror in Literature\n\nHere I was, a bit bored and a bit biased about the marriage of a point & click adventure with the theme of horror, but Darkness Within 1: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder was a spectacular experience! I've spared 14 hours or so, discovered every achievement, read and re-read every single document, practically poked my nose in every single pixel in the game; but I am still paranoid about missing a piece of the great picture, as any Lovecraftian theme should make you so...\n\nIn this gem of a Lovecraftian setting, you play as Howard E. Loreid; a detective that investigates the strange murder of Clark Field, a wealthy man involved in the dark art of occult. The prime suspect of the crime is a man named Loath Nolder, a famous private investigator and an admitant of the local insane asylum. Our game starts with a nightmare, and a phone call coming from our partner, Arthur, in the middle of the night. We're informed that Loath Nolder has escaped...\n\nThe game takes brilliant twists and turns, and forces you to investigate odd objects coming from forgotten times, secluded buildings that no one visits and isolated areas of the local geography with dark histories. The atmosphere is carefully arranged to procure a balance between the uneasiness that we feel from a partially observed shadow that lingers in the night, and the raw sense of dread that we suffer whence we face the plain unexplainable. Environment is a huge success to create that lingering, uncanny feeling that haunts us when we are reading a random narration excerpt taken from H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. It actually uses direct characters and anecdotes from Lovecraft stories like The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Whisperer in Darkness and The Rats in the Walls.\n\nGameplay carries two major features that makes the investigation process noteworthy. As you observe events and the environment, you take mental notes in your journal as ideas, observations and suspicions, alongside conversations. You are to pick and add the relevant ideas together to make a thought process to grasp the insight of happenings. This progress of deduction presents the player a unique gameplay. Nothing is presented to you on a silver platter: you actually have to think like an investigator to decide which evidence might go with another to indicate a fact. Another feature is about the documents you stumble in the game. In these kind of games, the gameplay usually presents you your next objective just after you read the document, automatically. Here, you underline the part of the document that you think to be relevant or important and think about it! I mentioned hard work, didn't I?\n\nIf you do sincerely enjoy the horror genre - not your common jump scare, or plain human cruelty: an actual sense of gothic that will keep pushing your buttons to keep you awake at night, you MUST try this game. It is brilliant as an adventure, astonishing as a horror game. Plus, it is Lovecraftian!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","July 25, 2015","true","14.5"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","58","63","0","6"

But as you begin to track his whereabouts, you start to wonder what is real and what is not, halucinating, seeing and hearing things as you travel through locations finding and picking up clues and solving puzzles.\n\nIf you like point & click games and you like mystery and horror, you will find a good combination here.\nIt's a good game.","November 14, 2014","true","0.1"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","0"

One of the best adventure games available.  However, this point may not be obvious on the first playthrough.  It's actually fairly difficult, which may drive some players to a walkthrough.  That's unfortunate, because playing this game with a walkthrough is a terrible idea.  The game's two strongest points are the story and the atmosphere.  Both are fantastic, but excessive walkthrough use can ruin your understanding of the story.  The game should be played with a mindset of truly trying to understand and solve the mystery.  That will require reading and rereading the documents you find several times.  But doing so is extremely enjoyable once you finally begin to grasp what's happening.  If you get towards the end and feel that you have no idea who any of these people are or what's happening, you've missed a LOT.  But putting the effort into exploring and understanding is extremely enjoyable.","January 11, 2015","true","19.8"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","1"

Loreid who is trying to solve the murder of Clark Field and right at the top of this list is none other than Loath Nolder.\nAs you progress through the game you will become part of what seems like a routine investigation but this will take strange twist's and turn's.As you uncover clue's and find out more on why Loath has done what he has done,why he disapeared and just exactally why this case will become so important to Howard and what effect it will have on not only his life but his sanity as well.\n\nDarkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder Trailer - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4K05VGycRU\n\nOk down to the brass tac's of the game and first up the most important element the story,now the developer's Zoetrope Interactive really have tried to capture what make's H.P Lovecraft's work's at one a journey into madness and also a horrific vision of thing's that just shouldent be and sometime's they succeed and get it spot on but sometime's (sadly i might add) they just havent.\nNow i say this as i remember when this game first came out (November 6, 2007 to be exact) i really did take to the story and its twist's and turn's but on playing it again and looking back on other game's based on Lovecraft's work's (Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened and Call of Cthulhu : Dark Corners of the earth) i think that this game lack's something that they seem to just have in abundance...................that Lovecraftian feel.\nThe sound in game is a highlight and really does do a good job of setting the scene with chilling noise's seeming to come from the shadow's and the music does hold its own against other games from this genre (there is one moment however that just doesnt seem to fit in the game,trust me once you hear it you'll know what i mean).\nThe graphic's in game are well done and some scene's look just like painting's (until you move your point of view of course),and each place you visit has its own feel and is different enough from the last that you will allway's want to explore a new location.I found myself wanting to move around like in some modern 3D free roaming adventure's (like in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter) but sadly that is something this game lack's (whereas Call of Cthulhu and The Awakened offer this and neither of these are modern games).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341796814\n\nAnd last but by no mean's least gameplay now this take's a few form's in game which include's exploring new area's,puzzle solving,cracking codes,dealing with locked of area's (some of which need to be unlocked) and whilst some of these can be easy to solve others can be a true nightmare (due to the game's way of throwing some obscure puzzle's at you).\nThe two that differ the most however are the ability to combine your thought's to create new clue's and lead's (like a famous detective would do-right Mr Holmes) and also underlining clue's in article's and paper's you come across again to provide new clue's and lead's.\nPutting your thought's together to unearth a new lead or clue can work but on the most part you will find yourself putting them together only to find that it just doesnt work and you have to try again "AARRGGHHHHHHHH".Even underlining things to gain new insight can be a little hit and miss with you choosing word's that you think are usefull to the case your on only to find out that their not and you need to find another word alltogether "AARRGGHHHHHHHH".Both idea's should would work well and its a shame that they both havent been implemented better (like in some other game's).\nNow this is part one of a propossed three part trilogy and having played the second game (which came out on the 28 May, 2010) i allready know that one uses a first-person perspective whereas this game play's out in a more traditional style (like MYST),the second game is due on STEAM soon and i will be reviewing that one when it's released and i have replayed it (to be honest the second game does benefit from playing in that style and actually play's better than this one does)\n\nDarkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage Trailer - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0CospHxFwU\n\nSo in game you will experience thing's real and unreal (also thing's due to the game and its engine you dont want to) and never know which is which but allway's know that what ever it is thats going on it isnt good (AARRGGHHHHHHHH),as why do day's pass instead of hour's when Howard sleep's?????\nWhat’s real and what’s not,and why couldent the thought and underlining work better in game?????\nAnd that is the journey we are taken on as we walk along side Howard and experience this whole nightmare from his point of view (for better or for worse),is he going mad,are the thing's he see's real will he find the two thought's to put together,or is it all just one huge nightmare that he will eventually wake up from?????\nSo in closing why am i recommending this game then as some of the gameplay element's just dont work as well as they should and it doesnt capture the Lovecraft feel i was looking for completely????\nOK here goes....................................even though it has these bad point's (that as a Lovecraft fan) i just cant ignore i am on the fence and to be honest i enjoyed this game more than it actually got on my nerves (WELL FROM READING YOUR REVIEW I AM SHOCKED),which is funny as reading the review you would think that i really didnt enjoy my time with this game (I JUST SAID THAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME).\nBut just like true Lovecraft that's where the twist lies as "Memory sometime's make's merciful deletion's" (and that's what happened to me whilst i was playing through the game i seem to have blocked out all the negative point's and focussed on the positive one,which is for all its faults i actually enjoyed playing through it-allthough i must admit i wont be doing so again in a hurry)\n\n(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEO'S PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNER'S AND ARE THEIR'S BY COPYRIGHT)","November 22, 2014","true","10.8"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","46","58","2","6"

The graphics are a bit pixelated on high resolution but nothing major. The character models on the other hand are very outdated unfortunately. They are pretty rare but can break the immersion for a little bit.\n\nThe strongest point of the game is its atmosphere. Along with the story they give the eery sensation that you can have when you read some of H.P Lovecraft's work. It deals with the same themes of blurry frontier between natural and supernatural. With madness often being a better outcome than trying to comprehend what lies beyond human perception.\n\nThe story is mostly in written form. Plenty of books and notes to read and re-read to understand all that the game has to offer.\n\nThere are two gameplay mechanic that I mention below which I found interesting but also very frustrating at times. It is a warning of some sort:\n\nThe first mechanic is the ability to combine not only object but thoughts. Thoughts are short description of major and minor events, which can be obtained by clicking somewhere important or underlining phrases in texts. It can become overwhelming since you can combine from 1 to 6 thoughts and/or objects. It can be a very heavy game of trial and error.\n\nThe second mechanic is the underlining of important clue in books or notes. It can be partially disabled in easy mode but it doesn't show hidden clues (if there is one) in a text. The hardest mode give no hints but you can underline any text (as opposed to a select few). In a book with more than 3 pages it is quite difficult to find them. The interface does not help by requiring one click for switching cursor to underlining at the far left and then clicking on the Think button below it after the underlining on the text in the center. On books with many topics, finding the one that the protagonist care about with such a system can be frustrating.\n\nThe object bar is classic and doesn't get in the way which is nice.\n\nThis game is also kind of a preface and first chapter to the second opus which is completely different in its gameplay.\n\nRecommended, mostly for the atmosphere. Difficult game but rewarding with the right mindset.","June 17, 2015","true","13.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The inclusion of the latter should perfectly fit the context of a game about sanity; unfortunately the implementation is a bit disappointing -- the mechanic becomes cumbersome and frustrating, particularly by the end of the game when you have collected dozens of clues to sort through (I would have preferred a system where only unresolved clues stay active and the others are simply archived for narrative reference).\n\nMy two biggest complaints would be the endgame (narrative threads fray and split over the course of the entire game but never come back together to provide a satisfying conclusion... this is almost entirely left for the sequel to deal with) and the occasional lack of direction provided to the player (there were a number of times where I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing or why).

Be aware that this is not the type of game that creates horror through letting you run away from creatures because you don’t have a weapon. Unlike its successor, the game has no WASD movement. There are a lot of scary scenes but the game has much more to offer. Lovecraft is a selling point of many today’s games but Darkness Within is one of the few that really fits the mood and suspense of his books.\n\nOne of the most innovative aspects of this literary horror game is the thought system. By linking the character‘s thoughts and underlining important parts of texts, you find new clues that keep you progressing throughout the case. Solving puzzles and reading (well written) texts are the main parts of Darkness Within but if you are willing to spend some patience and attentiveness, you will intensely enjoy this game. While some puzzles might be frustrating, most of them are logically integrated into the story. On the lowest difficulty (there are three to choose), the game helps you with the texts and gives you tips when you are stuck.\n\nZoetrope did a good job in creating a credible protagonist that is anguished by fears and social isolation. The voiceovers (also the non-English ones) are well done and the ambient sounds perfectly capture the mood of every scene. The CPAGE engine might be outdated but has some nice lighting and particle effects that make the various locations – especially the dream sequences – very atmospheric.\n\nThis game is qualitatively in line with other first person adventures like Scratches, Outcry or Barrow Hill.

Maybe almost too much. If you want to play a game where you are the main character in an HP Lovecraft story, this is it.\n+ Very immersive. The mood is consistently creepy, and solving the mysteries in front of you almost feels realistic. The game sidesteps some of the traditional Point and Click cliches in favor of making things more realistic. (For example, you don't randomly pick up every object you see because you are going to need it for some convoluted reason later on.) For sure, this game gave me the feeling like I was really in the story.\n+ Very good story.\n\nCons:\n- Although the game's problem-solving is normally pretty realistic, this makes the game very hard. Remember how I said the game won't let you pick up some innane object that you'll need later? This means you have to remember where it is and come back for it if you need it. You'll spend a lot of time searching the same areas over and over looking for clues or small things you missed. This game would be very hard to beat without consulting a walkthrough at least once or twice.\n- I love the game's emphasis on having to read things in order to put clues together, but the mechanics of making you underline important clues in the documents doesn't work very well. It's very hard to see what the game will consider a relevant "clue."\n- Overall, the game can be quite frustrating, and it is very easy to get stuck.\n- The story is unresolved, making this game more episodic than standalone.","January 26","true","12.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

That being said, here's how I rate it:\n\nStory/Atmosphere\nThis is "Lovecraftian" or "Lovecraft-inspired" but it's not actually a rendition of any of Lovecraft's works that I know of, it's an original story, which is fine. But the game still manages to be more faithful to Lovecraft than CoC or other mythos titles! That's because, like other peple have pointed out, they don't resort to jump scares or: "hey look, a Deep One! Oh my god isn't that scary?!" Which I personally feel CHEAPENS Lovecraft's stories. But you do get glimpses of unknown things, like an actual H.P. protagonist. The game is very atmospheric, you'll be clicking your way through empty (??) mansions and other locales, wondering if you're actually alone in here as you find more clues.\n\nGameplay\nYou don't move with WASD, you click your way around & you click on everything. The puzzles on Day 1 & 2 were pretty straightforward & most players will probably speed through the first part of the game, but then things start getting more and more obtuse and harder to solve. But nothing really stood out to me as a "WTF were they thinking??" moon-logic puzzle. Sometimes you might get frustrated because the character won't do something you think you're supposed to be able to do. In that case, you probably need to trip an event flag, and that most likely means using the "Think" feature where you combine 2 clues that you've found to deduce a new clue from that.  "Investigating" documents was pretty neat, that means when you read (some of) the files that you find throughout the game, you need to manually highlight the important info from within the text so that the character gets a new clue & can make more progress.\n\nFinal Score 8/10  Overall very good, I liked it but maybe 1 or 2 frustrating puzzles and the game is a little short. Oh, and also you sometimes have to REALLY scour every inch of the environment to find an item, that 's a little frustrating too!\n\nIf you don't like point-and-click games, or need your games to have lots of action then you're for sure not going to like this.","November 16, 2014","true","15.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

At points throughout this game the atmosphere was almost tangible, oozing from my monitor, gripping me within its eldritch grasp. The puzzles and thoughts kept my mind racing, jumping from conclusion to conclusion, waiting to uncover the next secret or clue.\n\nI am all praise for this delectible slice of true lovecraftian gaming, but one does feel it necessary to point out some of the flaws.\nIf you don't like lovecraft, this probably is not the game for you. This game is Lovecraft to the bone, even crediting him as the creators biggest inspiration.\nThe graphics. Now if unpolished graphics are enough to put you off this game, then you sir are a fool and i already know that you would not enjoy this game. But yes, the graphics and 3d models aren't the best, but that does not detract from the experience in the slightest. Hell, i'd even say that the unnaturalness of the charcter models adds to the creepiness.\nKnowing where to go next. Occasionally you can be left stumped. You've found a clue, YOU know where you want to go due to thinking ahead, but in the game you haven't found the exact clue that the game wants you to find. Having to double check everything is tedious.\n\nOne small problem I had, which i intend to remedy, is the shear number of loose ends for instance I know that Arthur was something to do with the cult, but i couldn't find a way to follow up on this. .But I'm sure going over parts again would clear these up.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this. Nothing new to Lovecraft fans, just the same cliches, but they're the same cliches we know and love. Difficult though it may be, the story is intrigueing and I couldn't get enough.

I have to say that I was a bit let down by the ending, but still thoroughly enjoyed the game. The atmostphere and creep factor was great. You have to play a ways into the game to really get to the good stuff. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the genre.\n\nIf you like point and click mysteries, especially those in the horror genre, this game is for you. There are some decently scary scenes in the game, but it's really more about immersion and atmosphere. I find myself completely immersed in this game, badly wanting to unravel that next thread, but also dreading where it might take me. It will keep you playing. Most of the puzzles I've seen thus far aren't trivial, giving you a feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve them.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that I've run into a bug (I think). When I click on something to zoom in (like a statue or calendar), it zooms correctly for a split second, then the camera immediately moves to the left and zooms way in, cutting out the thing I'm supposed to be looking at.

Very old school, very atmospheric. Just one minor problem can hamper your enjoyment. You have to search and underline keywords and phrases in the documents you find. Howard also collects his thoughts which you can then combine in a system I call "think tank". The system itself is fine and you can finish the game without finding all the keywords and phrases and combining all the thoughts and clues. However if you want to get all the achievements and uncover all the secrets, the game requires you to go through all the documents several times, in A GIVEN ORDER, otherwise it won't let you underline certain keywords. Several times during the game I found myself AHEAD of the main character, just because I figured out the solution or plot points in advance thanks to the obvious keywords I was not able to underline and thoughts I was not able to combine, because the game did not want me to YET.

A complex and compelling story builds around you in the form of newpaper articles, books, notes and your interaction with various strange and interesting characters. The puzzles are not terribly difficult, but do require you pay attention to the information you gather on the way.\n\nA few gripes: There is an item and information combination mechanic present that isn't explained very well in-game, so some Google-fu is required. Some of the areas are also a little too dark (even with Gamma adjusted) and you may miss things if you're not careful. This is also the first in a trilogy and while you can find the first two on Steam, it seems the third game was discontinued in 2014 (having played only this one so far, I'm not sure where that might leave off the conclusion of the story).

This game has lots of it, I daresay it's at least as lovecraftian as Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the earth. Especially in the beginning you can barely make a step without finding a Lovecraft or even a Poe reference - a madman who escapes from an asylum, a town called Wellsmoth, a protagonist called Howard, a poet called Pickman, a book with incredibly lovecraftian short stories and poems which was probably written by the developers (amazing work!), darkness, fear of the unknown, a secret cult, a raven, a "volume of forgotten lore" and a detective story. Seriously, it can't become more lovecraftian than that.\n\nBut then there's the gameplay. Most of the riddles are ridiculous. You sometimes have to find hints by reading (very long) documents and underlining the right info. Sometimes you don't even know what you are searching. Sometimes you have to come back to a document you read 2 hours before, because you can suddenly underline information you couldn't underline earlier because you haven't triggered it by finding information in another, completely unrelated document (at another place) you didn't even know you had to find. You can't even take these documents with you - that's backtracking at its worst. Sometimes you don't even find these documents because you can't click them even though you are standing right in front of them - because you aren't standing at the right position.\nI also had a bug where an item vanished from my inventory, so I had to edit my savegame to be able to progress any further.\n\nI really don't see how one could be able to finish this game without a walkthrough. There is an activatable hint feature, but it usually only gives you hints when you don't need them or they are just plain useless. "There must be something in this house that helps you find the solution" - thank you, but in which of the 10 rooms did I miss something? Reading long, boring texts over and over again without even knowing why isn't fun at all, even though it's quite the charm of being a detective.\n\nTalking about being a detective, the story disappointed me a lot.\nYou have investigate in the case of a man who was found dead shortly after descending into a well under his house. According to the info you have he found something and wanted to get rid of the house immediately - so obviously the game starts by finding the well and climbing down. Oh, and there really is something, and shortly after the "real" story starts because you don't know whether you are mad, whether you are dreaming, whether you are a sleepwalker, whether you are whatever. You get suspended, but you keep investigating in the case.\nYou keep meeting people and finding information that make you think "Damn, I really want to know what this is about!"\n\nWell, none of these question get answered. You don't find the resolution of the case, you don't find out who these people are, you don't find out what the thing in the well was, you don't find out what happens while you are unconscious (which happens several times), you don't find out what your nightmares are about, you don't even find out what's the matter with Loath Nolder.\nI know it's part of the charm of Lovecraft's works that several things stay unresolved, but this game doesn't resolve anything at all. And this is why I don't recommend this game at all, because after the struggle with these horribly designed riddles I'd at least expect a good ending.\n\nIf you love Lovecraft as much as I do, give it a shot, but don't forget looking for a good walkthrough before you do. Otherwise you probably won't be able to enjoy the partly exciting story which is almost TOO lovecraftian.","March 12","false","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

I loved how it ended. However, some of the game mechanics made it rather difficult. The most difficult mechanic is using the think boxes where you have to put clues together in order to come to a conclusion. While interesting on paper, this mechanic added another level of difficulty to an already somewhat difficult game. This game does not handhold you through the story and I found it to be somewhat difficult to determine where I was supposed to go at times, eventually referring to a walkthrough because I was so frustrated. Only to find that I was simply to continue to go back and re-review a letter or book that I had already seen.\n\nIf I had to decide to play the game again, I would purely because the story was so entertaining and thought provoking. However, would I play it again after knowing what the story is? Probably not unless I was really bored and had nothing better to play.\n\nI would recommend this game for a seasoned adventure/point and click gamer who is interested in analyzing the text and  a mechanic that you need to use to decide what to do next and advance the story.","February 18","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The key to the Darkness Within is to immerse yourself in its narration. Otherwise you shall never complete it.\n\nThis is a good example of a game where the abscence of our beloved entities and bloody episodes is just what we need. For although someone tries to reflect Lovecraft's  novels by spilling blood over the walls, I think the best way to introduce people His world is to show them a mystery. No violence and gore  and strong language what is suitable for children under 12 years old  . Darkness Within makes you reveal what is hidden.\nThe atmosphere is truly fantastic, I can almost feel what's intended to - chill, thrill, the smell of old books and mould.\nI give it 7/10.

The plot stays true to Lovecraftian fiction if you consider the main character's struggle and even more so if you consider the second half of the plot. The puzzles and clues to solve them are unique and interesting and are sure to intrigue players. The environment is also creepy but I regret to say that there is no sense of an immediate danger so that creepiness dissipates quickly.\n\nHowever, it suffers from some dated graphics, confusing user interface, some typos (there are some typos in the in-game letters), and some unsolveable puzzles. The character's designs are notably dated however you rarely run into NPCs in this game so it is not that intrusive on your experience. But the user interface will annoy you primarily due to the way you inspect and combine items. Additionally, some puzzles may be too difficult for the casual gamer.\n\nWhen I played this game I frequently consulted walkthroughs because it was my first point-and-click mystery game and I did not have the patience to backtrack and search. So keep in mind this game requires patience and attention to detail otherwise you might be frustrated if that is not your cup of tea.\n\nYou might notice that the end feels rushed and I think this may have to do with the publishing company Lighthouse Interactive going out of business before the game could be published. Also, the development team for this game wasn't too big since Zoetrope Interactive consists of three people. So keep that in mind if you feel like criticizing the game. But regardless it's an enjoyable game that is relatively cheap and you have nothing to lose by buying it if you like point-and-click games.","August 14, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main thing that drives me to finish games (because I have a pretty short attention span and patience) is the story. If there is no story, then I can't really finish the game.\nWell, the story was excellent during the majority of the game. The fact that it ended without some conclusions is what really killed it for me.\nDon't ready any further if you haven't played the game and plan on playing it since the following points contain some spoilers:\n\n\n-What happened to Loath Nolder? Yes, we find him but then that's it. His voice sounds weird and then zilch.\n-Who was the random prisoner guy? At first I thought he was Nolder, then Edward, now no clue. And what was the purpose of having him there? (I can surmise some guesses, but it's just that, guesses.)\n-Why does it matter that Howard's friend, Arthur, refers to Edward in the same way that Ivar.. (or whatever, I.B.) does? I mean Howard makes a point, to ask the question, "where did I hear him being referred to as an 'old fool' again?" I guess it could just be that we were supposed to link that particular letter and the identity of the person they were talking about in the letter, but the way that it came off I was thinking, "OH Snap! Arthur's involved!"\n-The ending where we don't really know whether Howard has gone insane or not is totally fine with me. I'm okay with open ended, are they crazy or are they not kind of movies/games, but I just wish those other things above were sort of just answered.\n\nAnyway, it's possible that there were explanations in the game for all my points above and if that's the case, please comment and explain those things to me.\nSo, I would originally have rated this game a 3-4 out of 5, but because of what felt like an underdeveloped/incomplete plot, it's 2. All that time spent on the game, to reach the conclusion and get some sort of explanation aaand... Nada.\n\nWith all that being said, I think I would still recommend the game to people who are really into Adventure games. I would warn them that they may not be satisfied with the incomplete plot though.","December 2, 2014","true","18.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Well, I wouldn't call it terrifying but it certainly builds an uneasy, creepy atmosphere wherever you go. However, at times I was laughing at the graphics and sound effects (one area actually has "woooooooo" ghost noises!) but hey, it entertained me!\n\nThe puzzles are challenging but doable (although I confess I did cheat a couple of times because I'm impatient!). You have to be very particular at times, not just vaguely heading in the right direction. This can be frustrating at times but it depends on the type of puzzle gamer you are!\n\nOverall would give it a 7/10: Interesting story, good atmosphere, but sadly lacking in replayability and graphics are a bit outdated.","October 3, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are many games with the genre like horror, survival horror etc etc but this game has it's unique genre of it's own which i would like to call as "THE LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR". After having read plenty of Lovecraft's wierd tales i decided to plunge into this game to see how it's like to be actually inside of  one of his tales. And to my astonishment this game actually do capture his theme to a very good extent. Now as a gameplay wise there are puzzles to be solved, places to be investigated, notes to be read and studied. You will have to work with the patience to enjoy this game at it's full potential. Don't go around speed-running through the whole game. Now it would sound stupid but the best part i've found in this game is finding diffrent notes and reading it because it's basically your part of the storyline, off course you get the plenty of cut scenes but those notes which you find as letters, diaries or as fragments of news papers are just amazing. And yes one more thing, it's got good sound tracks which suits perfectly to the lovecraft theme.The main menu sound track reminds me of one of Lovecraft's best tales called "The Music  of Erich Zann". And have i mentioned that it's the "LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR" game?! And that alone is just more than enough.","February 16, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are ok, but hard to see at times because they are all so dark. This is a visual novel kind of game, where there aren't many choices to make and isn't much you need to do- it's about following the story and gathering information about it. If you go everywhere and click on absolutely everything, you'll be fine. Or use a walkthrough and those might or might not make your experience better, depending.\n\nThe UI is absolutely maddening- everything is point and click. There are no keyboard controls. You need to open envelopes and such, but there is no indication of how to do so. A phone is ringing, but the one right next to you doesn't do anything when you look at it, click on it, etc. It will take you several minutes to realize there is a second phone you need to find and pickup in order to check your voicemail. You'll spend 90% of your first 2-3 hours of this game figuring out how to do simple things, which is just stupid. Whomever developed this UI should be beaten.\n\nIf you can be patient with figuring out how to do simple crap and you can manage to not smash your computer on your driveway in frustration, this is an entertaining Lovecraft horror visual novel.

Beware, there is no jump scares and nothing related so don't buy this game if you want to get scared. The horror is implied in the atmosphere, and I was surprised by how much it got me immersed. Voice acting is a gem but appears only in a few dialogues, which is a shame. The sound is another strong point in this title. The only con I can think of is the playability (took me about five hours to complete).

So instead of thinking and getting meaningful feedback, it's more like madly combining stuff trial-and-error style.\n\nBook researching is a bit silly too, since the game decides for you what is "interesting" and what "is not", but you of course could not know at the moment.\n\nThe fact that everything is a very static, somewhat low quality rendered model, and action is very crude and rare, does not really help too.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, but the abysmal gameplay kills it in the end.","May 31, 2015","false","10.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

While it has some interesting ideas and a good atmosphere of horror, I found it much more difficult than many of the adventure games I've played.  It really gives you no goals, no hints, no ideas on what you're supposed to do next at all so you just sort of stumble around trying to figure things out by trying things at random.  After a couple of hours fiddling around and trying to figure out what i was supposed to be doing I gave up.  I'd like to recommend this game, it's an interesting concept, but I just can't.","May 3, 2015","false","39.9"," 20 of 44 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","20","44","2","0"

I bought this game desiring, a scary, lovecraftian, point-and-click adventure. A scary mystery game would have been good enough. What I got was not at all scary and had a convoluted story expressed through shoddy English, overzealous sound design, and an annoying UI. The puzzles were decent though and all the clues necessary to complete them could be found through thorough play. The graphics were also surprisingly nice, not counting the character models, which look like something out of the early X games.\n\nThere are some slightly tense moments in Darkness Within, but none of them are really scary and the sound design is a major culprit behind this problem. The ambient sounds are way too busy. It seems like there is a creak, the sound of somebody walking, howling wind, or distant talking every 5 seconds and though this may be alarming for the first thirty minutes of gameplay after that all the ambience does is drown out scripted sounds that actually might be scary if the player was not vaccinated to mysterious noise by all the random sounds constantly being generated.\n\nThe main problem with the story is that a lot of threads are created, but by the end of the game only a couple of them, and the obvious ones at that, are resolved. The game ends way too abruptly, I guess because the developers want you to buy Darkness Within 2, but in that case they threw the bait way too soon. Also, the story is told through long texts written in poor English. I can tell the developers did not use a native English speaker to translate and in a game all about reading huge walls of text and extracting clues therefrom, good grammar is a must.\n\nThe last big problem with Darkness Within is the UI and I am mainly referring to the inventory screen. The player only gets one row of slots for inventory items. By the end of the game, after many items have been collected, this becomes a problem, because one must slowly click arrow keys on the sides of the inventory row to reveal needed items. The reading screen also has a huge flaw. The arrows that control paging are at the very bottom of the screen. Coincidentally clicking on the bottom of the screen exits the reading UI, so if the player is not careful he can easily put the book away instead of turning a page by accident. This quickly becomes tedious. The last big flaw of the UI is the item/thought combination doohickey. When the player puts items into it those items stay there unless the player manually, tediously, puts them back into the annoying inventory row. Even when the inventory is closed, items stay in the combiner. All of these technical issues slow down an already slow game.\n\nOn a scale of 1 - 10 I give this game a 5. I made it through and enjoyed some of it, but it was nothing special. I won't be buying the sequel.","November 17, 2014","false","10.0"," 15 of 42 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","15","42","0","0"

The main question is: Developers, critics, publishers, vendors, please explain me - Why don't you add to the description of genres of such games the word PUZZLES??? Usual description of such games is "Adventure" or "Point & Click" but this is incomplete description! You must think where to point and where to click, how correctly to combine and arrange found things together. You must THINK in such games! You must SOLVE THE PUZZLES in such games. And in the section "Key Features" of this game there is written "Dynamic Puzzles and Features – Traditional adventure game puzzles..." So why don't you add directly the word PUZZLES to the genre of such games, please? Now the world "Adventure " is rightly added to genre description of Shooters, RPG, Tower Defense etc. That's right! Which movies are described by the world "Adventure"? Such movies, where are chases, shots, wild dangerous animals, natural cataclysms etc. So, please, add to description of such games the word PUZZLES. (May be also Quest, but it's optional).

Some of the puzzles are just so vague that you're left wondering where you're meant to go next. Also, some of the investigating can be a bit misleading. For example you can click on and inspect things which would help you in the story, but can you actually take and use them? No. Or rather you can, but you have to wait until later when the game finally prompts you to use said item.\n\nDespite that, the story is very compelling, creepy, but not really scary. The atmosphere has a sense of foreboding and oppressiveness about it, like any good Lovecraftian tale should. The game's atmosphere does a lot with very little, something it should be recognised for.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who wants a creepy point and click game, or anyone who appreciates a genuinely unsettling story that Lovecraft himself would be proud of. Also, at the price this is currently going for I don't think you can go wrong.","February 10, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
