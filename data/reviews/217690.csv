I spent a few hours banging my head against some of the puzzles, as even though you're given a LITTLE direction, it's not enough half the time. If you're looking for a pretty game, this is it. Anna has it's own DRM, along with Steam, which some might find obnoxious. I forced myself to 100% it, alot of it in offline mode.\n\nI would have to give it a 4/10, it did spook me a few times and give me the "WTF is that?! OH ♥♥♥♥" moments. The story could of been a bit more fluffed, and the puzzles given a little more direction. I spent most of my time, wandering back and forth in areas for a bit trying to find that TINY clue I needed to move on.\n\nI recommend googling a "Walkthrough/How-To" for this game when you get stuck, or go slowly your first playthrough. Pay attention to every tiny detail.\n\nMy opinion on the matter, this game could have been more.","May 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 119 of 150 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","119","150","0","0"

Sounds like it has a lot of potential right?\n\nBut let's talk about the controls.  There's idiotic things like not letting you escape out of your inventory by hitting ESC.  You have to hit "I" again.  And then there's the inventory itself.  It's very awkward where you have to scroll through a bunch of stuff you have.  The interface could use a lot of work.\n\nAnd now let's talk about "pixel hunting".   You know what's frustrating?  Going into a dark room with a bunch of items scattered about the room.  The thing you want isn't an more noticeable and hidden a certain area and it looks just like all the other stuff you can't click on.  So the only way to find it is to move your mouse over every possible item on the screen.  Ugh.  I combed rooms and missed things before and I had to use a walk through a few times to find things.\n\nAnd now let's talk about the worst part of the game.  The puzzles.  Some make sense, many do not.   There's a very thin section of wall you need to break through.  Maybe use a stone or something?  Nope.  You have this metal gear piece.  Maybe you can use that to break through?  It's metal and looks fairly heavy, should bust through.  Nope.  I have a full canteen, that should be kinda heavy...  Nope.   Solution?  You gotta use a tree branch to break through.  A tree branch!  To break through a wall.\n\nYes, that makes sense, right?  The whole game is full of puzzles that barely make sense.   The other use for a tree branch?  There's a knife lodged in a wooden table.  You want that knife.  Your possible tools to get this knife blade out?  Your hands.  Nope, you''ll cut yourself, that makes sense.  An axe!  Let's just chop it out.  Nope.  A shovel?  Maybe you can whack it out or pry it?  Nope.  Ah ha!  I found a woodworking tool!  That's gotta be it.  I mean how else do you get a knife out of a WOODEN table!  HAHA YEAH RIGHT.  Obviously you would use a tree branch to get a knife out of a wooden table.\n\nGood puzzle games, when you figure them out, you go "AHHHHH!  That makes sense!  Why didn't I think of that?"  Anna, you can actually play with a walk through and be like "uhhhh, ok, I don't get it but sure whatever.  I guess it might make sense maybe?"  That's what made the Lucas Arts games so much fun.  You might have NO idea how to pass a certain part of the game but if someone tells you the answer or you brute force the answer you think "Oh my god, that makes sense!"  I remember in Monkey Island where I couldn't figure out what to trade the head hunter.  So I offered him everything in my inventory until it worked.  And when the item that worked was offered I had to laugh because it made complete sense once I thought about it.  Anna, I used a walk through heavily after figuring out how terrible the puzzles were.\n\nSo basically, do not recommend this game in the form it is in now.  Now, if they went through and fixed a bunch of things and redid a lot of the puzzles, I think this could be a very good game.   It's just fairly minor things that need fixing, but a lot of things.  Inventory fix would be very easy and then it's just fixing the puzzles.  It almost feels like it would only take a week or two of work to fix the game completely.\n\nIt's a shame too because I think the story and atmosphere is great.  If you are a HUGE paranormal / occult story fan, the game is worth playing for the story.   Just make sure to have the walk through available for you so you can just play through the story without any of the frustration.","November 15, 2014","false","3.0"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","90","113","6","0"

Who looks inside, awakens.” ~ Carl Jung\n\nThe first time I tried to play this game, it annoyed me a bit. Most beautiful atmosphere, sure. But the camera movements were lagged and inventory interface was downright annoying. I gave the game an hour or so, declared it as "meh" and quit to complete it for achievements on a later date. That was before I managed to get into the house. After my success, I learned that I couldn't be more wrong.\n\nAnna is a tragedy, adorned with a love story, a murder, a forgotten promise and the cult of the Sacred Feminine. Our protagonist is an esteemed professor of history who gives lectures at a university in Italy. Important to note that he is specialized in mythology and folktales - because this is where social sciences tend to present complications fitting for a horror story. Life goes pretty much ordinary - aside some vaguely disturbing and symbolic dreams that he has been having - until he finds an envelope in his closet which leaves him with a sense of uneasiness. He avoids the envelope like the plague until his assistant conveniently spills tea over it, making opening the thing a priority. Then, he discovers photos of him in places that he has no memory of visiting. And the implication of a woman being there. He takes a pause, and mumbles to himself: "Anna, how could I forget you, my love".\n\nWe learn all this information from our professor's notes, meeting him the first time where he stands outside of an abandoned country house in a secluded valley. This is the house that he's been dreaming of, and he intends to discover more about it at any cost. I warn you: this is a "be careful what you wish for" scenario and it includes many disturbing symbolic imagery, knowledge of the occult, and the versions of folktales that Disney wouldn't even touch with a 10 foot pole. So keep reading if you are interested in a kind of dread that Lovecraft would be much proud of.\n\nI wouldn't like to exaggerate anything, but the atmosphere is really marvelous and effective. Every detail is carefully put together to arrange the correct mood, empowered with symbolisms and background noises. Drawings and writings on the wall, lights flickering and beaming on furniture, random events and paranormal occurrences within the house makes you tiptoe, and jump at the tiniest of changes in setting. Yes, there are jump scares, but on contrary to a brutally gory display which we are used to, such events are presented elegantly with the usage of either uncanny symbolisms - concerning many, many weird puppets - or the usage of partial objects that would poke your unconscious with a needle like Silent Hill did back in the day. All of this is accompanied by the most beautiful soundtrack, full with suspense and emotion.\n\nAs for story, all events center the cult of the Sacred Feminine, where female force is idolized like a deity, or even a paranormal entity. I was astonished at the amount and authenticity of lore accumulated in this game. Story and atmosphere combined with the theme of survival horror, I think Anna as a more female oriented version of Amnesia: the Dark Descent. We have a flaw in memory, an abandoned settlement with occult on goings, appearances of most strange and disturbing phenomenon and a mystery to solve at all costs, mostly to our own inconvenience.\n\nAs for gameplay itself, there are much that lacks, I won't lie. There are books to collect and learn from, intuitions to combine, items to gather and puzzles to solve. Both without a basic background on at least mythology and an understanding of societal belief, the game would feel plain. Puzzles and most items do make complete sense only if you are already familiar with pagan customs. It is a feast to the ones who are interested in the lore, but I'd advice to skip this game for the casual horror game player.\n\nIf we are to be straight with the negative, controls do suck. Okay, you cannot go wrong with the tradition of WASD, but camera controls lag horribly, and mouse sensitivity is abhorrent. You basically go pixel hunting to grab something you are interested in, and I have been stuck with inventory bugs that makes it impossible to go through your documents for more than once. You save. You quit the game. You restart, reload. This is a thing now. Sorry.\n\nStill, if you are persistent enough to endure controls - you get used to it as a nagging spouse after a while - and set aside the 3rd Party DRM that belongs to Kalypso, it is a good game. As a market strategy, a 3rd Party DRM is a really bad call and I've read there are issues of lost CD Keys about this game too. If you are interested, I advise to play the game in a 3-4 days period, complete everything and get done with it, for being on the safe side.\n\nDoes it worth this much trouble? Most would say definitely not, but I'm still glad that I was stubborn enough to go through with it. The true ending - it has 8 different endings depending on different courses of action you may take - baffled me and made complete sense for me. I gulped down the rest of my coffee and shed a tear, knowing what this whole ordeal was about. A tragedy, a warning, a mistake to be corrected, a demon to be faced... Call it whatever you may. On a last word, I loved it. I loved Anna, the Sabot Maker and our poor professor. I hope you'd give them a chance to haunt your subconscious too.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 1, 2015","true","11.1"," 59 of 69 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","59","69","0","7"

After Three Years I have finally had enough of the intrusive (and highly glitchy) Registration Process every time I want to play this game.  I really liked this game but I have never before come across a publisher who deliberately shoots themselves in the foot to this degree by barring the customers from playing a game they paid good money for.  STEAM should do something about this highly suspicious (and creepy) company who are harvesting personal information and ripping people off in this way.\n\nEDIT......\n\nI had an important question about my review that I should share with the steam community.  There is no doubt that Kalypso are selling our personal information to third parties.   I got so exhausted from the glitching and inconvinience of the registration system that I created an email for no other reason than to use it for the registration process and nothing else. Sure enough withing days of doing this i started getting spammed from all sorts of buisineses and scams. The only people who ever had this particular email was Kalypso so they must be selling our personal information to third parties.  It should also be noted that I left that particular email fallow for a month before registering it with Kalypso to see if It would get spammed if I did nothing, It didn't. That was evidence enough for me so I quickly closed it down. I made my findings known and took exeption at what they were doing, I asked Kalypso for a refund which they refused.","January 24","false","15.1"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/217690/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Plagued by a sudden and insatiable urge to investigate a mysterious, far away sawmill in a remote, Italian countryside, a man tries to uncover the source of his fevered visions and sense of familiarity with a place he has no recollection of ever visiting, despite evidence to the contrary. His search leads him to unearth a gruesome history of the abandoned dwelling and its past inhabitants, and in particular to the story of Anna, a woman who seems to somehow be at the heart of it all. But to what end?\n\nA first person horror game set almost entirely within a single, modestly sized building, players are tasked with solving puzzles to both progress exploration and to reveal the story related to each room and/or the part the items involved in each puzzle played in past events. But the deeper you delve into the mystery, the more your sanity and reality are called into question as the world begins to change around you and conspire against your efforts. Presentation is stunning as the visuals, sound and overall design are the beating heart around which this games revolves and reason enough to play it through from start to finish.\n\nUI is largely intuitive but can confound on occasion as there's no explanation of its more intricate workings necessary for fully uncovering the story. In fact, that probably also sums up just about every aspect of the gameplay here. Satisfying and frustrating in equal measure, for every part of the game that there is to enjoy, there's also as many flaws as the puzzles and story become increasingly convoluted towards its conclusion. Since quite a few of the puzzles are based around performing rites and rituals, it means the player has no natural process of logic or intelligence to apply to the solution, but instead must pick up on the clues or directions provided by the game, which at times can prove annoyingly obtuse.\n\nBut don't let that stop you. Despite its shortcomings (one of the biggest of which is the unneccesary DRM which requires that you create an account with Kalypso Media in order to run the game. A process that feels incredibly archaic at this stage in our chosen pastime), that still doesn't stop it from being a worthwhile and gratifying experience, for nothing else if not for providing one of the singular most startling scares I've had in a game to date (mind how you go in the artisan room!). Anna - Extended Edition also includes the original game released prior to the free update which overhauled a massive amount of the game to include a myriad of new content and greatly expands upon the story and its surrounding lore. In comparion, the extended edition makes the original seem like a skeleton without its flesh and really should only be played after finishing the latest version just to see how far the game has come and how much effort developer Dreampainters went to in order to craft an experience that stays with you long after the credits have finished rolling.","November 26, 2013","true","16.9"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","52","66","0","0"

You have to login each time to play the game through their launcher. DRM is NOT COOL.\n\n(((Edit: This review contains some basic spoilers about gameplay and "scariness" of the game. I have blatant storyline spoilers marked in brackets below. If you don't want to read any spoilers, even minor ones, pass on this review :) )))\n\nThis is a tough game to review. I liked the atmosphere of the game, for the most part, and I liked the general direction of the storyline...even though it has problems...but ultimately the mechanics and "puzzleness" of the game hurts it for me. There are a lot of little sloppy things, or some poor design choices, that make the game difficult to enjoy, but not impossible to play through. I recommend playing through the game at least one time for the 2-4 hours of interesting experience (it is a bit unique from many games in its genre), but unless you're achievement farming it'll have little to no replay value.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half of playtime I decided I couldn't stand the random item/puzzle hunt and looked up a guide (there is a very good one for the extended edition on Steam, btw). Even using the guide, I still don't understand why I had half the items in my inventory at the end of the game. At one point I had upwards of 20+ items in my inventory, most of which I either never used or didn't know where to use. After finishing the game I looked up other comments and guides and it seems there are just a lot of pointless items in the game thrown in there as red herrings. I really dislike games that do things like this, so it's difficult for me to enjoy it after playing the similar, and MUCH BETTER, survival-horror game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. If you are really into the idea of a horror puzzle game where it gives you little to no help/clues, then this would be a great game for you.\n\nFor a horror game, I didn't find it particularly scary. Most of it was "creepy noises to the sides/behind you and you can't figure out their source!" or "something appeared next to me! JUMP OUT OF MY SEAT!" It wasn't even scary. It was always the same mannequin-lady (I presume to be "Anna"?) following me around doing the same set of 5-6 poses the entire game. There was 1 moment where a flying mask surprised me a little, but that's about it. The art of this game was pretty subpar which hurt my ability to get "sucked into" the atmosphere of the game. Maybe I'm being picky about this, but subpar or bad graphics in a horror game can ruin my experience. The music was pretty good, but the animation felt blocky and choppy a lot of the time.\n\nAs far as the story of this game, I'm left pretty confused. It has an interesting storyline...if it were fleshed out more. Don't read my spoiler if you plan on looking into this game at all. I completely give away the entire game's plot as well as my problems with it, which would defeat the point of you exploring the game for yourself!\n\n\n[[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]\n\nThe premise of this game, as far as I understand it, is that there is a married guy who becomes obsessed/falls in love with a statue of a goddess (who is supposed to be Mary? or an ancient "Goddess"? who the guy names Anna? or is actually named Anna? I am so confused about how to interpret her). He more-or-less turns into a cultist and worships Anna/the statue. His wife realizes he's going crazy and destroys the statue. He goes psycho-mode on her and murders her and their two sons (who might be named Castor and Pollux? Lots of references to Greek mythology with them). I can't tell if he loses his memory because of his guilt, or if he just goes so far off the deep end in his cult-worship of Anna that he loses it completely, but...whatever the case is, he regains his sanity and becomes a professor. He starts having crazy dreams and stuff and decides he HAS to visit this cabin (where the game takes place) to discover what is "calling" to him.\n\nThere are 8 different endings to this game, but they can be broken down into 3 categories: You get kicked out/Leave the house, You go insane and "die," You discover that you are a murderer and decide that you *must* live for/die for Anna stuck in a cave beneath the house (where you find her statue as well as "mannequins" representing the two sons you murdered). I don't particularly care for most of the endings except the "full" ending (going nuts and choosing to die, spending eternity with, the statue/the mannequin sons), which really doesn't help explain/answer some of the questions throughout the game. Who exactly is Anna? Does your character care at all about his wife whom he murdered & apparently chooses not to spend eternity with (choosing Anna over her)? Why are there constant "moon" and other Greek mythological references--is Anna supposed to be an interpretation of Diana?Is your character crazy at the end, or so truly grief-stricken by his actions that he can't help but stay in the cave, atoning for what he's done until he dies of starvation/dehydration/asphyxiation?\n\n[[[[[[[[[[/END SPOILER]]]]]]]]]]\n\n\nThere are many, many more questions the game doesn't bother answering. The game developer says they want the player to interpret the story, which I would be fine with, if they didn't throw so much information at me that I am completely unable to create my own version of what happened due to too many loose ends...","January 6, 2014","false","7.2"," 96 of 142 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","96","142","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zharwyn/recommended/217690/","Zharwyn","Zharwyn | tiny sarling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zharwyn/","2531 products in account","This game is quite disturbing, that's the first thing I will say. Anna - Extended Edition is a challenging point and click type of game that nudges the survival horror genre a little. I mention survival horror mainly because it seems quite inspired by Amnesia - The Dark Descent, however it does not require you to run away and hide from monsters once in a while. The game does have a sanity meter, though, but other than that it continues down the puzzle road, mainly.\n\nYou start outside, in the yard of a house - a sawmill, and you suffer from amnesia. What's with all of the amnesia themed horror games these days? Putting that question aside, your first challenge begins. The house is locked, how do you get in? Ah, our first puzzle! The first of gazillions, crazy, disturbing and somewhat illogical puzzles! Although, I have to admit that the original game was worse in the 'illogical' part.\n\nOnce you get inside the horror starts. This game will mess with your mind. I found myself disturbed many times as I progressed through the game. There are several events that triggers randomly, different intuitions to unlock and combine, a lot of books to read and on top of that Anna has eight different endings! This of course boosts the replayability a lot, if you can stomach going through the game several times.\n\nVisually, it's decent. It's not the prettiest one in the bunch, but it has the atmosphere nailed. Graphics are not important when it comes to psychological mind*bleep* games, in my opinion. The sound quality is somewhat lacking at times and there are occasional frame rate issues, sadly. It's not a flawless game but if you can close your eyes to various bugs then you won't have a problem playing the it, despite its somewhat awkward controls.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the game but then again I knew nothing about it so I had no expectations when I first started playing it. I will admit that it's not for 'everyone' and it's definitely not a game for the youngest gamers out there. If you'd like to experience a twisted story then look no further - Anna is quite effed up in terms of story. It's a bit like The Cat Lady - you really have no damn clue about what's going on, which will generate a numerous of "WTF?!"s as you continue deeper into the secrets of that abandoned house.","May 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","44","61","0","2"

Fans of the genre hold out for the triumphant return of limited supplies, vulnerable protagonists, dark and moody atmosphere, and freakish creatures. Where there is a demand someone will inevitably step up with a supply. Dreampainters has stepped forward with a modest entry in the horror game genre. It isn't a traditional survival horror title but it does promise scares and chills. With such strong games like Amnesia helping to scratch the survival horror itch would seem reasonable that Anna could deliver, right?\n\nAnna begins with your nameless, faceless, voiceless character in front of a sawmill explaining that he was drawn to its location. Your character is actually a teacher on leave of absence due to debilitating headaches. He finds some photos among his belongings that show him at the sawmill despite the fact that he remembers none of this. Players can only obtain this information if they bother to read the faux notebook contained in the extras folder of the game folder. The narrative is sparse—almost nonexistent really. While the esoteric nature of the story is intended to elicit curiosity it never offers a solid enough foundation to pique your interest. Not even establishing who your character is or what is motivating him in the game itself ensures that you remain distant from the events in Anna.\n\nAnna plays as a first person point and click adventure game. You meander around the game's environments picking up and examining objects in an effort to solve some of the most obtuse and absurd puzzles in video game history. It should be noted that ridiculous puzzles are not exactly uncommon in adventure games but they usually include hints or cues that provide the necessary hints to complete them. Anna, however eschews such formalities, instead forcing the player to combine random items and blindly guess what is necessary to solve the puzzle at hand. On top of this even when the puzzles do make some sense they are often undermined by pixel hunting. It makes sense that you would use your lighter to light the stove but attempting to use the lighter on the kindling in the stove will not provide the expected results. Using your lighter on the stove on the other hand will... It compounds the frustration and makes playing Anna tantamount to an act of masochism.\n\nAnna also blunders by failing to offer a credible threat. What is a horror game without some sort of impending doom? There is no way to fail Anna. The “horror” in this game comes from witnessing supernatural events which are rarely effective. They range from laughable (a card board cutout looking character blanketed in PSX era black particle effects) to mildly creepy (a mask whose eyes follow you around the room before appearing as a ghostly apparition behind the character). Anna doesn't do everything wrong though when it comes to effects and atmosphere. Upon making progress and revisiting some areas in the game you will notice that they are changed around. This reduces the tedium in backtracking as well as offering the occasional unsettling imagery. Messages will also appear on the walls and slowly fade away. It's in these brief moments that Anna shines but it isn't long before it's luster tarnishes.","January 16, 2013","false","4.5"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/217690/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Anna is one of those first person exploration games that does not have a protagonist with an array of weapons; there are no boss battles, no multiplayer and no high-budget cutscenes connecting one stage to another. It does not mean that it is a bad thing. Quite the contrary - considering its low budget nature Anna is quite a beautiful game; its sound and music are equally good.\n\nThe story revolves around a professor who is haunted by an image in his dreams - a sawmill that is constantly calling him. He finally decides to set out and seek out the answer - Anna seems to be the name of the woman calling him and while the house is surrounded by a forest and spacious, green garden upon entering the game's tone immediately changes to something much, much darker. Our hero begins to hear more voices and here the game focuses on puzzle solving till the very end.\n\nWhile the game is similar to a certain degree to Amnesia its psychological / horror nature is very far from it. There are some jump scares here and there but those of you already familiar with Amnesia may find these quite boring. However, the puzzles are interesting and the many books we find in the house give us the background of an interesting story. As for the puzzles: it is difficult to know sometimes what to do - the inventory can easily become filled with items and objects can be used not just with our surroundings but their combination is a must, too.\n\nThe Extended Edition is an upgrade the game received and the only version of the game that can be purchased. One of the new concepts introduced was the sanity meter - again, something reminiscent of Amnesia. Still, while wandering aimlessly and not knowing what to do I could not manage to completely go insane. I understand it would have given an extra ending (the game has 8 different endings, by the way).\n\nAnna is a bit rough around the edges - its narrative is not the best and the puzzles could have been a bit easier. The sanity meter is good but as we cannot die we do not really have a sense of threat while searching for Anna in the abandoned household. Also, the Extended Edition could have had an upgrade to its interface as it isn't exactly user friendly.\n\nNevertheless, Anna is an interesting adventure game and while I said it is one of those first person exploration games here we have more focus on puzzle solving so bear this in mind when purchasing it. I recommend it if it is on sale and remember you can always use a Steam guide if you get lost in the narrative / puzzle solving like I did!\n\nPS: The game requires a Kalypso account to be created otherwise it cannot be launched!","August 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

I really really really wanted to like this game. Really truly. However it has some really serious flaws that made me want to stop playing. So I did.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere and ambiance in this game are phenomenal. It is very immersive and beautiful to look at. The sound design is smart, the visuals are stunning. The way in which the story is told is very nice, very intriguing, and really weaves an interesting world for the player. The horror is excellent. Very few games have made me jump and just physically react like some of the scares in this game have.\n\nHowever, despite all it has in it's favor, it has some serious issues that make actually playing the game exceptionally frustrating. Perhaps the biggest offender, and probably what gets harped on the most, is how completely obtuse and irrationally difficult many of the puzzles are. You will carry items around with you for most of the game without ever having a use for them. Your inventory will be so waterlogged with pointless items that you'll find yourself trying every possible combination of items on a puzzle, no matter how illogical, and when you finally think you've got a solution that makes sense, the game says no, that's not the right answer, continue scavenging every square inch of the house for that one item you missed in a dark corner. Additionally, death is very unforgiving. Granted I got through half the game without dying, but when you do, you get the bad ending, and if you want to continue have to go back to your last (manual) save. You do not make a game with perma-death and no checkpoints, this is not 1995, I don't want to sound entitled but I really do feel like that is just basic game design common sense. And on the topic of death, every time you see a scary event, you lose health. This might be okay if there were more ways to restore your health, but there are not. And in a horror game, you kind of want to check out all the scary things. I mean, they're some of the strongest design points of the game, I'd be loathe to run away from any of them. But no, they damage you, and lead to death, so you should avoid these smart well-made scenes that really make the game experience.\n\nThis game had so much potential. I am very disappointed that it didn't live up to it.\n4/10","March 16, 2014","false","3.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"

Rather disappointed. It is just too short, and only on the second stage of the game do the puzzles devolve from clever methods to open a door to completely random rituals that will have the player constantly guessing about where the hell are they supposed to go, eventually either swallowing their pride and searching up a walkthrough or getting frustrated to the point where they burst a blood vessel.\nHowever, there are redeeming qualities. As I've mentioned before the game has some pretty heart-stopping scares, and the music is quite beautiful and complements the setting perfectly.\nIn the end, Anna just doesn't seem worthwhile. Probably best to give this one a miss.\n\n*UPDATE*\nI am well aware that the developers have updated Anna to the "Extended Edition". I've looked into it and this edition still suffers from the same flaws: Puzzles are still completely random, the game is still disappointingly short and the story is still flawed. All they added was a few new rooms and one or two new scares. Whoop-de-freakin'-doo.","September 29, 2012","false","12.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

The game at the moment is pretty much unplayable due to the horrid lag you get from just looking around and enabling Vsync doesn’t do anything. Another issue with this game is something that has come up recently which is when you try to launch the game it asks you whether you want it windowed or not and the resolution and so forth, regardless of those settings the game is determined to make you suffer by ignoring those settings and playing in extremely small window. So as for buying a copy I would recommend that you wait till (if ever) the developers fix its issues. The lag is not only with the mouse in looking around but also moving around as well. Also the developers haven’t fixed anything with the game since I bought it which was like a year or two ago. However if you are a Linux user some of this my not apply to you because that seems to be what they are focused on fixing, but if you are a Windows user your outta luck.

I also played the original version tho im not going to say anything about it. I mean why play the old version when you can play the updated and polished one?\n\nStory 8/10\n\nThe story revolves around a man with amnesia who dreams about an old sawmill in the mountains and a woman he can't forgot - Anna. To find his lost memories, the reason why he lost them and the true identity of Anna, he finds himself at this place again. In order to do so, he's got to solve misterys/puzzles and keep his sanity while witnessing a lot of supernatural phenomena to get his way through all the rooms in the sawmill to eventually find out the truth.\n\nEverything will be told to you through voices you hear throughout the game, books you'll find and read, notes the protagonist will make about certain things and with your own intuition. The Extended Edition has 8 different endings which i'll not put on display here so don't worry about spoilers.\nI enjoyed playing this game while discovering all the different endings and making conclusions on what exactly happend there. The story is not made that easy so you don't get bored after the first time playing it because you already know whats going to happen, but also not that difficult that you can#t understand everything. You will have a great time playing this gem if you pay attention and take your time to read certain books/notes you find throughout the game, because this game is certainly not something you can rush through and expect to understand everything. I enjoyed the story and everything around it and can only recommend it.\n\nGameplay 9/10\n\nYou see everything from the 1st person view, you have to explore the area and find clues and objects to solve puzzles/riddles in order to progress in the story(If you played something like Amnesia you will have a better image of what i mean). Theres no healthbar in the game so you basically can't die, but theres a bar that shows you your sanity.\nMeaning if you witness to many harmfull events, the game will end with a rather unsatisfying ending, depending on how far you got.[/i]\n\nthe gameplay is easy to understand so nothing really there to confuse you. The only thing i would have to mention is that in the beginning the controls might feel a bit off when you are trying to use the objects you found and when you are trying to interact with your enviroment, but that will go away after playing for a bit so no serious problem. Only bad thing i would have to mention is that sometimes the phenomena you witness are bugged. Well leaving the 2 buggs i witnessed aside the game has a solid, simple gameplay.\n\nSound 6/10\n\nDialogs are voiced really good, everything is easy understandable and just fits the situations. Backgroundmusic and sound effects are not especially good or bad. The game also features different background music while exploring the sawmill.\n\nOverall the music,dialogs sound effects are good. Nothing special that will be stuck in your head but im not going to use that as a negative point for the game. What i really didn't like is that you can easily notice when something is going to happen, because most of the time theres a change in music slightly before something happens. Personally i think that is the worst thing about this game since it takes away the fear, which..well.. should be in a horror game\n\nConclusion 7/10\n\nTaking everything into account im giving this game a 7 out of 10. The story is enjoyable and interesting enough to make you feel like you want to know everything and get all the different endings to find the real truth. Gameplaywise there isn't much innovation but also nothing really bad to say about it.\nAll in all i had a great time playing this game, playing it multiple times to learn more about Anna and her story. Some of the phenomena scared me for good the first time and some of them even for the second and third time :D. I can really recommend this game for people who like horror point&click adventure games. But don't expect the great horror, if you do, choose something else because this game is focused more on revealing the good story with some nice scare-jumps to push up the mood of the game a bit.\n\n","October 14, 2014","true","13.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","1"

Through the use of books and notes found in the game, we learn more about the characters involved in what happened here, come to our own conclusions. The whole environment has a surreal feel about it, at times beautiful, other times chilling, or supernatural. At its heart it is a tale about obsession, the cult of the Sacred Feminine, and worshipping a woman like a goddess.\n\nGameplay involves picking up items and figuring out what to do with them, made more interesting by the creepy ambience and the feeling you are being watched. The mask is definitely right up there as a spine-tingler, and I'm not talking about just how ugly it is. I found myself stuck at least two or three times, so if you don't run to a walthrough at the drop of a hat it is pretty easy to rack up the gameplay hours trying to figure out what to do next. Moments like these are ideal for if you're eating breakfast or having a cup of coffee.\n\nStarting the game may seem dull - this is because you begin the game outside the house. Don't let this fool you. It can be pretty, or pretty boring depending on your mood. Once you get inside things start to get interesting. Imagery gets a bit busier - you have a lot more things to look at compared to the open spaces of outside. In the latter half of the game the supernatural events kick in to high gear and things really start to get interesting.\n\nWant to know more? I don't want to spoil it for you, so you better get the game and find out for yourself. It may be short (depending on how fast you do the puzzles), but I found it an enjoyable break between longer games. It has its scary moments but these aren't too bad - you won't quit playing out of fear at any rate.\n\nOther points to note: I had no problems getting the game to run on Windows 7, I don't even remember the DRM that others have mentioned. Controls are not the best, granted - but I didn't have any game-breaking bugs.\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","17.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","3"

Italian developers corrected the most bitter points of their previous work in order to create a deep and complete game, an homage at the same time to the never-dying adventure game genre and to the most deep and sick horror.Anna Extended Edition has brand new accessible puzzles, a larger area to explore and stronger narrative material. Its so much richer compared to the standard edition that even those who have already finished the original game will find many good reasons for a second play through.In this Extended Edition Dreampainters has given a more professional look to Anna. Now the Italian adventure is also less cryptic and more understandable, although many plot points are still unclear and some puzzles must be solved again with a lot of trial & error.Anna Extended Edition improves the basic title from every point of view. The game is one of the best Horror Adventure available on the market.","May 8, 2014","true","17.5"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

Due to the earliness of me getting the game, I am writing this review years after I played it. However, I do remember quite a bit about this game and my hours played do not include the offline hours which would total to around 2 or 3 or 4 more.\n\nAt the time, I remember that Anna had some decently nice looking graphics and okay movement (at least on the outside of the house). However, the game was quite annoying in finding out what to do next as it didn't really give me lots of hints as to where and what. I also did not like the item usage controls but that wasn't too important. As I figured out what to do in Anna and started to progress through the story (which wasn't too straightfoward at all), I never really felt the scare which I expected that I might feel. Sure some parts were dark and creepy, but Anna never allowed me to feel the scare that games like Dead Space did.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy progressing through a story and playing through some creepy situations, go with Anna. However, unless it is on sale, I would not recommend this game.\n\nRating: 6.4/10\nRecommend: on 75% sale or better only","March 20","false","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, some legitimately freaky stuff goes on but, it felt more like I was in one of those Haunted House attractions more than playing an actual game. Now I can defend something like Dear Esther utilizing a minimalistic game approach because there was an interesting story woven into the visuals being presented to the player, but this game doesn't seem to really have a story minus "Demons in a shack... maybe?"\n\nI guess it's supposed to be like a 1st person 3D Point-and-click Puzzle adventure, but even then there is a lot of context missing from the puzzles, hell I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how to get into the cottege.

It takes about 16 mouse clicks to get going EACH TIME, which shows the designers simply have no concept of the player experience. Game play is largely ruined by constantly having to deselect inventory items, click through unnecessary text which blocks all other mouse actions, and closing the inventory by typing "i" instead of escape, all clicks requiring a little delay before the next action will work.\n\n2/ I didn't find the pixel hunting too bad, but there is far too much randomly trying things in the inventory as some of the "solutions" are counter-intuitive. I am a seasoned adventure game player and like to play without walkthroughs but this just isn't worth the effort of doing so.\n\nThe game isn't bad looking but the "atmospheric sounds" feel like they just threw in random effects for a bonus.

I really, really don't know.  It's got a good setting for a horror game, and a lot of creepy ideas...but somehow, just isn't that spooky.  And the pace at which your character walks around is AGGRAVATING, especially in all those long, winding tunnels at the end.  And the scenery isn't anywhere near as spectacular as the similarly-paced and similarly-themed Dear Esther, and nor is the story as intriguing, so...it's all a step in some kind of "right" direction, but just never seems to quite reach its intended destination.  Which is...a poignant, slightly disturbing ending?  Again...not quite.  But its heart is most definitely in the right place.\n\nMaybe the "Extended Edition", which I'll admit I've yet to play, will rectify some of the shortcomings (including, one hopes, all those typically obscure "adventure" game puzzles which don't necessarily make all that much sense, even once you've somehow bluffed your way through them by humouring every remotely viable solution you can possibly think of)!  And I do look forward to the next release by Dreampainters, 'cause the intent is all here...just not the execution.

The Tone is unbelievable. The music is Masterful. The puzzles are amazing. Lets slow down and look at it slowly. Anylizing what we can at a slow rate. The beginning you are outside of the house. An experience i absolutely LOOOVE!! The feeling that i had when i first saw the absolutely stunning visuals is indescribable. This game gave me the chills to an extreme extent when you go inside. Confusing and daunting. I remember how many times i jumped when i saw something that freaked me out. Too many times. Now looking at this game critically. The puzzles are extremely confusing and sometimes make little to no sense. But its not until you finish the puzzle that you realize it did make some sense. Not enough to say that it was just you being stupid, but enough to make you feel like saying "Ohhhhh" A lot. This is the first game. The original, unextended edition. Its got amazing visuals, enough to make me feel like my chest is rising. Never before have i felt the inate need to jump into a world. The Ambiance is unreal, aboslutely the best part of the game.\n\nExtended Edition:\nThis is where it starts to fall a little bit. This still has the beautiful and even enhanced graphics of the original, but the puzzles were changed. Making people, like me, who played the original to completion confused and a little upset. But nevertheless understandable, after all this game is definately changed. The original you can sink many hours into, the enhanced you can sink twice or triple that amount into. The ambiance is even better and the sound is sublime!\nNow the hard part for me. The downsides of this game. The Puzzles. If you played other Puzzle Games this will STILL be a challenge. I love Puzzle Games and this one is definately one of my favorites, but you could have played a million puzzle games, all through to completion and this will still stump you multiple times. The story is confusing so dont expect to understand it fully until replaying the game keeping all the past reasonings in mind. Second this is not User Friendly. The Inventory is just as confusing as the puzzles hell it is an awful inventory. How you may ask? The UI is not pretty on the inventory screen, in general actually, its pretty unfriendly to users. Again, How? Well its one of those inventorys that you need to be really finicky about how ot use things, especially in the Extended edition. Its difficult to explain without using it yourself. I found it wresteling with me every now and then but i worked around it.\nFinally the best part of the game the reason you should totally get this game!\nITS                  JUST                   AWESOME!!!\n\nThat may seem like a childish response but its true! Again, difficult to explain. The downside to this game that a lot of people need to understand is that it take a LOT of slowing down. You need to take your time with this game. If it was charged for more, i would say save your money unless your a huge fan of Puzzle and Horror games. This game definately warrants 10 bucks. Absolutely. Play one or the other first. Id reccommend the first one first because its shorter and the game is a little easier to understand. Unless you want to dive Headfirst into a game with gorgeous graphics and a downright amazing story (Once you understand it). If nothing else, buy this game for the Soundtrack. Because OH MY LORD!! THE SOUNDTRACK IS ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥♥♥IC!!! I love games with an amazing Soundtrack, and THIS!!

At first, it seems like a very cut-and-dry Unity based adventure game (think Gone Home, or Slenderman for its control scheme/layout/control feel). As supposed to those games, however, there is a much lighter tone (at least at first), but once you pass the first true puzzle of the game, the whole mood changes. Gone is the bright, beautiful scenery, replaced with a drab, plain shack essentially. Once in the new setting, more horror based elements start to present them. These aren’t necessarily fear-inducing (which is what I believe this style of game is commonly used for), instead it just has an overall creepy vibe. The creepy vibe is sometimes subdued by the absurdity of the scares at some points (“walk into a room, ooooh there’s blood on the wall! Isn’t that scary?!”). Sometimes, they do have a really effective moment (there is one puzzle I can recall upon completion, a floating mask will follow you around, with the sounds of muffled breathing coming from behind you until you turn around), but these moments are far and few between, and not enough to set the mood.\n\nAlthough these horror elements are going on, there is very soft and relaxing guitar music playing, which partially breaks the immersion with the game. There is also never really any sense of danger (for one, you can’t die, but this is common in these sorts of games). I found there was always just a one off scare, then more relaxing music and adventure-esque puzzles (The first puzzle involves putting two pieces of a mirror shard in an eye hole in the wall, using a pine cone to make an iris, burning said pinecone to “burn the left side of the door to reveal a keyhole (I never gathered this occurred when playing)”, then putting out the eye with a filled canteen).\n\nIn terms of the story, it follows a person being drawn to the cabin by a mysterious voice to be revealed as “Anna.” Exploring through the game shows that she was an ancient goddess that would lure men into worshiping her, then killing for her pleasure (very similar in narrative to the ancient cult of Diana of Italian mythos). In terms of the endings, they tend to go against the norm that each ending gets progressively worse and worse for the main character as it goes on (the happier ending is the easiest).\n\nIn conclusion, the game seems to be slightly confused in terms of what it is trying to do. The story was very horror-esque, but at no point did it really feel like it was truly immersive into this role. The music (although nice) didn’t really fit into this game, as well as the different scare tatics implemented.  Overall, I cannot recommend this game for many. If you are a fan of much slower horror games, maybe give this a play (it’s not very long either, clocking in at about 3-4 hours), but as a general note, I cannot recommend the game.","January 13, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For what it's worth, Anna has sparse moments that are genuinely creepy, but those scraps don't redeem this terrible walking simulator.","March 31, 2014","false","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

It has an interesting story, and is chilling at times. While I usually enjoy games in this genre (Its most akin to point and click adventures, like Myst), some of the puzzles make so little sense that I believe it is impossible to beat with a good ending, without the use of a strategy guide. That isn't crafting a complex and thought provoking game, it really feels like a short coming on the development side. The inventory system is sloppy, and by the end of the game you have over 20 items in your inventory, and while many seem interchangeable, the game is very specific about which item is used where, without much logical following these necessities.","January 13, 2014","false","13.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Disabling shadows and some crazy light effects make the game faster, and I even mentioned that in some threads - but even though developers were following the said thread, no comment was made on that note.\n\nAchievments do not work on Linux. This is a known bug, that the devs acknowledge, but completely ignore. After a lot of insistence, I obtained a reply from a dev - saying that the achievments are not an important issue. Which makes me wonder what is an important issue since none of the issues have been fixed for more than 1 year.\n\nAfter some investigation, it seems like these bugs all come from Unity engine, but devs don't even bother to tell that to us. All in all, it seems to me that we are dealing here with highly amateur developers who are incapable of tracking and pacthing flaws in their softwares, and even worse: unable to reach the community.","June 23, 2014","false","7.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But overall the game isn't actually remotely scary at all.\n\nThat aside, the gameplay is awful. The interface is very clumsty and requires a ridiculous amount of precision. It is supposed to be a 'puzzle' game, but the puzzles are completely nonsensical. There are little to no clues for solving most of them, you just spam trial-and-error with every silly combination of materials until something happens, and then you must repeat it a number of times just to get one puzzle done (and believe me, a lot of the combinations are the most inane and arbitrary you could imagine- like sticking a pinecone into a mirror and lighting it on fire to open a nearby door- and that's the easiest one). Basically, you don't "Solve" anything, you're just supposed to "know the answer".\nFurthermore, after playing through the game, you just get the 'bad' ending, because you didn't solve the 'other puzzle'. After watching the solution played on youtube (the guy spent over an hour randomly punching in combinations until they fit together), I decided it wasn't remotely worth it and uninstalled it.","December 23, 2013","false","8.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

But I must say that it was wholly disappointing and I really had to force myself to finish it. Everything that I will briefly mention is negative, unfortunately.\n\nIt was not as beautiful as I had hoped, and I found the levels to be mostly dark and ugly. The music was pleasant enough, but often seemed to clash with what was actually occurring. The story itself was very ugly. Be prepared to not only read about but also participate in pagan rituals (and not really have a clear idea of why you’re having to do them). I felt very, very uncomfortable doing these. Finding out who the characters are is the main goal of the game, but there really isn’t any personal connection to the characters, and no real motivation to want to know them. They are just a mystery. The puzzles are ambiguous and I found that it often became an inventory click-fest. The inventory I found to be one of the biggest irritants. There were about three pages of inventory items, half of them red-herrings and dead ends, and I was constantly scrolling back and forth, equipping and unequipping items, and waiting for the game to load while doing so. That became quite tedious, as did having to read and reread the slow-loading item descriptions that may or may not change the second and third time you click on an item. The text itself I found to be the most irritating part of all. Generally I love to go around collecting books and letters. In this game, I cringed every time I found a book, knowing I would have to read it. The books were generally a mash of useless, repetitive, uninteresting words that you nevertheless had to read through to find a recipe for some puzzle. Not only are they in a rather difficult font to read, the attempts at sounding archaic—filtered through a poor translation—were extremely distracting and unpleasant.\n\nThe one thing I appreciated was the idea of mouse movement being a sort of feedback for the reactions of the player. However, all that means is that looking around when events are happening will get you killed. In other words, whenever something interesting happens, you are supposed to freeze and look at a wall (I guess). That really isn’t fun. Since a sanity meter was never mentioned, to me this just did not make any sense in the context it was used, and I would have appreciated being told why I was dying.\n\nI love scary games with great story. I did not find this game to be at all frightening. It was mostly just uncomfortable and I felt no investment in the characters or their progress in the game.

The windows version is DRM protected by some perma-online nonsense from what I've heard and the Linux version (which I played) is as buggy as it can get.\n\nOn decent Hardware with latest kernel and proprietary graphic drivers this game will just glitch out permanently. All (scripted) cut scenes run in slow motion. What should be a short (couple of seconds) screen shake lasted for minutes on my system. Some textures (e.g. the water) are just missing and the lightning I awful. Depending on which point of the game I start the screen is either way to heavy on red or yellow.\n\nTL;DR This game would be OK for horror fans if the Windows version wouldn't be DRM contaminated. Non-Windows gamers I hearthly recommend NOT buying this game. Steam offers a couple of better scary games than Anna. Go get those!\n\nPS: Support has been ignoring my emails for a while. By ignoring I mean ignoring my issues with responses of the like "update drivers", etc. After over a month trying to get something from support they wrote me that the contacted the developer. This was over a week ago, no response so far.","December 3, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main problem is that this adventure takes every textbook design aspect, even the bad ones and just applies them with very little thought. By the first 15minutes of the game you will be in your inventory combining stuff with a stuff, running around the house to figure out what to click next, because you just missed something. Point&click adventures without logic behind their actions usually end up as a very frustrating experience and so does this game. I could possibly forgive this problem (because I do like adventures), but as you progress in the game it gets more and more tedious. Inventory gets bigger, more rooms to visit... so many illogical possibilities open up.\n\nThe game also wants to be horror experience and so is trying to be like (for example) Amnesia with its "sanity meter", but in the end it forces you to miss a lot of the cool and "scary" stuff around you, because the game is built upon events that will spring around you and so when you stop and look at some of it, you will lose a portion of sanity. Sometime you will even lose sanity seemingly by itself... making you to even more to focus on the running around blind to the scenes around you. Do you hear a scary sound? Quickly run walk away, it might be something cool for a change.\n\nOn the other hand, the story seems to be interesting even if the delivery is bit of a mess. Level design is very fine, with bits and pieces done wrong. Music is very good, and as voice acting goes, it will not offend you even though script is totally forgettable.\n\nSimply put, the game is not well designed. It has very pesky and completely unnecessary DRM. Technical aspects of the game have their share of problems (I guess Unity engine implementation done wrong) and to this day my Linux version still does not work properly, for some reason I could only walk around in the garden.","November 29, 2014","false","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't care  if the game opens up or gets very scary afterwards, I simply didn't see any reason to stick with it any longer.\n\nThe game looks pretty and it ran on my machine smoothly without any problems. I haven't encountered any bugs. The sound assets used were quite good.\n\nAll in all, the game might get better later on, for all I know. But I didn't want to struggle with the bad UI and the uninspired puzzles to get to the meat. I uninstalled the title immediately after exiting it. I would recommend the prospective buyer to watch a gameplay video so that they can decide if the problems I report are relevant to them.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre, you might want to pick it up at a sale. But I can not, in good conscience, recommend this game.","September 15, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first, it was more like "Oh, I didn't see that coming", but later it turned into "Why would you even do that?" and further frustration. At the end, I was playing just to finish it. Of course, it may be just me, but let me say that I am not a newcomer to this genre.\n\nConcept was really creative, sure, but the game really suffered from the Unity engine itself, controls (especially constant misscliks resulting from bounding boxes -did I say Unity?), puzzles with no logic and no hints in-story, and lousy texturing (especially at the end).

While there's some truth to the argument that we as gamers have become spoiled by too-obvious gameplay hints and on-screen tutorials that follow you from the first five minutes of a game all the way to the final boss, the solution is not throwing out everything we've learned about game design over the last 30 years in favor of pointlessly frustrating authenticity.","November 25, 2013","false","0.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

You play an 'amnesiac' who is drawn to an old abandoned sawmill, where some really disturbing events happened and you need to discover who you are and why this 'Anna' calls to you. The main gameplay mechanism is - pick up items and combine/use items on things in the environment to progress the story. I found that some of the puzzles were kind of absurd, like use a stick to smash through a concrete slab, but for the most part they are fairly consistent to the world. You will run into puzzles that you might think are completely absurd, mostly the ones dealing with occult rituals, but once you know the story and can decipher the metaphors everything begins to connect. This is what I found most entrancing about this game and it kept me thinking about the story even throughout the day.\n\nNow, I have not yet unlocked the 'True Ending' yet, so I still don't even know everything about the story. But I have received the 'Good Ending' and I am not going to spoil anything, but once you understand the ending, it really is a, "holy ♥♥♥♥", kind of moment. Despite still wanting to get the 'True Ending', I am hesitant, since this game gives me serious anxiety. It is not jump out of your seat scary, or will have you screaming in fear. But the whole mood of the game has this lingering malice that is always present, like a evil entity is constantly watching you. There are also hallucinations that sometimes occur which can have some disturbing imagery, or the god-awful sounds, specifically that women dying in the bedroom (you know what I'm talking about if you've played this game) that can really drive you mad.\n\nI laud the Italian dev team for the unique story, and the fact that the more you play - the more you discover; there are details in every corner and each one adds something to the story. The aesthetics are also well crafted and blend with the environment. It really feels like an old abandoned European log cabin in the woods (not the movie). And as a matter of fact Anna has a tone similar to a Grimm fairy tale.\n\nThis is not going to be a game for everyone specifically the less patient or possibly the Amnesia fans. I can easily see some players getting bored with the game, to scared to play, or annoyed by having to look up a guide to solve some puzzles (I had to use a guide several times).

Instead it pressures a player with a ghastly, dark athmosphere where paranormal things happen and twisted hallucinations appear.\n\nThe story begins at a courtyard of a homely cottage surrounded with beautiful peaceful landscapes. At the first moments the game explains a bit about a male protogonist's background with few sentences, which reveal that man suffers amnesia and has somekind of overwhelming obsession on the cottage.\n\n"This is the house which keeps appearing in my nightmares. ...How did I end up here anyway?"\n\nAfter the short perioid of relaxing puzzle solving strange supernatural things begin to happen: these events will not leave in dropping food cans nor mysterious voices, but instead take increasingly scaier features which I won't list here to avoid spoilers. I'll just say that this is about a very terrifying game where it is really hard to make yourself confortable.\n\nThe gameplay in "Anna" is excelent and offers various interesting puzzles, whereas some of them honestly were a little dumb and far fetched. Luckily though player is provided with customizable hint system which can be turned on/off whenever player wants. As in many other adventure games during quest the inventory is filled with many items, which can be examined and attached together. As a new innovation player also gathers some thoughts and conclusions that can be blended together to see some details about the story.\n\nAnna - Extended edition surprised me as a game and especially as a horror game, which storyline eventually sorted out to be sad, but also inspiring. I hope that the develeopers carry on with the same genre.","May 28, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

My PC specs are fairly high, as I can run most other games with 60+ frames.\n\nSecond, I experienced multiple bugs right when I jumped in. Several things were off about the lighting as well, where as if I stared at a light for too long, it ended up growing and growing in brightness, until I finally turned away from it so it would go back to its normal brightness.\n\nFinally, when I actually DID get a decent framerate (which ended up being only outside of the sawmill), movement felt unnatural; when I ran over certain objects, I'd end up getting hopelessly stuck.\n\nAll in all, if you're REALLY curious as to what this game is, either look it up on Youtube, or wait until this game's on a rediculously low sale.","January 3, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Though they can all be completed using the increasingly vague hints given throughout the story in the form of old texts, many players will turn to a guide for at least some because some will truly leave you asking what the hell you actually just did.\n\nHowever, do not let the puzzles stop you from experiencing the best part of the game: its story. Drawing on various folk legends and the Pagan religion, as well as having multiple endings, the story will have you thinking about it and drawing connections well past the end. It's very easy to miss parts and multiple play throughs are required to do everything, giving it great replay value.\n\nFinally the graphics and audio are absolutely gorgeous and serve their purpose of creating an incredibly creepy , surreal atmosphere throughout the game. Although some audio and lightning glitches are present, they did not detract from the overall experience very much.\n\nWhile it may not be worth the full $10 to some, it is certainly worth its sale prices and has become one of the most intriquing games I've played because of its elements. Certainly not for everyone, but well worth a try if you get the chance.","May 12, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't know who thought up the puzzles in this game but as an average joe with weird tastes and sociopathic tendancies, I can tell you would demand a refund if I didn't know better.  It has a strikingly break-neck descent into madness from the get-go, it runs on the same Silent-Hill 2 Logic, that "I can't leave this place because I haven't found what I'm looking for, even though it's gotten past the point of ever being worth what I am going through and I kind of don't know what I'm looking for anways so Durr Durr Durr"\n\nDidn't appreciate that.  leaving the Mill-House (The whole few hours this game took me overall takes place in a seven-room saw mill) counts as being a quiter and even though it provides the best endings in my opinion it never really gives teh sense of satisfaction you get from finding the End-End instead of the "This stuff is waaayyy too wack for me and I'm never coming back" end.\n\nI was stared at by tree-women, chased by flying horned monster masks, and the whole time, me, NOR THE CHARACTER knew why on earth we were going through this.\nI'll tell you right now, I recieved three endings for this game.\nSPOILER ALERT\n\nFirst time I ended it I put the wrong masks on the wrong maneqquines in the cave under the loft that would be impossible to reach by the laws of physics, and all that happened is it showed me laying on the floor in the first room as a wooded mannequin wearing the mask I put on and pressumabley dead.\nSecond time I ended it I put the right masks on and crossed the magic bridge and went left to get confirmation that (Either myself or the mill-master who lived here and left this stuff behind) Brutally murdered the wife and infant child as well as the brother in order to consemate with an ancient forest spirit/deity/witch named Anna (This game is bad at clearing things up) for no other reason than it seemed like a good idea, and the only path left was to the right where in I got to the cave found out me and the mill master somehow have become the same person (If we weren't already before) and that I am in love with the statue of Anna there and don't care that the cave collapsed behind me because we were together.  Then it showed me there was a painting of some whacked up crap (I'm trying to not curse and it's getting hard) in the wardrobe in the attic/loft/bedroom that has chains covering it.\nThird Time (This is the first ending I got) I walked out of the Saw Mill, looked up at the beautiful forest and the sunbeams shining through the pine trees and said "There was nothing but madness in there and something something something I'm never coming back"\nI would not recommend this game.  I might play it again one day, simple because I have it and I have a tendancy to replay even the things I hated, Like Broken Helix on Playstation 1, but if I can warn you of anything:\n\nIf you buy this game don't buy it becuase it's scary, it is not scary.  If you buy this game for puzzles, know that getting out of game is easiest by Alt+Tab to go view help of it from the internet.\n\nIf you buy this game for the sole purpose of seeing just how whacky and full of garbage and feces it is.  By all means, be my guest.  That's the only reason I would ever reccomend it.","May 10, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I found it a fun diversion from my usual FPS and RPG games.  The developers put in a phrase that says, It Makes No Sense, when you are doing something wrong that kept me laughing as I tried multiple things to move the story forward.  The game is short, like scary short, like is $10 worth 3 hours of play, kind of short.  The story gets "BIZARRE" as you continue and I had some 70's flashbacks on many levels.  The blacklight room art caused quite a bit of amusement in my home!!  LOL!  I bought this game on sale for a couple of dollars down from  $10 and I don't feel like I was cheated.

But my experience was that game ran fine at most times with any lack of performance possibly my hardware setup.\n\nGraphically the game looks good. But its a very very small scope type of game, but it looks nice and isn't hard to run.\n\nIts most like one of those DOS text adventure or later on when point and click type of adventure games came on. But unfortunately like some of them this game can be very confusing.  Eventually puzzles can amount to just randomly clicking on stuff until you get the right combo which is just a waste of time. At points some elements were really interesting in the puzzles, but more often than not it just made no sense or was illogical and confusing.  The books do help some but they only give you an inkling and the tips system if your stuck but have an idea of what you have to do is next to useless.\n\nThe seemingly random events such as stuff popping up or happening was interesting. And for the most part good. Look at something only to look away and back and its moved or gone. Gives a very creepy feeling that you are not safe and the world around you is alive. Which alot of games falter at and end up with a static feeling enviroment. As you progress the game world changes around you.\n\nThe only problem is that puzzles are just anti-intuitive at times and just to much and thats pretty much all the gameplay. Just walking around and interacting with things that are apart of puzzles.\n\nThe story is spooky ghost sprittual stuff from what I can tell. But I didn't really get it.\n\nIf you want a confusing puzzle game where you pretty much have to google atleast some part of the puzzles or waste hours trying to figure them out then I suppose this maybe for you. Sure the game could possibly draw you in, but once your there your stuck at a puzzle while you want to adventure in a world unlike one your used to.\n\nSomething I think this game could have been really great with is some top notch narration for books, and other parts where there is onscreen text your intended to read. Also making the text in as small and biteable chunks as possible instead of a giant wall of text paragraph that the in game books are. This would make them less of a chore to read and with the narration it would be possibly pleasurable to listen to if was anything like Bastions narration.","March 8, 2014","false","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But that task is just impossible, because this game is an horrible technical mess!\n\nFirst you have to spent an hour just to familiarize yourself with the clunky controls and the horrible mouse sensibility. After that you think your problems are gone, but they're not... you found a lot of things you can do with your collected objects, but very soon you realize they don't make any sense, so you start to search and try every bizarre combination to try to solve simple puzzles and this take long, much more long than your patience.\n\nThe worst is... every new room i entered i got struggle with a buggy blinking environment lights that makes me literally close my eyes to not being blind. Sometimes it stop in a few seconds, sometimes don't, and i found me running or shaking the mouse trying to stop the madness. Sometimes i had to go to options and click every button, then it stops.\n\nIt is really a shame that game being published this way, because i really like the mystery mood, but it's really impossible to play. In the Steam forums you see any decent answer either by Dreampainters or Kalypso Media. You just don't get any support, unless a false statement that is a Unity problem. You buy a broken game and it's your own problem, they'll not fix it.\n\nAlso, you have to make a Kalypso account and login in a launcher every time you start the game, even with no online resources. This publisher is one of the worst i ever seen, they don't have any respect or care with customers. I'll skip any title  under their label forever.","November 26, 2013","false","4.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

This is something where you can close your eyes and feel that you are in the atmosphere. While they seem beautiful at first in the first scene of the game, it goes down towards the mystery and the creepy, scary side.\n\nMusic:\nWhile this game only has a few tracks, the music is beautifully well done with acoustic guitar, violin, and piano. This is the kinda music you want to listen to while you're getting into the game or relaxing and touches your soul.\n\nGameplay:\nThere are two versions of the game: Original and Extended. The Original is more simple than the extended. It just focuses on items and getting through the game. The Extended, however, is more complicated, as there are more places to explore, more types of items to explore, and decisions and explorations that can affect the ending of the game. The upside of the Extended is that the story goes deeper.\n\nWith the differences aside, there is some weirdness with some items of the game. You have to combine items you didn't expect that go together or used on something, or items that are well hidden. This can be a downside for simple players or people who don't wanna spend so much minutes on figuring stuff out.\n\nStory:\nThe story goes into a sort of mystery and cultish feel with going back to some parts of the past. Yes, this game has some jumpscares, but in a perfect amount. I don't want to get into details, but the story is simply looking for a woman you can't get out of your head and you have an obsession. Not a crazy, sick obsession, but more of a desire just to be with the woman.\n\nIn conclusion:\nAnna is one of those explorative, story gems that is a must have in your library and must be played. The graphics, music, and story melt perfectly into the pot that makes it a masterpiece. While the gameplay might be a bit annoying, the rest of the game will encourage you to delve further to solve the mystery.","December 21, 2012","true","34.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I suppose I just couldn't get into it, but I will give this game credit where it is due : it is very creative and this ''Extented Edition'' is a vast upgrade over the original. It is also gorgeous and is a real work of art, so I REALLY recommend this game for anyone (like me) that believes games can be art. It is a very mature game, not for the faint of heart, and not for the easily bored.\n\nIt was also VERY freaky, and it just got freakier and freakier, to the point that I started to feel just as insane as the character I was playing. Yeah, you're not supposed to look directly at the freaky ♥♥♥♥ that pops up to scare you. You have a kind of insanity meter, and its game over if it runs out. You then get the bad ending, which was my ending. Couldn't finish the game you see, but that wasn't really the reason.\n\nThe reason I don't REALLY want to recommend this game, but I will anyway due to the aforementioned points, is the puzzles. They make little to no sense. The whole game is heavily cryptic, to the point of insanity... and I guess its kinda the point, but I couldn't even get passed the first area without a walkthrough, and I don't think that's a point in its favor. Yes, you'll sometimes find a few clues in the form of books as to what to do next, but they are vague at best, or seem to have no connection with anything at worst. I just went in circles, revisiting room after room after room (once I finally unlocked them), not understanding what to do until I finally saw too many hallucinations and it was over. I guess there's two words to describe this : beautiful... but weird. VERY WEIRD.\n\nSo, I am tempted to continue this game, but it is as a big freaky impassable wall of nonsensical puzzles, which only the metaphorical industrial drill of a walkthrough can penetrate, which kinda destroys the immersion it tries to create. And if you do get through, blood will spill out and you'll go insane, then its game over. That pretty much sums up my experience.\n\nTHUMBS UP FOR ARTSYNESS THOUGH. I will not replay this though.

It doesn't start off on a good footing by making you sign up for some account that serves only to advertise another game before you start. The game itself is beautiful with a very dark, sinister atmosphere. The inventory system is not very good and the way of moving objects is useless. The puzzles are nigh on incompressible. The built in help system does nothing except either tell you to do things that you have already done or tell you things there are no help at all. I am not the best puzzle gamer, I will generally reach for a walkthrough more often than necessary but here quite early on I just gave up any attempt at solving the puzzles and followed a walkthrough in its entirety. There is a health meter but the game is really not that clear on what injures you so losing health just feels arbitrary. Through the game you collect intuitions and offers no explanation as to what they are but you need to work this out to progress to the final endings. All these things do not mean I did not enjoy this game, the mystery and the story kept me wanting to carry on. The multiple endings add a bit of replayability This game also comes with the original Anna so you can play that and realise that the terrible inventory, controls and incomprehensible puzzles are a significant improvement on the original. Completing certain endings on the original is dependent upon random events you have no control over happening which is annoying. So overall I am giving this a thumbs up, it is flawed but pull up a walkthrough and enjoy the atmosphere and story.","August 9, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

What I liked most is the suspenseful atmosphere and the story. Game's setting changes drastically over a few stages: first you find yourself outside a wooden sawmill, observing as the sun glistens from a calmly running stream. You feel intrigued to get inside the house and learn of it's secrets. Once you're inside - it gets pretty spooky. You solve puzzles and trigger scripted and random events to progress in the story. The puzzles are satisfying but usualy don't make much sense and are not really intuitive. I had to look up a few playthroughs to solve some puzzles - couldn't come up with solutions myself. Once you reach a certain point in the story, the setting becomes really grim. With an unholy presence in the sawmill and ambient sounds that chill down your spine - the experience is quite satisfying even for a horror junkie. The game has multiple endings which adds some replay value. All in all, Anna is a decent game with some flaws regarding puzzles, but if you're up for the challenge and have plenty of spare time to come up somewhat ridiculous solutions to solve puzzles - get this game. 7/10","January 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is reminiscent of the Nintendo Gamecube cult classic Eternal Darkness in that it is puzzle based and very much focused on horror that is in the main player characters mind rather than stalking zombies, or deadly plagues, or the apocalypse. The atmosphere is spooky and intimidating and the player has a wide variety of options in game that effect what achievements they get as well as the final outcome of the game. The only problem is that the controls are a bit touchy and there is no controller support for this game. Overall this game gets 4.5 out of 5 for horror ambiance.","June 22, 2014","true","22.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Nor is it Silent Hill or Amnesia. This is a game about being spooky and creeped out. And in my book, it succeeded wonderfully. So many times during my playthroughs I found myself with a severe case of the goosebumps. Be warned though: while this is certanly an entertaining title, it is quite short. My first playthrough took about 5 hours. If you are a skeptical person, this is not a game for you. If you have a hard time allowing yourself to be immeresed into the world and atmosphere of a game, again shy away. This is a game that requires effort from the player in order to enjoy it fully. It doesn't give you hand outs or force feed you intentions, and so the player must make inferences. You may dislike the story at face level, but it's something that made me think. Many claim "lack of immersion" when they realize that the monsters/disturbences can't "really hurt you," thus removing the fear of a horror game. This game IS NOT A HORROR GAME, but a creepy game with great atmoshpere. The puzzles are often much simpler than you think, and many times you simply glance over what you need to progress, reminiscent of the MYST style of puzzles. So my final word is this:\n\nGood puzzles as long as you don't mind thoroughly searching the enviroment, and rememberto combine items in your inventory\n\nGREAT atmoshpere. Creepy and spooky. Goosebumps, NOT wet underwear or screams.\n\nThought provoking story with multiple endings, some of which can keep you thinking for weeks after the game interpreting.\n\nNOT an instant gratification game, requires player commitment, thought, and willingness to accept the game world without trying to pick it apart at every seam.","January 10, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, you are able to turn this off.\nThe game has Multiple Endings.\nSound is okay.\nYou can use the mousewheel to scroll through items. But opening inventory is faster.\n\nOther things.\nYOU NEED A KEY IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS GAME - HOWEVER YOU GET THIS ONE AUTOMATICALLY ONCE YOU HAVE INSTALLED THIS.\n\nThis requires a Kalypso Account.\n\ni have complete the game and it is very good. You might want to get this with a discount however.\n\nJust a Hint, do not turn the sensitivity of ur mouse high. Keep it at low, because you will get punished for it if you have it on high.\n\nPlaying in window mode is not always super in this game. Because if you are scrolling around, there is a chance that you could click outside the border and click your desktop instead.\n\nPlaying on lower resolution graphics, might be easier to find items.\n\nThere are "Time based event" (SECRET) achievements.\n\nSometimes you get stuck at something and that is really annoying. No, you can't jump!\n\nGame is short.\n\nLet's Try Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLqVaTdxf5A\n\nI give this game a rating of 9/10.","August 13, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The puzzles are often not based on common sense, but on some sinister dark knowledge of witchcraft it seems. So I guess I used about 50% doing walkthroughs. It is dark and deep  and I really like the music and sound effects, they really add to a good experience. So if you don’t use walkthroughs I wish you good luck, but if you’re not afraid to get a little online help every once in a while, it’s ok.\n\nThe story is good, and once you’re inside you really get sucked into it! I’ve done my first playthrough now and had one of 8 endings. Not the final ending though, which I’ve seen on youtube and is really worth trying again in the not too distant future.\n\nThe thing I really missed was the experience you have in Amnesia, Among the Sleep or Outlast, where you occasionally have to run for your life. I have to add, there isn’t really anywhere to run or hide :p but despite this, the music, fx, story and puzzles make it creepy as hell. Whenever I play games like this, with bad or average games, I sometimes start to wonder when it’s going to end.

The sound, music, narration, story, design - all these things are absolutely remarkable, and Anna should be played by anyone who wants to see how a game like this should be done.\n\nQuite unfortunately, the entire game is left in ruins due to an insulting puzzle-solving mechanic.  If the other features build the perfect arc, all that's necessary is a keystone that'll just keep those things in place.  It doesn't exist, and worse, this was reportedly done on purpose.\n\nYou repeatedly pick up items that you'll never use.  Puzzles make no sense and worse, there's no effort for them to do so.  I tried my damndest to get through the game without a guide, but it's impossible.  Unless you plan to hammer away at this title for a solid month for hours on end each day, you will never figure out each puzzle.  Worse yet, there are multiple endings depending on how you play the game - and nothing is explained to you at any point.

The sound, music, narration, story, design - all these things are absolutely remarkable, and Anna should be played by anyone who wants to see how a game like this should be done.\n\nQuite unfortunately, the entire game is left in ruins due to an insulting puzzle-solving mechanic.  If the other features build the perfect arc, all that's necessary is a keystone that'll just keep those things in place.  It doesn't exist, and worse, this was reportedly done on purpose.\n\nYou repeatedly pick up items that you'll never use.  Puzzles make no sense and worse, there's no effort for them to do so.  I tried my damndest to get through the game without a guide, but it's impossible.  Unless you plan to hammer away at this title for a solid month for hours on end each day, you will never figure out each puzzle.  Worse yet, there are multiple endings depending on how you play the game - and nothing is explained to you at any point.  There are useful guides online, but I'd imagine even THEY needed help before writing it, or they went into the game's code to make sense of it all.\n\nThe only way I can recommend Anna is with a guide.

On a positive note the game doesn't wait for you to make progress to decide to give you a scare, which nicely avoids the boredom problem that many adventure games have in that situation.\n\nIt's actually probably for the best that it wasn't any longer - like many psychological horror games the scares have less and less impact as you get more used to them. By the end of the game I wasn't jumping whenever XXXXXXXX happened any more, which makes me think the length was about right (although that was in my second sitting - I'd recommend playing through the whole thing in one sitting if you can).\n\n\nAlso, there are intuitions at the top of the inventory screen. I only mention this because I didn't notice until I was almost finished the whole game and it seems like they might have an influence on the ending.\n\n\nOne annoyance I had with the game was that some of the cutscenes are unskippable - including the expelled ending sequence which happens when you lose too much sanity. Unfortunaly at one point I had saved a game with almost no sanity left and I had to keep sitting through that ending and reloading over and over until I was able to make some progress before the game threw another random event at me.\n\n\nOne final warning - this game includes some 3rd party DRM. While it's far from the worst DRM scheme around it's still unwelcome - you will need to create an account with Kalypso before you can play.\n\nI also had some technical issues with my controls (the camera spun by itself every 5 seconds), though it mysteriousely resolved itself after a few attempts to launch the game.","July 27, 2013","true","7.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In fact, I thought that the audio and visuals were even more disturbing that the arguable more famous Amnesia.  The story is interesting and unfolds gradually as the player interacts with different puzzles and objects in an abandonded house, piecing together the mystery of what happened there.  There is no dialogue interactions in the game but the storytelling is well done without them.  The steam overlay, widescreen resolutions and steam achievements are supported but unfortunately the controller is not.  Anna's strength is also it's weakness, it is maddeningly difficult to figure out how to solve the puzzles.  In fact, this is a game that is nearly impossible to complete without the assistance of a walkthrough video.  However, the several possible endings based on the choices you make bring some replayability to the game that is often missing from adventure titles.  In all, Anna is a succesful but flawed entry into the genre and should be considered by anyone who enjoys a difficult adventure game.","February 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can understand that many may not feel the same way upon playing, but my friend Skye can attest to the fact that I was yelling in shock and anxiety repeatedly while make my way through the game. The sound design is phenomenal in that often when you hear a sound there's nothing there...but sometimes there is...and it's that 1-in-10 moment that makes you jump out of your seat. The same principle is applied to the 'inhabitants' of the sawmill. These elements combine to create a living, unpredictable, and malevolent environment that continually surprises and engages you. My only criticisms extend to the occasionally insane difficulty and abstract nature of some of the puzzles, and the lack of explanation of the so-called 'intuitions', which, given how pivotal they are in regards to your experience, lack any in-game explanation as to their importance or function. The Extended Edition has many improvements over the original (longer game length, more puzzles, increased graphical quality) and, in my opinion, completely redeems the experience. 8.5/10.","July 29, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The story was very well written and the atmosphere and soundtrack were phenomenal. It is rare to find a game with a story so captivating that whenever you are away from it, all you can do is think about what will happen next. It took me about 6 hours to beat Anna and I unlocked one of eight possible endings. As for the horror aspect of the game - Anna will make you jump a quite few times - the scenes were well thought out and weren't cheesy like any of the FEAR games. Anna incorperates a 'Sanity Meter' similar to that of Eternal Darkness on Gamecube, the more unnerving images that your character sees/experiences the more sanity is drained from the meter, resulting in more horrific images. If the Sanity meter is depeleted the game will end. You can replenish Sanity by completeing various puzzles throughout the game. Just a heads-up, puzzles range in difficulty from Easy to "♥♥♥♥ this, I'm looking up a walkthrough". Anna was an ejoyable gaming experience and well worth the cost of admission, give it a shot.","June 7, 2013","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no monsters like Amnesia or other horror games. It is purely puzzle-driven, with some psychological fear factors added into it. The scenery is beautiful, the music is wonderful as well, though at times it seems like it does not fit the atmosphere of the game. However, I think with how soft, and beautiful, the music is, adds to the atmosphere of the overall game.\n\nNow, a couple of things I did not really like about this game. It felt WAY too short... Maybe even a little rushed at some parts. I feel there could be so much more done to this to help aid the story along and to add more to it. I also hated some of the puzzles. I had no idea what to do for some of them, and eventually had to give in and look up a guide. There are a couple of puzzles that give hints, but other than that, nothing. The controls are rather easy to remember. The inventory is another issue that I had. There were some items that were SO pointless to have that the end of the game, and even throughout the game.\n\nAside from the few cons and issues I had with this game, it definitely terrified me to play the first couple of times. I have played through it numerous times for different friends, all which have liked the ctual story. Personally, I would have to give this game a 7.5/10. There were some things that could be improved, but overall I think it was a very interesting, very plot-twisting game.","September 12, 2014","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While Anna on the other hand is a woman, standing with her back towards you slowly turning around until you see half her face expecting the rest to be horribly maimed, but instead it’s a perfectly normal woman with a loving look in her eyes.

Instead they really get in your head.  It makes you afraid to turn around, which is a nice change.  "Find items, combine items, use items" combined with a pretty darn creepy setting and background materials, and it's satisfyingly thinky without any real bash-head-against-wall puzzles.  A bit short though, and I don't expect to get much replayability out of it.\n\nAll in all, the horror genre thrives on every game being a little different--different mechanics, different fears.  This game is sufficiently different from other genre games that it really works.  Within the horror genre, highly rated.  Without the horror, it's just a fairly cerebral point-and-click adventure game, so if horror isn't your thing there might not be a lot for you here.","July 8, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wasn't so fond of some of the long texts since they felt like a break in the actual gameplay, but they were generally interesting to read. I didn't get very far, however, because some of the puzzles were rather obscure; it was very easy to miss one little thing and be stuck for a loooong time. Since there are barely any tutorials for the Extended Edition, it made it that much harder to figure out what to do when I got stuck (which happened fairly frequently). Granted, though, I'm not that great at puzzles. So although I'd recommend it, it's certainly not for everyone, especially those with little time to play.","December 23, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well above Amnesia on the "Curl up and cry softly in a corner" category.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting depending on which ending you actually get. And getting the "good" (and I use 'good' in the loosest possible way) requires a lot of work.\n\nThe puzzles you're required to solve in order to progress are anything from simple to "I've been stuck in this room for 7 ♥♥♥♥ing hours, dammit...". Not to say they aren't solveable, they just require a lot of searching and gathering of items. And downright odd combinations of items. Advice? Read every single book you find carefully.\n\nOn top of that, the puzzles are made all the more tricky when you're in a constant state of fear that when you turn around next, something will be stood right behind you. Don't get me wrong, there's no 'health', per se, but you have an Amnesia-style sanity meter. Which depletes because of randomly occuring "events".

During the red shift event, you can no longer get one ending.  The problem was, no matter how fast you went through to get to that point, the stupid red shift would occur.

Anna is pretty entertaining.  There is multiple endings and quite a bit to collect.  It has some replayablility to it.  The story is also interesting and one should try to complete all endings inorder to piece together their own interpretation of the story.\n\nAs your sanity gets lower you do experience quite a few jump scares.  Apparently the game engine watches your movements and predicts your vulnerability to try to scare you when you least expect it.  I play horror games all the time and I don't generally get scared easily, but there were a few points in this game that made me jump.  And I appreciate that.\n\nThis is a "point and click" style game in which you examine items and craft things to solve the puzzles.  The puzzles can be irritating at times though, and not much help is given to the player apart from journal entries and books.  The soundtrack is repetitive but it is nice.\n\nThough some other reviewers and websites tend to view this game negatively, I think it's wonderful.\n\nIt's not too often we have a horror puzzle game that is actually creepy.  Though the scares are supernatural in nature and some tend to be a bit on the cheezy side, I guarantee you will be surprised when it gets silent and you turn around to find the creepiest wooden mannequins ever, which always appear in different spots.   Or if you see a shadow in the corner of the room, only to turn around to see 8 more inches from your face.  Sounds lame: I know.  But trust me, it's really great.\n\nFor what it is, I think Anna is a wonderful game and has a lot of interesting features.  From what I heard, Dreampainters is making a "spiritual sequel" to this game, and if they improve on it, it might be something to watch out for.\n\nWould recommend.","June 22, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However i dont recommend this game if you like big scary games because this game wasnt hardly scary (at least creepy) nor were the developers trying to make it that way. Besides that, what your supposed to do is very, very confusing which would make searching online for walkthroughs a regular routine.The game is also super short (their only like about 4 small areas, and the plot of this game is hard to understand nor that interesting. Its still impressive for a team of two people to come up with this project but it doesnt quite deliver much of anything.","September 26, 2012","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the game can actually produce some freaky moments and jumpscares, given the right place and atomsphere you are in. But I have to say, there's Puzzles, and then there's Anna. I don't know if it's just me, but I practically needed a walkthrough almost every step of the game, because it's puzzles are actually really hard. All to do with combining objects together to do something you thought was impossible. So, if you're a puzzle mastermind, I'd get this game. But if you aren't, but like the look of this game, you're definitely going to need a walkthrough, because this game is god damn hard.","July 17, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the events are just buggy and annoying to get too.  It seems as if certain scary events will only occur within a certain time frame of the game.  So this makes it a big pain trying to figure out when you can get an event, and when you can't.  With none of the walkthroughs explaining the timeframes of each event, you will be wasting a lot of time trying to get these events when you can't.\n\nAnd also, there was a certain ending that was a big pain to get too.  During the red shift event, you can no longer get one ending.  The problem was, no matter how fast you went through to get to that point, the stupid red shift would occur.  Didn't matter if you sped through everything to get to that point in less then 5 minutes, red shift event will happen and completely prevent you from getting that ending.

You play as an, apparently un-named, history professor who has been mysteriously drawn the sawmill by a strong feeling of deja vu when he finds pictures of the place in his closet, despite having no memory of the place.\n\nWhen I watched the trailer on Steam I noticed that most of the objects in the game aren't even animated, and almost passed by this game because of it.  While it is true that there is almost no animation outside of physics objects, the mood and setup was all that's needed to emerse me into the game.  Also, because many of the objects are stationary, it led me to question whether the house is in fact haunted or if the man I was playing as was going insane.  It's obvious that this was an intentional choice as the game uses clever placement to ensure that you're not looking when certain objects move or materialize, which to be honest did make me jump a few times.\n\nThe story of what happened at the sawmill and the ways in which I was required to reveal it are also better than I expected.  The things I was required to do to find out the truth made me question the sanity of the man I played as, and the truth itself is something that would probably cause the average person to go insane.  None of that "Timmy fell down a well and died and now he's a ghost that feels betrayed" crap.\n\nWhat little music is in the game is very good and, along with the sounds, enhances the experience of the game.\n\nMy only negative criticism is that some of the puzzles require ridiculous logic to try to solve on your own and there are usually clues for each one they are either hard to find or not nearly enough to get you close to a solution.\n\nRecommended for anyone who likes adventure puzzles, solve it yourself stories, and psychological horror.","March 17, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the in-game hints system is vague at best.\n\nThe controls for inventory and using items is very annoying and lacks fluidity. The forced walking speed is an annoyance, especially when there is a fair amount of backtracking throughout the game involved.\n\nYou also can not describe this title as a horror survival either, as its not possible to die.\n\nSome nice touches of horror brushing through the gameplay but very weak and suspense is not sustained properly in-game, which causes the scares to be cheap jumps rather than actual in-your-head horror. Not very obvious but there are 3 different endings which is always a nice touch to implement into any game.\n\nI'm a fan of this genre so its great to see games like this get developed and out into the commercial world, especially by independant developers but if unpolished titles like this were released out often the genre would be soon dead and forgotten.\n\nWorth a couple of quid in the sale and you have an interest in horror type games, but avoid paying full whack.","November 24, 2012","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There is no dying in the game, but it was very unsettling and there are some decent scares. It was good enough that I did make sure to only play it at night in the dark with headphones on. I completely love these types of spooky ghost story point and clicks. Anna took around 5 hours finish. I am eagerly anticipating the developers next game. This game like a nice juicy steak garnished with turds. If you like horror point and clicks, definitely get Anna when it's on sale.","December 18, 2012","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been getting flashbacks to the unbridled madness of titles like Lighthouse, and am not sure how I feel about that.\n\nThus far it took me most of half an hour just to get inside, because I was admiring the scenery and completely failing to find the item I needed to advance the entry puzzle...after that I have fled just to see what happens, then later was kicked out of the house. (Two endings down!)\n\nPuzzle difficulty and exploration difficulty is all over the place, the books help a bit but this is definitely an indie game and the built-in help is there for a reason. I really wish the inserted voices were better, they are bordeline tolerable but a major chance of adding atmosphere was lost there. There is some bad english in places, but it doesn't smell like a fanfic or amateur translation...the most critical story elements got the extra polish they needed and are a delight to read.\n\nIn closing I would say that while the game is not very player-driven so much as event-driven, time management and NOT INVESTIGATING STRANGE NOISES are a big priority for me in starting my next run. It seems a reasonable amount of sanity damage may be avoided by not triggering/witnessing supernatural events.\n\nAt this rate I am willing to start fresh and attempt to beat it cleanly two more times, then it's time for shameless abuse of outside help.","December 4, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't get very far, however, because some of the puzzles were rather obscure; it was very easy to miss one little thing and be stuck for a loooong time. Since there are barely any tutorials for the Extended Edition, it made it that much harder to figure out what to do when I got stuck (which happened fairly frequently). Granted, though, I'm not that great at puzzles.

There are no monsters like Amnesia or other horror games. It is purely puzzle-driven, with some psychological fear factors added into it. The scenery is beautiful, the music is wonderful as well, though at times it seems like it does not fit the atmosphere of the game. However, I think with how soft, and beautiful, the music is, adds to the atmosphere of the overall game.\n\nNow, a couple of things I did not really like about this game. It felt WAY too short... Maybe even a little rushed at some parts. I feel there could be so much more done to this to help aid the story along and to add more to it. I also hated some of the puzzles. I had no idea what to do for some of them, and eventually had to give in and look up a guide. There are a couple of puzzles that give hints, but other than that, nothing. The controls are rather easy to remember. The inventory is another issue that I had. There were some items that were SO pointless to have that the end of the game, and even throughout the game.\n\nAside from the few cons and issues I had with this game, it definitely terrified me to play the first couple of times. I have played through it numerous times for different friends, all which have liked the ctual story. Personally, I would have to give this game a 7.5/10. There were some things that could be improved, but overall I think it was a very interesting, very plot-twisting game.","September 12, 2014","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something I haven't had in a game for a while. Yes, it's the same atmosphere you'll get when if you played Silent Hill for the first time on the PS1. There's no combat action though, and it mostly involves solving puzzles and reading journals. Maybe doing some trial and errors just to see how something would work. This game requires some brains to play.\n\nI'm playing this game on its maximum settings and the environment is truly fantastic. The background music and sound effects add to the eerie atmosphere as you uncover the truth about who Anna is.\n\nIt's possible to save at almost any point in the game. So this can be something that you play for 10 minutes, take a break, then come back to later.\n\nThe only caveat in this game is it doesn't have controller support. It's very much made only to be played on a PC.  There's also the annoying login/registration screen that you need to deal with before starting the game. What gives?

(This may be a measure of insanity after playing the game for hours).\n\nSome of the puzzle solving is a case of "how on earth was I supposed to figure that out?", especially when it comes to trying to unlock all the achievements, but I'd still suggest getting as far as you can with it before interweb searching past a bit where you're stuck.\n\nAn odd game.

The Extended Edition update truly was an update and added genuine content and changes to the game.  The graphics were updated and the game looks more beautiful than ever.  The sound was revamped just a little bit, which is a ever welcome update.  They also modified the actual gameplay itself, smoothing out the previously clunky controls and making it overall easier to handle.

Not that many jump scares, which is nice, otherwise they don't work that well :) One or two were (for me anyway) genuinely unnerving. On the Extended version though, after a certain point the spooky factor gives way to pure puzzle solving intrigue, and some of what should be "spooky" actually becomes quite comforting. (This may be a measure of insanity after playing the game for hours).\n\nSome of the puzzle solving is a case of "how on earth was I supposed to figure that out?", especially when it comes to trying to unlock all the achievements, but I'd still suggest getting as far as you can with it before interweb searching past a bit where you're stuck.\n\nAn odd game.

A bit slow at parts, but enjoyable on the whole.\n\nThe key things to bring along when playing Anna are observation and inference. There are a lot of puzzles whose required solutions are fairly subtly hidden, so you'll need to keep an eye out for objects and/or connections between things you've seen or found most of the time. This is made that much more important by how Anna takes a lot of different occult material and remixes it into its own pocket mythos, making any supernatural points of reference the player may have a bit less useful here.\n\nSpeaking of remixes, if you've played the non-Extended edition before, there are some new and remixed puzzles from the original version, so keep that in mind. Solutions have changed slightly, or at least, it felt as such. To be fair, it'd been a while since I finished Anna originally, so it could just be failures on my memory's part.\n\nDespite its occasional drifts into the obtuse, Anna - Extended Edition is a fun, sometimes frustrating romp through lingering dread and ambient menace. The encapsulated nature of the story presents something different from most rehashed horror trope-fests and is worth trying, if only to get your brainmeats flexing for a bit.\n\nIf you want a taste of the game, here's a -really- old clip of me exploring the starting area in the original version. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfEaD8peUQ","January 7","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy to control.\nBugs: none that i encountered.\nStory: meh.\nMotionsickness factor: I felt sick to some degree. Probably from the entire game being enclosed in a small house. :X\n\nFear: the game was creepy. Ambient sounds were alright. No jump scares at all, just things suddenly there that weren't there before...which at times took me by surprise. This is NOT an Amnesia-type game. It's not even action. It's more narrative.\n\nThis game has MULTIPLE endings. I only did 2. So with 8 different possible endings, I suppose this game might have replay value. I do not feel compelled to complete all 8.\nI needed to consult a walk through on several occasions. Some things just aren't very clear on how to proceed with the tasks. (example, the 'Intuition' icons at the top of the inventory screen, I had NO IDEA what they were for. I thought they were chapter markers.) I suppose if I took the time to read all the 'documents' and 'books' in the game, perhaps there would have been some indication or hint on the tasks, but the fonts used were bloody awful to read, sooooo nope.\n\nSO...would I recommend this game? I think I would say yes, but maaaaybe get it on sale and DON'T expect this game to be full of action and screams. It's really just slow paced and head-scratching.","May 25","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
