The object of all three of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective mysteries is to gather clues by deciding on what people and places to visit. Once you have gotten enough information to solve the crime/s you will go before a judge and he will ask a few questions that you must answer correctly.  Getting to the judge and answering questions using the fewest amount of clues that you can will give you a score. The goal is to solve the mystery by using only as many clues as it takes Holmes to solve the mystery. There is not a lot of replay ability in the game except if your score doesn't match Holmes' once you have solve the mystery.  I wouldn't expect it to take very many playthorughs to match Holmes scores.\n\nIf you like Sherlock Holmes , or some not too hard brain teasers, you will enjoy the game. It is only about 60-90 mins of total gameplay in most instances for each mystery. As for the price, I would definitely go the collection route as it's almost half price. I would probably also wait til it might be on sale as well.","January 20","true","2.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

I originally owned this game on Sega CD.  This game is short.  Given that it was originally bundled with 2 other cases when it first came out.  This game is alot better than I expected it to be given that I played the original version, either concerning video or the interface itself I came in expecting my experience on Sega CD and was suprised that it was better.  Hopefully they might release Volume II or III.  I did not hate the game and found it interesting. It's probably not for everybody and there are really better Sherlock games out there.  I bought it for Nostalgia purposes.  If you want to step into FMV history this is a good example of it.  Would I reccomend buying it? Yes.  But depending on what you want to buy it for.  I bought it for nostalgia purposes.  The game is decent, has it aged? Maybe a little....","September 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

I can't claim to be one of them. Despite that I had a great time searching the newspaper for clues and watching the live action cut scenes. Something about this game's cheap production values wins me over, from  the amature acting to the obvious sets.

Though it has little replay value, I quite liked it.\nI must confess, I've become so used to games holding your hand that the lack of mandatory instruction was confusing at first. However, it was not a very difficult game to figure out.\nYou read the newspaper and watch live-action cutscenes of Sherlock interviewing suspects. Then you put the evidence together and present it to a judge.\nIt was less of a game, and more like an interactive episode of an older Sherlock show.\nIf you enjoyed Sherlock Holmes: Crime and Punishment, this game is similar to it.\nDue to its lack of replay value, I would not advise spending over two dollars for this game.","December 12, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I was wrong. The game want's you to "enjoy the ride", so you can eighter read every single article from the four pertinent news papers you have and talk to the right people, OR YOU CAN DO LIKE ME and just talk to everyone you know that has a cutscene, which are for the most part relevant. Speaking of cutscenes, the acting is spot on (for the most part). It's a short game, mind you, but it's worth to buy the whole pack, if you're into misteries. Even if you don't, the acting of the main cast will subtily, but surely grab your atention. 7.8/10\n\n"Peter Farley > Whole cast of NCIS"","January 30","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You solve a case by skimming newspaper reports and visiting any places or people who seem like they might be relevant - when you think you've worked out the solution, you take it to court and answer a Q&A to see if you were right, with your score being the number of investigative dead-ends that you avoided.\n\nIt's enjoyable enough. The video scripts do a clunky but passable job of being written to work no matter what order you're investigating the leads in, and the British accents are largely terrible ("English toffee? My favourite!"), but flipping through newspaper clippings and following up on anything that catches your eye does a fair job of capturing the amateur detective genre.\n\nI don't think I'd bother to play any more games in the series, but I'd pick up the boardgame.","April 13","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Back then they were, although they barely could be called games, quite a successful series. Professional actors tell you a story, you are actually deciding only which story is told - you can follow even red herrings and wrong leads (which are quite costly in points) aim of the game is it, to get as close as possible to the rating that sherlock holmes achieved in a specific case. So you test your mettle against the hero of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles stories himself.\n\nThis is just a rerelease of the old series, and it's really good that those made a reapearance. Though the videos are pixelated (clunky) the game still has it's old charm. It is actually fun to follow the leads and try to figure out who is the culprit in the who dunnit. Let's just hope the rest of the series also makes a reappearance.\n\nThe Case of the Mummy's Curse was the firs in the first set of games, the story is quite well told - won't give too much details though, because you should try out this interactive "movie" and find out for yourself who was the murderer, and what other information about the victims turn up, and what motive the murderer had for each of his killings.\n\nPros:Nicely told narrative in form of an interactive short movie.The rating system is very transparent, therefore you always can actually see where you are going.The acting reminds a lot of the old black and white movies, which actually catches the atmosphere of the original Sherlock Holmes.Cons:Just to mention it, the clunkyness of the videos might be the biggest problem, but you have to keep in mind, that it's just a rerelease under a new company!It is really, really short and has only a very limited replayability value.\nRecommended\nI can recommend this game on various reasons. First it's obviously a game which is thought to be a short sidestory, in between like some nice and tasty morsel. The acting and voiceacting of the artists is really good, given the time that passed between release and present, it's timeless to watch a nice interactive movie that was so smoothly added into a game. There are no complicated game mechanics that might disturb users, no hidden buttons, no traps and tricks; Just plain storytelling, interviewing and decision making.\n\nBack in the nineties, the Consulting Detective Series was quite successful and founded the basis for a lot of other Sherlock Holmes games, most of them had to hold up against this series, which a lot of games, even adventure games with a lot more of variety couldn't reach the success of the Consulting Detective Stories.\n\nIt is a no brainer that I would recommend this game, alone for the nostalgic value of the series.","April 7","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sherlock and Watson were both uncharacteristic of anything I've seen. Didn't strike me as a super sleuth, the game was fun for 25 minutes.\n\nYou will scan newspapers for leads, check up on the leads and question characters via FMV. About 5-8 minutes of FMV per case completion. Extremely short and has little replay value but I still liked it.\n\nWould have rated higher if they didn't try to call this Sherlock Holmes, and it wasn't so short.\n\nWorth $0.50 max! Try to get all 3 cases for $0.99.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Definitely kind of dull but not a bad game. I think the biggest tip you can get, is to talk to all of the Regulars, even if it doesn't seem like it would be helpful. One big annoyance is when using the Clue hints, they are in an automatic order so it often gave me hints about things I had already done, which is annoying because it damages your score to get those hints. I also never really found much of a use for using the Irregulars, aside from how it affects your score, as they always seem to get the exact same info you get by going there with the detectives, but when using the detectives you at least get to see the short videos. So in that way it becomes an enjoyment versus score debate and either way you essentially lose.\nBottom line: If you like this sort of game then, splurge. An hour of my time was worth the 0.82 cents for the game.","December 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoegays/recommended/374010/","shoegays","shoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoegays/","513 products in account","A running theme through this series is that the game system is excellent and the cases fail to live up to the possibilities. It's just as true with The Mummy's Curse, though it's at least the best of a bad lot.\n\nThe biggest problem with The Case of the Mummy's Curse is it becomes fairly obvious who your culprit is early on and there is one absolutely threadbare path that allows you to haul ♥♥♥ to the conclusion with irresponsible speed. But if you reach that conclusion like most people would, by checking with witnesses, contacts, investigative resources, etc., you could have a thorough, airtight case that still won't satisfy the judge. The game requires that you've done investigation X while investigation Y is intended to make it more clear if you're hesitant to make an accusation.\n\nIt's a mystery that lets you approach the mystery from a bunch of different angles to build your case but only respects one of those angles as the true way to resolve it. It's reminiscent of getting stuck in a Phoenix Wright game where you've already reasoned through much of the mystery but struggle with understanding the tiny logical steps the game excepts Phoenix to make in order to catch up with you.","May 2","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
