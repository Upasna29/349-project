While I agree that such themes are important, and I even agree with the positions the game forces you to take, being /forced/ into those positions kinda defeats the purpose of "Choice Of Games", doesnt it?\n\nI can't recommend the game because:\n1) If you agree with the postions that the game forces on you, then there is no game.\n2) If you /don't/ agree with the positions that the game forces on you, then you'll find yourself totally unable to express your opinions.\n3) In either case, the game is hardly worth of the title -- it is really more of a quasi-interactive book.\n\nI'm not going into details of the games message because its irrelevant to my recommendations.  I rather suspect that I'll get a dozen comments accusing me of a bigot, so if you /really/ want to know, read the comment thread. :(","April 23","false","0.5"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","39","57","0","0"

You play as a merfolk living in a mersociety. I love that the game does not bury you with tons of merfolk backgrounds in the beginning, but rather introduce you to the society through several dialogue choices scattered throughout the game. Many dialogue choices inform you of some relevant truth before you make the choice.\n\nCharacter development is average in The Sea Eternal, but whatever it loses in character dimensionality, it makes up for with its huge plot. You are placed in the controversial world of merfolks in which the very concepts of your life, memories, and identity are a well plotted scheme. Throughout your journey, you will inspire younger versions of yourself to either fall for or avoid the scheme. I myself have had the misfortune of pushing everyone I care about down the cliff. But the fact that you will inspire others to fall despite sensing that something is off is just what makes The Sea Eternal so beautiful.\n\nIf you enjoy choose-your-adventure games with mind-blowing plots and don't mind melancholy, you should definitely pick up The Sea Eternal.","April 25","true","0.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/visceralbobcat/recommended/463320/","visceralbobcat","Riovanes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/visceralbobcat/","295 products in account","I had very high hopes for this starting out.\nOne of Lynnea Glasser's previous works, Creatures Such as We, was what first sparked my interest in CYOA games (though it was later with Choice of Robots that got me seriously into them) so I bought this as soon as it was available. I ended up not doing my first playthrough for quite a while and by then the reviews had started to show up. I was surprised and honestly a bit disappointed to see the overall ratings. They caused me to delay even longer. All that aside, though, my actual thoughts on the game.\n\nFirstly and most importantly: this was EXTREMELY engaging for me. I'm sitting here at 9am, with about 4 and a half hours put into navigating the story and then several more thinking about what I'd just read. That should speak for itself.\nA lot of people mention how this is a "message" game and while I can't really dispute that it didn't feel that way to me. There were definitely some, uh, "PC" elements but they never detracted from the story. They were well couched in the themes and elements of the setting that they felt quite natural... most of the time. Though, as always, with this type of content your mileage may vary.\n\nAs for the actual writing and editing... top notch. I really don't think there's any argument here, whatever people may think of the content. I may not exactly at my best due to sleep deprivation (and if there are any errors in this: sorry) but I didn't notice any typos or anything of the sort. The writing was concise without being too brief and generally quite evocative. Aaaaaand speaking of concise... the length. My first playthrough definitely took less than an hour and the many half-skipped-over proceeding playthrough, totalling about 5 or 6, only ate up about 3-4 more.\n\nNow, I'm far from done with this but already this isn't a bad amount of time for a CYOA game to keep my attention. My only real complaint is that I find myself unable to get a lot of the things I want to happen to happen. I don't know if this is a lack of freedom, overly harsh choice requirements or my own addled ineptitude but it's getting pretty annoying. I may have to ammend this section in the future, but for now it's... a problem. Not a huge one, but still.\n\nAnyways I feel like I'm in equal parts rambling and entirely missing the point of a review so I'll wrap this up. Interesting, complex setting with generally interesting characters and some pretty seriously dramatic branching paths.\n\nI give it a "pretty great" out of 10.\n\n(Again, apologies for the probably massive number of typos and errors both grammatical and logical.)","April 28","true","4.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supersilverwing/recommended/463320/","Supersilverwing","Smooth Buttery Dick Biscuit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supersilverwing/","767 products in account","I really do enjoy these sort of ''games'' as these stories really add up in the world of story telling, and this world. As this story takes places in the ocean as a mermaid, I don't wanna spoil much what happends more. But I really love the idea of transgender character(s), lesbian lovers or just doing both genders. Or choose you don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about love at all.\nI would recomend it if you enjoy these sort of stories with a path to choose your own.\nIt's sure a diffrent twist then some random mermaid story, but very good.\n\n-Little edit-\nI wrote this late night, and forgot to add that some things are really forced into the game. As you can't really choose that way and just get pushed into the direction. otherwise it's pretty good only a shame they kinda force some ways.","April 23","true","3.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

A big problem with this is at the end game, there will be major choices that will decide what ending you will get and only a few one will be available\nto you depending on your personality stats, the rest will be grey. and since in this game what choices raise or lower stats is NOT CLEAR AT ALL! tries after tries i tried different combination of choices to raise my stat to a certain degree so i can select the ending that i considered to be best and it just never works, i hope the developer take this into consideration into making the next game since I loved creature such as we.","April 25","false","1.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

But the route was such an awkward close and tried to guilt me out of it so many times that I'm not sure why it was made to be an option at all. If this is what all of the endings are going to be like (minus the one that it's trying to push me towards), this is going to be a pretty unsatisfying game.
