So if you want music, be prepared to launch the Steam music player. LOL.\n\nIf you buy this game now, the only benefit you will get is being a part of the development process and helping give the devs input on what they can add and do to improve the game.\nI honestly think this game won't be finished for at least another year or so. But at least the devs got the foundation done.\n\nThey are at least honest enough to admit that what the game offers now is extremely limited, in it's beginning stages and nowhere near done.\n\nLet's just hope the devs come through and don't pull an incident like the devs of The Stomping Land... smh, everytime I think of that game.\nBut if the devs for Pro Wrestling X pull through, we are in for a bada$$ wrestling game to look forward to in the future. :D\n\nRemember buying this game now is at your own risk.\n\nGood luck to the devs making this game.","November 18, 2014","true","0.4"," 86 of 105 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","86","105","0","7"

The game is rather stiff feeling, and clearly needs quite a bit of animation work to bring it in line with the intended dream of making a modern day version of the Aki series of wrestler games from the late 90's back to life.  If you had a Nintendo 64 and were into wrestling (when wrestling was at it's peek, you played some of those Aki games)  you played some of those games.  Whether it was the huge rosters, or the ability to create some of your favorite super stars (Was really easy to create characters that resembled their real life counterparts because the graphics were kind of poo poo and blurry)  you played them like they were going out of style.  I'm sure many people like myself popped in your gameshark and fired up some codes, change the ring mat, unlock extra wrestler slots as permanent wrestlers who didn't count against the CAW slots, heck I even seem to recall unlocking The Big Show wrestle-mania 2000 after he was removed from the game and sent back down to OVW for his weight issues.\n\nWith that said, Pro Wrestling X has a long way to go before it begins to even slightly resemble the Aki games, but (almost always a but)  the developers have passion, and seem to be trucking away.  (Rather slowly but the project isn't abandoned)  Does the game need work, in the words of the immortal Stone Cold Steve Austin..  "Oh hell yeah" but I think given the time and money this game could be a shining beacon of success..   With that said, if you don't buy into the dream you should avoid this product until a later date.  I would call this game more of a demo version, rather than a full fledged game.  You can play it for sure, but using the same 3 wrestlers and 1 wrestler you can edit gets boring, the lack of fluid in the motions is nothing like the Aki games which glided like a hot knife through butter.\n\nMy personal hopes for the game\n\nSure up character movements and animations, the buttons seem rather sluggish and that makes the game rather un-fun to play, I'm not personally sure if it's an animation issue or a button imput issue, but pressing a button and having the game wait 3 seconds to carry out that action makes the game feel much worse than it really is.\n\nCreate more wrestlers, it gets really boring playing with 3 wrestlers...  If you had a bit more variety in wrestlers a person could overlook most of the technical limitations and still let the game carve out it's own niche.  As it stands right now, 3 generic masked wrestlers (albeit very well designed and cool looking wrestlers) leave the gamer saying meh, I don't really have any reason to play.\n\nWork on adding some additional match types, maybe a hardcore match with weapons would do the trick, give us fun things to do, which protect against the negative aspects of the game-play, until those issues get worked out.  Nothing major, but the more additions the less likely people will be to notice the glaring issues the game has.  Give us some replay value for the money we plunk down, meat and potatoes can be a good distraction.\n\nAdd in some additional music tracks.. (I loved the one looping music track, absolutely loved it) the one track included was really awesome... like banging my head while throwing up my devil horns and banging my head awesome, but after it loops for the third time, you're left going... ugh, I don't think I like this song as much anymore..\n\nCut the music during the matches and add in some sound effects, I understand the music is there to cover the fact that no sound effects are in place for matches, but that will help immerse us in the product.  Is commentary of some sort planned for the future, I don't recall the Aki games having commentary, but at the very least including the mat hits, punches, kicks, and splats would go a long way.\n\nMy recommendation\n\nI'm going to recommend this game (I know, I know, it sounds like I'm trashing it right?)  Well I'm not, I think the potential for a wonderfully amazing retro wrestling game is there, it's sitting there, a few updates and additions away from poking it's glam 80's metal hair band head out of the ring, throwing some punches, doing a few suplex's and telling the haters to SUCK IT!!!!  This game needs ALOT of work, it's a real mess right now, but it has potential, and developers who seem to care and have a real passion for bringing this dream to reality.\n\nIf you aren't willing to support development and wait.. (probably a LONG LONG) time, I'd suggest not buying the game right now.  For people who want to make an investment and help fund and support a wrestling gamer fan's dream I'd fully recommend buying this game and waiting for a few more patches to really pass judgement.  The game's cost of $9.99, may seem like a lot compared to other games you can get on steam for the same price, but the major difference is none of them are aiming to deliver a preeminent throw back wrestling experience.   If you remember the attitude era, you remember DX telling everyone to SUCK IT!!!,  Manking winning the WWF championship and WCW spilling the beans live on the air, resulting on WWF Raw putting out some of their best ratings ever, this game will probably eventually have you feeling like Val Venus, (not when Val was having his member threatened by Kai n Tai, but when he was saying HELLLOOOO LADIES)  and loving it..\n\nTrust me when I say, right now this game is like a new born baby, just starting to open it's eyes, seeing light for the first time, getting a robust slap on the behind to kick start the crying..  Just remember while you may feel like a loser for owning this game in it's current state, if someone tries to speak negatively about you because of it, just remind them, "YOU WERE NUMBER 1 ONCE IN YOUR LIFE" that glorious day you won the race up the birth canal.. Much like you developed into an amazingly talented young man, with a great job, a beautiful wife, and 2 1/2 adoring children, this game will eventually bloom into a beautiful flower.  If you don't have ADHD and expect it to get there over night.. or this year, or possible even in 10 years, just know it will probably get there at some point before the females at your favorite strip club begin to call you grey bush..","April 2","true","0.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","3"

This game is actually updated now!!!" on every single outdated review, and the dev is bragging about updating now.\n\nThis game has changed a little since November.  There are a few new moves, a momentum meter, and basic AI logic.  Those are your "many updates" you're parading around and bragging about.  That's what's been added in the last 9 months. There have been excuses as to why development has been slow and I understand that things happen, but we're talking about the decision as to making a purchase here.  This game is $10.  It's been clear that people aren't necessarily purchasing a game, but a promise.  A small handful of updates recently does not absolve the huge gap of nothing but excuses.  $10 is purchasing a promise that is not guaranteed to come true and it is a HUGE risk to buy in on this promise that has a long history of disappointment and very little to show for it.\n\nI'm also sick of hearing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of "We've been updating sometimes twice per day lately" because I distinctly remember hearing something along the lines of 'we're updating more than most early access titles" back in November.  That is just offensive. People bought in because of that statement thinking this was going somewhere and all we got were excuses.  You go and make this new statement and more people see some minor updates, buy in, and then what?  9 more months of excuses.  This game does not update frequently.  ARK: Survival Evolved updates frequently.  Getting to this minor milestone of being able to have a 1/2 star match after 9 months is not a worthwhile investment that should be recommended to potential buyers.  I'm sorry but it's not.\n\nThere's not even a manageable UI at this stage.  Discovering the controls is pure guesswork.  That should have been a priority above anything else. You added more moves without telling people how to actually DO them!\n\nLook, I get it, this is a small developer trying to make a big game, but Early Access is Early Access.  It has the good side and the bad side.  The good side are your games like ARK, that are updated daily, released in a playable semi-polished state that improves steadily.  Pro Wrestling X is the bad side of Early Access.  It's the game that goes on hiatus immediately after it becomes available for purchase, doesn't update for months, and after 9 months of development, has very little to show for it. I know ARK has a big team and all and PWX has like 2 and a half people, but it doesn't change the fact that they both have the same title of Early Access and one is worth the investment while the other isn't yet.\n\nI stand by my original review.  This game DOES have potential, but the promise of a game is just too risky to invest in at this point.  Bragging about updates and having pathetic white knights downvote and comment on outdated reviews does nothing to make this product worth purchasing.  It's only trying to hide and mask the current state of this game that's not worth investing in (in my opinion) so that more people will buy the game (because "oh hey the bad reviews are downvoted, they must be wrong! Also, Updaetz!")\n\nI will update the review when my opinion changes, and if that happens, it will bring me great joy.  I want this game to succeed but as of right now I do not recommend this game, and going around downvoting and posting on 5-month-old reviews does nothing to make me feel better about the product that I invested in as soon as it came on Steam.\n\nOriginal Review Below from March 30, 2015:\n\nVery basic and shows promise, but since the game was put on steam there have been *EDIT* A Few *END EDIT* updates and a whole bunch of empty promises.  Hopefully it gets better with time, but right now, I would recommend to stay away and just follow the game until it gets to something resembling the developers' vision.  It's not worth playing in its current state and it DEFINITELY isn't worth $9,99","March 30, 2015","false","1.6"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","40","58","0","8"

The game has been in development for a very long time.  In fact it had a failed kickstarter over 3 years ago..  and was being talked about for a few years prior to the failed kickstarter  So we'll be kind and say it's been in development for 3 years, the store page says the release date was Nov 2014, but it's been in development for far longer than that.\n\nThe game is supposed to mimic a the Aki styled wrestling games, WWF No Mercy, WCW vs NWO, etc etc etc..  These games came out over 16 years ago!!!!  16 year old tech.\n\nUnfortunately for Pro Wrestling X, the long development time hasn't translated into a good game, or much of a game at all.  The game is in Early Access because of that some wiggle room should be given, but with each successive patch the game gets closer to it's full release, the current patch 0.94, seems to suggest the next patch will be the one that takes it out of Early Access.\n\nThis game is no where near ready for full release, it has a grand total of 3 wrestlers....  3!!!!,,  The movements and controls are stiff and kind of rancid in all honesty.  Aki games were smooth, fluid, and even though the graphics weren't all that good, the games were amazingly fun to play.\n\nThis isn't a game as much as a concept, it's like a tech demo of something someone would put togther to show off what they wanted to do in a finished product.\n\nThe game features 3 match types, single vs single, triple threat and a 4 way.\n\nThe game has 3 wrestlers and 1 CAW slot wrestler that you can edit.\n\nWhen judging this game it needs to be understood that this is a game based on tech from 16 years ago...  I can't fathom how this project can be so bare bones, unpolished and unfinished as it's been in development for over 3 years.  I can't hate on the developers though, they have passion, and really talk like they want to make a memorible game, unfortunately I think this should have stayed as someone's pet project, it really doesn't belong on steam.  I'm not sure if the problem is a lack of developers, a lack of money, lack of time or some combination of all of them.\n\nI think at this point any new comers should be very leary about buying into this idea, the developement time is running at a snails pace, and you could very well see your 10 dollar investment turn into a 10 dollar loss.\n\nAs a hugh Aki fan it saddens me that this game is in such a poor state, I think it's a safe bet to assume many of gamers are tired of the same old garbage WWE game which gets released yearly which feels super arcady.  We want a real simulation wrestling game, and unfortunately Pro Wrestling X isn't going to be that game... atleast not for quite a few years, if at all..\n\n\n\n","March 31","false","0.2"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","3"

(seems to be worst compared to last time I undated my review but more wrestlers in the ring at the same time seems to be the problem so hopeful sorted next patch).\n- Interference (As in having the same wrestler attacking you for example Grasshopper is in the ring vs Grimhold then Grasshopper runs out to attack Grasshopper needs to be a different wrestler to the two in the ring).\n-Needs more of lot things in fact, Match types (has got single and 3 way and 4 way matches know so improving), create modes (these are starting to enter the game in a very basic form, but getting more advanced every patch it seems),crowds (Are in but still very basic can be improved a lot), arenas (Same arena but we can change things like colours and logos in game as well as simple moding allows us to swap out signs and similar things by replacing the files with the same name etc), referees (still non) etc.\n\nI have added a vid of the current build what is 0.752 so you can see if it is worth buying for you out there right now.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMo0tM6phJ8\n\nPlus I have edited my review a little since more updates have come out and here is my next updated video to the current build what is 0.785 (and yes I have a better mic for this one).

Regardless of the version number, this game has a long way to go before being a release for mass consumption.  It is an incredibly limited experience right now in regards to match types, attack/grapple variety, appearance, and small touches such as the fixed camera angle, the inability to leap over a downed opponent while walking/running, etc.  From all appearances the game is far better than the initial steam release, and the team does care about feedback from those who purchase.

Definitely had my excitement with this title reinvigorated.\n\nI am hugely appreciative to have recieved a response from the developers acknowledging my concerns, and I really hope they can keep up this frequent update cycle. I wish them all the best and hope that all goes well from here on out, if they can keep up any sort of frequent bug fix/content updates and avoid another very lengthy drought they could have a great title on their hands.\n\n\n\n\n--- ORIGINAL REVIEW CIRCA MAY 6TH ---\n\nDo not buy at present. This game is very much an Early Access title, with a barebones framework currently in place - a barebones framework that hasn't seen any updates since late 2014.\n\n- Before I go on, I'd like to say that I will gladly change this review once any substantial updates are made to the game. -\n\nI appreciate that events occur that hamper development, but I've been rapidly losing patience with this game for some time now, and this is coming from a Kickstarter backer. I knew what I was getting into, but I didn't think updates to the game itself would be THIS scarce. I appreciate there is a small team developing this title, but six+ months with no public updates to the game itself isn't good for a team of any size or budget. This has been exacerbated for me by the way the game is discussed in the Wrestling Gamers United newsletter run by the developers - whilst I understand that the newsletter is not just about their game, it is the perfect platform to talk about the game directly to their audience, and there have been multiple occasions even recently where I've been excited that a newsletter from the team has come through, then dismayed to see that the game's progress is either not mentioned at all or briefly mentioned in passing amongst a number of other things. I like the generally casual atmosphere the developers are projecting onto the community but there really needs to be some more formality in talking about the game's progress.\n\nThe team have apologised for the lack of updates, and still connect with their fanbase through livestreams showing off the game's progress, but there seriously needs to be some public updates to the game posted to Steam to keep any sort of larger fanbase going. Even being allowed to play around with the unstable developer versions through the Steam Beta service would be some sort of signal that the game is still being actively worked on.

I then waited patiently for 6 minutes so I could write a review.\n\nThis game is unplayable at this point, but if you watched the video it isn't meant to be. The developers released it early access to allow die hard fans of the N64 era of wrestling an opportunity to voice their input. The only positive thing I can say at this point is that the character models look fantastic. This game has a long way to go, but I am extremely optomistic that the end product will result in the best wrestling game since N64's WWF No Mercy.\n\nTo the development team,\n\nI just wanna thank each and every one of ya'll, for all you've done to your bodies....

It is difficult to recommend since there is so little to do in this game, especially since this is not the final version. And admittedly, while I understand that it is an Early Access release that's stripped to the bare bones and that they have a small team, after what was promised and displayed on their Kickstarter nearly a year ago (including blocking and spirit meters), I expected more. While I understand why some would recommend that you should try this game out at this stage anyways because A) this game will be updated over time and will get better, B) there aren’t many choices for wrestling games on the PC to begin with, and C) the market is saturated with WWE games and variety is needed, it is woefully below fans and supporters expectations.\n\nWhile it models itself off of the AKI games, there is a possibility that it will be able to do things that the AKI games could not do, and if you are a fan of those games, than you should defiantly give this a chance. However, I would personally recommend that you wait until it is further developed and more ideal before trying the game out.\n\nWhat I would like to know:\n\nIf you are modeling this off of the AKI Games, then will we have the ability to have matches with rounds, to have MMA style matches? I know this feature is available in VPW2.\n\nWill there be a 10 count for matches like Last Man Standing and deathmatches, in addition to TKOs?\n\nIf you work on an opponent’s limb during the match, will there be limb damage?\n\nWill wrestlers get fatigued if they are in long matches?  If so, will there be a “breathing” button if help them recover? It was something I saw in King of Colosseum 2 where wrestler will get tired after a period of time and needs to take breather before continuing with the match, and thought it was an interesting feature.\n\nWill there be post match ratings, in regards to how good the match is? It’s another idea I saw in KOC2.\n\nWill we be able to do corner moves to someone propped up on the guardrail?\n\nWill we be able to do a figure four around the ring post a la Bret Hart?\n\nWill there be the option of tag and non tag handicap matches? Will they be single fall or elimination?\n\nHow many guys can be on screen at a time, 6,8,10? It’s important to know if it will be possible to have Survivor Series style matches, proper Lumberjack matches,  proper battle royales, and even WarGames/Lethal Lockdown type of matches somewhere in the future.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\nBeing able to press slam, overhead suplex, and back body drop opponents over the top rope and to be able to do moves off of the cage. We were able to do this in the Acclaim series of wrestling games, but not in the AKI games.\n\nThe option to win by pin, submission, escape, and/or first blood in a cage match. Plus the ability to have cage tag matches, and cage triple threat matches and cage four ways as well. Another thing we were able to do in the Acclaim games, but not the AKI games.\n\nWhile I don’t personally think it is vital to have ladder matches, table matches, TLC matches and such at this time, I do think that we should be able at least to climb ladders, set up and stack tables, prop up weapons in the corner, and leap off of chairs onto opponents like Sabu. WWF Raw, the only major wrestling game for PC in the last 15 years, never did these things.\n\nI think it is more important that we are able to fight in the crowd than backstage, although it is nice to know that you are working on backstage areas as well. If we fight in the crowd, then we should be able to leap off and throw others off of balconies.\n\nVariation of match types – 1 vs 3 handicap matches, Gauntlet matches (single and tag), multi man tag matches, Survivor Series matches, triangle matches (elimination triple threat), stable matches, and a proper Royal Rumble (2 men start off, and eliminations only by throwing them over the top rope).\n\nHopefully, you will be able to get a few more people working with you so that the game can be done faster. Or give us a timetable to let us know when you expect things to be done.\n\nEDIT (June 23): The updates made to the game have vastly improved it. More moves, more taunts (including American Grasshopper’s signature taunt), health meters, music, even mats have been added to the outside of the ring. And as they have a new programmer who is really good at what he does, and we finally have an idea as to what the next scheduled updates will be, it should ease the concerns of those who wonder if the game is progressing.\n\nAfter going from recommended to not recommended, I would say that this game is a recommended purchase, final decision. This game is getting there, and is slowly but surely starting to become the game that everyone has been dreaming about. After the bungled release of WWE 2k15 (no port should have so many problems), this has restored my faith in wrestling games ending up on Steam and on the PC.\n\nP.S. Didn’t know you were originally going to use the Fire Pro way of delivering finishers. I like that system. It’s pretty cool, although what you have in the game (No Mercy/AKI style) is nice too.","February 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't buy if you expect to have a match.\n\nPro Wrestling X aims to bring back the N64 style wrestling games, and already you can see their influence in the very few animations in the game.\n\nCurrently the game only has one grapple move, one strike, one pin, and hundreds of bugs!\n\nI recommend this project, as it is a much needed addition to not only PC gaming, but gaming in general.\nWWE games are pretty average.

The controls are really straightforward and have a great feel to them, throws are quick but not lightning unseeable fast, the animations all look pretty great even being work in progress, everything is what a wrestling game should be. Right now of course there are limited throws, wrestlers, rings, so on and so forth, but the foundation is SOLID and all this game needs is some time. The build I'm playing as of September 8th has one strike and like 5 throws and I'm already having fun with it, the game is just satisfying to play.","September 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

So basic it plays like those old fighter demos from back in the day where you could only choose from one of the two characters and play on one stage. However right now as of it's most current build you can edit a third wrestler and make him your own with a very basic editing system that they currently put into the game. Also the game handles nicely on a Nvidia GT610 card with 4GB of memory in "1280x720 full screen resolution" with "fantastic graphics mode" chosen. Anyways if you liked the N64 No Mercy style of game play this is what they are working towards and I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's a work in progress but it's worth the $9.99 if you want to try it out in it's early access form.

First time a Wrestling Game is on the PC, and I'm already impressed,\nheck, excited!\n\n\nFor Starters:\nThe Main Menu greets me with a bad @$$ Rock Song, and a small, albeit user\nfriendly Options and Keyboard / Controller Ready Interface, my\nLogitech PC Controller already feels at home in Pro Wrestling X\n(w/out the need for JoytoKey?? Color me impressed!) Whoever made this\ngame Controller friendly; great job!\n\nThe Menu is all here: Single Play, Options, Edit, Credits, etc.\nEach Menu item is simple, and covers the Basics, like a good\nFighting / Wrestling Game should, and I got everything in my Options tweaked and Saved in a jiffy.\n\nHowever, I would like to see Mouse Support; a PC Wrestler Game w a Mouse\nis the stuff of dreams. Maybe even Touch Screen Interface on future PC Platforms....\n\nThe Edit Mode already shows promise:  I made a Ring and a Fighter, with\nthe help of the present interface, very user friendly, and with a healthy\nlist of Edit Options. It reminded me of older Wrestler Games from\nye Old School; simple, but fun to make.\n\nThe CAW mode is a huge seller for me, in any Wrestler, and this one does\nit nicely. The textures and details really look convincing. The Lucha Libre styled Mask and matching pads are a very classy touch, the one that caught my eye invoked an almost Draconic feel. I dig it.\n\nOf course, I wouldn't a Female Wrestler Option. A Sable and/or Chyna -esque\nwrestling hottie in HD, with the return to "the N64 / No Mercy Era"??\nDoing a Bronco Buster in the Corner??  mmmm giggidy!!\n\nAnd an Editable Moves List. (Sorry, had to say it!)\n\nAnyway. I can't wait to see how the Edit Mode Evolves!\n\nGameplay Wise: It's got the basic nuts and bolts down; the Moves work like\nthey should: the Strikes hit accurately, The Grabs do do their job, the\nGuard works, like No Mercy... etc.\n\nThe AI Edit is a welcome feature, and the AI Bot works well enough.  I\nstarted with\nInactive, to get the Game Play down pat, then bump it up as we got things\nunder way.\n\nBetween the DDT and Tower Suplex, that alone made me grin.\nAnd that Dragon Sleeper has never looked cooler. (One of my old stand byes.\nnow we just need a Dragon Suplex!!)\n\nSpeaking of which, I'm hoping to see some Back Grapples. Seeing a\nDragon Suplex, or Tossing German Suplex or a Rough Toss, in this this games edgy appearance, would be a treat.\n\nI noticed the "Left Bumper" (left, front Shoulder Button, or\n"L1" in PlayStation speak)\ndoes a Back Step, with the hands raised. I wonder; Reversals?\n(I sure hope so!)\n\nThe Run... done with the Y Button on my Controller, well... it's archaic.\nHate to say it. In current Wrestling Games, you have a "Free Run", hold a Shoulder Button, and Run Freely.\nTry that, see if it works.\n\nSo far, in Game Play, the game runs pretty smooth. The pacing is a little\nsluggish, I would like to see more variation in individual Fighter Speeds;\nhow fast / slow they move, how fast they get up, etc. Personally, I wouldn't mind a feature were your Fighter quickly clambers to his / her feet, or Kips Up, or even an Ukemi: a quick Roll off the Ground, when you are knocked down.  Things like this make a game flow quickly and smoothly.\n\nI notice, when I interact with my opponent; several opportunities to attack\nin unique ways:\nwhile the AI was in several different and prone positions; such as bent over,\nsitting up, getting up etc, I'm thinking: different Holds, Grapples, Strikes,\netc; in all the enemies varying postures.  More ways to mess with the\nopposition in his/hers many vulnerable states, would really spice the\nMoves List Up.\n\nAlso, ways to Break and Cancel your own Holds / Grabs, and possibly flow\ninto another move, or simply Release the Opponent, to set up a "big surprise",\nwould be neat.\n\nOther then that; between the Basics: Strikes, Grabs, Lifting the Opponent off\nthe Mat, and getting yourself up, fairly quick... it's all there.\n\nI hope we can exit the ring soon. The Outside Ring Count Down, before a DQ, should be Optional.\nAlso, gotta have Back Stage Areas. Like No Mercy. I miss those.\n\nOn a Side Note: 1. The In Match Song. KEEP THAT. It's a kick @$$ song.\nIn Match Music is good Music, PLEASE, NO BORING COMMENTARY.\n2.  A variety of Music and Songs, would be awesome.\nPersonally, I'm thinking: 8 and 16 Bit Era Music, Rock and Metal, or Techno\nand Rave.\n\nOn that note, if you do decide on Commentary in Ring:\nA. Keep it witty. Like SVR 2006 witty. It made laugh at times.\nB. Use your In House Voice talent, from your Development Team, to run\nCommentary:\nmake Fictional Characters of yourselves, you inject yourself into your own\nwork this way, (and save money on Actors lol) you get to goof off in\nDevelopment, and when your Testers\nlisten to In Match Commentary; you can say: "Yup, that's me!"\nDave Wishnowski; In Game Host, Narrator, Announcer, etc... heck, screen\nyourself, and  your Team,  in the Announcer Chairs, Audience, Back Stack\nInterviews...! OWN IT, DUDE.. That would we cool.\nC. Make Commentary, In Match Music / Songs, heck, even running Dev. Team\ntalks, Options, that can Toggled In the Options Menu, under Music Options.\nThis way, we have the Option of hearing Songs, Music, Narrative, Ect,\nin the Games Matches.\n\nI can picture:  Directors Cut Commentary, on the evolution of Pro Wrestling X,\nin a Match.\nOr random goofing off on the mic. Just a thought.\n\nBut keep it all Optional. Different strokes, right?\nThis way, your more involved in the game's progress.\n\nMy Favorite thing, thus far, is the way the game itself looks:  The Ring Itself.\nIn a Shadowy Darkness. No Crowd. No Ref. No Announcer. The soft focus glow,\ncomplimented by the colors, highlights, the lighting and shadows.... duuuuude,\nkeep that. Or at least, make it an Option. I already dig the aesthetics of the\n"Current Look". I hope that look sticks around, very dramatic... like a\nPlay Wright, or an Opera Scene.  If you use a crowd, make them look Shadowy,\nlike a dramatic play.\n\nAn Idea:  make a scene like a Japanese Dojo, keep the lighting low, lit by\ncandles, and have the Crowd on Traditional Mats, like an Asian Teahouse,\nwith their faces barely showing in the candle light and shadows.\n\nAnother Idea:  A nod to the Undertaker, and his Acolytes, keep the Ring dark, &\nlit with Torches.\nIdeas like this, make a game memorable.  (Remember WCW Thunder, PS1? It had\ncrazy Stages!)\n\n\nBut so far, the Game Play is off to good start, man!! Keep it up\n\n\nOverall, I'm excited. I can't wait to see where Pro Wrestling X goes, and see\nwhere the Crazy Train ends up next!!\n\nThe 2nd Coming of No Mercy is upon us. I can feel it.\n\nBut remember:  Just like a Dragon's Claw never stops growing, never stop\nimproving. Do not be satisfied with limits; Evolve, Grow, Adapt. The Journey\nto true Greatness, never ends. It continues, like a River's Flow, steady and\nsure.","October 4, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I have read it has been too much years in the making. Now it seems a near beta game, but I feel like I would become old before it will be completely finished, but I will enjoy the ride.\n\nAfter big updates the game change near everything, the menu seems more friendly and the game is more playable but it needs some work yet.\n\nA great update is the edit options for wrestlers and rings.\n\nThe wrestler edit menu is quite basic, the main problem is it have to few options (most of them have 3 different options and there are 8 colours), I hope the add more items soon because is hard to make different wrestler when you have to reuse some options because you have 3 options.\n\nThe ring edit menu is great, but I had the problem that you choose the options with the left stick but it is used to rotate the ring too and you must try to get back to prior position with the right stick to watch what are you doing.\n\nYou can play a match 1 vs 1 choosing from the wrestlers and rings you have saved. You can choose the IA difficulty and the game works smooth, sometimes it seems slow, but I choose the best graphics option, probably other options are faster (need to try).\n\nI missed too much the key display in options easy accessible from the match menu. I don't know how to activate the "finisher" when the special displays in the hub.\n\nI didn't find any use to run, probably there are no running moves yet.\n\nI didn't messed up with the camera because the during game it seems fine, I only get a little annoying with the music, because I'm not used to have music during a match instead the ambient and FX, and commentary... The problem I see is that when the match get longer the music repeat more times and take you out of the feeling it gives you at the begining.\n\nI can't recomend to anyone looking for a finished game, although I encourage you if you are a wrestling or indie fan and want to back it up, it's just at the begining but it looks good and promising.\n\nIt is being hard to me to update because I have less time and willpower to enjoy the beta-tester work now that WWE 2k15 is in steam.

So why should you play this game? well to me the game is now back in moving to there games goals and very quickly too so every time you play you may get something new happen to the gameplay. The gameplay at the moments is getting better and i think for the long time we found our ecw of wrestlings games there going aganest the norm of 2k wwegames. In today gaming world FPS, Fighting, Wrestling and more are going easy old mortal kombat games it was hard to hit that finish move and first person games you use to be able to go any where now it go to a to b, wrestling games now follow going hit one button and have a cutscene of the ring breaking well now we got this game trying to bring that hardcore gaming back to wrestling free wrestling style. the furture i see in this game are great i think we could see a corner move that only happens in 3 way match the powerbomb suplex combro that will not need a cutscene it just happen on the move.\n\nhere is the list of good things i like about pwx\n. There listling to there fans\n. You get that old wrestling game feeling\n. wrestling moves look real\n. The ring is good to look.\n.the gameplay is getting better by the months.\n\nnow to the things i want to see in the game\n. The leather stap match\n. bruse body parts say you fight for a hour i want to see them beat up\n. face paint that could come off when beat up\n. Ladder match\n.

Put off purchasing it for a few months but with the latest updates it looked like it wouldn't be bad for the price to even just tinker around with, and decided to get it. It is fun for just tinkering around and playing for a couple minutes at the time being, but looks like it will be so such more.","September 24, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I first read about it in an article in a game magazine (Game Informer I think) in the early 2000's. I have desired to support the project monitarily since around 2005 but I just haven't been able to muster the extra funds. I'm happy I can finally contribute to the early access, even if the game never developes past what it has become, I have to give Dave and the crew respect for not giving up on their dream and I wish them all the best success. I respect the perseverance and heart of this project.\n\nI am giving this game a thumbs up, not because I enjoyed playing the current build, but because I was finally able to physically interact with a project that for over a decade has been only screen shots and commentary. I do have some criticisms of the build but I will find a different outlet for those as I am a hardcore wrestling game fan and I suspect the average gamer might not understand my reasons.\n\nIt is encouraging to see the makings of a creation suite at this early stage. The addition of the ability to take snapshots with a free camera, adjust and customize rings, and create a wrestler will allow us to see these features grow along with the core mechanics of the game and that excites me.\n\nSo, I'll save my criticisms for a different time and place. Thank you Dave for sticking with your vision through the many years, your dream is also the dream of many others. Be encouraged that after all these years we still have not seen a valid successor to WWF No Mercy, if it is to be it is up to you!","September 20, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

(Original Review Below for reference)\n\n\nWhen I first played this and declined to give it an overall recommendation for purchasing it, it was, in fact, extremely early in development as far as steam goes. Anything and everything the community said about the developer, honestly, loomed in the back of my mind like a heel turn at a PPV when you know good and well the star heel of the federation is taking a break being hurt (aka - Shooting a movie) and someone has to pick up the torch.\n\nAfter loading it up, however, I was greeted to a new menu. Progress. I liked it. I played around with the edit button and this part of the area. It is easy to see the foundation work in place, but the developer is wisely persuing gameplay advances. So let me get to that.\n\nA quick selection started the up and coming Default... yeah.. I forgot to rename him before I saved... against Grasshopper. After seeing each character given a serviceable in ring introduction, the contest was started. Default was determined... he walked up to Grasshopper and punched.\n\nGrasshopper blocked it?\n\nWhat... when... okay.. This is new.. So I backed up to collect my thoughts coincidentally right as Grasshopper attempted a drop kick. Thankfully I was back far enough. A few grapple moves instead and some playing around with button combinations... as if I expected to shoot a fireball out of my hands.. And bam. Default had his first win, but it wasn't just his.\n\nFans of the old schoo N64 wrestling games where it was all about fun have won, too. Pro Wrestling X is alive and definately on track.\n\nDon't get me wrong. This is STILL early access. And the developer clearly keeps that thought forefront in all his materials. It is just now, there is a lot of improvement and the game has earned a definite thumbs up from me. If you want finished product, have fun with big fed game. Just don't be shocked if this old school Gym and folding chair independent game gives them all they want and more.\n\nAt this point, that's very much in the hands of the developer.\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nYes, I'm in on it and a believer. At the current price, most of you would be very much off put to purchase this at this time. My recommendation to you all is to follow this project and watch implementations as they arrive. At this point in time, the developer is VERY CLEAR that there isn't much to do here. Punch, Grapple, slam and pin. That's all you get. Once they are in place and at a point you wish to jump in, do so. ' Nuff said. So, for most of you, honestly at this point it is a no.\n\nThis, however, is very deceptive of my personal feelings about where this can go and the opportunity for those of you that want a No Mercy style game on the PC. Hop on, buckle up and take notes. The opportunity is here to get involved with the development (as much as the developers would listen, that is)\n\nSo, that in mind, here is my wish list. (NOTE: WISH LIST MEANS NOT IN GAME)\n\n-More... (Directly from Captain Obvious here.. More moves, More Wrestlers, More Environments.. I think the cheesy crowd thing can be averted.. It will only be a point of nit picking down the line unless it is done shaded or almost greyed out.)\n-MP3(/video?) integration. Ever look through the song list and think... damn.. I want my wrestler to come out to this one song but it isn't here... Well.. it will be your own library that you pick from. The developer isn't supplying it.. so it isn't his concern about copyright infringements.. just yours if you share the match on youtube.\n-Commentary (very touchy situation here.. good luck, devs) Watch a match with the sound off.. any match on TV.. isn't as exciting is it? Well. The game in current state won't seem as exciting without the commentators giving you the vocal thumbs up or down.\n-Running. Could also be used as a modifier... Run + strike = lariat Run + Rope + Strike = Rebound crossbody eh.. throw it under more.\n\nThat all being said, it is an excellent start.\nI'm gonna shut my pie hole now as the devs are probably shaking their heads saying (already on most of this)","November 29, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I've waited to see a little more content before taking the plunge and buying it but thought 'what the hell' maybe putting a little capital into it may just get it moving quicker. I have always been a wrestling fan and definitely a wrestling gamer fan but have a huge love for Three games in particular, WCW World Tour on the PS1, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 on the Gameboy Advance and WWF No Mercy on the N64 so a game that even vaguely resembles any of these would be ideal… So this is what I have found so far and what I'd like to see coming soon just to add a bit more longevity.\n\nFirstly, this game is super smooth, it plays like a dream even on highest graphical settings, wrestlers movements are really smooth and even though at this stage the moves are limited they all look nice, I’ve certainly not had any of the Smackdown of old issues with collisions problems with dropkicks. The rope running is nice and again I have had no issues from the few games I have played thus far. All and all it looks and feels good thus far.\nThe game itself is very, very early stages and it shows in the other aspects of the game, lack of moves, only 3 characters and nothing really to do in create a wrestler bar mix and match the costumes from the two named workers… All of this is already noted in the previous reviews and the description so I wasn’t shocked at all by this, I was however disappointed there was no generic tights, trunks and masks of just plain colours so even in its raw form you could at least cobble together a motley roster just if nothing else to stave off the repetitive nature of the game at its current stage.\nAll in all, I would say it needs a few more little things adding before it is worth the amount it is up for however if you wanna support the game and see it grow into something remarkable then click buy even if you don’t intend to play it for a few updates because it really does show so much potential even with the small amount already there.\n\nSo in short for me to make it worth it as is it needs:\n\n•	A few generic Create a player bits just to give you something to get your teeth into\n•	One more character at least\n•	A single weapon like a chair to see an example of weapon collision detection.\n\nAll in all, though If you wanna support an independent wrestling game with promise click buy.\n","January 13","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

WE help shape the future of this game by providing feedback for the developers. It's not in a finished state and it should not be treated as if it is a finished product.\n\nIf you're a fan of the old school wrestling games from the Nintendo 64 era, Pro Wrestling X just might be up your alley! In early access the game is limited to three game modes, basic wrestler editor and a ring editor. There are three playable characters with the option to create up to nine of your own. Move sets are limited but will be expanding with each update. The progress that has been made on this game so far is impressive when you keep in mind the size of the development team.\n\nPro Wrestling X is a game that has so much potential. Although the game is limited in its current state and needs a bit more polish, the future for Pro Wrestling X is looking bright. If you're looking to support a game that looks to bring a modernized wrestling experience inspired by the N64 games, look no further then Pro Wrestling X!\n\n","May 14","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
