That said, as a poker game it feels a bit simple for my tastes, and is in no way a good substitute for a live poker game (either in person, or online).\n\nIf you're just learning how to play the game, this can be good practice for you.  However, if you're looking at this game because you're already into poker, skip the purchase.  This will not scratch the poker itch effectively.","March 21, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Sound effects are a bit dopey and repeditive. I play with music on in the back ground and it works out just fine.\n\nThis seems like it was geared more towards the poker crowd and less towards the PC gaming crowed. I enjoyed it and if you like poker, I think you will too. However I can see how some people would be disappointed if they were expecting a game with a ton of personality.","June 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

IT IS BROKEN AND DOES NOT START!!!!!!\n\nThe game does not work. For a very small minority it does work but for the majority it does not, and im talking 99% of people. i have looked everywhere for a fix, contacted support with no answer and im writing this to let people know its a waste of money. Steam are conning you, they put this game on their store and it doesnt work. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nUPDATE: It works for me, but not for some. some computers it works on, some it doesnt. i tried on my relatives nvidia computer, didnt work. tried on my own amd radeon computer at home, it works.","November 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","32","7","22","3","0"
