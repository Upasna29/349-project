And yet I don't know what the big fuss is about in the reviews... it's that terrible of a game.\nYeah oke the combat sucks, its basically spray and pray, but it does work.\nThe graphics is dated but it is a low budget game, not every game can be a AAA title.\nThe story was rather easy to follow, don't know why people can't follow it.\n\nI really liked the setting, steampunk Idea. Steam trains and railguns and steampunk motorcycles were the best.\nThere was even some good parkour, scaling buildings and walls.\nIt was not an amazing game but it was worth playing, if you can get it for a good price.\n\nIn the end I still enjoyed it, give it a try if you are open minded and not just use to AAA games. 6/10","October 9, 2015","true","10.6"," 61 of 84 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","61","84","2","4"

No brain killings, dozen of bugs, poor AI, poor weapons, bad voice acting‚Ä¶ and A LOT of things "stolen" from Gears of War.\n\nAfter reading multiple reviews I had thought this is the waste of my money but since there was not so many co-op games I decided to get it.\n\nAfter few playthroughs I can sadly say that all prejudices were true: few clip offs the map, AI is "stupid like Nazis in WW2 movies", and voices‚Ä¶ just horrible. All seems like uglier brother of GoW.\n\nBUT there is something in this game which gets you in. Something which makes you play it over again. Ugly duckling for sure but with good partner and some patience it may become a swan.\n\nSteampunk setting gets into you somehow. Wild west style of cogs, blimps and‚Ä¶ steam bikes makes experience unique. If you add to shootings some acrobatics in Lara Croft style, you have mix which is not as bad as some write about.\n\nI can forgive this game all the bad because I can have GoW + Tomb Raider + Steampunk.\n\n\nAnd I will repeat myself again: steam bikes are just cool.","December 1, 2013","true","27.1"," 75 of 110 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","75","110","0","1"

And I do believe some games just get completely unfair treatment from the reviewers and this game seemed to be getting a lot of bad reviews from many websites, so I gave this one a try.\n\nMy goodness where do I begin.....\n\nThe control. The control is not bad. It is CHEAP. You move around like you are playing some really old PS2 game, and the whole aiming....I. CAN. NOT. AIM. May I ask why??? Even if I did aim at the target correctly, EVERY FRIGGIN GUN IS USELESS!!!!!!! So, there is this gun that appears to be a machine gun. IS IT A TOY GUN??? IT CERTAINLY SHOOTS LIKE ONE?!?!  And DOES IT EVER HIT THE TARGET???? And I can't even tell if I am actually giving any kind of damage to the enemy or not, it's kind of like Resident Evil: Raccoon City, I can't tell if I am seriously hitting them.\n\nAnd the voice acting....my goodness do they just read or something?\n\nAnd I have no idea what is up with the story. What's going on? Why does he say that? Why does she say that? Why does this guy appear all of a sudden? When did I get here? Why did I get here? Who are you talking about?? What ARE YOU talking about??!?!?!?!?!!\n\nit just makes me wonder, did the developers even test this game when they made this? Did they think it was ok like this? I mean, the characters move like they have some kind of issues (Or I should say they move like PS2 or old PS1 characters) and the whole combat is not even fun to begin with.\n\nCan I recommend this game? OF COURSE NOT!!!! There are so many better alternatives out there, and why should anyone seriously waste their life time on this? Because certainly, I would NOT want to.\n\n1.4 out of 10.\n\nÔºàÁ≥û„Ç≤„ÉºÔºâ","January 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 144 of 245 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","144","245","8","11"

I bought Damnation on release day due to hype, and learned a very valuable lesson -- ok, I didn't, I've still bought trash since. A few other titles have put up a hard fight to dethrone Damnation as worst game I've bought on Steam, but Damnation fought them off and still sits proudly as King on a throne of garbage.\n\nAddition:  Plenty of people have gone into what's wrong with the game, so my review doesn't need to repeat after everyone else.  The point of my review is to emphasize how much I regretted the purchase and how much it disappointed me -- so badly that the day of the Steam review system launching (1648 days after buying Damnation), the very first thing I thought to do was find this particular game in my list to give it the biggest thumbs down I could.","November 25, 2013","false","1.7"," 59 of 102 people (58%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","58","59","102","10","4"

Three gorgeous pairs of boobs, presented to you on a silver platter :D\n\nHad this steampunk first (third) person parkour shooter come out in 2003, it probably would've been a real blast. The parkour moves you have to perform are INSANELY absurd, in a good way. If you're not very comfortable with heights, you might be playing with a pair of sweaty hands or whatever your reaction is, a lot of the time.\n\nThis is NOT "Assassin's Creed", pathetically hopping around a few two story house roof tops and dangling on 1st floor balconies BWHAHAHA, ooohhh no... no...\n\nThe controls and the camera are not that bad, I've seen far worse, but the movement is definitely made for consoles/controllers, not for mouse and keyboard. The shooting mechanics could be better, and the AI is not very good for today's standards.\n\nStill played it through, on "Hardcore" (Normal) difficulty, because someone decided to jump on the retrarded band wagon, where you have to "unlock" the hard difficulty. I rarely want to do second or more playthroughs.\n\nI also hate that you can't interrupt the obnoxious intro videos, or the credits roll at the end, when I was done trying to roughly estimate how many people worked on this. It didn't sell well and the company closed after this financial desaster.\n\nOnline VERSUS and Co-op mode probably won't work, as it requires Gamespy, which has shut down. I have no idea if LAN Co-op does work well, or at all.\n\nThe parkour stuff though, this is what the game has going for it, and I am NOT good with heights :D","January 18, 2015","true","9.4"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","19","29","7","0"

While it uses many exotic contextual actions, dynamically grabbing pipes, ledges, and other objects in game to ascend to higher safer perches, the game just falls flat on it's face.\n\nI believe the description of this game is a "vertical" fps, which I think they meant to show by this emphasis on climbing and acrobatics, but I think what went wrong is the aiming, which felt clunky, enemies didn't seem to die fast enough, mostly because you're flipping and climbing everywhere just trying to find the guys, and an overall unappealing level design which was consistent of mostly blank brick buildings and bridges leading to nowhere special.\n\nIf you can get over the aiming and the level design, you might be able to take this game.

Sound great, huh?\nThat what I was expecting from Damnation. It tried. Very hard. But sadly, failed. Probably enjoyed it a little only because of co-op option, so if you are looking for just a game to play with someone, you can try it. Still, you will have more fun seeing how buggy and bad this game is. There will be characters which will be stuck somewhere - like "bad guy" running in front of wall for some reason, or somebody from your team shooting also in wall. It happens but most annoying thing is when you fall down from some really high place, or you will land outside a game territory AND you will spawn in same place... oh god. I can't remember how many times I needed to start over because I was running underground, or landed in some strange place which was marked as my new spawnpoint, where I could move an inch in any direction.\nIf only this stuff could be fixed, it would be much better game. I mean, story is rather dull, nothing special on graphics/music but it was kinda fun running, finding your way, jumping from one place to another. And co-op option is what made it double fun. I wouldn't mind to see someday another game like that but only POLISHED one, where bugs and stuff doesn't annoy you every few minutes.\nSadly, I can't recommend this game. Maybe it could get neutral but we all know you can only say yes/no to games, so it's a "no" from me.","December 27, 2015","false","11.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

But it is by no means a good game. It is enjoyable though, and the setting is somewhat unique, it keeps it interesting, despite the awful story.

It still offers a lot of fun for its price and has some surprises. Granted, the main plot is ridiculous, gameplay is very linear, and the cutscenes and any form of conversation between Rourke and his comrades is carried out with far less attention than you can demand for a game released in 2009 - they all behave like robots. Enemy AI is not a big concern. There might be more auto-save points as well because some failures will send you back just a little too far (no, can't save whenever you want).\nBut on the positive side, movement animation in the action is nicely done, the controls are intuitive, and most of the world you are running around in is kind of beautiful (if you like steampunk). There are some nice puzzle situations such as aligning elements redirecting a stream of water to create a consistent flow, and some really fun motorcycle rides.

Unfortunatly that is what I managed to hear, everything after the first 2 cutscenes I just skipped, couldn't listen to all those bad voice actors, it sounds like someone just went into recording studio and read the whole script while heavily sedated, but not quite enough to make him unable to read it.\n\nEven though the game concept has some nice ideas such as multi-layer combat, it hasn't been utilised right and it makes the whole fighting experience awful. Developers tried to make a third person shooter/ prince of persia enviorment interaction game which resulted in me wanting to smash the head against the wall.

Trying to use a machine gun resulted in wasting 30 bullets on a single enemy and hitting him maybe 3 times. To be able to actualy kill an enemy with a machine gun you had to be at point blank range and pray to gods he doesn't focus his fire on you.\n\nApart from bad voice acting and bad combat, there is also badly done character movement. Controls are badly responsive.\nGraphics are bad, textures are all glittery almost as if the sun is shining at a wet surface, mind you in this case every surface would be wet and sun would shine from every corner of the level to make it glittery.\n\nTo conclude, if you are interested in buying this game, just don't, spend your money on something done right. If you are still not convinced that this is a bad game, I'm sure you can dig up some youtube gameplay videos for the game, try watching those then, maybe then you will change your mind.","February 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

From the sound looks like you're firing a minigun, but just a couple of shots every 2-4 seconds get out of it).\n\nThe voice acting is performed by seemingly soulless automatons, who can't bring life to a line even in the most desperate situations. Not that the script in itself is brilliant, mind you - too often the sentences of the various characters seemed disjointed and out of context.\n\nThe music is forgettable at best, while the textures are really hideous.

Graphics are so so, but better if you put everything to "Intense", "Vivid", "Maximum", and turn V-Sync on (if you have the Graphics power).  Now I've only played about an hour, and I was a tad confused by the very beginning.  And this isn't a spoiler - the game begins by showing you the end of the American Civil War with a General Prescott being victorious.  Then the General and his troops attack Washington.  Next thing you see is a march of Robot Soldiers and I'm thinking to myself, "Robots?  After the Civil War?  Okay, Steampunk.", and then I thought, "How are guns going to stop metal robots?"  Right?\n\nThen this guy comes out carrying a long sword and begins slashing and chopping up soldiers (who are carrying machine guns).  The Swordsman kills all the soldiers (about 8 or so), that's another "Come on writers, swords against machine guns; gimmie a break,  the Swordsman would be plowed down immediately."  And I shook my head in disbelief once again.\n\nThen the scene changes, and our  characters come onto the new scene, riding motorcycles, slipping through the lines, and destroying Prescott's soldiers.  There was a group of four or five of our guys, then suddenly it's just three - your character, another man and a woman.  It's after that  the tutorial starts.  The tutorial section is very good, much better than some of the other games I've played.  That is one part that I did appreciate.  They show you the keys to use, then give you time to learn the moves, and best yet, show the move to you by letting another character do it first.  Like I said, that really helped as not many games do that for you.\n\nAs for the targeting system, it's hit or miss.  There's a cross-hair, and if you get it right on the target, it will turn red, that's when you shoot.  But the area of red vs. white is very small.  Most times you'll miss your target.  It takes a steady hand and a healthy body to aim correctly.  Yes, a healthy body, because if you've been hit a few times, your vision blurs, making it almost impossible to target your enemy.  It's then you have to find cover to recover.  You can also help your crew if they get hit, restoring their health, but do they restore yours?  Nope.  You do get resurrected a  few times, but after a few, you're back to your previous save.  I also disliked that sometimes one of your crew just up and disappeared.  One battle I saw the girl get hit a number of times. I knew she was injured and awaiting help because she never made it to the end area - only the two men made it.  The Guy told me what we had to do to advance to the next point, but before I did the action(s), I went back looking for the girl to heal her - couldn't find her anywhere at all.  So I went back to the end point, and looked to the new starting point.  Guess what?  She was waiting there.  Grrrrr...\n\nAnyway, taking everything into consideration, it is an interesting game to play, but only at the highest graphics settings.  Note that even though it was released on May 22, 2009, it was trademarked by Codemaster in 2007 (two years prior).  I think that because of its game mechanics and graphics, it was probably a project that was put away a number of years before that, then one day resurrected when someone was between projects.  It has that kind of a feel to it - bookshelved because it was not so good, and then picked up once again because they needed a project close to completion.\n\nWould I recommend it?  Well, for something to do between great games, when you need a break, this will do.  Plus it will help you appreciate how far gaming has come in the last decade.  So if you can get it for under $5 bucks, the same as a sandwich, think of it just being a day past its expiration date, and add it to your Game Library.","December 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The models are bare bones, there are no idle animations, the characters look like lifeless models. fighting is cover based but its implementation is just a poor sorry attempt at copying the gears of war style. The story is incredibly stupid involving people hopped up on drugs being given super powers. The guns pack no punch, they feel incredibly dull and so does not work for its playability. The hardest difficulty is only unlockable if you bought a special pre-order edition and the co-op is janky. The large world is a lie. it is just a linear environment and exploration is forced. The AI is incredinly dull  getting stuck in the geometry and having uncanny aim. There are driving segments that are just a joke, your models are glued to the vehicle and look like dolls. The vehilc has no weight and sound drones on like a cheap royalty free sfx and Its hard to control.

The graphics were less than good, and the sound effects actually kept making me laugh. Every time someone dies, they make this horrific scream that is just out of place. And before they die, the AI just kind of stands there and shoots, offering no kind of tactical process. I'm not upset that I wasted a couple dollars.

Luckily I picked this up for 1 dollar during the summer sale so I feel that I got my money's worth, but damn......The characters are terribly voice acted and by terribly I mean TERRIBLY. The "Spanish" ally's accent wavers and disappears, all the characters speak in a dead tone deaf droll, lines, no matter how clich√©, are spoken with borderline no emotion so something that would make me chuckle and roll my eyes turns into something cringe worthy. The "puzzles" if you can call them that are either looking around the drab environment (albeit some areas if you look around are at least interesting to look at....not fun to be in though) for a random ledge to either grab on to or jump off of, the one of only maybe 2 actual puzzles in the game are made unnecessarily annoying by the speed at which you can perform them, making pushing these statues go at like 2 feet per second FOR NO REASON no time limit, no enemies just poor game design. The combat? Ugh don't get me started, it feels like it was trying to be GOW with plat forming but it just fails horribly, 90% of the weapons have the accuracy of blind firing with a sniper rifle (well at least in most games, this game it's in the dead center of the cross hair), so shooting with a shotgun that isn't 3.5 feet or less away from an enemy won't kill them, in fact you'll find that most of the time you'll be pumping 2-4 shots into them from about 6-7 feet. the assault rifle although less painful when you miss a shot just vomits ammo with horrid accuracy that requires anywhere from 1/4-5/4ths of a clip with barely any reason behind why. The hits are barely noticeable when you land making it easy to waste ammo. assault rifle is useless at mid range which is where it should be good. on "normal" (hardcore in game, the only other is casual mode aka easy mode) you will get your a** kicked multiple times without any way to avoid or dodge enemies, and unlike most games that turn red or have a health bar or something this game decides to BLUR YOUR SCREEN, that right when you get shot a little bit it makes everything impossible to navigate to get to cover, or to kill that one last enemy that is hitting you from 4 feet away. Respawning isn't terrible, some checkpoints are not well placed but for the most part dying is going to be a 20 sec-2 min slap on the wrist, for some reason (but thank god) dying via falling causes an instant reaspawn with no penalty (I guess they know their plat forming wasn't the best) which is amazing as there are multiple times when you will just fall off for stupid reasons and die, this guy will die from about a 10 foot height so I give them credit for implementing that respawn. The level design is boring and drab for 3/4ths of the game, only getting remotely interesting during the last 1/4th  during an interesting Spanish city and EEEEEEVIIIIIILLL lair (seriously it's so evil looking it's a joke). And just when you think it couldn't suck enough THERES MORE! boring wayyyyyyy too long bike sections break up the crappy combat, with LAUGHABLE physics that let you drive on any wall, letting you glitch the game at times, drive on the ceiling at like 4 miles per hour, and crap like that, but this overstays its welcome by about 30 min, there are ramps and jumps a plenty here but since the bike controls like Sh** and the fact that even one slight bomb (which the ramps are usually full of them) you will find yourself rocketed off into space, where you will die....and restart at a checkpoint 2 min back, where you will probably fall off again, and do it again.....and again. But to top off this train wreck of a game (horrid voice acting, bad combat and weapons, terrible scenery, plat forming that will only keep you interested for maybe 30 min, horrid bike sequences) the final boss is a disgusting joke, I won't spoil it but if you happen to have 2 weapons (ONE OF WHICH IS DROPPED BY 2 ENEMIES LIKE 1 ROOM BEFORE HIM) it will make him a joke (an annoying joke but a joke). well that enough about that, should u buy this? for a dollar or 2? maybe....maybe, although I wrote an essay knocking this game,  for 1-2 bucks its entertaining to watch this train wreck, for 5 or more?

Controls are a bit clunky at times but over all, it's a rather solid game. Played this start to finish... gotta say the story sorta lost me as to why the big bad is even doing what he's doing, but at the end he's that sorta idiot you just want to put a bullet or 50 into.","January 21","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does this game mess it all up. I love the setting, and the design, and a lot of the artwork and everything. This game has a mind-boggling amount of potential. The main issue is...it's a pretty poor game. The shooting is strange, the animation is laughable, the graphics are pretty poor, and the controls are awkward. So sad. I'd love to see this game get a remake, because it could be an amazing game, if it didn't have so many issues in the gameplay itself.","April 17","false","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
