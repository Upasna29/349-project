"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Empyrrean/recommended/228400/","Empyrrean","Empyrrean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Empyrrean/","49 products in account","In order to enjoy this game, you need to go in with an open mind and forget everything you know about Ace Combat. This is not an Ace Combat game. It's more like Call of Duty: Jet Fighter Edition. The story is pretty flat and is your typical 'Murrica vs terrorists plot. Also, make sure you turn off Flight Assist and change the control scheme to Original for the best experience.\n\nMost people complain about DFM (Dogfight Mode) being too on-rails, and for the most part, they're right. There are some targets (called TGT_LEAD) that require you to engage DFM and follow them through a semi-scripted segment of cinematic explosions and debris before you can do any damage to them. I don't care for this feature myself, but it's not a big deal and it's fun to watch. For normal targets though, it's much more dynamic, as you can play a game of cat and mouse by counter maneuvering each other in DFM, or you can choose to not use DFM at all. Personally, I think that DFM, while a tad repetitive, is quite exhilarating. The helicopter and gunner missions are pretty grueling and last longer than they should, but fortunately there's only a few of them. They can be fun and intense at times though, especially on higher difficulties.\n\nThe multiplayer is where this game really shines, and now that the game is going on Steamworks, we should hopefully see more players. Capital Conquest is incredibly fun, and you can be a fighter, an attacker, or a helicopter and defend your HQ while capturing additional bases to spawn closer to the enemy's HQ. The aircraft are balanced so that fighters don't do much damage to ground targets, while attackers have an insane damage modifier against them, with the downside of being unable to engage DFM. Once your team captures the central control tower, you can go into ASM (Airstrike Mode) against the enemy's HQ as an attacker or multirole. You can attack the HQ directly without ASM but it's not as efficient, since ASM increases your reload speed. Helicopters are excellent for HQ defense since they can hover and shoot down incoming attackers. If you get 8 kills in a row, you can load up your PAK-FA with Trinity (tactical nuke) and decimate a wide area of ground targets. When your HQ's health bar gets low, someone on your team can make a desperate last ditch effort by launching in a B1 or B2 bomber and deal a large amount of damage to the enemy's HQ, but you better provide cover for him on his way there. There are tons of skills to unlock with points you earn from multiplayer, which include weapon damage boosts, improved homing missiles, increased armor, and improved maneuverability. All the skills are pretty balanced and none are too overpowered (except maybe Burst which maxes out defense, but it costs a lot of points and has a limited amount of uses).\n\nIf you're thinking about getting this game, get it for the multiplayer, You can play multiple roles other than a fighter, and the dogfighting is more fun and less predictable since you won't be spending the whole round circling each other which ends up happening in most other multiplayer jet games.","February 20, 2014","true","196.9"," 491 of 625 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","491","625","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elliottford/recommended/228400/","elliottford","ThatWelshIdiot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elliottford/","134 products in account","Oh, Ace Combat, why did you have to do this to me?\n\nI'm a big fan of the series, it's always been a blast to play, and yes there were low times, but never so much as this. Now, i'm not saying that the game is 100% terrible, it DOES have it's pros, but it has many more cons. I'll list them below;\n\nPros:\n-The plane flight mechanics feel tight and responsive, sure they're not realistic, but we're not playing Ace Combat for realism, are we? We're playing it for the fun of doing crazy air stunts and gunning down people along the way.\n-The sound design is nothing spectacular, but it does it's job. The guns and the music are serviceable. Now, the old Ace Combats had some great soundtracks with some spectacularly memorable pieces. DO NOT expect those here. But, at the same time, it's not terrible.\n- The planes, while not being the highest texture quality you've ever seen, are pretty damn sexy. As are some of the spark and explosion effects, it does feel good to gun down planes out of the sky and watch them burst into flames.\n\nCons:\n- The dogfighting system. Now, this one just relies on how you feel about the system. The dogfighting system allows you to lock onto an enemy and kep on their tail while firing at them. Alternatively, enemies can also do this to you. It does allow for some pretty cinematic chases, but ultimately after about three times it's already gotten old. What it actually boils down to is this: Lock onto the enemy. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on. Find new target. Lock onto new target. Wiggle stick a bit. Fire. Move on.\nIt makes the game just a million times easier and means that instead of having these amazing dogfights where you're doing all these crazy stunt mid air, it just means that you see an enemy...and now he's dead.\nMost of the time.\nIn order to combat you doing this, the game suffers from the same artificial diffficulty that a lot of plane games suffer from, whereby your target will just perpetually fly away from you. Get an enemy into your line of sight, and all of a sudden they pull up. And up. And up. And then you pull up. And up. And up. And now you're just spinning a hundred times before you can lock him into your dogfighting system. No skill needed.\nThe next thing that annoys me is that the enemies can also lock YOU into the DFS (dog fighting system). It seems like a good idea, having to escape them, but it just boils down to doing exactly what the enemies do to you! You're chasing someone for aaaages and then BAM you're taken right out of it, so what do you do? Pull up until you escape. Now you can continue to chase NOPE YOU'RE BACK IN IT WHOOAAA CRAZY RIGHT? PULL UP PULL UP okay we're free again, now to finally chase that NOOOOOOOPE I'M BACK ♥♥♥♥♥ES.\n-The helicopter missions. They're awful. You fly around a horribly controlled helicopter, gunning down floor enemies and the occasional helicopter. That's it. The heliocopter controls terribly, as i've mentioned, and the whole missions are just uninspired. Use these boring weapons and this boring helicopter and shoot some cars. Woo. Do that multiple times throughout the game.\n-The turret sequences. OH? WHAT'S THAT? YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE HELICOPTER SEQUENCES? ALRIGHT WELL TELL YA WHAT, HOW ABOUT WE TAKE OUT THE WHOLE FLYING THE HELICOPTER THING AND JUST GIVE YOU A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURRET? Yeah, thanks developers. There's literally whole missions where you load in, and shoot a turret for about 20 minutes at some foot soldiers, and then move on. No variety, no challenge, no interest, nothing. Just point at people and click. You don't even get to move around on your own. Just point and click. Oh you wanna do something else? NOPE. POINT AND CLICK.\n-The voice acting. It's awful. There's not much to say except that everyone is just Mr Generic McGenericson or Mrs Genericson and her Generic babies. Maybe it's not even that bad, but seriously it's so generic that I think it dulled my senses.\n-The story. Spoilers, i guess, but hoestly just read any Tom Clancy novel and you've heard this story.  While the game is voiced by Mr Generic Genericson, the story was written by his superhero alter ego; JERRY GENERICMAN! American hero. He's the hero we need. Other people. They're the heroes we need. Terrorists have a bad plot to blow up some people! Quick; call America! Oh no, a Generic non-american bad guy who wants to do bad stuff. WE STOPPED HIM JUST IN TIME. BUT WILL YOU MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE? Yes. Roll credits.\n-The AC130 missions. Just fancier disguised turret sections.\n\nOverall this game was a huge disappointment. Are you a huge fan of the series and you're just ACHING for more? Sure, pick it up on sale and just slog your way through it. Only have a slight interest? Just don't buy it. There are plenty of other plane games that you could get that are ultimately better.","March 28, 2015","false","9.5"," 191 of 235 people (81%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","81","191","235","45","4"

It requires absolutely no skill whatsoever, providing no fun a result.\n\nSuch ain't "optional" either, since certain enemies can ONLY be taken down using said mode, and others can also glue themselves to you, forcing such mode on yourself.\n\n...as if that wasn't bad enough, certain enemies will take you on a rather long scripted adventure (you'll notice those right away, they're bullet sponges) and can only be disposed of, once their fancy "scripted" event has come to an end.\n\n\nFor the first time ever in the franchise, we're given the opportunity to take control of an Helicopter (in fact, tree of them); This is indeed a breath of fresh air in the game, but unfortunately its implementation leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nTo start off, the shaky, in your face, zoomed in Third-Person camera, has got to be one of the worst I've experienced in a game, the levitating brick occupies almost three quarters of the screen and flies all over the place, making its best efforts to obstruct your view all the time;\n\nThankfully, there is a cockpit view, and even that has the bad habit of shaking in an exaggerated manner and zooming in every time you lock your weapons on a target.\n\n...now, as far as Helicopter gameplay goes, it could be described almost as a modern generic Third/First-Person Shooter (only clunkyer) and in the air, which consist off gunning down waves upon waves of ground forces who oppose no threat whatsoever (as in challenge), occasionally dodging a missile or two (it's laughable), and maybe, face off another chopper one on one; Oh, and you cannot crash it.\n\nNothing too complicated... in fact, if you're expecting anything that requires even the slightest amount of thought, strategy and/or skill, you might want to look somewhere else...\n\n\nBe aware though!\n\nThe game has the bad habit of taking the control off of your hands, constantly zooming into whatever goes boom;\nTrying a little bit to hard to make people go nuts over rad explosions, I guess...\n\n\nNew to the series are too the Turret Sections, which consist of nothing but press right click for "awesome".\n\nUnfortunately, there are no unique and/or interesting mechanics to the big guns themselves, they don't overheat nor do they run out of ammo, rate of fire doesn't vary from turret to turret neither does the ammunition they consume...\n\n...and as an effect, these sections come off as simplistic, stale, repetitive, and nothing more.\n\nIt could be said they exist for the sole reason of instant gratification, and it wouldn't be too far of the truth, as challenge is kept to a bare minimum and all it resorts to, is: Everything you look at explodes and anything that hadn't exploded yet is inoffensive to your mighty immortality.\n\n\nWhich brings me to...\n\n...the Health Bar of old, which is nowhere to be seen, and there is a reason for such;\nOur friends at Namco, decided it'd be a good idea to borrow, amongst other things, one of the worst fads in gaming; The absolute ATROCITY that is regenerative health.\n\nYes, that's right, Planes/Helicopters fix them selves (you'll notice a red screen displaying Critical, Heavy and Light Damage at times);\n\n\nBut wait, this ain't over yet!\n\nIf that wasn't ridiculous enough, our beautiful flying machines now bounce of the ground as if they're made of rubber.\n\nTogether with "Invincibility Mode", such can be abused to no end...\n\n\n\n...but boy, oh boy, there's more;\n\nAmongst other fads brought to the table, is the poor implementation of either intrusive Quick Time Events (QTEs for short), that serve no purpose other than breaking the flow of the game, or QTEs that don't even have an impact on anything (yes some can be ignored completely)!\n\nSome cutscenes are unskippable (thankfully those are very, very few and far in between), forcing you to "take control" of the camera, as in, moving the main character's head to look around, because apparently someone somewhere thought that'd be fun.\n\n\nTo add insult to the injury, not only is our main villain the typical evil Russian guy (because 'Murica, I guess) he's also called Markov; Doesn't this ring a bell?\n\nEven the name is similar to an evil guy from a certain overly successful, yearly franchise that's been copied to the point of exhaustion for the past decade!\n\n...it might seem like I'm nitpicking by now, but it's blatantly obvious who or what this game has drawn inspiration (or should I say lack thereof) from, there's even a boring, uninspired AC130 mission thrown into the mix, and a long boring one at that (actually, most missions overstay their welcome)! Who finds this fun and why?\n\n\nThe Ugly\nWhile this game is properly optimized from my experience, the Graphic Settings menu is a joke, there are only four available options to "tweak", Antialiasing (can only be turned On or Off), Fullscreen, Vsync and Resolution.\n\n\nOn a side note, while the PC version contains all the DLC included, don't even get me started on how ridiculous and overpriced they were on the console version, which used to charge from $4, up to $6 for individual Painting schemes and Aircraft (Not sure if it still does)!\n\nBoy have standards fallen low, uh?\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\nAce Combat Assault Horizon is a game that tries to hard to be the next big thing; Not only does it feel desperate, like a little kid yelling and screaming for attention, it also feels like a compilation of everything that is wrong with games, the industry nowadays and the mentality of those who Publish/Develop the games we used to know and love.\n\nTherefore, earning an abysmal rEvo's rating of 2.5/10\n\n\nI can't remember a single moment where I was enjoying myself; I felt suffocated in the middle of all of its "edgy" in your face exaggeration, mixed with boring, generic simplified gameplay mechanics...\n\nIt felt cheap, it felt empty and it felt outdated...\n\nOutdated in the sense that the kind of game Assault Horizon is trying to be, has been copied and beaten to death multiple times in the past decade.\n\nIt's just not its unique thing anymore, and as a result you'll find "Assault Horizon's" core, in any other  brown, cinematic (edgy), military (or not), linear, scripted, simplified, over budgeted, mediocre AAA (triple A) game out there...\n\n\nAt the very least, the game's well programmed and functional, doesn't crash nor does it stutter around...","July 26, 2014","false","4.1"," 138 of 168 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","138","168","0","0"

While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar.\n\nBut, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?\n\nIn the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.\n\nEither way, this games is awful.

As a newcomer to the series, I quite enjoyed my time with it.\n\nThe graphics are good, except for ground textures, which are what you would expect from games of this genre – low-resolution and blurry. But there's a plenitude of 3D buildings, the jets and helicopters are well crafted, explosions look nice, and even characters don't look bad at all.\n\nFighter jet gameplay is simple enough and shooting down enemies while in DFM (dog fight mode) is very satisfying. The only problem is that the HUD (heads-up display) can be a little intrusive, with too much information on screen. This can prove distracting at times, especially with the amount of dialog going on.\n\nHelicopters are absolutely dreadful to control, however. Luckily there are only a couple of helicopter missions in the campaign, and they're far between.\n\nAs a side note, I might add that the game can be perfectly played with mouse and keyboard, but was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind.\n\nThe story is utterly forgettable, but I reckon it is not the selling point of this game, so it can be safely ignored.\n\nThe sound effects are decent. On the other hand, the soundtrack, while not bad per se, is very repetitive and does not go together well with the action.\n\nLastly, multiplayer is fun, even if few people bother with it due to Games For Windows Live.\n\nOverall, a solid game.\n\nUPDATE: Since the writing of this review, Games For Windows Live has been patched out of the game.","December 18, 2013","true","10.9"," 178 of 260 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","178","260","0","7"

The new "Dog fight mode" looks cool for the first few times you use it but then you realise that all control is being taken away from you and that the dog fights are actually highly scripted. You'll activate dog fight mode and while you're chasing an enemy plane the game will make you fly through explosions and under collapsing buildings, it looks great but it's more like watching a cutscene than actual gameplay.\nFor some reason Namco also decided to scrap the science fiction elements found in the older games so there are now no awesome boss fights against gigantic flying fortresses and the plot and cutscenes feel like they're ripped straight from a generic modern warfare shooter. The helicopter levels are terrible too and have awful controls.\nThere's even a boss fight where you can't kill the boss untill the game decides you can, you'll shoot him a thousand times and it won't make a bit of difference because he only dies during a cutscene.

It's a very arcadey approach to the genre that often feels like its a compilation of the variety missions that appear in modern military shooter games, rather than its own game.\n\nThe mission variety is very good, from dogfighting over cities in a selection of modern fighter jets and weaving an Apache Helicopter between buildings to providing air support from an AC-130 Spectre Gunship or a series of late night bombing runs; what's on offer is varied and has a nice pace to it, changing things up so you don't tire of the same thing again and again.\n\nThe biggest let-down for me and my main reason for purchasing the game originally is the Dogfighting. Ace Combat Assault Horizon introduces a feature known as DFM, which is clearly an attempt to keep engagements fast and thrilling. The problem is, in most cases it feels like you've been strapped into a rollercoaster and been given some bread rolls to throw at the head of the person in the seat in front of you when ever you line up. Enemy planes can absorb a large amount of bullets and apart from a few non-essential targets, will quite happily shrug off direct missile hits - it just seems to lack impact or enough fidelity to get the blood pumping and tends to feel like you're chipping away at a health bar until the target explodes. This is made slightly worse if you decide to replay a mission and notice some essential targets are heavily scripted and fly the same paths along specific set pieces.\n\nThe visuals do a good job although are nothing special, vehicles are decent, explosions look good, smoke trails don't look out of place and the quantity of modelled buildings rather than just a ground texture is nice to see.\n\nI played with an XBox Controller and the controls never caused frustration, the game certainly lends itself more to the arcadey approach than a Simulation.\n\nAll in all, the mission variety on offer doesn't make up for the run of the mill story and disappointing combat. The games singleplayer clocks in at around seven hours with the ability to replay missions and I personally didn't experience the multiplayer, although I imagine with the removal of Games for Windows Live (Ace Combat Assault Horizon - Enhanced Edition now requires Steam only!) more people will be willing to give it a try.\n\nIt's not a bad game and is indeed, well made - they just should have waited for a clear lock before firing this one off.","April 4, 2014","false","8.9"," 135 of 196 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","135","196","0","6"

Fans like me of the other games will pretty much be dissapointed in it. Both parties however will find the DFM or Dog Fight Mode novel at first, but after a while its extremely repettative and sometimes just broken, and the sad part is you need to use DFM on some planes so the fly by sequence can run its course to progress in the mission, these planes are basically invincible unless you use DFM.\n\nSome cool fictional planes make a reapearence as bonus content like the CFA-44 Nosveratu from Ace Combat Six, but the special missiles are sadly nerfed, and somewhat useless in DFM.\n\nPros:\n-Better diologue then previous cheesy anime inspired diologue,\n-The B-2 Bomber mission is pretty cool.\n-Game gives you the ability to customize the color of your fighter.\n-Previous games planes when shot down would just fall to the earth, now they expload and fall appart with oil and shrapnel and bits going every which way.\n\nCons:\n-Broken and repetative Dog Fight Mode which is pretty much forced on you.\n-Attack Helicopter Missions are clumsy, and theres a sad lack of gunships to unlock and choose from.\n-Helicopter Gunner missions are extremely irritating, luckily there is only two of them. (then why bother have them in there at all)\n-C-130 mission is just in there for the hell of it.\n-Game is pretty short, even on Ace Mode.\n-Cinamatic Swquences are intrusive and annoying.\n-The first half of the game has little replay value because of tutorial popups which cant be turned off.\n-Multiplayer could be good if there were more players (not really the developers fault, but still an unfortunet fact.)\n\n\nTL/DR: Mediocre Ace Combat experince, give us a PC port of Ace Combat 6 or Infinity instead please...","September 27, 2015","false","23.5"," 65 of 84 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","65","84","2","7"

But this.... wow. It was alarmingly clear that they looked towards Call of Duty for inspiration. let me explain.\n\nin every previous game, the story took place in a fictional world. on top of that, the protaganist was always the silent type and was never truly identified or shown, allowing you to more easily insert yourself into the story and get immersed.\n\nin this game, you play as American McCheeseburger who's been dreaming of his own death over the skies of miami. as you can imagine and predict, that's a spoiler for a portion of the last mission. to make everything worse, the entire game is PAINFULLY predictable, playing into the "surprise! Russians are evil! SO ORIGINAL" trope. The story involves every single war cliche you can think of. Russians are evil, you're a war veteran, the woman suddenly loves you at the end for some reason, your wingman takes a missile for you, the Russians have WMDs and attack D.C. with them, etc. it's so poorly thought through that it was truly difficult to care in the slightest about any of it.\n\nMost of the gameplay isn't... horrible, I guess? the DFM takes away 90% of the control you're given and they force it on you throughout the game. the entirety of the end of game is so horrifically scripted, but the dogfights between are fun and true to the original games. (assuming you never use DFM that is) my main complaint is that they simulate difficulty by having the AI straight up cheat. they can pull manuevers insanely faster than you ever can, they have unlimited flares with no cooldown for them, they can straight up ignore your cannon making them impossible to damage until the game says they can be.\n\nbut the cardinal sin of it all is that they introduced regenerating health for your aircraft. this was never in any of the previous games. not having it forced you to return to base and think about what you're doing more carefully. in this, you can just avoid damage until your plane suddenly decides it's not broken anymore.\n\nAt the end of it: Go play Ace Combat 5. you will VERY quickly see why the Ace Combat communtity shuns this game.","April 16","false","6.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","13"

I can't help but think that if they had spent less time polishing the cinematics and more time focusing on the game, it would've been less of a travesty.\n\nThe series takes a nose dive here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/228400/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","Many people have heard of the Ace Combat flight arcade games, and hundreds of thousands of players around the globe are fans of the series. However, Assault Horizon was an anomaly. The game's producer, Kazutoki Kono, saw fit to try a different formula for the series, and the results were varied. I'm going to attempt an honest review with little bias from the rest of the Ace Combat series. First things first, imagine this game didn't have the "Ace Combat" name in front. Because it's not a part of the series at all. Got it? Alright.\n\nStory: The game's story is tightly integrated with the missions, allowing for a smooth transition and preventing the player from getting lost (although it can definitely be intrusive at points). You are flying as Colonel William Bishop, a renowned fighter pilot, for Task Force 108, a multi-national task force including units from the United States, Russia, and even France. The plot is centered around Colonel Andrei Markov and his personal vendetta for revenge against the United States, as well as a rebel uprising within Russia.\n\nYeah, it's not anything we haven't heard before. If you've played any modern warfare shooter released in the last 5-8 years, you basically got it all. What it does do, however, is give us varied characters. To be quite honest, I loved flying alongside Russian and French pilots - they actually seemed more interesting to hear over the radio than your own American squadmates. But other than that, character interaction is really cringe-worthy and there isn't much development to speak of.\n\nGraphics: Holy. Crap. Yeah, they're not the most beautiful thing, but Assault Horizon in 1080p at 60fps on PC is probably the greatest thing to happen from Project Aces. The aircraft are all gorgeous, with fully-modeled cockpits and animated control surfaces. Explosions are a little Michael Bay-esque, but something I will never get sick of is seeing an enemy aircraft shatter to pieces from a charged missile hit or the individual holes I create with the machine gun. The level of detail in the environment completely sucks at close-up views, but in general the game is so great to look at.\n\nGameplay: Obviously the meat of the game. Fair warning, I play on "Original" controls, which emulates "Normal" in older Ace Combat games. The game is set by default to "Optimum", which emulates "Novice" in the older games and makes the game a lot easier (or a lot harder, depending on your playstyle). So if you have the game and it's not controlling the way you think it should be, take a look at the control setting and see if it's this you gotta look at.\n\nAssault Horizon's gameplay is pretty great at its best times, but really flawed at its worst. Everyone by now is aware of Dogfight Mode (DFM), which allows you to initiate a close-range chase sequence between you and one enemy aircraft. Guns are more accurate and missiles can be charged for insane accuracy and damage, but you run the risk of the enemy aircraft performing a counter-maneuver to get behind you. A lot of people claim that this is an on-rails sequence, but for the most part that isn't the case. The player still has complete control of their aircraft and must stay locked on with the enemy to keep this sequence going.\n\nPlaying with fighter aircraft is the core of the game, and it works. You can still dogfight without DFM, but DFM is unfortunately required for some boss-type enemies - these guys have plot armor and are set up to give you a cinematic experience with additional dialog, you know the drill. It definitely retracts from gameplay a little too much, especially when the game cuts away from your aircraft to give you a cinematic close-up of the aircraft being destroyed. I stated before that I loved seeing this, but not in the middle of a big dogfight with tons of other units firing on me.\n\nAssault Horizon also introduces, for the first time, gameplay with bombers, helicopters, and a gunship to the series. However, I listed them in order from best to worst. Bombers are pretty fun to fly due to their unique weight and power, and you get to perform a strafing run with dozens of bombs at your disposal in the unfortunately single mission you get to have them. Helicopters, however, are really difficult to control and the missions designed for them are really poor - they're insanely difficult and seem to be aimed at shooting you down unless you follow a specific path. The gunship is the worst - anyone who's played an AC-130 mission in other shooters are sick of these already. The (thankfully only) one mission designed for it is enough to fit into the horror genre given its difficulty in the number of SAMs and AA guns that are trying to shoot you down. There's also two missions that are on-rails shooter sequences using a Black Hawk's machine gun, and they definitely overstay their welcome in terms of time.\n\nThere are also a few glitches you may encounter, such as enemy aircraft flying through the ground (this has been a common bug in the entire Ace Combat series) or cutting away from DFM at insane angles that you can't follow. But for the most part, thankfully the fighter/multirole missions are the core of the game and they do work, just with a few rough edges for sure.\n\nOther: By the way, I didn't mention music or sound effects. These are gorgeous, and everyone on the Assault Horizon OST, from Rio Hamamoto to Hiroshi Okubo to Keiki Kobayashi and more, deserve insane credit. Also, be advised that there are two glaring bugs that no one has fixed since GFWL was removed: you can't rename aircraft skins or skill sets, and trying to access the leaderboards crashes the game. Additionally, it's not a CPU hog but it'll definitely tax on the processor. I can't run this game in tandem with a Skype call, otherwise it will lag every now and then. These are definitely minor things, though, so it's not too big of a problem.\n\nSummary: Assault Horizon is definitely a flawed game but, for the most part in my opinion, it works. There are some things I didn't mention, like multiplayer (which is dead) and Air Strike Mode (which works just fine). I own the game on the PS3 and paid $60 for it, and I don't regret that at all because I felt it was worth it. Most won't, but the Steam version costs $20 when it's not on sale, and it goes on sale for $5 every now and then. So, for $20, I think it's worth a try. For $5, though, it's definitely worth it. Just remember, this ain't Ace Combat, bro.","March 25, 2015","true","63.1"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","40","58","3","0"

For me, there are way too many on-rails gameplay forced on you - especially Dogfight Mode (DFM). Essentially you follow the tail of an enemy jet doing crazy unrealistic maneuvers but you don't even have to control anything except fire missiles and guns. Well you do have to control turning the aircraft a little bit (BUT most of aircraft flying control is automated in DFM).  In fact, certain required targets, those marked TGT_LEAD, can only be destroyed by initiating the on-rails experience of DFM. They tried to make this game too cinematic like Call of Duty and the DFM is very cinematic but repetitive.\n\nI liked how they added helicopter Apache missions, a bomber (B-2 Spirit or B-1 Lancer) mission, a AC-130 gunner mission and transport heli gunner missions. However, there were not enough jet missions and jet mission variety (especially when compared to older Ace Combat games).\n\nNever played multiplayer because it is dead and found zero online games to join (on a Sunday afternoon) . I didn't bother trying the online Co-op.\n\nAir Strike Mode (ASM) is at times required throughout the game, and it's kind of like on-rails bombing gameplay. Fortunately it's only forced on you a few times and most of the time it's optional. It's not overly done so it doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nAll in all, they added many new features to this game, but I think most of them made the game worse.","June 7, 2015","false","9.9"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","26","34","0","3"

The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.\n\nThe story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.\n\nThe game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.","February 5, 2015","false","7.5"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","33","47","3","0"

Awesome soundtrack, definitely not dissapointed!  It's a really fun game when you look at all the action alone and stuff. DFM (DogFightMode) mode is fun, but a bit OP, as all you have to do is lock in DFM and fire missiles. ASM (AirStrikeMode) is difficult, and you have to align the plane to face the targets to shoot them down with the machine gun if your missiles don't recharge fast enough. Personally I thought ASM is a bit dissapointing.\n\nThe helicopter missions are a bit ehh, slower paced and can be a bit boring as your objectives are to cover the ground allies and shoot down cars and other helicopters. Guess how you dodge a missile in a helicopter? By doing a full sideflip lol. The helicopter missions are the ones I don't really enjoy that much to be honest. The angle isnt the best on 3rd person, so I suggest 1st.\n\nThe helicopter door-gunner missions are also slower paced and can be a bit boring. Kinda laid-back gameplay. Also for the door-gunner mission, the camera is behind the soldier, which makes looking out a bit difficult.\n\nThe objectives for the game is mostly: Cover you allies, Destroy enemies ASAP etc etc. If you do not do it in time, you will fail the mission. Also, the concept is the typical Americans vs Russian storyline, nothing too special.\n\nOverall:\nPros:\nAwesome Soundtrack,\nNice Graphics and fast gameplay is exciting.\nFlying and fighting jets is pretty fun.\nImpressive fighter jet gameplay.\nDFM mode is actually alright.\n\nCons:\nHelicopter and Door-gunner missions are a bit stale\nBad Angle for Door-gunner missions.\nHelicopter missions can get boring.\nMostly same objectives.\nASM mode is a bit difficult.\nStale storyline.\n\n\nI would give this game a 6.5/10.\nSo is it worth it????\nFor 20 bucks, No.\nOn sale for 5 bucks, Yes.

I'm playing the series since Ace Comabt 3: Electrosphere for tthe PS1 and I felt highly disappointed by the gameplay mechanics choices that have been made for Assault Horizon, completely discarding the provebial "bread & butter" of the series. To be more specific: they cut down the simulation in exchance for action, which didn't worked out well enough, as it seems that the simulation is much less realistic than the preveious games, despite the surreal and fictional weapons from the previous ones. I won't go down in more details since I've alreay expressed them on my angry rant above, which I am sorry if I offended someone or sounded threatening.

I grew up on flying games like Top Gun: Combat Zones, Jetfighter, iF-22, and later HAWX, Ace Combat 6, and Sky Crawlers (an INCREDIBLE piece by Project Aces). One thing these games all had in common is engaging, fast-paced, and straightforward dogfighting that demanded precise control and a keen wit to spotting enemy maneuvers and countering them to your advantage. I grew up with these learning to dogfight using only the stick, yaw, and throttle to create dynamic dogfights and neverending fun. The unlimited freedom of flight is really why flying games are my favorite.\n\nREAD: THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE GAMES.\n\nFair warning: I will vent. HO' BOY AM I GUNNA VENT-\n\nThe game opens on a dramatic cutscene-SKIP JUST LEMME FLY I DONT NEED PLOT I NEED PLANES-and a storm of fighter jets over.....Florida...? (NO ACE COMBAT GAMES ARE SET ON EARTH HNNNGGGGGGG WROOONGG)\nYou drop right into combat and you're in your jet! Cool! Can I shoot things now?\n\nNO YOU HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS GREAT NEW THING WHERE THE GAME PLAYS ITSELF FOR YOU CALLED DFM (DogFightMode)\n\nOh okay, I'll give you the benifit of the doubt. Flying games have always had some wierd new mechanic to make them "unique" (gotta admit though, I love playing around in the "Assist Off" mode in the HAWX games).\nSo this fresh new thing is basically a dogfight autopilot that forces you to tail an escaping enemy. Cool, I guess. You just hit B a few times to launch the (booming echo) NONDESCRIPT HOMING MISSLE THAT OPERATES PURELY ON DFM MECHANICS. Some (booming echo) CINEMATIC EXPLOSION shrapnel fly into your engines and your (booming echo) GENERIC GRIZZLED WHITE MALE PROTAGONIST says he wants to check his systems. Cue generic control tutorial. *gasp* CAN I DOGFIGHT NOW CAN I CAN-\n\n...nope just go into DFM again and do a gun tutorial\n...now?\nNope! More autopilot! And this time a bunch of bad guys fly directly in front of you solely to get themselves blown up LIKE FRIGGING SPACE INVADERS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE\n*deep breath*\nOkay, that was boring. Game wants me to use DFM again? No, screw you game, I'm doing my own thing and dogfighting old school like I payed money to do!\n*long silence*.....what...why....I can't... I can't.... kill them...\n\nI PUMPED COUNTLESS MISSLES INTO EVERY ENEMY AND YOU LITERALLY /CAN/ /NOT/ /KILL/ /THEM/ /OUT/ /OF/ /DFM/\nThat HAS to be only the tutorial, righ-NO.\n\nITS NOT JUST THE TUTORIAL.\n\nYOU CAN'T KILL ENEMIES DUBBED AS "ACES" UNLESS YOU USE THE STUPID BORING DFM AND I'M NOT SWEARING FOR STEAM'S SAKE BUT CHRIST I AM ON THE INSIDE.\nNo really, I tried. They all have infinite flares that never fail and even if you manage to bait them with one missle, wait for flare, and fire another while they can't deploy more, YOU CAN HIT THEM /ENDLESSLY/ AND THEY WILL NOT DIE\n\nI SPENT TWENTY MINUTES ON /ONE/ GUY AND JUST LOADED HIM WITH MISSLES ENDLESSLY AND HE WILL NOT CRASH. This is the point where I said "screw this trash" and shut the game off.\n\nDid I mention that the tutorial leads directly into a rail turret mission? A RAIL TURRET MISSION. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECT ACES WHAT ARE YOU DOING. THIS IS A /FLYING/ GAME. YOU MAKE /FLYING/ GAMES. I DIDN'T PAY REAL CASH MONEY DOLLARS TO HOLD RT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES AND ENJOY THE FRACKING SCENERY.\n\nI don't even wanna KNOW what the AC130 missions other reviewers mentioned are like.\n\nFew more nitpicks from a flight sim/arcade vet: The stalling mechanic is just your nose falling. Yeah, that would have been acceptable in 2002 ON THE PLAYSTATION FRIGGING TWO. You know, I seem to remember a real-feeling stalling mechanic IN A GOOD ACE COMBAT GAME.\nAll that happens when you brake while turning is you move a little faster. There's no smoothing or feel of a real plane decelerating and slowly tightening its turning radius or any kind of physics at all. It blows my mind that all the things I HATE about this game were already features IN PREVIOUS GAMES THATS NOT HOW PROGRESS WORKS-\n\ntl;dr: Sorry I really needed to vent all that. If you like arcadey, almost shmup action with all kinds of cinematic flair? This game is for you. If you like flight sims or ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS ACE COMBAT GAMES THEN NO FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY. I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle because if I had paid $20 for this I would probably sue Project Aces,\n\nGod... I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a game that I have to just stop playing to avoid future embarassment. I've never written a review. This made me so upset that I sat down and wrote a two-page, 850 word review about how disappointed I am,\n\nOut of ten? How low does the scale go? Because that's my answer. Screw this game.

So to enjoy this you must forget your previous encounter with the ace combat franchise in terms of gameplay mechanics and even the story telling. This is made like a interactive movie and you are in the ride with limited steering options because the whole thing moves on tracks at high speed. This is the curse and blessing of this game depending how you look at it. It gets hectic and exhilarating but it does not have great characters or story or immersion. I myself like the action which is frantic. Story wise this is as bad as the Michael Bay movies get... The cheesy Russian terrorists to mess up the whole world kind of plot I personally could not care less about. It's not even told in an engaging way, even at a time when terrorism is actually a hot potato right now. I feel like game developers swap back and forth with the washout writers that come from hollywood when they can't make it there, and vice versa. Seriously gaming in general is on a steep declining slope in terms of quality of content. Good graphics don't alone make a good game. However this game for me as I'm a casual gamer,is okay in terms of the over the top, Top Gun'esque action. This is like the 'independence day' version of aerial combat. It's not good storywise or by characters, but action leaves your heart pounding and liking it when brains are in need of relaxing and crave for just stupid action for sake of action.","March 23","true","7.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

While the DFM mode adds a cool element of spectacular destruction, it wears out its welcome when it is literally forced onto the player in some sections. These kind of sequences aren't new and they can work well, like in the new Fallouts. However, there you voluntarily activate the sequence. Here, it's required in some portions. It literally becomes an on the rail shooter without warning and only serves to jar.\n\nBut, the most damning and horrible shortcoming is the control interface: You're literally forced to use a gamepad lest you have to endure shoddy keyboard controls or even worse joystick control. The Joystick support is non-existent. This is unacceptable. Some say this is a game meant to be played on a gamepad and this just smacks of apologetics for laziness that has become so familiar within the industry. Even Tom Clancy's HAWX, which wasn't all that good, had a basic dead zone slider and that came out in 2009, this was early 2013. There's no excuse for this at all. Why can't someone with a joystick enjoy a game about flight? Why is the joystick suddenly a peripheral only for the hardcore flight sim? And why are people defending this lazy thinking as if spending money on a game were a privilege for them?\n\nIn the end, this is a horrible game and for those seeking a good arcade flying experience would be better served with the original HAWX or, better still, going out and buying a PS2 with its trilogy of Ace Combats. Those games are superior in everyway to this pile of dung. If you're looking for a good arcadey experience on pc? Your regular flight sims can provide; just crank down the physic settings and difficulty. Wings of Prey is also another good choice for that when compared to this.\n\nEither way, this games is awful.

It is an unforgivably terrible addition to the series and cannot be avoided as many objectives require the player to use this mode. Some players might be able to work with this game mode and still appreciate Ace Combat's attention to detail and diverse plane selection, I however could not; preferring to play the older titles and hoping on the newer ones.","January 23","false","0.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

One night I went in and some kid was hogging the Playstation station. He wouldn't get off so I bought my own console because Air Combat was just that good. It wasn't til a few weeks later that I discovered Doom and then Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. Air Combat sold me on Playstation.\n\nAction, action, action. As soon as you shoot down one bunch, they're replaced with another bunch. That could be a good thing but in this game I just found it to be tedious. You're constantly turning, pulling G's. It seems like it never ends and then they give you an awful cut scene and then they turn you into a helicopter gunner. If fighter jets fought in stadium sized battles then this would be an accurate sim. I almost never feel like I'm flying. I'm just steering a camera around some tight turns with a picture of a jet plane in front of me. They never let you do your own thing like explore the world or the capabilities of the jet. It never feels like anything more than a game.\n\nThe game is constantly telling you to do things. Sure it is helpful to integrate the tutorial with the gameplay but it sucks when a huge flashing "Y" button starts throbbing in the middle of your intense dogfight. The game is ordering you to eject into a cutscene.\n\nFor an action game I'm surprised they weren't concerned how bad this game is at giving you the feeling of speed and acceleration. At least in the early game the feeling of S and A just isn't there for more than a second. I never feel like I am moving through air or being lifted by lift. I just turn my camera with the pasted on HUD and go to different parts of the background picture. Then they have that part where your computer or console takes you down real low through a forest of smoke stacks and girders. That might have been cool if I felt like I actually was steering or choosing to go there. I am moving sticks and such but obviously there's a lot of "assists" going on or something. Its almost a cutscene. You'd think that would be a good thing to be at the controls going through those maneuvers but the whole thing is so fudged and predetermined its just disappointing and annoying.\n\nThe sophisticated navigation consists of a little map in the corner with glowing arrows. It makes me feel so like I'm in a modern fighter plane.\n\nYou also won't be bowled over by the airplane models, the HUD models or anything like that. They all are definitely blah.\n\nI was a fan of the original Air Combat as it came out on the PS1 and while that wasn't really a sim, it was better than this. If you like a lot of fast action and constant battle or you're just wondering how something this action packed can be so boring  then Ace Combat might be the game for you.","April 4, 2014","false","14.6"," 38 of 67 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","38","67","0","5"

In fact, it is different. Some differences are good, even great, but there is something I considered crazy and not fun too. Let's start with the good stuff. My favorite one is the DFM or they call it Dog Fight Mode, which when you get closer to enemy bogey and lock on, you can enter DFM instead and chase the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through anything, aim very close and engage with your jets machine gun instead of missiles just because it looks cool and epic. There is also ASM  or they call it Air Strike Mode, almost similar to DFM except this one is for ground target. In some part of the mission, DFM or ASM are not optional because some enemies are just too bloody fast and good to be shot down normally. There are also the new helicopter mission, bomber mission, AC-130 mission like the one in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Blackhawk minigun mission? The campaign story is also quite interesting.\n\nAce Combat: Assault Horizon graphics are kinda great, and quite detailed. Overall the graphics is good. Performances is also great, no problems at all, at least on my end. Soundtracks of the game are kinda cool too.\n\nAlthough, there is some bad things also, like the helicopter mission. While the helicopter gameplay is kinda fun, it's doesn't feel that great, and barrel roll with helicopter every moment you're about to get shot? That's just not awesome for me. The helicopter control itself is kinda restricted, why can't anybody make control of helicopter game like in Battlefield series? Is it because it's too hard for some? At least make it a choice. Then the Blackhawk minigun mission... I thought this is a flight combat simulator? Then the skill of special enemies... boss fight? Wow, they're just so ace that even with DFM they can dodge almost all my missile every single time! Even locking them to enter DFM is kinda hard. I spend quite a time just to dodge instead destroying each other.\n\nBut aside from those, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon has many good moment. It's good flight simulator game and fun to play. Helicopter mode needs some polish and it has potential.

In fact, I didn't even know they existed. There are lot of complaints that it's not true to the previous games and I guess that's true.\n\nThis is a very arcadey airplane game with a story straight out of CoD: MW or some Tom Clancy thing. Those are my guilty pleasure so that's great. Most of the game is air-to-air combat, but sometimes they're mixed with air-to-ground enemies and then there are missions where you're a helicopter gunner, helicopter pilot, AC-130 gunner, B2 bomber and there's one anti ship mission where you're flying the A-10. So pretty varied. I played it with a DS4 for most things and a mouse for the gunner missions and it controlled mostly pretty well.\n\n+ Cheesy story where you get to save America\n+ The Dog Fight Mode made the whole thing more arcadey and, for me, more fun. Some people really don't like it.\n+ Plenty of aircrafts to choose from, including a F-35 with a Pac-Man skin. Because why the hell not.\n+ Some of the locales are cool, like a giant battle around the Kremlin.\n+ Anime skins for your aircraft. This is probably the best feature - your waifu is your co-pilot.\n+ Recently moved from GFWL to Steamworks, so there are no annoyances stemming from the former.\n\n- The helicopter controls felt somewhat weird, but I got over that.\n\nIn the end, I really enjoyed this.\n\nrating: 2 golden sloths\n","May 10, 2015","true","6.7"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","26","47","4","0"

On one side, the game's story is next to non-existant. What little story there is, from what I've seen so far, is about as generic and boring as can be.\n\nThat said, the story is obviously not meant to be the draw of the game. A game such as this really only has a bit of story to tie the gameplay together. It's the gameplay that is of greatest importance here. So, is the gameplay good? Well... I didn't think so.\n\nThe game relies far too much on it's new DFM feature. DFM might look cool, and even feel a bit exciting at first, but in the end it just turns the game into an interactive POV cutscene. "Hold the triggers and then push B when the lights turn red. Repeat until the enemy is dead. Find a new enemy and repeat again."\n\nA dogfight has the potential to be fun and rewarding, relying on the skill of the player to manuver his/her plane to keep on the tail of the enemy. But instead, we're told to rely almost entirelly on this new mechanic that does nothing that drain the game of what COULD have been it's greatest moments.\n\nAt least the game is pretty. the environments are well put together, and the radio chatter was definitely a treat.\n\nIn all, I'd give the game a 4/10\n\n[I'll update the review if my opinion changes after playing for more.]","August 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","12","20","4","0"

This was probably one of the most painful action games I've struggled through. The first struggle I had was buying this game when it still had GFWL included which is probably why I never bothered to finish it until recently. Thankfully that intrusive DRM has been removed and the game is now exclusively Steam based with achievements. The second struggle was painfully getting through the almost infinite number of enemies during each mission.\n\nNow all the mission objectives in this game are great and fun. I loved the story and the gameplay is easy to enjoy. The variety of jets and bombers available to fly is also satisfying. The biggest issue for me was the sheer number of enemies during each mission. It made each mission feel excessively long and excessively repetitive. The fact that it takes multiple missiles to kill each enemy didn't help matters either. I get the arcadeness of the game and that aspect actually made it more enjoyable over a realistic flight simulator. But enemy after enemy after enemy after enemy after enemy...you get the point. There is a moment during each mission where I found myself asking, "Good Lord, when is this going to end?"\n\nOk so that is pretty much all I didn't like. That aspect left some battle wounds and those scars will likely never fully heal, but I loved the game overall. The story is excellent.

When I first heard someone on my friends list say it was an arcade combat flight game with Fallout's V.A.T.S. system I was slightly intrigued. I even went as far as buying it just because of that description, and believe me when I say I normally can't enjoy these type of games, because they become repetitive too soon. And yes, Ace Combat doesn't manage to spice things up all that much, but it gives you many ways to play the game, more than many other games in this genre. Missions are diverse and the gameplay is fun, with indeed some sort of V.A.T.S. system in place to kill enemies. It's a fabulous way to make games like these more exciting. The action also regularly slows down to give you some eye candy to look at.\n\nIt all looks great in motion and playing the game with a controller (or joystick, I guess) is the right way to play it. I was really, really impressed by its visuals. Everything looked clean, and sharp and the people looked like real people (in a way). The camera is always close and the parts where you're not flying your aircraft look like you're watching a movie, with the right amount of motion blur and angles.\n\nThe game doesn't do everything right, of course. There are missions that rely on depth perception. There's one mission in particular where you have to use stealth in order to avoid getting seen by the radars. The reach of these radars is shown in large, moving, green triangles, but they're so close apart that I had to repeat the mission several times because it's so hard to see. All of this would've been unnecessary with the use of more color (darker green or light green, for example) or by setting them further apart. It's one of the few times that I was really frustrated.\n\nConcerning the length of the game; this is perfect. It's not too long and not too short, it's just right. You can finish it in 8 or 9 hours so there's plenty of gameplay in it.\n\nOk, time to wrap things up again: Ace Combat Assault Horizon is by far my favorite arcade combat flight game so far.

With that being said, I don't think Assault Horizon strays too far away from its old style with this one. There's this new mechanic called dogfight mode which is a step away from the traditional "Lead your Target" tactic for dogfights. Instead of using your skill to out manuever planes, you can use a snap lock on feature that automatically locks you onto the enemey's tail.\n\nI'm imagining this is where the game gets its hate. I honeslty don't have a problem wth it because it gives a very interesting cinematic approach to dog fights. In this mode the plane sollows completely behind the enemy while the target tries to escape. This can be a number of things in a number of places depending on where you're fighting and I find that interesting.If you ever feel like you're sick of it, just stick to firing rockets-never fails!\n\nLike I said, a step away from intense dogfights but still a solid flight combat game. Another really interesting feat is that you fly multiple typs of airfract, helicopters, AC-130s, etc. This is a step in a new direction of "Ace Combat" glory. Is it enough to stack up to a game that you want to come back to?\n\nWell I like it.","July 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And then they put me into a chopper and the game just sucked. The controls are terrible, especially compared to the dozen of other chopper games I've played throughout the years. It uses a control method that some early 3-D shooters used in the early nineties where you turn by pushing the aiming reticule against the side of the screen. Off course if you want to aim at something that is now in the middle of your screen you'll have to turn the reticule all the way back. And making a quick turn is impossible so you can't strafe around a target while aiming at it. There is a reason why only a few games ever used this control method and why it rarely makes a come back nowadays (I think there are a few WII games that use this control method, which kinda proves my point) ... it sucks big time. Since there are no alternative controls for the chopper and you can't skip the chopper missions those missions ruin the entire game for me. The developers can't claim they implemented these controls because they wanted to make them more realistic. Either choppers have their machine guns mounted on the sides and the aiming reticule would then move with the chopper (unlike in this game). Or the machine gun can swivel and aim independently from the chopper (in an Apache helicopter for instance the machine gun follows the head movements of the pilot and will aim where he is looking) which also doesn't match with the controls in the game.","May 8","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where the gameplay, sound and presentation excel, the story greatly disappoints, rarely doing the title justice. AC is a risky gamble by developers. In marrying the niche genre of flight action represented by its past titles with the pick-up-and-play modern-warfare genres enjoyed by masses of casual and regular gamers.\n\nAC boasts a completely revamped destruction engine, full-spectrum missions that expand into helicopter and support-plane varieties, as well as a brand-new 'Dog-Fight Mode' flight mechanic intended to bring jet-on-jet action right into the face of the player. This it does very well. Transitioning between the standard flight controls into the shooter-inspired DFM is smooth and crisp, and letting the game take partial control over your jet while you focus on keeping the enemy plane within your sights and unloading lead and missiles upon him is incredibly entertaining as you see his plane fragment bit by bit, oil streaks splattering over your screen as he finally explodes, debris burning past you. Even more satisfying is chaining multiple DFMs together then turning the tables on a pursuer with a well-timed stunt maneuver that puts you behind him, and right on track to blow him to smithereens.\nBut once you engage in DFM you dont need any skill at all to chase your opponent. It's all auto. You don't need to care about natural obstacles and such because the AI simply removes it from equation. When an enemy engages it on you, it takes luck rather than skill to shake it off you. Without DFM engaged it's almost impossible to destroy enemy planes at medium and long ranges, so no need to carry missiles for that purpose. Bosses and main targets can only be destroyed in DFM.\n\nHelicopter missions offer a more down-to-earth approach, as you weave between buildings and get closer than ever to the ground in missions that have you taking out tanks, infantry positions and even other choppers. There are also bomber runs with incredibly satisfying explosion shots and even a heavy bomber mission that plays rather similarly to that famous sequence in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, offering the same entertainment value, with a tad bit more action as you can now be shot down by enemy missiles.\n\nJoypad controls are easy to pick up and the camera offers a nice 'over-the-shoulder' view of the action.\n\nTechnically, AC is not the best-looking game, but it doesn't look too bad either. Plane textures and models, in both third- and first-person cockpit views, look great. The ground looks decent from most altitudes, with buildings and structures modeled with sufficient detail to remain presentable.\n\nPlus AC is easily one of the best-sounding games. Explosions rumble your bass speakers as bombs make their impact, and the sound of lead shredding through metal as the your Vulcan cannon buzzes away is one I cannot get enough of.","January 8, 2014","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My biggest gripe with the game is the fact that often, when you are chasing a high-ranking bad-guy, he will become unkillable until he leads you to a certain location, just so a cool killcam can occur. This bothered me because I feel it stifles your freedom as a pilot and negatively effects gameplay, just for the sake of showing off the visuals (which are fantastic btw). The controls take a little getting used to, especially if you've played past Ace Combat titles on the playstation, but should be no problem after a few hours of gameplay.

I love flying games. I love them to bits. I relish the speed, the adrenaline, the viceral sense of the bits of metal that rocket past you at mach 2 as you riddle another plane with bullets. Ace Combat Assault Horizon offers all of that and that is why I like it.\n\nAce Combat has a long history that I have never experienced; so you will not get any comparisons with its predecessors from me. Instead I will tell you exactly why this game is awesome and why you'd do yourself a disservice when not playing it. Let's start with the obvious; the mental presentation. Stuff is literally thrown at you. You are experiencing a barrage of unyielding terror and excitement all at once. The game runs overtime to get you the best angle on the action. The camera will cut back from the action to show you the minute details of your enemy's plane as it disintegrates when you unleash a flurry of bullets and missles at at. If it wasn't enough, the game might just give you a front row seat and follow the missle as travels toward its mark.\n\nNot exciting enough you say? Lets talk about dogfighting; the bread and butter of any aerial combat game. Initiation a dogfight in this game requires you to close the distance. A quick button press initiates the special pursuit mode that hooks your plane to your target and the pulse pounding chase begins. Your plane broadly follows the target, but the goal is to keep the crosshair in the center at a insane speeds to make your lock-on kick in faster to shove your deadly missles up his rear end faster. Your mark can escape though. By swaying and dodging, or by hitting the brakes hard and leveling the craft at the right moment you might find yourself being chased. Even then, if you can react fast enough you can instercept his manouver and rivet his plan as he flips in front of you. Everything is carefully accentuated with flares, scratches, explosions and other effect that really make the game's catch prase seem like the real deal: "Make metal bleed"\n\nThe story mode is a wee bit short. And by a wee bit I mean seriously short. One day is all you need. You do get some variation in missions and vehicles. Such as flying an Apache Helicoper, B2-Spirit Bomber or a DC-130 gunship, but the real kick comes from flying the many jet fighters. From the F-14 all the way to the latests supersonic machines. Multiplayer allows you to test your skill against other pilots, or cooperate in thwarting the CPU from bombing major cities. The only real problem is the general lack of players. So if anything, this review should have convinced you to shell some cash and come fly with me, cause I can use a few wingmen.","April 6, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played and completed almost every Ace Combat to date so I was scared I was going to be disappointed with this one. I finally got it just a few days ago, played it and completed the single player, and let me tell you - it was easily worth it! The graphics are great (It's not the prettiest game ever but it runs smooth as butter and the overall detail level is high; explosions and plane models look exceptionally great), the gameplay is fast and frantic, there is rarely a dull moment in the entire 16 mission campaign. The story is nothing to write home about but it's interesting enough. The missions are surprisingly varied (especially in comparison to older AC games) and a lot of fun to play trough. The planes handle like a dream and the controls are great (I used a X360 controller). I see a lot of people are bashing the new dog fighting mechanic but I have to say I liked it - sure, it happens a bit too often but it never really gets boring and it's not without challenge (I've played the game on HARD difficulty). I also see a lot of people bashing the helicopter missions and the turret sections and I can't agree with them. The helicopters are a great addition to the game (it's not without problems, sure, I died many times because of the controls, for example) and the turret missions are short and fun, just as they should be. All in all this is a great game, easily recommendable to any fan of AC or action games in general. Just don't expect a simulation or something like that :) Oh yeah and - this IS a TRUE Ace Combat game, but I guess haters gonna hate anyway :)","August 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themonkeysmith/recommended/228400/","themonkeysmith","SoupSandwich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themonkeysmith/","101 products in account","In full disclosure I will admit that the only other Ace Combat game I have played is AC04:Shattered Skies, AC04 is one of my favorite games with an excellent combination of good story telling and solid controls, as such I am going to be using it as my reference point and I expect the majority of the other titles in the series to follow in AC04's vein. I will also admit that I have not played much of ACAH due to its multitude of problems, which include the issue of controls and the radical shift in game play compared to AC04.\nThe controls are awkward to players use to the traditional combination of mouse and keyboard flight simulators, they involve a combination of the arrow keys for the place of a joystick and place the yaw and acceleration on to the wasd. This setup does not give the precision that a mouse and keyboard or a controller gives, it just feels really clunky. Though the control settings claim to support mouse and keyboard, that is only during the helicopter and rail gun segments, the mouse is not supported when piloting fixed wing aircraft. This is a serious problem when you consider the fact that the game focuses on close range arcade style dogfighting, something that inherently requires precision, and leads to frustration at overturning your opponent almost constantly.\nThe gameplay itself is solid, if this had not been an ace combat game I may even call it good, it involves closing behind the opponents aircraft, pushing a button, and entering a “dogfight mode” where the camera is zoomed in and your reticule is expanded. In the dogfight mode the opponent is locked to your speed and can only turn, the goal is to use your cannon or a well timed missile to knock out your opponent. But my real issue is the fact that the gameplay is just so different from AC04 that it feels like a completely different series, it feels more arcady and badly put together. The controls don't help the game in anyway, so you really should buy a controller or a supported joystick (of which there are few) before purchasing the game.\n\nTL;DR: Controls are clunky and require a controller or joystick to use, the gameplay is so radically different that it might as well be a game from another series. A good game, but not a good Ace Combat.","July 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The cheesy but serviceable story serves to move the combat from one setting to the next and you won't mind as you shoot down enemy planes from the vintage MiG-21 to futuristic concept designs straight off the blueprints.  Never has aerial warfare looked so beautiful.","July 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

AC6 was by far my favorite Xbox 360 title. Much as I wish Namco-Bandai would port that one over to PC, this game makes for an adequate substitute.\n\nAt first I was a little upset about dog fight mode (a semi auto-pilot mode that for the most part keeps up with high-maneuverable enemies automaticlally while you just and and shoot at them), but after a while I realized; 1) It does have it's drawbacks, such as making it more difficult to evade missiles; and 2) You don't ~have~ to use it.\n\nKeyboard crontrols are pretty terrible for me. Thankfully I have an Xbox One controller, making the experience pretty much identicle to AC6 on the 360. The only difference (and a negative one in my opinion) is the absence of "Low-G Turning". The default controls can be set to classic style, which I've done being an Ace Combat veteran. I can't help but feel classic style should have been the default - a very minor gripe.\n\nThe story is set in the real world, which I think was a bit of a mistake on Namco-Bandai's part. I'm not incredibly deep into it yet, so I can't comment on whether it's good or not.\n\nOverall, if you like the Ace Combat series,..well...this is an Ace Combat game. You'll probably like this one too. Still crossing my fingers for the slim-to-none chance they decide to bring AC6 to the PC.","July 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game feels like a Michael Bay movie, much eye candy but little substance: graphics are OK, explosions and damage details on the aircraft are amazing, but the over-emphasis over cinematographicness has stripped almost every bit of "sim" aspect out of the game. In fact my biggest grievance is over DFM (DogFight Mode) which pretty much turns any close combat into a shooter on rails where you just have to wait for your missiles to have a lock on your target.\nWith this I am not saying that the game isn't any good, but treat it as an action game rather than a simulator, however simplified it could ever be.\n\nMy vote: 5.5/10","July 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a high paced fast air combat game, is it REALLY a good idea to have a tutorial that freezes the game to display a message? I failed the first mission a number of times due to this.\n\n2. Dogfight Mode - What the hell is this? A gross over-simplfication of flight mechanics to create a "YEAH EXPLOSIONS WOO" montage. I'm sorry, that's not why I play games, least of all flight sims, I don't want my hand held and the mechanics dumbed down to the point of infantile.\n\nAlso, Quick Time Events are a cancer that turns interactive video games into (in the words of Mr Yahtzee) "PRESS X TO NOT DIE" movies. Quick Time Events make up the bulk of maneuvers and avoidance techinques and having important aspects of a flight action game reduced to such simplistic levels is frankly painful.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm no flight sim anorak, but the bit of game I experienced made me feel like I was largely watching a vaguely interactive movie. The flight mechanics themselves seemed fairly alright, but are heavily bogged down by unnecessary gameplay mechanics to oversimplify dogfighting to the point of being banal. Enemy on your tail? complete the pseudo QTE and automagically maneuver behind the enemy, rather than you know, actually using skill to outmaneuver.\n\nOther reviewers compare this to COD in the sky, maybe that's true, but at least COD doesn't make you enter a CQC mode to shoot someone in the face at point blank range.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeealex/recommended/228400/","zeealex","This is Not a Snail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeealex/","93 products in account","Well, first off I'd just like to say now, I WAS an ace combat fan prior to this game.\nI played this game previously when I was a console junkie, on the Xbox 360 after loving Ace Combat 4 for many years on my playstation 2, Back then, i was expecting it to be just the same old lovable gameplay mechanics, just updated graphics and a new storyline based in a fictuous world.\n\nI was wrong, on all fronts.\n\nThey brought in dogfight mode, or as I liked to call it, dogshit mode, which held your hand through something that wasn't particularly hard to do in the first place in this franchise, which is dogfight. Now I remember Ace Combat 4 being unremarkable in the sense that there were very few moments where I'd actually have to break contact and fight off an enemy attacking from behind. But dogfight mode goes over the top with it, it happens too much, and suddenly in order to maneuver and engage a radar target behind me, I have to press a button rather than have the ability to, do it myself.\n\nnot only that but the sudden need to change the camera mode in third person, i don't particularly like 3rd person anyway, but suddenly I need to zoom in on my guns when I fire them, and the same with my bombs, too. okay, namco, keep taking those tablets.\n\nI could no longer pitch and roll like in previous games, no, instead my turning was forced at a certain angle and my speed affected how much I turned, not exactly a wrong thing, speed does affect your turning, but it just felt wrong...\n\nnot to mention, suddenly your aircraft are like the T-1000 from terminator 2, they have regenerating health... HA! how laughable.\n\nNext, the storyline was America vs Russia, oh dear, not only have they removed the fictional worlds I was used to in Ace Combat, but they've also jumped on this bandwagon? seriously?!\nI won't say too much because, spoilers, but it feels like the aircraft version of call of duty in terms of the story, in fact most of the time it feels like story elements have just been ripped right out of Modern Warfare and applied in the most generic way possible to this game.\nThe characters were very obvious and quite frankly unprofessional at most times, there was the overly masculine edgy black dude, the pretty blonde girl who looks like the woman from Ridge Racer Type 4, who is so obviously into the colonel, who is this really edgy legendary fighter ace (apparently) who likes to say "♥♥♥♥" and "damn" alot, then tell people to cut the chatter when he's the one talking. Then theres Guts, the overly enthusiastic dude who wants to impress his squadron leader. then of course there's the stereotypical vodka drinking russian dude who speaks with a russian accent, and you SO can't tell that he's a bad guy or something, because this game SO isn't obvious(!)\n\nso the storyline annoyed me a little but I gave it a chance at the time, trying to find something to love in this game, along with that, your player character is no longer an enigmatic pilot who you only know the callsign of, and also that he/she only flies jets (the addition of helicopters made me want to cry)\n\nso it's 2014, I feel like trying it again, following my departure from my Xbox and the entry of my PC.\n\nby this point I wasn't really an ace combat "fan" anymore I got around to playing 6, and then I started using my PC more, realised that there was more fun to be had so I let ace combat gather dust....\n\nI played this on the free weekend after i saw it advertised and old frustrations brewed up, the same criticisms above applied, only worse because of how badly this game was ported.\n\nWhile I can say, for a 2013, game the graphics are quite good, but the options are horrific, you get to choose whether anti aliasing is on or off, and that's really about it.\nnot only that, but the menu isn't even mouse friendly, no, you have to use your keyboard/controller.\n\nspeaking of controllers, good luck finding a controller configuration that actually makes any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense! remapping the controller is a nightmare, and unless you know what button is what, you're going to find the first level a frustrating guessing game. I spent a good 20 minutes on the first level figuring out whats what.\n\noh and that tutorial level, isn't much fun anyway, its a hand holding bunch of nonsense in which you MUST do what the game tells you or you can't get off that screen or the other guy won't die.\n\nin other words, this "enhanced edition" is a sloppy console port with upgraded textures... oooh wow.\n\nNamco, if you read this... I'd play Ace Combat again if the next one had an option to turn DFM off, and just have classic ace combat controls, and gameplay on a carefully ported game. I'd gladly pay £40 for the next game if it were like that.\nthere's a point where a game can be innovated too much, and people reject it, and this is a classic example.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it, purely for the fact it's a sloppily made game with too much hand holding going on.","July 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played  the original Ace Combat game, Air Combat which was developed for the Playstation 1 back in 1995. It has been interesting seeing the additions added over the years, not just an improvement of graphics but also gameplay features, an expanding storyline and interesting fictional aircraft. This current Ace Combat has deviated slightly from most of the others by being set in the real world with a different fictional backdrop as well as removing most of the fictional technology seen in the earlier games but is still a great addition to the series.\n\nOn the whole i think this game is worth playing, there are many highly detailed aircraft to choose from and not just the fighters this time round, bombers and helicopter gunships are available to choose from too adding to the diversity of the game.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDecided to play this again tonight after months and months of inactivity on it, and just wow.\n\nI've been playing a few other games alot recently, Elite Dangerous, Vector Thrust, as well as a bit of Gmod with friends, along with a few others, but nothing for me plays quite so intense and fast paced as this game.\n\nThe downside is, the rarity of other players and the inablity to start a match with just AIs.\n\nIf only more gamers were also aircraft enthusiasts then this wouldn't be a problem. We might also have more Ace Combat games on PC too if this were the case, as a larger player population would result in more income for the company from people buying them.\n\nIm going to try logging in from time to time a bit more to see if anyone else does, will be prioritising Capital Conquest.\n\nA warning and a tip to other players, I dogfight classic style so don't expect any alert from dfm activating, only the RWR going off from missile locks if im in the match. Just be glad the guns are almost useless without DFM or I'd most likely manage a quicker fight in a tight turn, though I can still use the Railgun on the CFA-44 for close in encounters. :D\n\nI find it more fun this way as theres no computer assist involved and as a long time fan of the series. In fact probably the first game I ever played was Air Combat on the PS1 many years ago.\n\nPS wish there was an ingame mic mute option as i can't use skype if i play this game or other players get half of a conversation spamming down their headset :(\nAlso if you have rudder pedals with toe brakes, they go mad in the menu and constantly make it scroll with no way to disable it.","February 21, 2013","true","173.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found everything else poor.\n\nIn my opinion this game is the Silent Hill 4, or Final Fantasy 13 of the series. The point where successfull great games and IP's become multi-million dollar + countless man-hour spent on making something that betray long time fans and are bad games on their own. I often wonder if such horrible games are the developers answer to the few people who griped about how bad certain aspects of previous good games were.\n\nHere are the reasons why I think this is a bad game:\n\nThe controls for this game are absolutely horrible. I thought the $35 price point dropped instead of $50 would be worth the inclusion of random helicopters and stuff, but no. I looked at a review on IGN and I'm a fan of Ace Combat games so I thought "Hey why not give it a chance, they switched a little gameplay between the other ones I have, and they turned out really well!".\n\nI was wrong. You're fighting the controls in this game every single second. In 4, 5, and Zero the games had VERY GOOD controls that actually did what you wanted and nothing else and flowed really well. After beating those on normal difficulty setting and got skilled I beat them on Ace mode.\nIn this game there's twitchy controls that roll too much, and do nothing when I need to, often at the same time in logic paradox ways. Your personal skill or strategy has very little do with success in missions.\n\nInstead of being an arcade-y aircraft game like all the previous ones, it's an On Rails Shooter and the controls similar to previous AC games are just to get you on the rails and used to fool you into buying the game. It's more like a series of quicktime events than anything else.\n\nDogfight Mode has caused me to crash into the ground more times than all the previous titles combined! It will shove you out of DFM randomly sometimes and since many planes go down near the ground when you enter DFM this often leads to heavy damage or death. In the one or two missions with bad weather it's very confusing, as if flying in a storm wasn't disorienting enough. When in Dogfight Mode the camera has a tendency to shake violently the whole time which is hard to look at, and a serious health hazard to anyone who has even the slightest epilepsy or proneness to limb twitching/ convulsions. I'm also glad I don't get sea/car sick because I'm sure I'd have vomited many times by now.\n\nMissiles only 1/100 actually hit what you fire at, except in Dogfight Mode, not even the QAAM's which in previous titles were sure hits you saved for enemy aces, nor the SAAM's while having a lock on them the whole time.\nThis is especially bad in the missions to kill enemy bombers which should be easy targets but you still have to enter Dogfight Mode and hit them with half a dozen missiles, even though your allies SAY they'll take out fighter escorts they don't actually do anything helpfull.\n\nEnemies are often invincible and not even targetable until you're told to attack them, even though they are already firing at you and your allies, some of them mission critical allies. Even after you are told you can attack them, ground/sea targets are often still invincible unless you enter the bombing run version of Dogfight Mode.\n\nOne bomber aircraft mission is nothing but that, and it interupts you with "tutorial tips" that take control away from you in the middle of a bombing run making you unable to hit the targets causing you to fail the mission over and over.\nIn the "gunner" missions where you man the heli gatlin or that huge planes cannons you are fighting the controls to aim at what you're supposed to be hitting because the targets are outside the edge of where you can shoot most of the time.\n\nDodging missiles is difficult because there's hardly a second in the game that you aren't hearing MISSLE MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE (repeat constantly for hours). Flares appear to do nothing whatsoever, not that you can tell when you NEED to use them because of the previous thing, and have a ridiculous reload time. The only mission I noticed Flares actually save me is the above paragraphs bombing mission where you choose between the 117 or the B2 bomber both of which can spam flares and have dozens of flares.\n\nThe bigger map radar you can switch to shows an area MUCH larger than the actual mission area, and enemies and allies are a worthless blob of colored dots mushed together in a small portion of it.\n\nOnce an enemy is on your tail in their Dogfight Mode there's no way to shake them except by spamming the DFM button. It tells you to slow down and when there's two icons overlapped to level out... Gee! Okay! I'll just level out and allow the enemy to lock on while my allies are worthless and do nothing while I take several more missiles and die repeatedly! There's a hard to explain thing where you slow down and speed up to get the icons to overlap so you can press the DFM button.\n\nTOO MANY of the respawn checkpoints in air-to-air missions start out with a head on squadron of enemies already locked onto you. It's difficult not to get hit right from the start.\n\nThere's also no mission briefings. The previous games had great mission briefing scenes and screens. You get no information past a little place with two words above where you select your aircraft on whether it will be air-air, air-ground, or whatever. And even that is no real indication of what you might be facing or are expected to do. The couple cutscenes that look like mission briefings give no real information, they just take several minutes to say "hey these are the bad guys, and look at the bomb we're looking for" all of which you already knew, the end, pick a plane.\n\nThe "story" for this game is weak and sparse, and in most of the cutscenes there's button presses and looking around for no good reason relevant to story or gameplay. No outcome of the story or cutscene changes based on where you look or if you press a button or not. It's their way of saying "we know alot of you have ADD so press this button, monkeys".\n\nI might actually like this game if they called it "Desert Strike: Subtitle" (remember that game series for the Genesis which included Jungle Strike and Urban Strike?) and only had helicopter missions with the controls from this game. If they improved the camera angles - specifically the lag in cockpit view between looking in a direction and actually turning that way and a further up and back outside the heli view. And if they improved the weapons - you can't see individual targets until you're right on top of them and can't do anything intelligent like firing from maximum range - the 4AGM refuses to have a set target lock so you often waste missiles while strafing unless you sit still taking fire while trying to fire them at specific targets. Minus the annoying physics defying barrel rolls.\n\nThat's it. End of my review of the problems with this game.\n\nEdit: I'm adding that I played this on the medium difficulty "Pilot" and turned the controls to "Original" AC mode and did not use Flight Assist which I'm not sure what that even does as I never noticed any difference in how the planes handled. I was using a gamepad to play the entire game. I did play this game all the way through because I liked the previous games so much I thought I'd see it through just in case it ever got good. It didn't.","August 15, 2014","false","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I'm a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator and am also a fan of the techno thriller genre from Ace Combat series or the great Tom Clancy HAWX games.  Yes, I get that Ace Combat (or even HAWX) is scarecly a "flight simulator", but I also frame these flying games in the realm of flying exotic (and highly classified) aircraft on a console or PC.\n\nThe Good:  Flying military aircraft on highly classified if not outright impossible missions.  The developers here did an outstanding job of replicating the aircraft inside and out!  You even fly an Apache and as a gunner on the side of a Blackhawk.  Graphics during the cutscenes are awesome!  Even shooting down some of the enemy aircraft are eyecatching events with the oil splattering and aircraft breaking apart.\n\nThe Bad:  Why the developers strayed from a winning formula is beyond me.  It would seem that they tried to combine a flying game with a fighting game (think Afterburner meets Mortal Kombat).  There's only one way to destroy certain enemies and that's to engage them up close and fly low to the ground with the cinematography of a Braveheart or Gladiator swordfighting scene.  To escape some of the missiles, you need to pay attention to two arrows lining up.  Basically, they tried to hard to make this game stand out.  Controlling the Apache or the Blackhawk gunner was clumsy.\n\nThe Ugly:  Interesting story...from what I know of it.  The game play is awful!  So awful, that I couldn't trudge through it and get immersed in the game.  It pains me to say this as I love these types of games, and wanted to love this game so much as I've loved the other Ace Combat games.   The voice acting (or the script) needed work but it wasn't terrible.  Like other flying games, even the good ones, your missions require you to fly against a numerically superior air force.  Thankfully, your aircraft carries a numerically superior amount of missiles.  IMHO, this "numerically superior aircraft vs you and your missiles" theme leads to repetitive and quickly boring gameplay.  It didn't help that some of the missions dragged on adding little if any value to the overall story!\n\nIt breaks my heart to do this, but no....I cannot recommend ACAH.  If you get it for free, then maybe.  But no, I can't recommend this game especially since it doesn't even approach the standards of Ace Combat Fires of Liberation.","July 2, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I found everything else poor.\n\nIn my opinion this game is the Silent Hill 4, or Final Fantasy 13 of the series. The point where successfull great games and IP's become multi-million dollar + countless man-hour spent on making something that betray long time fans and are bad games on their own. I often wonder if such horrible games are the developers answer to the few people who griped about how bad certain aspects of previous good games were.\n\nHere are the reasons why I think this is a bad game:\n\nThe controls for this game are absolutely horrible. I thought the $35 price point dropped instead of $50 would be worth the inclusion of random helicopters and stuff, but no. I looked at a review on IGN and I'm a fan of Ace Combat games so I thought "Hey why not give it a chance, they switched a little gameplay between the other ones I have, and they turned out really well!".\n\nI was wrong. You're fighting the controls in this game every single second. In 4, 5, and Zero the games had VERY GOOD controls that actually did what you wanted and nothing else and flowed really well. After beating those on normal difficulty setting and got skilled I beat them on Ace mode.\nIn this game there's twitchy controls that roll too much, and do nothing when I need to, often at the same time in logic paradox ways. Your personal skill or strategy has very little do with success in missions.\n\nInstead of being an arcade-y aircraft game like all the previous ones, it's an On Rails Shooter and the controls similar to previous AC games are just to get you on the rails and used to fool you into buying the game. It's more like a series of quicktime events than anything else.\n\nDogfight Mode has caused me to crash into the ground more times than all the previous titles combined! It will shove you out of DFM randomly sometimes and since many planes go down near the ground when you enter DFM this often leads to heavy damage or death. In the one or two missions with bad weather it's very confusing, as if flying in a storm wasn't disorienting enough. When in Dogfight Mode the camera has a tendency to shake violently the whole time which is hard to look at, and a serious health hazard to anyone who has even the slightest epilepsy or proneness to limb twitching/ convulsions. I'm also glad I don't get sea/car sick because I'm sure I'd have vomited many times by now.\n\nMissiles only 1/100 actually hit what you fire at, except in Dogfight Mode, not even the QAAM's which in previous titles were sure hits you saved for enemy aces, nor the SAAM's while having a lock on them the whole time.\nThis is especially bad in the missions to kill enemy bombers which should be easy targets but you still have to enter Dogfight Mode and hit them with half a dozen missiles, even though your allies SAY they'll take out fighter escorts they don't actually do anything helpfull.\n\nEnemies are often invincible and not even targetable until you're told to attack them, even though they are already firing at you and your allies, some of them mission critical allies. Even after you are told you can attack them, ground/sea targets are often still invincible unless you enter the bombing run version of Dogfight Mode.\n\nOne bomber aircraft mission is nothing but that, and it interupts you with "tutorial tips" that take control away from you in the middle of a bombing run making you unable to hit the targets causing you to fail the mission over and over.\nIn the "gunner" missions where you man the heli gatlin or that huge planes cannons you are fighting the controls to aim at what you're supposed to be hitting because the targets are outside the edge of where you can shoot most of the time.\n\nDodging missiles is difficult because there's hardly a second in the game that you aren't hearing MISSLE MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE (repeat constantly for hours). Flares appear to do nothing whatsoever, not that you can tell when you NEED to use them because of the previous thing, and have a ridiculous reload time. The only mission I noticed Flares actually save me is the above paragraphs bombing mission where you choose between the 117 or the B2 bomber both of which can spam flares and have dozens of flares.\n\nThe bigger map radar you can switch to shows an area MUCH larger than the actual mission area, and enemies and allies are a worthless blob of colored dots mushed together in a small portion of it.\n\nOnce an enemy is on your tail in their Dogfight Mode there's no way to shake them except by spamming the DFM button. It tells you to slow down and when there's two icons overlapped to level out... Gee! Okay! I'll just level out and allow the enemy to lock on while my allies are worthless and do nothing while I take several more missiles and die repeatedly! There's a hard to explain thing where you slow down and speed up to get the icons to overlap so you can press the DFM button.\n\nTOO MANY of the respawn checkpoints in air-to-air missions start out with a head on squadron of enemies already locked onto you. It's difficult not to get hit right from the start.\n\nThere's also no mission briefings. The previous games had great mission briefing scenes and screens. You get no information past a little place with two words above where you select your aircraft on whether it will be air-air, air-ground, or whatever. And even that is no real indication of what you might be facing or are expected to do. The couple cutscenes that look like mission briefings give no real information, they just take several minutes to say "hey these are the bad guys, and look at the bomb we're looking for" all of which you already knew, the end, pick a plane.\n\nThe "story" for this game is weak and sparse, and in most of the cutscenes there's button presses and looking around for no good reason relevant to story or gameplay. No outcome of the story or cutscene changes based on where you look or if you press a button or not. It's their way of saying "we know alot of you have ADD so press this button, monkeys".\n\nI might actually like this game if they called it "Desert Strike: Subtitle" (remember that game series for the Genesis which included Jungle Strike and Urban Strike?) and only had helicopter missions with the controls from this game. If they improved the camera angles - specifically the lag in cockpit view between looking in a direction and actually turning that way and a further up and back outside the heli view. And if they improved the weapons - you can't see individual targets until you're right on top of them and can't do anything intelligent like firing from maximum range - the 4AGM refuses to have a set target lock so you often waste missiles while strafing unless you sit still taking fire while trying to fire them at specific targets. Minus the annoying physics defying barrel rolls.\n\nThat's it. End of my review of the problems with this game.\n\nEdit: I'm adding that I played this on the medium difficulty "Pilot" and turned the controls to "Original" AC mode and did not use Flight Assist which I'm not sure what that even does as I never noticed any difference in how the planes handled. I was using a gamepad to play the entire game. I did play this game all the way through because I liked the previous games so much I thought I'd see it through just in case it ever got good.

If you have or like these game (H.A.W.X, H.A.W.X II) you probably will love AC:AH too.\nif you really want to play AC, don't read my review afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really love Ace Combat since it's first apperance in PS1, and I just can't deny this AC:AH is a dumb-down version from every Ace Combat ever released. to summarize my review, I'll point out the pro & con.\n\nPro :\n+ Graphic are nice and well done, the cockpit view are beast\n+ Loading time is good. lol.\n+ There's many option for jet, jet color, choice of weapon, in every mission. So you can refining your playstile well.\n+ Homing missile mechanic are improved from the latest AC, it's hard enough to avoid it, but didn't make it too hard either. You can do tricks like stall tho.\n+ The story a bit interesting, but back again to Russia vs America fairytale.\n\nCon :\n- The DFM mode really breakdown this game. here's the problem and why; some enemies (like boss or some red target) can't be taken down by just aiming missile, they must be forced to DFM with you to trigger the scripted storyline. And you will notice it just the same if you repeat the mission, even if you are miles apart from the last DFM happening.

They are made for consoles, not for PC. You can't control the planes with the mouse, you need to use the keyboard bothhanded. It's absolute hateful to play like this. For the helicopters you can use your mouse, but either the mouse is to fast - or to slow to turn the heli around. And the mouse control is very jerky, too. On the other side you have autoaim, but.. wth? No one likes that (on a PC)...\nEven other vehicles or weapons are hard and very bad to control.\n\nThe "settings" should really not been called "settings", you can't change enough.\n\nThe graphics are more or less ok, but only for the vehicles you fly. For ground based enemies... it reminds me of "C&C Generals", which is now really old - this graphics are bad.\nThere are only really really simple graphics settings available: Brightness, V-Sync and Anti-Alaising on/off. Nothing more..\n\nThe missions aren't really exciting. There aren't even all in the same context as it seems.\nThe missions are long, you don't really know so much whats happening there - and why. You are doing always the same for what felt like half an hour. (And this with this bad controls.)

I will disagree that the DFM system is necessary to take down the Target Leads like many of the other reviews have stated, but the enemy forces the mode far too frequently to be realistic or to make the harder difficulties even remotely enjoyable.\n\nAttempting to bait enemies away from a furball is next to impossible unless they are not a main target.  Main targets remained locked together in a mess on one side of the battlefield and you are forced to go into it to get anything done and that results in constant missile dodging and lock-ons from the enemy and being forced into DFM by two enemies at a time at every moment.  The AI pilots on your side are useless and pretty much never get kills or even assist in combat, unlike in HAWX.  Their only purpose is as a distraction for the enemy and they don't even do that well.\n\nIn general, I enjoyed the game up until the obvious betrayal of the Russians.  Many reviewers have said that the storyline is forgettable, but, again, I would have to disagree.  While predictable, the story should interest anyone with a good understanding of military and how warfare is engaged in.  The multiplayer seems to be where this game shines and what it was intended for, because I am completely finding the campaign difficult to enjoy solo.  Perhaps in co-op it would be more fun.\n\nA patch to the AI is definitely necessary to enjoy the campaign in this game.  Fortunately, playing multiplayer seems to feel like a much more realistic combat scenario than the BS you go through in the campaign storyline.  I will still recommend this game to people.  On lower difficulties, the game is fun and worth going through, but since higher difficulties are necessary for some of the unlocks, you won't be able to get everything like that.  Multiplayer will be a rewarding experience all around, though more people need to buy into the game so that there is more population available for multiplayer.","April 7, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have always been an avid Ace Combat fan with Ace Combat 6 Fires Of Liberation being my favourite (Xbox 360). Assault Horizon just does not hold the same feeling of fun that ace combat 6 offered. The forced use of dogfights while cool in concept just becomes annoying and less feeling like you are able to fly as you wish like in ace combat 6. Although that being said I still think it worth a play as the game still shines in some areas such as cinematic plane finishers and some dogfights can be pretty intense as the game goes on.

While it looks like one, it's made to be a game, not a flight simulator.\nPlot? As American pilot, alongside with russians you fight with some rebels. But it's predictable like kid with knife to us that russians will eventually turn against us. The plot twist? Not all of them. Yay.\nEnding with plot, ending with sarcasm, I promise. ACAH has some pretty nice mechanics. Most of the time player sees the world from planes' cockpit. Nice thing is, there are plenty of fighters (Not only american!) to choose, each comes with unique cockpit. At the beginning of the mission, player may also choose camo for his fighter. Looks nice when you dont like cockpit sight and preffer to play in Third person camera.  Last camera mode is placed on the fighters'  neb.\nMission objectives? Hm... essential part of every level are fighter fights. If you are playing as fighter, you can be sure that there will be air fight. Besides, pilot might have to perform air strike, protect transporters (by fighting planes) or shooting down a warhead.\nWhy if? Namco knew that featuring only fighters would be boring, so in certain missions you use different aircraft. So you provide air support as assault chopper pilot (somehow flying in theese make me feel as I were playing some console port - hitting anything without using lock on is really time-consuming), operate minigun in Black Hawk (as for me - best  part of the game), fly AC-130 (copied from CoD, but still awesome) or drop bombs from B-2 Spirit Tactical bomber. Plenty of attractions, aren't there?\nMake the metal bleed was the games' motto. I agree on that. Explosions, destroyed fighters and soo many more were awesome. Playing the game for graphics is totally worth it (okay, maybe ground structures could've been done better, but come on, you barely look at the ground!). And all that looked flawlessly on Nvidia GeForce GTS 250 and 4GB of RAM.\nTo sum up, ACAH was great game. If you like fighters, and modern air combat - don't hesitate.\nP.S: No word about multiplayer, because I havent even tried it","August 15, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As a hardcore fan of Ace Combat, i will be the first to admit that this game is very different from the past games in the series and it does take more of a mainstream approach like call of duty, however, the fact that this mainstream approach is being done on a game that is focused on combat flight simulator style of game is something worth seeing and playing. It's fun, distructive, and you still get those awesome vibes that i've felt throughout the whole ace combat series so far. If you are interested in the more traditional Ace Combat  games, there is Ace Combat 4, 5, and zero on PS2 and Ace Combat 6 (my personal favorite of the whole series) on Xbox 360.

Only if it's for less than 3USD or your local currency's equivalent.\n\nWhy? because of this[www.gamespot.com].\n\nOn my own words, this game went in the wrong direction. It tried to be something it isn't.\n\nThe game features several mechanisms (minigames) to make it easier or to try to change the formula. The dogfights are part of said minigames (if you don't use the dogfight mode, you're at a very HUGE disavantage), If you don't enter "ground attack mode"you can't use your A2G missiles. Horse crap.\n\nAnd the stupidity found in certain missions, but that contains spoilers:\n\nThere's a mission in whichyou have to defend an airfield of being overrrun by tanks and protect the incoming cargo planes of enemy aircraft. The most infuriating part is when you absolutely have to destroy the planes in dogfight-mode before engaging the tanks, or these won't let you do anything. Remember: you have to engage A2G mode to attack the tanks, there'sno way to defend against A2A while in that mode.\n\nAnd, on the final mission, you are supposed to have a 1vs1 fight with your ultra nemesis,however, that nemesis is so OP, he can travel from the "battlepoint" where you're supposed to fight him, to where the bombers are located waaaay back in less than a second, you can test that and see that in your minimap. I LOL'd hard when I saw that happening. And of course, you're supposed to take him down in dogfight mode before engaging the bomber that you also have to destroy in dogfight mode.\n\nThis is the first game that made me RAGEQUIT in single player mode.\n\nTL;DR: if you're looking for the classic Ace Combat experience, get it somewhere else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epavichthesavage/recommended/228400/","epavichthesavage","SavagePavich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epavichthesavage/","214 products in account","A rant from an old Ace Combat fanboy.\nSkip to the bottom to get a summary.\n\n\nI don't know what to say about Assault Horizon.\nI want to like it, but I just can't bring myself to. Being a Huge Ace Combat fan I was hoping to see past the flaws and enjoy the game for what it is. But god damn, is it awful. I thought Ace Combat 6 was the worst Ace game I've played. This takes the cake, bar none. I take it back, Fire of Liberation!\n\nFirst of all, DFM and Gameplay. I hate DFM. It literally ruins the game for me.\nSome targets are quite obviously unkillable UNTIL you engage the DFM. Why? You can tell. Any plane with TGT will pop flares endlessly and go from 0 to 60 in 1 second to avoid your conventional missles. This is obviously to get you to use DFM. To force your plane into an often very scripted chase scene. Sure, it looks fantastic. But after the eye-candy wears off it becomes an object of pure annoyance. It takes the feeling of being a Sky-badass away and makes it into a very boring rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you'll be asked to do quick-time events as well. Press W to see something happen! If you don't press that button..nothing happens 9 times outta 10.\nIt's completely pointless.\n\n-Second. The missions. Endless waves of very dumb Targets.\nNow I have no problem with scores of enemies. In fact I love it when AC does that. But when it involves mostly being forced into the "Bogey on Your Six" Mini-game (that's incredibly easy to boot) and DFM it really does become painful. There is little variation between the Red targets they throw at you. No enemy chatter, or at least none compelling enough to take note. The whole point of TGT was to make them special targets. Not things you hurtle at the player endlessly like the regular grunts.\nMissions are split between planes, helicopters and bombing missions now. I can appreciate the variation but the Bombers and Helo missions are terrible linear crap. Not to mention very boring. Blah. Toss those out.\n\n-Third. Story.\nStory isn't the worst thing to this game, even though I dislike the real world setting among other things. I will forgive the very typical Modern Warfare-ish plot as well. Don't expect the typical Ace Combat War drama here. It's nothing out of the ordinary.\nThe characters are likable, albeit forgettable. I didn't quite like having the protagonist blabbering on while I'm playing but that's more of a personal nuisance.\n\n-Fourth. Difficulty\nI can really, really tell they lowered the difficulty of this game. I know previous Ace Combats weren't all that hard to begin with (hence the mega-bosses and tunnel missions) but A.H. really drops the bar. Playing on "Elite" is no where nearly challenging. Again, this points back to the various mini-games and the DFM.\nIf you get the hang of the DFM (and you will within 10 minutes) you'll be shooting down the hardest Aces in mere minutes (so long as it's not a scripted event). You can take MULTIPLE missle hits on Elite, to which your plane will seemingly regenerate health. You have unlimited bullets (not like they do anything to begin with) and still have over ONE HUNDRED missiles on Elite.\nYou can almost Bounce off the ground on Elite, something only seen in previous games on the easiest difficulties.\n\n-Fifth. PC edition flaws and other crap\nThe controls are quite awful to get a handle on. You really must have a controller to "enjoy" this game because Mouse control won't help in the slightest and trying to fly with the bloody Arrow keys is near impossible. Of course, all to be expected from a Console series.\nThere's no real PC settings to get a hold of. Just resolution, AA and some other things. This was quite sad to see, since adding AA also adds significant lag for what looks to be little difference.\n\nNow the game itself looks good. Like DAMN good. They finally made the environments you play in interesting and vibrant. Not the flat Google-Earth imagery of old. The planes explode and tear apart magnificiently. Character models are well done. Overall, a good job. On the graphics.\n\nMultiplayer is mostly everything above only with REAL PEOPLE.\nI enjoyed it, even with DFM. Sadly, I don't buy ACE games for Multiplayer so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nAnother minor annoyance that came with the "Enhanced Edition" was the inclusion of those stupid, stupid IDOLMASTER skins that I hate oh so much from Ace 6. God damn, we don't need stupid pink anime skins in Ace Combat. Even if a small ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ portion of the fanbase asks for it. Just don't. Please. The Nagase fanservice was bad enough.\n\n\n-----TL;DR\n\nOverall I give this game a 5/10. It's just Average, bargin-bin videogamin'. Nothing wrong with getting it cheap but it's not worth anything above 14 dollars. New-comers will have fun, but older fans might feel a bit left behind. Multiplayer is a nice addition, sadly a little dead now though.\n\nI can play it, but it's still probably the worst Ace Combat yet and it has some serious, needless crap thrown on it.\nEven worse is how it failed to gain that "new audience" it was clearly going for, since Ace has now been reduced to a F2P game for the PS3. Shame.\n\n;_;7  Mobius One weeps for the future of A.C.","January 2, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Aproach this one with caution.\n\nwell,it feels like ace combat,plays for the most part like ace combat, but it has one mechanic that Kills it,DFM and ASM. those sections,when Scripted are Terrible,and makes the fights with aces,Especially the one with a certain shark nosed Plane Pilot, Unfufilling. At First,they are cool,but repeat them,over,and over,and over again,and you'll see what i mean. and this is agravated if you played other Ace Combat games on the consoles, that really demanded skills from you.\n\nso,it's a Hard game?! Far from it. Easy,even on the Ace Difficulty,but it has it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments.\nIs a Bad Ace combat game?! by my standards,Yes. Namco has done better with its franchises.\nBut it's a Bad game?! HELL NO.\n\nThe better pros i gotta say is: the cutscenes that are awesomely made, the Aircraft Collor editor that even to this date i revisit, and the Awesome models,beautifull with full interiors made by Project aces.\n\nBut the Unforgivable Cons i gotta repeat: The DFM and ASM are not good systems when done Scripted like 60% of the game. some sections are not,but they fell a bit cluncky to control,and i tend to lose control quickly. another Con is that the control on this game is very sensitive,even on the most Non-Sensitive setting,so it doesn't feel like Ace 5,6,or Cross Rumble,and you get to have tighter reflexes to adapt on how the Jets fly on this game. they feel different,but horrible?! no... just,worse. and those aspects i'm glad that namcobandai got right on the next games of the franchise,that can and MUST keep going in the direction it was since Ace Combat 3 (jp)... that by the way i still wait for a remake of that game... but let's not get out of the tangent.\n\nMy final Veredict: 7/10.  Is not a Bad game, i can recomend for you who want a Different Experience all togheter.\nBut if you are a Ace fan,as a said Aproach with caution or Don't go for it.(or at least,wait untill the price drop if you want to experiment with this beast).","August 31, 2014","true","61.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it doesn't near good enough as the Playstation 2 titles but still fun to play, the Dogfight Mode is kinda awesome although sometimes I hate it when some enemies are requiring DFM to be destroyed.

I knew I was in trouble when I was greeted with the "Please do not turn off the power..." splash right off the bat. Plenty of decent console ports, so NBD right?  "Please press SPACE", hmm, I guess Space is the new Enter. Wait, did I accidentally pull the mouse out of the USB port? No, one simply cannot manipulate the menu with it aside from mouse wheeling through selections. Press E to rebind? Really? R to reset to default? OK whatever, ♥♥♥♥ it they said I could use a mouse and keyboard with this game so let's see.. Aha mouse steering. There it is, good. Set to on, I'll fiddle with the rest later. Into the game I go. Twenty seconds later I'm back at the main menu. Mouse steering does absolutely nothing. At least in "plane mode" And maybe I'm just tired, but I SWEAR adjusting the "mouse sensitivity" option actually made turning with the with the arrow keys faster. Go figure. So fiddling with the rebind options I discover that you can rebind pitch and yaw to the mouse axis controls. OK, lets try that. I'll fiddle with the rest later. Two minutes later, I'm back at the main menu. I can turn left. I can turn right. Up and down? Nope. So apparently I'm going to need either A: a controller (which i refuse to use), or a flight stick (which I don't have) in order to get the most out of this. I was about to uninstall right there, but I took a breath. No, lets see if theres any entertainment value to be gleaned from this cluster ♥♥♥♥ at all. Back into the options menus. Well, lets see if we can make the game look any better. Graphics options are as bare bones as they can possilbly get away with. Worse then Borderlands 1.

Wait, didn't I already successfully rebind these mouse keys the first time I tried it? Now its not working? Wait, did clicking the currently still unbound right mouse button just escape out of the menu? WTF?! OK deep breath.

Mostly because this is not a game. It's a press-space-to-win Murica propaganda video.\n\nFirst, the storyline. Don't worry, there isn't one. You're firstly thrown into a dogfight with some invaders in SU27s - oh look, Default Enemy #1 - The Russians. Why are they invading? Why are they attacking Miami? Who knows. Second mission - oh look, you're in the desert. But no, this isn't Iraq (yet. I assume that comes later) and you're shooting 'rebels'. This is the point where it turned my stomach. No motivation, no cause, just some guys trying to run away and getting gunned down by the USMC.\n\nNo.\n\nAt this point the second HUGE problem of the game kicked in and I just couldn't play any more - motion sickness. Sometimes you have control, sometimes you don't. Dogfight mode puts everything RIGHT UP IN YOUR GRILL and you have to fight with the terrible control system to get a lock. It also seems to have some kind of selective auto-aim that throws the camera off as well - so you're basically spending half the time trying to chase an enemy and the other half fighting the camera.\n\nI felt so sick by the end of the second mission, I had to stop.\n\nWhilst I'm talking about the controls, Why can't I fly with the mouse? Why am I using the keyboard? The keyboard isn't a controller. I've never used WSAD as controls to look around.\n\nBasically, this game is garbage. Battlefield 4 has better aerial combat than this. Everything this game is meant to do, it does badly, and blasts its message of American superiority so hard it makes Call of Duty look like a balanced view of world politics. Spend your £2.49 on an American flag and go and stand in your local park yelling xenophobic comments at people instead.","July 27, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I remember the ace combat series being my favorite games back on console and i played it till there was nothing left to unlock, putting hundreds of hours on each game they had. I had hoped to have that happen here with the way the game looked but i can't say that i ever will. I can't blame them for trying new things, but this wasn't the way to do it. From barrel rolling helecopters that feel impossible to crash because you feel completely assisted on flights, to being in an auto lock dog fight where you're lead in combat to an area for a cinematic kill all the while you could have killed your target 15 times with the 30 missles you hit directly into him on the way to the "scene". Less the targets a regular green enemy youll just have to accept that you cant usually kill them until you reach that location, and if the autolock dogfight throws you directly into the ground... don't worry... it'll just bounce you off the ground like nothing happened.\n\nYou're also forced to follow how things happen to the T. You're flight skill means nothing since even if you could out fly the main characters protagonist you still cant technically shoot him down or hurt him since he is suppose to beat you in the fight anyways. Thats one example. Least in some of the other ace combat  games you could shoot some of the main story enemys down and get a different reaction out of them without it changing the game other than you feeling more like a badass.\n\nPeople new to the series may like the game because it looks great and it does have some pretty good action and a decent story, but again... returning players will just want to avoid it and continue playing 4,5 or zero.","April 6, 2014","false","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, because I enjoy the development team and flying games in general, I gave it a shot. Other than to satiate curiosity, I wish I hadn't given the game my time.\n\nWhile the flying itself is solid, the introduction of the dogfighting mode added cinematic flair, but also removed me from the action. Additionally, during some of the larger skirmishes, it seemed to open me up to more missile shots than I'd normally expect in an Ace Combat game (even on harder difficulties). The fighter gameplay is acceptable, though not on par with the other entries in the series, and unfortunately new flight additions to the game only detracted from the experience.\n\nThe helicopter controls didn't feel quite right, nor did the shooting while on board. I see what the devs were going for, but they didn't succeed in it. Likewise, the AC-130 experience was virtually ripped from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Certainly there's only so much one can do with an AC-130, but the experience felt put in to appeal to a broader audience, but at the cost of what Ace Combat has been about for almost 20 years.\n\nGraphically the game is solid, nice effects. The soundtrack was fairly forgettable, standard military game fair. The controls were solid (I used a wired 360 gamepad), so no big complaints there.\n\nFinally, the story wasn't the fantasy/reality blend of previous titles, but more standard military drama with obvious plot twists that one could see from 40,000 ft. As a fan I was not impressed, and frankly other games have told the same story in better ways.\n\nUltimately, I would not recommend purchasing Assault Horizon unless you need an arcade flying game fix. Previous Ace Combat games were better, there are a great deal of excellent flying games on the PC to play instead of this.","January 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Cool planes, crazy aerial boss battles, canyon/trench run challenges and conflicts in the fictional Ace Combat universe were hallmarks of the series. Unfortunately, Assault Horizon decided to completely throw out many of the core gameplay elements and themes that had made previous Ace Combat games so enjoyable, and decided to pursue a Call-of-Duty approach to gameplay and storyline.\n\nOne of the most egregious additions is the Dog-fighting mode, where with the press of 2 buttons, your plane magically maneuevers itself on the tail of the enemy and sticks there with minimal effort. Meant to highlight the "action" it just turns dogfighting into a glorified QTE.\n\nOne new direction that AC:AH took that had promise, but was poorly executed, was the expansion into other types of aircraft, including bombers and helicopters. Unfortunately, these levels seemed less about flying and more about aiming your recticle over targets on a screen (think AC-130). The end result was gimmicky execution of what could have been some very interesting and fun set pieces.\n\nOverall, AC:AH has been a disappoinment. It could not deliver the experience of previous installments and failed to win me over with its new mechanics.","April 5, 2014","false","8.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

DFM basically rails you onto a line and takes you through a QTE.\n\nThe storyline was average. I suppose I shouldn't have expected more. AC5 was corny as well but it was a better corny. ACAH was just convoluted. They dropped the alternate reality in favor of putting it in the real world and they got rid of all the sci-fi elements in favor of... giving the main character a premonition?\n\nAlso, by default you are in Casual flight mode, which I didn't realize meant that you couldn't preform rolls. Turn that off as fast as you can. It's just not right for it to even be on.","August 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ace Combat is not - and never has been - a flight sim. It's a long-running franchise hailing from Japan, eminently focused on high-speed arcade action. It has always had very, very little at all to do with reality, save the inclusion of detailed plane models based mostly on real-life military fighters and bombers.\n\nAs a flight-sim enthusiast, some would consider it a crime for me to admit that I really do enjoy arcade flight games. They're a great fallback for those times when you want to splash some bogies, but you don't have the time or the inclination to go full-real (or even semi-real, honestly).\n\nI've played Ace Combat games for years, since I was a kid, and it was probably Ace Combat among other games that helped foster my later interest in more authentic fare. I started with Ace Combat 2: Electrosphere on the original Playstation, and let me tell you: the title of that game says it all. Ace Combat has a track record of featuring crazy, wonky, way-out-there fantasy elements, up to and including the absurdly massive flying superweapons that are a genuine staple of the franchise.\n\nAce Combat was never about being serious. It was about flying around a surprisingly well-modeled, realistic-looking plane incongruously stuffed with 200-plus anti-everything missiles, and blowing things up with reckless abandon. This and Armored Core was where it was at back in the day, and it was a glorious time to grow up in.\n\nNow, AC4 tried to shake things up a bit by introducing a "relatable" "story" with "characters" and such. And it's fairly poor. Thankfully, it doesn't detract from gameplay too much, as the background chatter is easy to tune out, but if examined at length...oh boy. The writing was chunky and oftentimes silly, and the low-grade-anime-quality voice actors delivering the lines made for a very embarrassing experience.\n\n"Yeah, we won! Now let's sing our dramatically overwrought national anthem as the camera pans dramatically around our planes! YEAH!"\n\nBut AC5 didn't improve its horrible dialog and hand-wringingly bad voice acting. In fact, it made it *worse,* as "story" became an increasing focus. And then AC6? Oh my and dear me. Just go YouTube the intro, or look up "dance with the angels - " actually, no. Don't do that. You'll die of embarrassment. Actually, you should, because the sheer temple-drilling horribleness of that dialogue atrocity is actually important to this review.\n\nFor years, the core gameplay never really changed between sequels. It was all about going from one target to the next, getting a lock-on, and then double-tapping the missile button to launch precisely two missiles, and flying off to the next enemy. It's fun, for a while, but without any real evolution going on in the background, franchise fatigue was inevitable.\n\nSo what did they change? Is this game "Call of Duty with wings," as so many reviews claim? Ha, well, the answer is that they changed everything, while actually changing nothing. Let me explain in brief.\n\nThe "innovations" consist of one central new "feature:" Dog-Fight Mode. That's right. "Mode." As in, one of the core aspects of air combat is now a "mode." There's also a differently-named variant for ground attacks, but it's the exact same concept: press a combination of two buttons, and you lock into a more or less on-rails scripted sequence where you keep your target or targets centered while your missiles lock on.\n\nI don't even really mind the system in theory. Really, they HAD to do something to change things up, because even as a long-time AC fan, I was getting bored of the one-button double-tap missile fest the game had stubbornly been for years.  What they were trying to achieve with DFM was to add some depth to air battles, make them more dependent on timing and reading movements. It actually plays much better in practice than it sounds going by my description of it. But here's the problem: occasionally, the game uses DFM as an excuse to pretty much put you through an on-rails theme-park ride that's scripted to the end. Don't balk too much - after all, Grand Theft Auto has been doing the exact same thing for years with every single one of its "dramatic car chases," and it's a million seller. But let's be honest - it still sucks.\n\nDFM is actually okay on its own. It's got flaws, but the core idea is sound. It takes all the concepts of energy and g-forces and simplifies the crap out of them so as not to burden the core arcade experience with excessive realism, giving the occasional dog-fight a fraction of the intensity and strategy of the real thing. The enemy suddenly peels left, so you have to slow and follow to keep from losing him. He dives and burns, so you have to throttle up to keep pace. A lot of scripting is required, sure, and all of these maneuvers do constitute a sort of timing mini-game in all honesty, but still, the nature of the game's AI would ordinarily prevent exciting dog-fights from actually taking place to begin with. So in that regard, it's nice to have a sort-of-dog-fight experience every once in a while.\n\nThe problem is when DFM triggers a heavily-scripted setpiece, as mentioned above. It tends to happen at least twice per mission, and you have little to no actual control over the events. Your subject plane becomes temporarily immune to all damage until a sufficiently exciting number of explosions occur within your relative field of view, and the setpiece is over.\n\nIt's fun the first time, sure, but if you eat a missile (or two, or three) and die, and one of those setpieces occurs after your last checkpoint, be prepared for your next DFM attempt to trigger the exact same pseudo-cutscene again. It will do so the next time you die, too. And the next time.\n\nThankfully, most enemies can be defeated the old-school double-tap way, but you're still avoiding an entire facet of the gameplay. It sucks because these scripted moments, when they do occur, detract from the good the devs achieved, and all but ruin the feature completely. Regular DFM battles are just fine.\n\nThe ground attacks, though, are boiled crap. They force you on a linear path, often against ALL COMMON SENSE, and it becomes a game of struggling with the lock toggle to send your missiles to the right target. It's just plain horrible, and unlike DFM, it's straight-up forced on you. Do it, or mail your fission, 'cause it's game over.\n\nThe devs know all about the importance of cushioning a bad landing. In case their grand gameplay experiment failed, they needed a scapegoat to blame for the negative reviews. And so: thematic shift! They hired a half-decent American writer to pen an actually coherent script, applied some color-grading to the post, and for the first time placed the game's events in the real world. So of course the new "direction of the plot" was the game's real failing. Oh, yeah, definitely. Don't worry, fans. We'll never do that again, we promise.\n\nSadly, this nonsense seemed to have worked. Most people hate the game because it's "too American," while claiming that the prior games' plots were so good, that they moved them to tears. "Dance with the angels." Search it. I'll save space in the review. Anyway, it's not the fault of the ill thought-out gameplay mechanics - it's because they Americanized it. Yeah, that's it. Certainly it, no question.\n\nAnyway, in summary - I just can't recommend it. It's broken, it's frustrating. At one point, a dozen planes spawn right behind you when the game expects you take out a boatload of ground targets in less than two minutes. Another has you struggling to shoot down an ICBM whose exhaust causes unavoidable damage. Sucks if you get THAT checkpoint while already critically damaged...like *I* did. Time to restart a 30 minute mission!\n\n...or not. Save yourself the trouble, and save yourself the scratch. This game needs to go dance with the angels.","May 21, 2015","false","13.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Your subject plane becomes temporarily immune to all damage until a sufficiently exciting number of explosions occur within your relative field of view, and the setpiece is over.\n\nIt's fun the first time, sure, but if you eat a missile (or two, or three) and die, and one of those setpieces occurs after your last checkpoint, be prepared for your next DFM attempt to trigger the exact same pseudo-cutscene again. It will do so the next time you die, too. And the next time.\n\nThankfully, most enemies can be defeated the old-school double-tap way, but you're still avoiding an entire facet of the gameplay. It sucks because these scripted moments, when they do occur, detract from the good the devs achieved, and all but ruin the feature completely. Regular DFM battles are just fine.\n\nThe ground attacks, though, are boiled crap. They force you on a linear path, often against ALL COMMON SENSE, and it becomes a game of struggling with the lock toggle to send your missiles to the right target. It's just plain horrible, and unlike DFM, it's straight-up forced on you. Do it, or mail your fission, 'cause it's game over.\n\nThe devs know all about the importance of cushioning a bad landing. In case their grand gameplay experiment failed, they needed a scapegoat to blame for the negative reviews. And so: thematic shift! They hired a half-decent American writer to pen an actually coherent script, applied some color-grading to the post, and for the first time placed the game's events in the real world. So of course the new "direction of the plot" was the game's real failing. Oh, yeah, definitely. Don't worry, fans. We'll never do that again, we promise.\n\nSadly, this nonsense seemed to have worked. Most people hate the game because it's "too American," while claiming that the prior games' plots were so good, that they moved them to tears. "Dance with the angels." Search it. I'll save space in the review. Anyway, it's not the fault of the ill thought-out gameplay mechanics - it's because they Americanized it. Yeah, that's it. Certainly it, no question.\n\nAnyway, in summary - I just can't recommend it. It's broken, it's frustrating. At one point, a dozen planes spawn right behind you when the game expects you take out a boatload of ground targets in less than two minutes. Another has you struggling to shoot down an ICBM whose exhaust causes unavoidable damage. Sucks if you get THAT checkpoint while already critically damaged...like *I* did. Time to restart a 30 minute mission!\n\n...or not. Save yourself the trouble, and save yourself the scratch. This game needs to go dance with the angels.","May 21, 2015","false","13.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

Storyline is nothing special, it's very cliché en predictable but it's ok. Note: I haven't played the Ace Combat series before and I was looking for a combat flight simulation game.\n\nWithin minutes you are able to handle te plane like a pro. Hower if you play with a gamepad you need to change the control to "Original" instead of "Optimum", otherwise you won't get the total freedom of steering etc. I have played this game with a Logitech gamepad and also a joystick which both works perfectly. If you have a joystick I recommend to use it, because it gives this game a little bit more like a simulation feel.\n\nPositive:\n+ During the storyline you'll get the chance to control different kind of planes, helicopter and control even as a gunman or bomber (precision bombing).\n+ Gamepad and joystick compatibility.\n+ Lot's of actions.\n+ Customization in colors of your plane.\n+ Different choices of airplanes.\n+ Graphics (in game) and sounds are fine.\n+ It is an entertaining game and I have enjoy it.\n\nNegative:\n- Lack of more simulation and realistic feel and depth to this game. It's very arcade!\n- Most of the time the actions come's way to quickly after eachother which you'll get tired of it and wondering when the end will comes.\n- Dogfightmodus which you can trigger if you are close enough to an enemy is way to arcade and unrealistic. Ok somtimes it's spectacular because it triggers other animations and events, and most of the time it is also easier to shot the enemy down but this doesn't feel and look right.\n- No fly-by or rocket cam.\n- No free flight modus.\n- Bought this game last week and finished it already within 3 days.\n\nNote:\nIf you are looking for a realistic simulation game like I was, then this isn't the game you want.\nHowever I do have enjoyed playing this game and finish all the different kind of missions with satisfaction..\nIf you are looking for an arcade combat flightsimulator with lot's of actions, then this game will do the trick.\nBut frankly, the game is not worth the money (yet). I bought this game for 20,- Euros, wait till it's 10,- Euros is my advise.\n\nDespite all this I will recommend this game in this genre. This game do meets all the facets of an arcade player, it is an enjoyable action game and controls are great with full gamepad and joystick compatibility.","October 12, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Those missions are just full of stupidity. Its a bad influence from CoD.\n- So much unnecessary explosions that Michael Bay would totally fap to this crap.\n- Stupid in-game cut scenes that decreases your IQ.\n\nConclusion\n- Yet I still recommend this game.

I play inverted like how a real air plane is, and when it forces you into gun mode/dog fighting mode, its NOT interverted and its so fast that your not really supposed to fly either, your supposed to just chase them down using the basic starfox controller which DOES NOT allow you to do a classic barrel roll when in dog fighting mode.. and whats even dumber is that when your out of dog fighting mode; you go back to the hardcore/classic controls which allows you to roll the plane whenever you want... its so akward and hard to play because you can't get a good feel of the plane each time it engages like that.. and sadly.... MOST of your engagements will do that.  NOW if you played in the basic starfox type controls then I guess you are alright.... BUT you run into the problem with dog fighting.. because in a real chase I want to have that feeling like I can go upside down and go side ways and really move the plane how I want too... which is impossible without the plane having the ability to roll.\n\nI have tried again and again and I would really like to LIKE this title, but this maybe the very first ace combat that I have truely disliked and it might be the last of the Ace Combats I will purchase as well...

I hadn't seen a new Ace Wombat game in years, and never dreamed that my childhood favourite would ever hit the PC. Back in the early 90s,  gaming was all about the three big console mascots: Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and the unforgettable Ace Wombat. While Ace never quite had the broad mainstream appeal of Nintendo and Sega's icons, the adventures of the cheeky, baseball-cap wearing marsupial filled my childhood with near-limitless joy.\n\n1993's original The Adventures of Ace Wombat redefined 16-bit platforming with its streetwise style, punishing bosses and catchy gangsta rap soundtrack. The 1995 sequel, Ace Wombat 2: Marsupial Madness, was much of the same, ableit with a superior level of polish and new multiplayer modes featuring Danny the Disco Dingo (I'm sure we all remember his awesome catchphrase: "Can you dig it?"). 1997 brought the first shaky 3D effort: Ace Wombat vs. the Lizard of Oz. Unfairly maligned at the time for its awkward camera controls and risque tone, Ace 3D pioneered gameplay and storytelling techniques that wouldn't be adopted by the mainstream until the PS2 era.\n\nSadly, following the lackluster commercial performance of Ace 3D, the franchise was put on hiatus for almost a decade, and only the most ardent fans held out hope for a return. However, in 2006 our prayers were finally answered with the phenomenal 4Ce Womb4t: The 4th Wall. Informed by lead designer Trip Hazard's battles with substance abuse in those dark days, The 4th Wall was a  surreal, dreamlike trip into the psyche of one of gaming's iconic figures. Blending the game space with reality and destroying the lines between player and avatar, it takes inspiration from sources as diverse as the games of Hideo Kojima, the artwork of MC Escher and the literature of Jorge Luis Borges. Unfortunately, the experimental nature of the game didn't translate into solid sales, and the studio was shuttered soon after. We all thought the story would end there.\n\nNow, imagine my astonishment when I see Ace Wombat: Assault Horizon pop up on Steam. I furiously charged through the payment and download screens, palms sweating with anticipation. As the download ebbed and flowed I found my heart beginning to race. Finally - a new Ace Wombat game, out of the blue after so many years of silence.\n\nSadly, it wasn't to be. They had lied. Exploiting my cherished memories of youth, they'd cruelly duped me into buying yet another cookie-cutter military shooter, albeit with the standard ground combat supplanted by aircraft. Where was my beloved Ace Wombat, whizzing across the screen on his rollerblades? Where was the Acemobile? Where the hell was Danny the Disco Dingo???\n\nNamco. Bandai.

The article I read prior to playing the game comparing it to a certain hyper-popular first-person shooter cemented my opinion in stone already. One part of me wants to like this game, but the other part screams at it in disgust.\n\nAce Combat Assault horizon is a frank departure from the series established bizzaro earth in which it takes place in the more familiar setting of our world. It seeks to establish a cast of loveable characters from the outset with plenty of dialogue inbetween missions.\nWhile the game certainly stands on its own as a certifyable Ace combat game, it definitely has the feel most fans of the series have come to expect, but has a flawed core that sours the experience.\n\nFrom the core, it tends to lean to hard on its own gimmicks to draw in new players, and it shows in the gameplay, the addition of Dog-fight Mode is a sort of,"On Rails" mode to help new players take on enemies.\n\nits an easier to control help-to-kill method, and concurrently show off the much touted,"Aircraft Gore" as defeated planes spiral and tumble helplessly with much unnecessary amounts of oil, flames, and debris splattering on the screen, and an unskippable dramatic camera to show you your kill in gruesome detail as it suspends you from play. Counter DFM, is a feature called,"ASM" which is initiated in the same way as DFM is. ASM allows you to turn on your persuer and take THEM in DFM.\n\nAs a whole, the usual Ace combat control scheme is bogged down by this new control addition and a step back from the tight controls many have come to expect from the series. the timing required to pull off the ASM is far more strict and leaves  you more vulnerable than outmanuvering your opponent and mashes itself in your way, and many of the mission components require you to use this DFM to complete some objectives properly.\n\nMany of the games enemies seem to have been made with this mode in mind as they all zoom and boost impossibly out of your reach if you decide to engage them in any other form of combat other than DFM, I saw this mostly on the "required" targets and seemed to me as a way to railroad the player into using it at expense of artificially lengthening the game time.\nMoving on.\n\nFrom its mission structure to its characters, it tries real hard to make Ace combat fit within the confines of the modern game while still leaving a bit of salt from the previous games to flavor it.\nIn the end, AC:AH Feels short, shallow, and unmemorable, nevermind the technical issues that mar it.\n\nthe choice to cast the title in the current modern world left the game with a bland pastel of identity to draw upon let alone the suspension of disbelief to hold, the characters have no origin, we know nothing of why the characters have the motivations they do, they cast off the primary reason for conflict and instead leave a revenge plot with no plausability for its existence.\n\nThe story for me wrapped up in 8 hours, accounting for deaths and failures due to awkward DFM controls along the way.\n\nTo draw some comparisons between this and one of the previous titles, some of the titles had branching mission structures, and depending on how you play, or what you do, the story unfolds in a different way, giving some area of control and feeling of detail.\nThe mission structure of AC:AH is linear, the missions are short and there isn't any replayability in them as most missions are roughly 5 or so minutes long.(they can drag on because the game wants you to rely on DFM) The details of each mission are traditional for the Ace Combat library, in fact, as far as to say, they don't use any of the more interesting mission structures that the previous titles have. It goes to highlight the limited scope the modern world presents from a reality standpoint.\n\nFrom what I gather from this game, it was made with multiplayer in mind, (Singleplayer is just one long tutorial) and I'm sure it does it acceptably, but doesn't warrant me trying as coming away from the singleplayer, left me a lot more sour than sweet.\nAs a fan of the series, I'm dissapointed that Project Aces had to push out a title that was more than likely a cash grab to monopolize on the current trend of modern military shooters, not of their own volition, but by their parent company.\n\nThe good I gather from the game is, that I hope any form of success has made Bandai-Namco think strongly about porting previous Ace combat titles, and developing future numbered games to the PC as a viable platform.\n\nThis review isn't supposed to be to complex or properly formatted or well worded. but it does get across a number of gripes I have with the game, and goes to highlight what happens when game companies try to,"Follow the leader" instead of doing their own thing or doing something new.\n\nTL;DR: As a fan of the series, steer clear (but I'm sure I don't need to tell you that), but if you're someone who wants an arcade-y flight game to kill some time online. look no further.","May 26, 2014","false","9.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","2"

An Ace Combat game that's completely on the rails. The only effective way to shoot down aircraft is through a dogfight mode which flies the aircraft for you, the movement is so erratic in this mode that it just gets annoying over time to try and focus the cursor over the enemy jet while it's doing 10g moves. Most of these dogfight sequences are heavily scripted with the enemy jet not blowing up until you pass through scenic explosions and carnage that wouldn't have happened otherwise and that's what bugs me the most. Sometimes planes can take 2 missiles and explode which is usually the fastest some standard jet planes can go down, but sometimes planes can also take up to 4-6 missile hits and a barrage of guns only to explode after we see some stylized collateral damage.\n\nThe story is also uninspiring when compared to past Ace Combat games. Anything interesting in the plot could've been seen a mile away with as the game tries to hold your hand through its already weak plot.\n\nThe game tries to make up for its lackluster gameplay by expanding on what you can do in the game: bombing and helicopter assaults. Helicopter missions are a bit weak while the bombing ones are actually interesting althought there is only a total of 1 bombing mission in the game.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're a fan of the series or want to avoid an on the rails game.","May 31, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Storyline is nothing special, it's very cliché en predictable but it's ok. Note: I haven't played the Ace Combat series before and I was looking for a combat flight simulation game.\n\nWithin minutes you are able to handle te plane like a pro. Hower if you play with a gamepad you need to change the control to "Original" instead of "Optimum", otherwise you won't get the total freedom of steering etc. I have played this game with a Logitech gamepad and also a joystick which both works perfectly. If you have a joystick I recommend to use it, because it gives this game a little bit more like a simulation feel.\n\nPositive:\n+ During the storyline you'll get the chance to control different kind of planes, helicopter and control even as a gunman or bomber (precision bombing).\n+ Gamepad and joystick compatibility.\n+ Lot's of actions.\n+ Customization in colors of your plane.\n+ Different choices of airplanes.\n+ Graphics (in game) and sounds are fine.\n+ It is an entertaining game and I have enjoy it.\n\nNegative:\n- Lack of more simulation and realistic feel and depth to this game. It's very arcade!\n- Most of the time the actions come's way to quickly after eachother which you'll get tired of it and wondering when the end will comes.\n- Dogfightmodus which you can trigger if you are close enough to an enemy is way to arcade and unrealistic. Ok somtimes it's spectacular because it triggers other animations and events, and most of the time it is also easier to shot the enemy down but this doesn't feel and look right.\n- No fly-by or rocket cam.\n- No free flight modus.\n- Bought this game last week and finished it already within 3 days.\n\nNote:\nIf you are looking for a realistic simulation game like I was, then this isn't the game you want.\nHowever I do have enjoyed playing this game and finish all the different kind of missions with satisfaction..\nIf you are looking for an arcade combat flightsimulator with lot's of actions, then this game will do the trick.\nBut frankly, the game is not worth the money (yet). I bought this game for 20,- Euros, wait till it's 10,- Euros is my advise.\n\nDespite all this I will recommend this game in this genre. This game do meets all the facets of an arcade player, it is an enjoyable action game and controls are great with full gamepad and joystick compatibility.","October 12, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Pretty much everything about is an absolute cluster♥♥♥♥. The 'innovative' gameplay features seem like they were specifically designed to disempower the player; you'll be groaning every time an enemy flight lead shows up because you'll know you have to engage in the godawful dogfight mode, flying around in a nauseating chase sequence while your target implausibly and frustratingly soaks up missile after missile. And that's far from the only problem with the game. Especially horrible is the way the game frequently decides to ♥♥♥♥ with you by messing with the camera.\n\nOddly the tacked on Call of Duty-ish elements, namely the helicopter doorgunner and AC-130 fire support missions were the most fun I got out of the game (the attack helicopter ones however are pretty awful). Although I have to say the doorgunner mission at the start of the game is extremely disturbing; it's essentially a war crimes simulation. No, the throwaway line about it being a UN santioned operation and the area being a 'free-fire zone' doesn't excuse it. Anyone who has ever read in-depth about about the Vietnam War knows what utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t a free-fire designation is.\n\nOn the plus side there's some very nice music (a franchise staple) and the graphics engine is genuinely impressive and versatile, delivering good up-close visuals of humans and other on-the-ground elements in addition to the usual aircraft fare. Which only makes it more of a shame that they decided to waste the effort and budget on this crappy real world Tom Clancy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t narrative, instead of giving us what everyone actually wants, which is a true Strangereal Ace Combat 7.\n\nThe narrative deserves special attention because of how downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Russophobic it is. I understand why Russia keeps showing up over and over again as villains in these types of stories; it's the only vaguely credible threat to the American Empire left on the planet, aside from China which is too important a trade partner to risk villifying. But generally there's at least an attempt at nuance. Here's the entire message of Assault Horizon: Russians are backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, all of them. Except the token 'good' Russian, who is a nice subservient pet to our glorious American protaganists. No, just kidding, he's also a backstabbing traitorous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he was only pretending to be good. That's literally it. The villains entire motivation is that American bombing accidentally killed his waifu in Bosnia. I'm not even kidding or oversimplifying, that is literally it.\n\nCompare this to something like Call of Duty 4 (let's try and forget the sequels...) which still had shades of Russophobia but at least bothered to divide them into 'good' and 'bad' Russians via a civil war plotline. In that game the chief antagonist Imran Zakhaev actually had a fairly credible motivation, though it wasn't given much attention. The line he gives in the games intro about Russian leaders prostituting their populations to the West and destroying their cultures and economies is 100% factual. The historical reality is that in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union Russia was set to make the transition to a Scandanavian-style Social Democracy, because, whatever Americans may think, most Russians genuinely liked many aspects of the USSR, like socialized medicine and education. At which point the West, spearheaded by financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, stepped in and said 'no, what you really want is rampant privitization'. Yeltsin said 'okay', and the country was utterly exploited. A new aristrocracy of oligarchs rose to power, controlling most of the wealth and resources, and around 10 million people prematurely died, many simply drinking themselves to death in despair. Given that reality, the idea of a guy wanting to nuke the ♥♥♥♥ out of America isn't hard to believe.\n\nSimilarly Khaled Al-Asad and his generic Middle-Eastern 'separatists' have genuine grievences, though they're inevitably portrayed as genocidal monsters. Especially in light of the real-world Arab Spring where it became painfully obvious just how despised by their populations the US-backed dictatorships of the region were. Oh but don't worry, that annoying 'democracy' thing didn't last long in Egypt at any rate, and the US is backing a new military dictatorship.\n\nCompare both those motivations to 'bombs killed my girlfriend'. Yeah...\n\ntl;dr go play Vector Thrust, and/or resume grinding through sorties in Ace Combat Infinity.

However the game is still contains gamebreaking bugs.  At first when I got this I couldnt even start the game using a controller the menu would just infinitely scroll.  While I may expect that using a third party controller this is a standard everyday no frills wireless 360 controller.  Before the patch I couldnt start the game.  With the patch I can start the game and the jet parts with fights work well.  Anything with a helicopter it seems are broken and the triggers dont work for some reason.  I dont know if it will be patched now its been years for them to make the menu work so I could launch the game and maybe in a few years the helicopter part will work, who knows.\n\nThe jet flying for aerial combat is pretty strange, enemy planes tend to fly in circles right around you or right behind you for some reason.  There is an odd mechanic where if a plane is behind you, you can QTE by pressing LB + RB and you flip behind the plane somehow and you blow them up.  This is odd because in the game this maneuver cant be performed as in you cant do a flip in your plane.  So yea its real basic and I guess half the game works if its split between jet fights and helicopter fights since the helicopter fights dont work with a controller.  There is also no horizon control meaning if you turn right you turn right, and there is no way to keep the plane level or adjust this making this just a terrible flying game in general since even the basic ability of being able to play is it messed up so badly.\n\nThe game uses a VATS shooting thing like from fallout but in this game its called DFM for DogFight Mode.  Its a zoomed in battle making it like an FPS in the air.  A strange choice for an aerial combat game and doesnt really feel like it belongs and isnt very fun.  The concept should be fly a plane and blow up stuff, not change to FPS mode to do it, it just doesnt make any sense.\n\nStill broken, but the jets controls work now, so its half a game.\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","February 24, 2014","false","10.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","7"

This was my first foray into playing the Ace Combat games on the PC, so I was surprised by the keyboard controls without the need for the mouse. This Ace Combat features CRA, Close-Range Assault, in-game known as Dogfighting Mode. This is different, as once it is engaged you are zoned in on a target and must navigate in tandum with the enemy pilot to lock missles, or just blast it with guns. Visually, I like the way Ace Combat Assault Horizon looks, especially in Dogfighting mode. This game would definitely be next-level with a flight stick and controls, as opposed to a keyboard, but is still fun. I recommend playing on harder settings as the easier settings do not present much of a challenge.\n\nThe game allows you to control a stealth bomber, AC-130, fighter jet and a helicopter throughout campaign play. You can also play in Multiplayer mode, either through coop missions or in a free for all deathmatch. In all it was a fun game to play, as well as exciting. I think if you like games where you have to pilot aircraft and enjoy a fast-paced gameplay, this is going to be up your alley.\n","September 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

I love the Ace Combat series.  So much that I have some sort of stockholm syndrome and ignore the normal cheesy 'writers do no research on war' storylines.\nFirst, unless this game is ~$5, DO NOT BUY IT. Period.  Your steam code will not activate GFWL.  That means no multiplayer.   Half the game gone like that.  There is no solution.  Steam will direct you to GFWL and GFWL will direct you to Steam, any further comments will be auto-ignored. Seriously, read the discussion boards.\nThe highlight of this game was "Written by americans who professionally write tom clancy style novels".  Not only does this not fix the writing problem previously stated, but it's more painful because its set in the real world.  The writers obviously did not google "NATO relations with Russia".  Real world makes it worse if you know anything about history.  Let's move on to the game.  Plenty to talk about DogFightMode.  You can see the good idea behind it, except that it forces you to use it.  It forces you because half the enemies are immune to damage unless you DFM them.   Camera angles are jacked up.  The camera does not stick behind you like all 7 previous games and when doing maneuvers will face the ground making sure you have no idea where you are guiding yourself exactly.\nSpeaking of controls, they put a flight game on the PC and gave it no flightstick support.  The xbox AC games have support....and a special flightstick made for it.  WTF.  BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME : PACING.  Cutscenes are fine and help develop stories, but do I need to be forced to walk through hallways in buildings for 5 minutes only allowed to turn my head and looks a people with no interaction?  It does not help except to give me time to get a beer from the fridge.  In game too, many missions including the helo/gunner missions just drag on...sometimes for 40 minutes.  There is no skill in these modes, but it just wont stop.  I want to pass it to get to the next jetfighter mission, so I just rubber band the trigger (hint: you cant die and you have infinite ammo).  The helo mission don't even fit into the story flow and little reason is given.  It is direct jealousy of the Call Of Battlefield franchises. Just like how the R6 games failed starting with R6V2.  The last part I will comment about is the skill.  There is no thrill anymore because missiles are near infinite, life of you and the enemies regenerate fairly quickly, and you can survive from hitting the ground and other fixed objects.\n\nFinal thoughts:  TORTURE.  You can clearly see the AC game and fun you could be having with this, but everything seems to be set up to make it as annoying as possbile all while demeaning you.  Especially with achievements.  "You passed the tutorial" "you pressed 'Y' when we told you"  "You watched a cutscene" "You hit objects with an infinite chaingun".  Good for you.","December 6, 2013","false","9.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Many reviewers here who are fans of the series often argue that the changes made to the gameplay have deprived the game of any sense of challenge and thus made the experience extremely boring.  I'm inclined to agree with that statement.  The real perpetrator in regard to dumbing down the gameplay is the new "Dogfight mode."  Whenever you get close enough to an enemy fighter, you can trigger a mode where the camera zooms in on your opponent and the game glues your jet to his rear.  At this point, the game practically plays itself for you.  In Dogfight mode, staying behind your opponent requires pretty much no skill at all.  Your fighter is basically placed on a set of rails in DF mode, and there's really no sense of accomplishment when you do take down your foe, because, as said before, there's practically no skill involved.   This might not be so bad, if the campaign did not force you to make use of this mode at certain points.\n\nOn that subject, the campaign itself is equally bland.  Most of the time you will be  in your fighter engaging in the rather dull air-to-air combat, broken periodically by the chance to fly an attack helicopter or control the targeting computer of an AC gunship or some other gimic.  To the game's credit, I enjoyed some of these set pieces.  Manning the door gun of a helicopter was good fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed the AC gunship section of the game.  Basically, any part of the game that wasn't marred by the flawed movement and dogfighting was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, air-to-air dogfighting comprises the vast majority of the game.  Periodically, you will be required to line up your aircraft to do strafing runs against ground targets, but the joy that could have been had with that is also ruined due to the mandatory use of a "ground attack mode" that places your jet on a set of rails, again depriving every last iota of challenge or fun.  The one enjoyable aspect that applies to all parts of the campaign is that periodically when you destroy an enemy, the camera will zoom in on your kill, showing off the ensuing fire, explosions and wreckage in all its destructive glory.  These bits were always pretty impressive to watch.  The story is pretty uninspired; something to do with a civil war in Russia and some ultranationalist group.  It's completely forgetable.\n\nOn a final note, if you are interested in giving this game a shot, I strongly recommend that you use a controller, as this game does not suit itself well to a mouse.  While AC: AH offers some terrific visuals, the game is held back by some terrible gameplay mechanics, and at the end of the day, a polished turd is still just a turd.","November 14, 2014","false","28.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I don't even know where to start.\nThe gameplay is horrible. You basically have 3 ways of destroying the opponent and none of them is fulfilling in the long run. You either press B (on an XBOX controller) to shoot a rocket when the square mark on your opponent turns red and hope it hits. It usually doesn't so then you enter the dogfight mode. This means pressing RB+LB which puts you just right behind your opponent and then you again have to wait for a circle mark to become red and press B to fire missiles. Sometimes when you're in the dogfight mode a script activates and you can see a cam shot of your opponent exploding, which gets boring really fast. The last way to kill an opponent is to do a turn around on him when he tries to rocket you from behind. In that instance you wait for two arrows to cover each other and- guess what- press RB+LB to appear behind the enemy in the dogfight mode again. The whole game is basically a big, repetetive, boring QTE event.\nFlying itself is really disappointing. It feels nothing like a plane and every plane model flies exactly the same, despite different stats. The controls are unprecise. Also, I have to mention the camera work- it's just atrocious. The FOV is way too low which makes you see nothing apart from your own machine and after some time spent in the dogfight mode I started feeling dizzy.\nYou can also fly helicopters- don't get too pumped, though. It comes down to pressing LT when your crosshair is set on a land target and then pressing RT to shoot it- the end. It also induces the most camera problems- cockpit view is the only way to play (it's an opposite story with planes- the cockpit view is utterly useless).\nThe story is forgettable (blah blah Russians blah blah betrayal blah blah Murica).\nInitially I wanted to praise the soundtrack but it becomes repetetive fairly quickly, especially that it plays one chosen track during each mission and hearing it over and over again during missions that can last over 30 minutes makes you sick pretty fast. I'd also like to mention this game features the worst French accent in the history of gaming but it's not a big deal- the voice acting is decent overall.\nI'm also under impression that the game tries to artificially prolong your gametime, usually by excessive time pressure, at least in higher levels of difficulty.\nUnfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this game for more than initial 30 minutes- and I've raged through my playtime all the way. It's cheap but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Heck, I wouldn't even recommend playing it for free.\nIf you're looking for a pleasant, semi-challenging game featuring planes (including jets) try War Thunder. It's free and it doesn't try to be something it shouldn't be.","September 26, 2014","false","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It takes away the skill previously required from the Ace Combat series and in addition to that, it gets boring really quickly. Due to its ease and quickness for taking down enemies, most past players of the franchise may find themselves unwillingly using it to quickly make work of the more than necessary enemies thrown at you. I really dislike the alternate helicopter and gunner missions which take away from the jet fighting albeit the bomber missions are refreshing.\n\nLastly, I'm really dissapointed with the storyline. It does not make you feel like that Ace from the Gryphon Squadron like the other titles did and it does not live upto, atleast what I believe a true Ace Combat story line. No giant ships, no ridiculos missions, in trying to make it real with real life environments and maps, they took away the awesomeness of being able to take down flying fortresses which was jaw droppingly thrilling.\n\nI understand that this was an experiment, hence did not have a number associated for it, but for a first release, I wish they did not experiment with us. I really do hope they make one with the chemistry the Ace Combat series is known for for the next release :)","January 14, 2014","false","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The series has always had some of the best soundtracks around and Assault horizon delivers again. The graphics are a step ahead of any previous entry into the series, everything is nice to look at esspecialy the jets, there is an ingame viewer just for looking at jets which is great. The story is okay but nothing particularily memorable, same with the characters but the missions are extremely fun to play (multiple times). Now on to the gameplay which has always been great but there a few features added to Assault Horizon, one being DFM which is Dog Fight Mode which basically allowd you to engage your enemy in a closer proximity and puts you right in the action and allows you to pull off some pretty awesome maneuvers BUT these maneuvers are very dumbed down from previous games (before you would have to learn and execute these maneuvers on your own) now you press a couple buttons and its done for you so alot less skill is involved which is a letdown to me. Now this is a port from the console verions of the game and its pretty much a barebones port no extra graphical features just resolution, vsync and AA options which is a big minus to me, but it also includes all the DLC from the console verions which is a plus. All and all though Ace Combat Assault Horizon is a very fun game to play with a few minor flaws in the gameplay which are my own personal taste I'd have to give this a 7.8/10. If you like this game I would recommend picking up a PS2 and playing Ace Combat 4 or 5 which are probaly the best in the series.","November 25, 2013","true","24.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unit076/recommended/228400/","Unit076","Unit076","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unit076/","135 products in account","I have to say this is one weird game. Keep in mind this opinion comes from a total noob in regards to flight simulator genre, Ace Combat, and any games with planes in it. The first time I "seriously" play a flight game was H.A.W.X. on Xbox 360, and I ended up cockpit first into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ground texture. So yeah, I suck at this kind of games.\n\nThings that kind of stick out to me is how the game having "look over there!"-cutscenes. I don't know about the other Ace Combats, but having told what to do/see via a cutscene always annoys me. You have UI, target designators, stay with it! There are also non-mandatory ones, triggered by a button press when it comes on screen, which I guess you could ignore but I always pressed it anyway.\nAnd you also get treated with ocassional slow motion scenes when you destroy a target. I honestly doesn't find it to be a bad thing (and make for a nice footage, if you're into video editing) but it does break the flow of the combat, somewhat.\n\nBut the mechanics that actually feels like, "they're kinda watering down the genre, aren't they" is the DFM, or Dogfight Mode, system. Basically when you are locked on on an enemy, you can activate some sort of an "automatic enemy chasing" mode. All you have to worry about is maintaning speed so your enemy doesn't get out of range or being to close to them and being countered by their own DFM (which obviously make that enemy auto-chase your plane.)\nAlthough relying too much on DFM could be fatal since limited maneuver means you can't dodge incoming misilles, as the loading screen usually tell you.\n\nIt's not exactly a bad system, but it does make the flight techniques less... elaborate, for a lack of a better word, especially since the game itself made the use of the system to be mandatory at times. At one point, I even had to restart a very short segment of the game for at least five times because I was out of the DFM too soon and getting a Mission Failed screen, even if the target is already destroyed. You could also argue that the helicopter missions also break the game, but I found it to be an alright distraction from all the plane crashes.\n\nAll in all, I don't really recommend this game for big fans of flight genres. It feels too "arcade-y" and the gimmick system could prove to be an annoyance at times. Unless you don't care about any of that and just want to do some dogfights. Or doing dogfights with (or against) friends. Or you're just THAT desperate to see more of the 765 idols in video games. Like me.\n(WARNING FOR LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE: Only six idols are featured as skins in the game!)","February 20, 2015","false","13.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","5"

This game, like the developers said, is a test for new systems such as the DFM. Although we have seen that DFM did not work as great as they expected, it was a good try to add more content into the Ace Combat series.\n\nFor the ones that just picked this game up and know nothing about Ace Combat, it is important to note that this game itself is quite satisfying. The DFM may be boring and repetitive in the single player, but it is the most thrilling part in the multiplayer. However, there aren't many players in the multiplayer, so try to stick to capital domination and deathmatch or bring a friend to join you in the air.\n\nOverall, AC:AH is a great game in itself. Although it does not fit to the traditional Ace Combat series, it is important to note that this game was a testbed for new ideas, and it has served its purpose well.","October 27, 2014","true","239.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Seriously. This option between control styles has been a thing since the PS2 Ace Combat games, and even if it wasn't, why would you not check the options menu?\n\nMoving on...\n\nI actually really like ACAH, but with two major complaints.\n\nWhat are those complaints?\n1. Helicopter missions literally give me a headache. I almost didn't buy the game during the last free weekend because of this.\n2. The infamous DFM is required to take down certain enemy aces, and there's no shortage of these aces.\n\nA minor complaint I have is that in the cockpit view, the HUD isn't integrated into the cockpit. I'd be fine with stunting my abilities a bit (as an optional thing of course) to have a slightly more immersive cockpit.\n\nThose two msjor points certainly do damage the game, but it's still an arcade flight game that I find myself coming back to more often than others. It's just a lot of dumb fun. DFM is actually a nice mechanic when it's not shoved down your throat, and being able to get right up into the tail of an opposing fighter as it explodes makes for an interesting change than just seeing a  tiny puff of smoke a kilometer or two away.\n\nDFM for the most part is a system about managing your speed to be able to keep on the tail of an opposing fighter while being able to easily lock onto it and/or shoot it down with machine guns. If you get in too close then an enemy can pull off a counter maneuver to get behind you or simply make a hard brake into a direction you're not expecting to escape your sights, but if you're farther away, your acceptable lock-on circle gets smaller, and obviously it's harder to hit with machine guns. It's not quite as "on-rails" as some people would have you believe, but it certainly does assist you quite a bit in maneuvering.\n\nAn interesting note relatinmg to DFM is that I find myself actually having to use DFM to perform as well as in other titles. For whatever reason, pinning an enemy with machine guns seems much harder in ACAH than other arcade flight games I've played. I'm not sure if it's the speed of the game, the AI, or the control sensitivity, but there it is. That said, dropping behind an enemy and firing a couple of missiles works just as well as ever... unless it's an enemy ace. Then it doesn't do anything helpful at all.\n\nAs much as I like DFM, the game would most certainly be better if it didn't shove it down your throat (I know I made this point already, but it needs to be said again). It takes you on scripted sequences through exploding set pieces, which looks cool, but I'd rather just be able to take down enemies as I like and as fast as I can.\n\nAside from DFM, ACAH makes good use of visual effects to give it a pretty nice sence of speed not captured in most games. This is actually a large reason that I like the game so much, even thought it's pretty much a purely aesthetic thing. The feeling of speed is just... nice.\n\n\nAnyway, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon is a fun game. It's not like other games in the genre (or even in the Ace Combat series) due to its controversial DFM system, but that's not such a bad thing.","December 31, 2014","true","29.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People often told me that Ace Combat is better than Tom Clancy's HAWX; now I can see that it is not exactly true. Viewing a fighter cockpit from the inside is not enough to make people's feelings authentic or at least close to such. The unability to control your aircraft completely is especially annoying: it simply doesn't let you move as you want to, and it automatically returns to horizontal flight if you stop pressing the movement keys. As a result, you feel clumsy against those super agile enemies, who move so swiftly and easily as if they were flying dishes of some remote sci-tech alien civilization.\nAt the same time, the game is rather spectacular, it is intense, and it offers some lengthy and difficult missions.

Not very impressed.\n\nThe air to air stuff is OK at first, but it very quickly becomes tedious.  Playing with Original controls on Normal difficulty, with a 360 controller, the planes fly well enough and controls are responsive and intuitive.  The targeting system is just OK, a lot of times it's difficult to understand where your target has gone but that's more a matter of getting used to the camera.  The problem with air to air is that it doesn't feel in any way realistic; everyone flips around and the only way to really dogfight is to get close enough to the target to enter the on-rails "dogfight mode".  Then it's just a matter of whacking them enough times until they die.  It's way too easy and way, way too repetitive.  Missions pretty much consist of flying to an area, engaging half a dozen bad guys, then moving on to the next area.  You end up going through dozens of enemies, but because you have no sense of the big picture, there's no tension and no drama, you just fight on until someone declares the mission is over.\n\nThere are some missions where you basically operate a turret, such as when you are a door gunner on a Blackhawk helicopter.  That is pretty fun, but it's very chaotic and not particularly rewarding.  You just shoot everything that moves until some scripted event takes place, then it's on to the next mission.\n\nThe real turnoff for me was the attack helicopter stuff.  The controls suddenly are completely unintuitive, with too many weird modes, strange dodge attacks rather than relying on terrain to avoid being targeted, etc.  The weapons seem to have a mind of their own and fire when they want to, and in general the whole helicopter experience is just frustrating and pointless.\n\nIf there was any element of strategy to go along with the very simple tactical system, it might be a fun game.  I'm not talking turning it into a wargame here, but maybe if you had a map and could navigate so that you can head off the enemy before they reach a target, or have to decide which group of enemies to fight first knowing you'll take more casualties at the second site, etc etc, it would have some sense of accomplishment.  As it is it's just go here, fight that, OK good job let's go home.\n\nOverall I guess it's OK to blast away for a few minutes, but it seems like everything is either overly long and frustrating, or overly long and boring.  I don't think I will fire this one up again.","September 13, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The throttle was stuck open so I had to use both the key board and the joy stick for throttle control. Avoid this game at all costs! I wouldn't even play it if it was free!

I played 2 other games of the Ace Comat series (Shattered Skies, Squadron Leader), but this doesnt feel like a Ace Combat game.\n\nThe game basically consists of Quick-Time-Events, which is boring and annoying. You cant fly like you want to.\n\npro:\n- grafics looks nice (as far as i am concerned with it, the ground still looks a bit ugly for an "enhanced" version)\n- combat (has it's moments, but still not what i expected)\n- combat diversity (you can choose between different planes and helicopters)\n- works fine with a xbox360-controller\n\ncontra:\n- story (for a war game, mostly the story is dull, but in the previous ace combat series, the story was quite nice and beatiful narated)\n- subtitel font (the font looks stupid, who came up with this one? i dont like it, it doesnt fit well)\n- radio sound (i miss the good old "fox1, fox1" or "nothing but air, hands up", yes sometimes he says it, but often there is nothing but silence or ♥♥♥♥-chatter\n- Quick-Time-Events (there are to many, you cant avoid them, you have to use the Dogfight-Modus to get some targets, and this is annoying, because you just push the button combination annnnnd it's done)\n- helicopter controlls (they are stupid, and make no sense to me, but if you figured it out, you will come to the conclusion that you nearly dont need to steer the helicopter, just use the autoaiming system and it will be soon over)\n- there is one mission where you cant change the camera, i prefer to fly form the cockpit-view it wont let me change it\n\nOverall: If you are a fan of the series, dont buy this game, or buy it when it's cheap like very cheap. Try it out, like i did, on a free to play weekend.\n","July 26, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

NO flight/conbat simulator should have quick-time events and it feels like they are spammed in this one.\n\nThe graphics are lame, no mater what this game isnt puting power on your pc a grand total of %10 of my gpu's maximum was being pulled when playing the fov was stupid and with no way to reduse it it destroys it for me as lo FOV means constant disorentation. The rest of the graphics are worse of that of BF:BC 2 a much older game, and for a title that is this recent it's unacceptable.\n\nI havent tryed the multplayer but I suspect that it would be much of the same crap that's in the campain.\n\nOverall 4.4/10\nNOT WORTH THE MONEY\nand I got it for free this weekend","July 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even so, the game looks fairly nice, aside from the annoying static cockpit reflection in cockpit view. The story is a wannabe Tom Clancy USA vs. Russia, which is particularly annoying considering the previous games were set in a very interesting alternate universe with fake countries that are allusions to real life counterparts. Sure, the prewvious stories were corny, but you could get really into them. The story in Assault Horizon is both difficult to get into and corny.\nAnother issue in this entry is limited plane selection according to the mission. The game has a fairly large selection of planes, but it's wasted potential since you can only use a few each mission.\nThe music is composed by the same guy who was doing it since 04/5, so it is superb as usual. However, in this entry, the music is different from others in regards to their style.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is that they wanted to attract new fans by making the game Call of Duty style with more emphasis on on-the-rails action than the freeforming fun of previous games.\n\nI recommend all the other games in the series before this one, but Assault Horizon is still a decent arcade air combat game.\nHowever, as an Ace Combat game, Assault Horizon fails in many aspects.\nI recommend every previous entry other than this one.\nAlso, make sure you have a joystick/controller, as it is near unplayable otherwise, especially online.","July 26, 2014","false","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have been warned.  And if you're wondering why it says I have 0 hours in the game, it's because I put it down almost immediately.\nThis game feels like a travesty to me, being someone who has been an AC veteran for almost 10 years.  I absolutely adore Ace Combat.  The graphics, story, controls, and gameplay mechanics have always been great.  This game comes along and throws multiple things out the window.  Graphically, it's not bad.  The visual options are extremely limited (basically, all you get to customiz is AA and screen resolution, so you're screwed over if you have a lower-end PC) and some ground textures are a bit shoddy, but the planes all look excellent.  The visuals of shooting down other aircraft are awesome: the explosions are vibrant and detailed, and watching your enemy's plane fall to pieces while spewing unburned fuel everywhere is a sight that doesn't get old.  Do you know what does get old, though?  The on-rails segments.  Dogfight "mode?"  Seriously?  In Ace Combat's past, you actually needed skill and reflexes to outmaneuver and take down a Yellow or a UAV.  Now, all you have to do is get close, press a button, and keep your targeting reticule in the general direction of the bogey while you fly along a scripted path and fill him with missiles (side note: sometimes, enemies in DFM can take a ridiculous number of hits to kill).  This completely killed the game for me, especially since it's required for some enemies.  This isn't even bringing up the minigun turret and AC-130 gunner levels.  Another cool thing that Ace Combat had was its place along the realistic-arcadey spectrum.  Almost all of the planes are fully licensed models that exist in the real world, but there's always at least one science fiction superweapon, supervehicle, super-something that you get to fight.  Physics and maneuvers are mostly authentic, but your aircraft can hold 100 missiles and the games' final levels include flying through tight corridors.  This game throws all of the cool science fiction aspects away by going with a "realistic" story set in the real world.  Middle eastern terrorists, Russians, and nuclear weapons are all old hat.  I would rather shoot down the Arkbird any day.  The controls are good if you're using a gamepad.  Playing with a keyboard is either outright terrible or has a fairly high learning curve.  I also hear of poor joystick support, but I don't own one so I can't say anything about it.\nI wanted to like this game.  I really, really did.  But I can't enjoy a game that hijacks one of my favorite franchises and flies it straight into the land of COD and BF campaigns.  That's really what this game feels like to me: it's like Namco tried to shove Ace Combat into the skies above the world of extremely scripted corridor FPS.  I know some say that lack of innovation is threatening to kill the games industry, but I'd rather have a tried and true PC port of a formula we all know and love instead of an attempt to blend epic with mediocre.\n5/10","July 27, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are pleasing and the flying/combat is what you would expect from the Ace Combat series. The reason I wouldn't recommend this, however is because aside from being able to play the first tutorial mission the game crashes after selecting your aircraft and weapons loadout for the first mission. Very annoying and disappointing.","July 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I would rather have played fires of liberation if I still had my 360. The game has a  boring, no feeling of accomplishment story with heavily scripted battle system. The dog fight systems is sometimes disorienting  and in some levels it needs to be done in order to advance. You will sometimes fire lots of missles on an enemy plane hitting it multiple times and it would still be up. So will be stuck in some cases why is that plane not going down. I wish they would have added a solo wing fight instead of this dog fight system. The AC-130 and Apache missions felt call of dutyish and added nothing exciting to the game. Throughout the whole game I only wanted to see if I could spot Kei in the background. Buy it not out of curiousity for flight sims or if you're a fan of the series. Only buy it if you stole money from a friend who betrayed you. Then after giving them the game as a gift showing what you wasted their money on.","August 11, 2014","false","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's quite difficult to shoot someone down "normally" In the 3DS version all they have in addition for the previous games that you can get behind enemy planes by maneuvering and avoiding missiles, but you still shoot them as you used to.

Played all of them (from Air Combat up until AC Infinity), this one... well... is diffrent.\nRemember AC4, AC5 for PS2? Yeah, it's nothing like those, so, that takes away all the playability. It has a new feature called Dogfight mode (DFM for short), and fans don't really like it. Me neither. Also, there are pointless turret segments. "Break away the monotony..." some say, but really, this game is about plane dogfight, not stupid turret segments. There is a nice amount of planes to fly, and even helicopters. HELICOPTERS. Sounds bad already, but, guess what? It's because it is. But, they have alot of skins to pick, including hentai skins (Vomit inducing hentai skins).

Ignoring the trite, jingoistic, racist narrative: the gameplay consists of on-rails segments that are heavily scripted; there are only a few missions for each type of aircraft (bomber/fighter/heli); in-mission enemy aircraft do not fly into the area--they spawn out of nothing right beside you; there's very little SP content--once you finish the campaign, that's it. No reason to re-play missions, no free flight option, no way to set up your own dogfights, etc., etc.\n\nExtremely terrible game.\n\nAnd to cap it all off, there's no way to exit the game in-mission (and these tedious Call-of-Duty-inspired mission can be upwards of 40 minutes long) so to escape this putrid rubbish you have to alt+tab out to close the program, or manually cut the process.

This is a warning.\nNot only is this game a waste of money, but also an extreme waste of time. Due to my computer being more powerful than the consoles it was designed for, the game speed was accellerated to twice the speed viewed in the trailers. I had to stall out my plane just to be able to fly under the speed of light.\n\nThe controls are VERY clunky and un-coordinated. Inability to destroy fighters without going into dogfight mode is aggrovating. Dogfight mode being entirely an on-rails experience is rather disgusting. Enemy aircraft can trick you into a dive then veer 90 degrees to both lose you and make you run into the ground.\n\nAll in all, this is by far the single worst game I have ever played and didn't even get through the first level without wanting to pull the eject levers.\nIt's CoD in the air.

I still haven't beaten it, but i'll get to that in a second. I love the Ace Combat games. I played many of the other Ace Combat games and this one remains fairly true to the series. I don't care much for the helicopter scenes, but the AC-130 and B2 missions are pretty cool. The graphics are fine and the gameplay itself is good.....overall.\nSo, why a negative review?\nBecause of DFM, dog fighting mode. The concept itself is a neat idea, but it doesn't work in reality. But is something like that really worth a negative review?\nSpoiler*****\n\n\nYes, god yes, it is so worth a negative review. At the end of the game you must fight a boss who is invincible. Not invincible hard, LITERALLY invincible. Missles LITTERALLY appear out of thin air and start flying at you in AND out of DFM while you try to shoot the boss down. It's a timed event and it's stupid. I don't know how many times I have repeated the final mission just to try and kill the final boss, but I end up dying just before the end of my timed invincible boss event. I'm giving it a negative review solely because of this right here. This moment is one of the most frustrating in gaming I have ever played and I don't know that I will ever have the patience to beat the final boss.","November 30, 2015","false","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I feel this latest iteration the series has leaned much more towards arcade. My biggest complaint is toward the dog-fighting mechanic. Yes, it makes for great cinematic but it is often too difficult to really see what is going on and the controls only makes it worse. I have tried playing with a controller and flight stick, neither feel great for this game.\n\nTypically I would just ignore this “feature” altogether, however, you can't. The game forces you into these cinematic dogs fights and certain enemies cannot be shot down unless in dog-fighting mode. The entire thing just feels “off” to me in a modern aerial combat. Don't get me wrong, I don't love the Ace Combat series for it's realism, I love it for it uniqueness and story. I loved the crazy and sometimes frustrating boss battles. I love the characters and stories it told. The game could be dull at times but I enjoyed just flying around. Unfortunately, in their attempt to make something new and interesting, to me, it just feels like a series of gimmicks.","November 21, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, AC:AH feels like a terrible port of a mediocre AC game.\n\nThe fun jet fighter elements of this game are obscured by frustrating and boring helicopter missions and extremely clunky controls (and I'm playing with a Xbox 360 controller). I was expecting at least 90% of the missions to be in a fighter jet. 2 of the first ~4 missions are in a helecopter.\n\nThat said, I did enjoy some parts of the game. Dogfight Mode (DFM) is a fun aspect of flight missions where your perspective is soft-locked onto your nearby target, and you have to maneuver your camera to get a quick missile hit. It's like a mini-game within the mission. This adds to the intensity of the game.\n\nI bought the game because I was desperate for an AC experience, but this has been a major let down. Fortunately I got it for super cheap from humble bundle. Otherwise, I would be really upset.\n\nThis game is NOT worth full retail price. If you're reallllly desperate for a jet fighter game and this has a deep discount (<$5), it's probably worth it.

Graphics are good, and the gamplay smooth. They get a pat on the back for the effort of adding a story line, even if they don't get one for the storyline itself. I get what they were trying to do with the gameplay, but i think the overly complicated control system gets in the way.\n\nIts not a flight sim, keep it simple.\n\nPressing buttons at instructed intervals to perform 'random' tricks makes the whole thing feel to scripted and rather than pulling you in, adds as a constant reminder to how odd and detached the flight controls really are. The default helicopter controls are a crime against gaming! Everyone knows pushing forward on the stick dips the nose, you shouldnt have to set this crap up yourself! BAD PROGRAMMER, BAD BOY, NAUGHTY! probably about 10 which may explain how they never saw a single episode of Airwolf.\n\nOverall, its well worth its bargain bin price and some may love the arcade style. Also, at least that dusty old joystick will get a bit of use, even if it is only for a few hours. Recommend this game?.....Hmmm, thats a bit strong.

The F22/A Raptor makes a glorious return and looks and feels amazing. The overall quality in graphics is nice, a definiate improvement over the 2D textures that the older PS2 games had.\n\nOh here we go, the helicopter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is by far the biggest problem in the game. They are boring and lobrious. Helicopters are slow, awkward to control and don't feel as satisfying when you control them. Like when you shoot another plane down in a plane, it's fast moving, you have skill in that. In a helicopter, you move so slow and aim so easily it is a joke. They are filler missions which pad the game more than they should.\n\nThere are other benefits though, mid-level check points. A long overdue feature. Nothing more annoying than playing Whiskey Corridor only to die about 1 minute from the end because you get rekted by an AA gun you neglected to see. Dog Fight Mode (DFM) was an interesting concept as well, but felt poorly integrated. A few times after exited that mode because I downed the enemy I crashed into a wall/floor because of the exiting angle. Enemies in this mode also seem to take about 50x more missiles to take out, which makes no sense at all. Also, planes now bleed all over your screen when you kill them.\n\nMusic in this game is also pretty lame in comprassion to the others. Megalith Agnus Dei, Zero both classic music from the games. Even Sea of Chaos from AC Unsung War is memoriable. I can't even name one track from this game.\nThe game is only not recommended because I am a ♥♥♥♥ing AC fan and it shocks me this was released.\n\nALSO DEAD MULTIPLAYER.\n\nTL;DR\n\nWould I recommend this game? To a new player, yes. Someone who has no idea of the past games it will be okay to play if you like flight sims. Buy it on sale though. It isn't worth the £10 they want to charge. It goes on sale for like £2.50 sometimes. Still a rip off, but a bit better.\n\nFor a classic AC player?

The flight dynamics are good for the game of this genre. It also has a fair amount of playable aircrafts to choose.\n\nSince I've played most of Ace Combat games in the series before, I found this one kinda disappointing if compared to the other titles in the series, but still enjoyable. Still, I personally think it's a good thing there's an Ace Combat game on PC officially (although the spin-off one) remembering there haven't been any Ace Combat games on PC officially before. Maybe someday there'll be another Ace Combat game on PC that will remain faithful to its Strangereal saga.\n\nIn general, I'd still recommend this to those who enjoy arcade combat flight genre in general. But if you're an avid Ace Combat fan who trully miss and wants the iconic Strangereal elements in terms of story, atmosphere, and gameplay-feels from AC1,2,3,04,5,Zero, X, and 6, then maybe this game isn't for you.","September 20, 2015","true","71.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you do however have a usb controller, a set of headphones and are looking for some arcade fun then this IS for you.\n\nYou'll notice some reviews bag the game for not being true to the franchise or that the voice acting is terrible (both true) but at the end of the day it's an airforce combat game where you fly different vehicles, all of which provide great variety.\n\nThe game can also be quite challenging at times, having multiple hostiles locked onto you and dodging half a dozen missles at a time will keep your thumbs dancing. There's also some nice cinematics when dog fighting through city buildings, you get the sense of danger as the buildings loom large over you.\n\nSome of the negatives include flat textures, rubber banding by the AI and surprisingly a lack of ammunition in some missions, including the Apache levels, as well as the aforementioned franchise deviation and voice acting.\n\nBut if you can look past these rather small flaws you'll enjoy a fun game with great replay value (and co-op missions).\n\nMaybe wait for sales before buying though.\n\n","September 14, 2015","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you have ever enjoyed any of the previous Ace Combat titles (I have... every one, since the original Playstation..) THIS TITLE OFFICIALLY KILLED ALL THAT WAS GOOD. It gave it a graphics facelift, then put it all on rails. Spare yourself, and remember AC fondly with whatever your last game was. Why? Just WHY!!??\n\nIn case you're still thinking about it, here's more. For a PC title, I would expect these to be a given.. they are not: AWFUL peripheral/joystick support, no TrackIR... Trust me, I tried desperately to find some redeeming value in this title.. I thought, "Well, if it's awful, maybe being able to use my peripheral w/ Ace Combat (childhood dream come true!) would make it worth it." Forget it. This game should be burned at the stake.\n\nP.S. Folks... Medal of Honor did a better job (much better really) with an Apache.. and that's SAD!\n\nDo yourself a favor, pretend Ace Combat died peacefully in it's sleep with the previous title.

I'm no grapgics junkie, but the ground textures were the absolute worse I've seen in any case of recent memory. A few trees and buildings are actually rendered in 3D over a mesh, but the rest of the world is a extremely low res flat texture laid out on the floor like a newspaper.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/228400/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Long story short, tl’dr version? It’s a completely sub-average action game that has a few high moments but also has some really low ones evening it out. If you can get it on sale then it’s probably worth your time, but at full price I can’t recommend it. Also as I always like to mention when reviewing a game in this genre, Ace Combat is an ARCADE flight game, meaning it’s not a hyper-realistic flight-sim but instead an action game in the air which is something I see getting confused about a lot.\n\nMuch longer version? Assault Horizon isn’t a horrible game, and if you enjoy the arcade flight genre you’ll likely get at least one playthrough out of it. That said it’s definitely one if not the weakest entry in the Ace Combat series and some really weird design decisions keep it from being infinitely replayable like its forbearers.  Positives include some attractive if not top-of-the-line visuals, good voice work, and a really strong score.\n\nBut that’s where the praise ends really and it can’t make up for what the game’s lacking, and some really atrocious gameplay mechanics. First-and-foremost is the big elephant in the room that every review touches on, the automated dogfighting mode (DFM). Basically once you’ve gotten within shooting distance of an enemy you hit a key and the game pulls into a close-cam attack that has the computer automatically trailing the enemy, with you focusing on achieving lock-on.\n\nI think I know what they were going for here. They wanted to create a more cinematic experience allowing you to go through all sorts of tight turns and close-ground fly-bys that just aren’t possible for most players. But in actuality what you get is a system that takes 90% of the gameplay out of your hands, and is buggy to boot. Now I can hear what you’re saying, “Don’t use it then”, which I would love to do but the game forces you to make use of it.\n\nEnemy planes are capable of pulling impossible moves (not in a thrust vectoring way, in a literally turns 180 on the spot way that I’m pretty sure is a straight out bug) that absolutely require the use of this mode as trailing enemies, and switching between them is sluggish in manual. To make matters worse things get really…obvious as the max speed of the planes you fly increases. If your plane is faster than the enemies you enter a jumpy, stilted slide-show as your plane forcibly slows down so that you don’t go flying past the enemy making the fact that the system is totally on-rails really blatant. I’m not averse to making the experience more cinematic and entertaining, but it shouldn’t sacrifice gameplay in the process. You also have a similar process for ground assaults and bombing runs but they’re a little less on-rails making them bearable.\n\nAdditionally perhaps about 1/3 of the game isn’t even in a plane. Several large parts or entire missions are from the perspective of a helicopter pilot or the door gunner. Another misguided attempt at expanding the experience but as all these missions are little more than “Hold mouse to win” it falls short. In particular the gunner levels require no skill as you only have to hit in the general vicinity of an enemy to kill them.\n\nLastly there’s the story that’s gotten a lot of flak from longtime fans, personally I can see it from both ways but I do think it’s one of the weaker ones. On one hand they ditched the somewhat fantastical Ace-world where unrealistic super-weapons and corny but enjoyable characters were the norm for a more stock story set in the “real” world. At the same time there are the makings of a traditional Aces story.  Impossibly skilled protagonist, betrayal, crazy over-the-top unlikely war that only you can solve, etc. It’s all here and on occasion when the situations right and the music kicks in you get those warm waves of nostalgia. But the gameplays too broken and the whole “set in the real world” thing makes it hard to buy.\n\nThe reason AC could get away with those silly stories was because it took place in a world where technology was different than ours, and where there were about a billion countries all vying for control, regularly splintering into new countries resulting in constant battles. It wasn’t realistic per-se but it took place in its own little bubble world that made things easier to digest. When you try to tack those same rules and morals on to the world as it exists the ridiculousness of the situation starts to shine through and become harder to enjoy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/recommended/228400/","goldenkitten","Goldenkitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenkitten/","627 products in account","Long story short, tl’dr version? It’s a completely sub-average action game that has a few high moments but also has some really low ones evening it out. If you can get it on sale then it’s probably worth your time, but at full price I can’t recommend it. Also as I always like to mention when reviewing a game in this genre, Ace Combat is an ARCADE flight game, meaning it’s not a hyper-realistic flight-sim but instead an action game in the air which is something I see getting confused about a lot.\n\nMuch longer version? Assault Horizon isn’t a horrible game, and if you enjoy the arcade flight genre you’ll likely get at least one playthrough out of it. That said it’s definitely one if not the weakest entry in the Ace Combat series and some really weird design decisions keep it from being infinitely replayable like its forbearers.  Positives include some attractive if not top-of-the-line visuals, good voice work, and a really strong score.\n\nBut that’s where the praise ends really and it can’t make up for what the game’s lacking, and some really atrocious gameplay mechanics. First-and-foremost is the big elephant in the room that every review touches on, the automated dogfighting mode (DFM). Basically once you’ve gotten within shooting distance of an enemy you hit a key and the game pulls into a close-cam attack that has the computer automatically trailing the enemy, with you focusing on achieving lock-on.\n\nI think I know what they were going for here. They wanted to create a more cinematic experience allowing you to go through all sorts of tight turns and close-ground fly-bys that just aren’t possible for most players. But in actuality what you get is a system that takes 90% of the gameplay out of your hands, and is buggy to boot. Now I can hear what you’re saying, “Don’t use it then”, which I would love to do but the game forces you to make use of it.\n\nEnemy planes are capable of pulling impossible moves (not in a thrust vectoring way, in a literally turns 180 on the spot way that I’m pretty sure is a straight out bug) that absolutely require the use of this mode as trailing enemies, and switching between them is sluggish in manual. To make matters worse things get really…obvious as the max speed of the planes you fly increases. If your plane is faster than the enemies you enter a jumpy, stilted slide-show as your plane forcibly slows down so that you don’t go flying past the enemy making the fact that the system is totally on-rails really blatant. I’m not averse to making the experience more cinematic and entertaining, but it shouldn’t sacrifice gameplay in the process. You also have a similar process for ground assaults and bombing runs but they’re a little less on-rails making them bearable.\n\nAdditionally perhaps about 1/3 of the game isn’t even in a plane. Several large parts or entire missions are from the perspective of a helicopter pilot or the door gunner. Another misguided attempt at expanding the experience but as all these missions are little more than “Hold mouse to win” it falls short. In particular the gunner levels require no skill as you only have to hit in the general vicinity of an enemy to kill them.\n\nLastly there’s the story that’s gotten a lot of flak from longtime fans, personally I can see it from both ways but I do think it’s one of the weaker ones. On one hand they ditched the somewhat fantastical Ace-world where unrealistic super-weapons and corny but enjoyable characters were the norm for a more stock story set in the “real” world. At the same time there are the makings of a traditional Aces story.  Impossibly skilled protagonist, betrayal, crazy over-the-top unlikely war that only you can solve, etc. It’s all here and on occasion when the situations right and the music kicks in you get those warm waves of nostalgia. But the gameplays too broken and the whole “set in the real world” thing makes it hard to buy.\n\nThe reason AC could get away with those silly stories was because it took place in a world where technology was different than ours, and where there were about a billion countries all vying for control, regularly splintering into new countries resulting in constant battles. It wasn’t realistic per-se but it took place in its own little bubble world that made things easier to digest. When you try to tack those same rules and morals on to the world as it exists the ridiculousness of the situation starts to shine through and become harder to enjoy. It’s not without its moments but it also limits the story. Because it takes place in the real world, or some approximation of it, that means we also don’t get any super planes/vehicles/weapons or any of the other crazy stuff AC liked to throw at you. So you’re stuck somewhere between the real and the crazy but since it can’t go full bore either way it’s just left dangling in limbo.\n\nSo, yeah, if you liked previous Ace Combats or just action games in general and can pick this up on the cheap then you’ll get your 6-hours-or-so of enjoyment out of it.

The game certainly looks quite nice, it is too bad you won't get to control it half the time you're playing.\n\nThe game seems intent on forcing you to watch Michael Bay-esque explosion and destruction setpieces, through the use of a new "feature" called Dog Fight Mode. I'm not sure what the intent was here, but what they did was made roughly half of the enemy fighter pilots in the game nearly impossible to shoot down by giving them an infinite amount of flares that recharge instantly, an apparent invulnerability to gun fire, and twitchy flight patterns that their aircraft should not be capable of performing.\n\nAll that is to force you to activate Dog Fight Mode, a glorified Quick Time Event. It takes control away from the player (pretty much always a sign of a bad game design idea) and instead lets you nudge the plane around slightly on a preset path, with the goal of firing missiles when a circle turns red and lining up the gun sight with the enemy. It feels incredibly janky and unsatisfying.\n\nEven then, the game will pull impossible stunts and prevent you from killing the enemy jet until you fly past whatever dumb falling crane or explosion they want you to see. Because god forbid we have these things trigger naturally, that might actually be satisfying for the player. No instead the developers decide you have to see THIS exact sequence of events EXACTLY like this.\n\nRather than having a goofy flight game with solid mechanics in an absurd setting, they went with a boring real world setting and broke the mechanics so they could shoehorn in an unwanted feature that does nothing but effectively force you to view cutscenes. I was hoping that I would be able to avoid using DFM entirely, but I guess I'm not allowed to have fun.\n\nI went into this trying to have an open mind about DFM, but the fact that the game forces you to use it is unacceptable. I honestly did not expect them to do wrong one of the few things that Tom Clancy's HAWX did right, that you never have to use the gameplay gimmick. And even as far as gameplay gimmicks go, Assistance Off is more interesting, creative, and enjoyable than DFM.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are an idiot who likes games where you push a button occasionally to watch complex cutscenes instead of actually performing those actions and think yet another story about Americans and Russian terrorists fighting each other is exciting, you might like this. Otherwise I cannot recommend it.\n\nPort the PS2 games to PC instead Namco, there's money in that.\nIn any case, I'm going to see if I can mod this game to remove DFM altogether and try to salvage something out of this mess.","May 17, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

I wouldn't pay more than like 10 dollars for it. DFM and the sheer amount of eye candy the game offers are really cool for about 3 missions.  I find myself playing a select set of 3 missions, and its mainly for the soundtrack.\n\nProably the single most annoying thing is how forced the DFM and ASM modes are. Some planes will take infinite damage unitl you start DFM, in which case they will only be shot down after a particular event occurs(ie, a bomber will not be destroyed until you start DFM with it and it is also .3 miles from its target)\n\nIf your new to the series, I would recommend starting on one of the 3 AC's for the PS2 or AC6 for the Xbox-360.","January 22, 2014","false","14.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played most of them since the first one on PS1. All my life, i never found another game that can par with NAMCOs’ masterpeice.\n\nAfter a long wait for consoles since Ace Combat 6, it’s back with agressiveness pushing away other games that tried to challenge one of NAMCOs’ pride and asset.\n\nThough did it delivered well? We shall see as i share my thoughts on the game.\n\nPresentation:\n\n“Modern Warfare in the sky”\n\nThe set up is now mentioned in actual world locations, mentioning from previous trailers are Miami, African locations and many more. Surely the game won’t be complete without a storyline and now it’s been aided by a New York Times bestselling military author Jim DeFelice and shaped a story about Lt. Colonel William Bishop from the Warwolf Flight Squadron and his quest to stop a Russian terrorist named Col. Markov “Akula” who has a weapon that can blow up pretty much a city. Unlike the previous and traditional Ace’s direct mission briefing then take off segment, they added some QTE (Quick Time Event) elements for you to react while off the plane (Heavy Rain-ish) which basically pointless for me to be honest. But gladly the phasing is fast & it won’t take long till you get on a mission. It’s a new gesture from the game and also trying other weaponries and aircrafts. Let’s say aside from flying planes, one of them is you can fly an AH-64D Apache Longbow, a gunner on MH-60 Black Hawk and other planes with different functions depending on the given mission. So basically it’s a different curve but it’s still a welcomed add on.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThere are no traces to disappoint the game in terms of visuals. The textures on a blown enemy aircraft is spot on, however I laughed when I saw a blown pilot wasn’t ripped to shreds as I blew his plane sky high. But I guess to avoid being flagged as a bloody game perhaps. But none the less, seeing a shattered plane gives you the sense of sweet victory after taking them down on plane after the other.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou fly a plane & blow some stuff up, simple? Well it used to be like that but the new installment has some treats to keep you occupied for a bit by flying attack choppers, bombers and also a gunner. Though the main meat of the game is to be the Ace in the air and fly planes with different specs and specialties for each given mission. The new main element of the game is the Close-range assault “Dogfight mode”. It can be activated when you’re close enough to an enemy plane; there, the controls will turn into a semi automatic tailing enemy planes (which is a bit silly for me but it made up by taking control on a close range attack) and stick with them as long as you can till you destroy them in mid-air, that way you will feel the sense of satisfaction after each kill. However there are two kinds of control mode whereas semi auto pilot “Optimum” for those who are new in the genre (which I don’t like to use) & the “Original” mode for those who are veterans (like me) on the game that will let you fully control your plane and do as many barrel rolls as you pleased.\n\nEach plane has their own special weapons and class whether a bomber, an air-to-air or both. There are tons of planes to choose from and that will also please the fans and keep them busy searching for their favorite plan/s (where are my Su planes from the start of the game!!!).\n\nAside from the single player, the multiplayer is back with co-op or a death match for all 16 players and plane customizations.\n\nIn co-op mode, you can team up with a trusted buddy while on 16 multiplayer, first there’s Capital Conquest where each team has a group base to protect and destroy the other team’s base; there’s also Domination where you capture ground installations and lastly there’s the classic deathmatch where it’s more intense than the single player by taking down a real player to see who dominates the skies. So basically the other half of the fun lies in the multiplayer.\n\nAudio:\n\nIn terms of voice acting, it’s pretty stiff which sometimes feel like the character’s movement didn’t blend well to the voice acting. I also found out that the sound quality wasn’t that epic enough for my 5.1 surround sound headset which I found that the music was louder than rest so I had to adjust the volumes. But on the brighter side, its well done in terms of explosions, weapons and epic OST which has a mixed of Rock Metal & Orchestra feel to it; plus a one of their track called “Rush” gave me Goosebumps whenever I hear the guitar solo.\n\nOverall:\n\nAce Combat: Assault Horizon is actually a good game but not as great as Ace Combat 5 for me. The gameplay, graphics, OST are there but the storyline fell short and wasn’t as epic as I experienced in AC5s' “The Journey home” song which the game also represents “world peace” from two giant fictional country fighting earch other that almost made a world war. But none the less, this game is a welcomed from its genre; Project ACES still is untouchable and cannot be compared when it comes to making a good arcade jet fighting simulator game. So if you ask me again what’s my favorite fighting simulation game? I’d still say NAMCOs’ Ace Combat series and this will be one of them but the best of them. This will be welcomed for young aces with the help of putting a modern feel to it; and for the fan of the genre, go get it, it's worth the wait and you can't find anything better than Ace Combat.\n\n\nPro(s)\n\nIntense new Dog fight system\n\nAwesome Multiplayer\n\nBreath taking OST\n\nUsing other air craft\n\nFaster phased air combat in the series\n\n\nCon(s)\n\nYou can forget about the storyline\n\nA few missions doesn’t feel right\n\nPointless off battle interactions at times\n\nPointless QTEs","December 3, 2013","true","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I waited until it was on sale for half the price (I believe $20~25) and purchased it. The story is, as expected, complete garbage. The twist was more predictable than putting water in the freezer for ice cubes. It was clearly written by someone who should stick to the cheesy anime pornos rather than serious war stories.\n\nSpeaking of serious war stories, why are Russians always evil? Why can't it be America for once? We're evil, just look at our drone strikes and Snowden and!..... Okay, getting ahead of myself.\n\nAnyway, this was the first "jet" game that I got that tried something new other than playing as a camera w/ turrets (a UAV) rather than a jet: A chopper. Lemme tell you: I wish it didn't. THe worse parts of this game are the chopper sections and they are a good chunk.\n\nAvoid this one, go get HAWX 1 instead. It's cheaper and has more dog fights.","November 30, 2013","false","6.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Although the storyline isn't as clear as titles such as Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, it is still pretty decent for a video game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are also great.  The dogfight mode really gets me into the game and makes me really focus hard on what I am trying to do.  Just like the other Ace Combat titles, I love how you have a special weapon and a regular one, just to help you out in fast-paced dogfights or trying to kill multiple enemies at once.\n\nThe graphics are just wonderful.  There is not much to be said with that, but I think that lots of people can agree the graphics are very well-done.\n\nOne thing I do not like about it is how there aren't very many missions.  I completed the game very quickly, which isn't really a good thing.  If there aren't that many missions, I think they should at least have something else to make you play it a little more.  The multiplayer was made for probably this reason, but have you found sessions that often?\n\nIf you do not have time to read all of this, I'll give you the pros and cons right here.\n\nPros:\nGreat mechanics\nGreat graphics\nGreat missions\n\nCons:\nVery short game\nNot many/no people are on multiplayer a lot of times\n\nOverall, I really like the game, and I think it stands next to my favorites in the Ace Combat series.","February 8, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go ahead and buy it.\n\nMost negative reviews are about how it doesn't follow with the previous, in every way supperiour, Ace Combat titles. And I agree, it does not follow that fun, challenging and instense gameplay the older PS2 titles did so well to achieve. Dog Fight Mode is possible the best way to remove the actual fun of dogfighting in the game and is pretty much the game going "LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS! ISN'T THIS COOL? THIS IS COOL!" No. It's not. The game plays itself, it's just left to press fire to kill things. Honestly, it feels as though the game went from being almost entirely Japanese made (ported to U.S), to 100% U.S made. All "action" and "in your face" explosions and what not, but no real challenge.","January 14, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The last Ace Combat I played was 04: Shattered Skies on PS2. That game was fantastic, and I was thinking that this one would be similar. But, sadly, I was wrong. The Dog Fight mechanic in this game turns what should be adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced flying action into simple point-and-click gameplay. Simply engage Dog Fight mode, and your plane does almost all the flying for you. Just lock onto an enemy with your rockets or machine gun and let loose. I got an achievement where you fly below a falling chimney, and didn't even realize I did it because the Dog Fight mode did all the flying for me. What's worse is that there are some enemies that can only be shot down this way. And what's EVEN worse is that the story can only be advanced with dog fighting in some instances. I normally don't give a game a bad review based solely on one flaw of the game, but this flaw is so ridiculously massive and constant that it just stopped me from enjoying the game. It's got great graphics, though.","July 5, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've always been an ace combat fan so I'll admit to some bias in that regard, along with a love of military aircraft in general.\n\nThat said, this itiration of the Ace Combat series, while fun, full of adrenaline, and still top notch in visual quality as you'd expect, I still felt the new Dog Fighting mechanic took away from some of the imersion.\n\nIn previous titles, dog fighting was as you'd imagine, difficult. Trying to follow your target while staying in range for your main gun and leading the target so you actually hit. While at the same time making sure you did not crash into anything. This, obviously takes some skill and practice, which I felt was a good challenge to the game.\n\nAssault Horizon however takes the burden of piloting and has you focus more on the target. Now it's a matter of making sure your crosshair is on target for your main gun or missles (whichever you prefer) and the plane is essentially on auto pilot after the target. You can change your pitch and angle, sure, but you are certainly only following the target aircraft.\n\nThis was more a design decision to add cinematic fluff than anything else. That hollywood sequence of flying just underneath a crane while at Mach 2 is undeniably impressive and enjoyable for most. But after repeated intervals, it begins to feel cheapened.\n\nThis is certainly a good game for those new to the flight combat sim, or new to Ace Combat in general to get a feel for series. While I wish they kept the old dog fighting mechanics in this, it does allow for a lot of 'wow' moments when you do pull them off.","July 8, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's also a new "chase" mechanic which locks you onto an enemy and autopilots you around, making aiming your only concern in a dogfight. It's basically rail shooter mode. Not only is this boring and unchallenging, but it also looks ridiculous as you weave between buildings and oil rigs at mach two. Use of this mechanic is optional against most enemies, but certain VIP targets force you to use it in order to take them down.\n\nThe helicopter missions come in two flavors: awkwardly controlled attack helo and boring rail shooter transport helo. There are also gunship rail shooter missions straight out of CoD.\n\nOverall everything feels very scripted like a CoD game and there isn't a lot of room for stages to play out differently when you replay them. There's no tension because you never run out of ammo, and there's no challenge because of the autopiloting chase system.\n\nIf you're a long-time AC fan like me you'll probably hate this game.

This game is truly and sadly unplayable without a controller or joystick. A mouse and keyboard simply won't grant you any enjoyment. Furthermore, I'd make this review neutral but since I did have fun and the co-op is great and story decent I'll give it an upvote to compensate for the negatives without much sense.\n\nFor the rest of it, can be summarized by the fact that it's "lesser" in everything. The previous games had masterful soundtrack, this one has a good one but it's still inferior. The very same applies to gameplay which is far more casual and can be applied to everything besides graphics essentially.\n\nNonetheless, on steam I highly doubt you’ll find a more enjoyable game when out there looking for some fun without actually needing flying skills. Casual is key here.. Assuming you fork up a controller - which kinda defeats the purpose of PC gaming in the first place.","February 19, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mixture of arcade sensibilities and modern military FPS-on-rails action. There are intermittant situations where a "DFM / Dog Fight Mode" needs to be employed while flying. The DFM mode at worst gets in the way of what would be an otherwise pleasantly polished arcade game. In short the DFM mode tries to be special, tries to be a frantic adrenaline driven mini-experience. Fortunately the need to engage DFM mode is uncommon. The game would be much better without it. Or at least if it had the option to turn it off. As is? It's alright.\n\nIn closure, if you want an arcadey, non-serious game that features flying, modern combat machines, give this a whirl.

This game isn't worthy of the title of Ace Combat.  I want to go in with an open mind but it just has terrible game mechanics.  From planes performing impossible moves to the dog fight not engaging at the correct time, this game can aggrivate even the most hardcore veterans of the Ace Combat series.  The development crew must have been a bunch of guys who grew up with COD and wanted to emulate it to the letter, with bad story telling and just making certain that there is an explosion every 3 seconds.\n\nThe story could have been a lot better, but the writers decided to go with the most severly ADD pilot I have ever met and to have no depth with character development.  They also wanted to go for the whole Russia is bad theme that COD has beaten to death and then some.  I mean I get the fact that from the Cold War, Russia has never got rid of their stigma of being evil, but I mean come on, lets see something more interesting.  The main villian of the series lacks a true motive for what he is doing, and, personally, they really needed to expand his backstory.  I got to say it was pretty boring when the AC-130 level came into play, cause I was spoiled by how good COD's version was (I will say that that was my favorite level in COD).  You would think that a game producer who focuses just on aircraft would have a better grasp on this.  I will say that the helicopter missions were definitly interesting and a breath of fresh air, once you died 20 times just trying to get used to the new controls.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are another point in the game that actually hurt it.  The dogfight mode is intersting, but annoying when you lockon a target and face an invincible fighter plane, because the producers want you to go through their house of explosions before you can take him out.  Also I have had this little problem affect me multiple times, I will be in the dogfight mode and the enemy plane nose-dives into the ground, and you would think that that is one less plane I have to worry about. Wrong, because your plane will also quickly follow suit and explode, just because dogfight wants you to have the nose of your aircraft so far up the enemies exhaust, that you could just pull the fuel lines, that you also share the fate due to bad AI pathing.  Also while the cinematic following of the missles is pretty cool, it just detracts from the game and causes you to sit in your chair for an extra 5 seconds, while you could be shooting down the other guys who is in front of you.  Once you come out of it 9 times out of 10, they have escaped.  Also the quicktime events are dumb, they offer no, I repeat no, effect on the game, but their are about 3 out of 20-something quicktime events that will make you fail a mission.\n\nThe last major problem I had is that the game isn't that hard.  Changing the difficulty isn't really a test of your skill, like having less ammunition or the AI being smarter, rather it's just how much more that the AI can defy physics and perform outragious moves.  One example is the final dog fight and it has to be done in dogfight mode.  If you break dog fight with the enemy, then the enemy can perform some weird 360-180 backflip, with a double axial from hell and be right on your rear.  Sure it makes it harder but it is just something that isn't that fun to deal with.\n\nThe good thing about this game is the normal dogfighting, not that stupid lockon behind them crap.  It was a blast to relive the old system of using the IFF to track down targets and just shoot them down.  That was a method that proved your worth in the old games, where if you couldn't manually track behind your targets and tack them out with missles of guns, you were dead.\n\nIf you are a new flyer to the Ace Combat series and were either turned off or interested in the series, I recommend that you get a ps2 and play Ace Combat 5 and/or Ace Combat 0.  The reason is simple, the Ace Combat series is hands down one of the best jet fighter sims out there, and this version was just a disgrace.  Now maybe I'm a guy who just enjoys living in the past, but I can tell you that this game had potential but terrible execution.\n\nKeep those skies clear.\n\n(PS I don't like to put spoliers in my reviews, so I am unable to explain, in this already long review, certain key elements in the story that are just bad.

First sin- story lost all of the old cheese and replaced it with real world cookie cutter characters. Second sin - the helicopter missions are awful, controls like a pig and the engine is not designed for rendering ground objects at close distances at all; travel back in time to 1999 graphics. Third, ultimate and unforgivable sin - the game insists on taking away control of the plane constantly. It forces you to use the Dogfighting Mode to fight tougher opponents, essentially changing it to an on-rails shooter with you being able to control aiming and the camera going crazy. It was supposed to be dynamic, but instead is chaotic and aggravating. I can't remember ever feeling offended by a game.

Planes are strictly keyboard based, helichoppers are mouse and keyboard combo, side gunner is strictly mouse and can be likened to a point and click adventure.\nIT SHOULD REALLY BE SAID however that Assault Horizon is not Ace Combat as those familiar with the series would remember it as. While the helicopters are neat (albeit limited) and planes are still the focus, it's a story mode with talking protags and a very arcadey DFM (DogFight Mode) system.

You are forced to use a no skill dogfight mode that only requires you keep you're target within a circle on the screen and fire missiles. There are a few levels, such as the helicopter gunner ones, that have you "on rails" for the entire time. These are tedious and can't be completed until the action sequences run their course. It's also no longer set in a fictional world, which destroys the suspension of disbelief that made it so you don't question the unbelievably huge aerial battles. You are also given regenerative health on your plane, which means that if you take damage you can just play conservatively for a bit and not have to worry about being shot down. Overall, I would say this is definitely the weakest offering of the series. I bought it at a mid range discount (~$15), and feel that was still too much for this mediocre game.","May 30, 2014","false","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a mixture of arcade sensibilities and modern military FPS-on-rails action. There are intermittant situations where a "DFM / Dog Fight Mode" needs to be employed while flying. The DFM mode at worst gets in the way of what would be an otherwise pleasantly polished arcade game. In short the DFM mode tries to be special, tries to be a frantic adrenaline driven mini-experience. Fortunately the need to engage DFM mode is uncommon. The game would be much better without it. Or at least if it had the option to turn it off. As is? It's alright.\n\nIn closure, if you want an arcadey, non-serious game that features flying, modern combat machines, give this a whirl.

It's a step backwards for the Ace Combat franchise in every possible way. The flight controls have been atrociously dumbed down and every plane has the same cartoonish feel. The combat system constantly forces you into annoying pre-scripted quick time sequences. The story boils down to cliche American bros fighting evil Russian terrorists who somehow have a super advanced air force. Oh and the graphics are horrible. It would be like Activison trying to make "Call of Duty with Planes" and farming out the development to the most incompetent studio they could find.","July 25, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game isn't worthy of the title of Ace Combat.  I want to go in with an open mind but it just has terrible game mechanics.  From planes performing impossible moves to the dog fight not engaging at the correct time, this game can aggrivate even the most hardcore veterans of the Ace Combat series.  The development crew must have been a bunch of guys who grew up with COD and wanted to emulate it to the letter, with bad story telling and just making certain that there is an explosion every 3 seconds.\n\nThe story could have been a lot better, but the writers decided to go with the most severly ADD pilot I have ever met and to have no depth with character development.  They also wanted to go for the whole Russia is bad theme that COD has beaten to death and then some.  I mean I get the fact that from the Cold War, Russia has never got rid of their stigma of being evil, but I mean come on, lets see something more interesting.  The main villian of the series lacks a true motive for what he is doing, and, personally, they really needed to expand his backstory.  I got to say it was pretty boring when the AC-130 level came into play, cause I was spoiled by how good COD's version was (I will say that that was my favorite level in COD).  You would think that a game producer who focuses just on aircraft would have a better grasp on this.  I will say that the helicopter missions were definitly interesting and a breath of fresh air, once you died 20 times just trying to get used to the new controls.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are another point in the game that actually hurt it.  The dogfight mode is intersting, but annoying when you lockon a target and face an invincible fighter plane, because the producers want you to go through their house of explosions before you can take him out.  Also I have had this little problem affect me multiple times, I will be in the dogfight mode and the enemy plane nose-dives into the ground, and you would think that that is one less plane I have to worry about. Wrong, because your plane will also quickly follow suit and explode, just because dogfight wants you to have the nose of your aircraft so far up the enemies exhaust, that you could just pull the fuel lines, that you also share the fate due to bad AI pathing.  Also while the cinematic following of the missles is pretty cool, it just detracts from the game and causes you to sit in your chair for an extra 5 seconds, while you could be shooting down the other guys who is in front of you.  Once you come out of it 9 times out of 10, they have escaped.  Also the quicktime events are dumb, they offer no, I repeat no, effect on the game, but their are about 3 out of 20-something quicktime events that will make you fail a mission.\n\nThe last major problem I had is that the game isn't that hard.  Changing the difficulty isn't really a test of your skill, like having less ammunition or the AI being smarter, rather it's just how much more that the AI can defy physics and perform outragious moves.  One example is the final dog fight and it has to be done in dogfight mode.  If you break dog fight with the enemy, then the enemy can perform some weird 360-180 backflip, with a double axial from hell and be right on your rear.  Sure it makes it harder but it is just something that isn't that fun to deal with.\n\nThe good thing about this game is the normal dogfighting, not that stupid lockon behind them crap.  It was a blast to relive the old system of using the IFF to track down targets and just shoot them down.  That was a method that proved your worth in the old games, where if you couldn't manually track behind your targets and tack them out with missles of guns, you were dead.\n\nIf you are a new flyer to the Ace Combat series and were either turned off or interested in the series, I recommend that you get a ps2 and play Ace Combat 5 and/or Ace Combat 0.  The reason is simple, the Ace Combat series is hands down one of the best jet fighter sims out there, and this version was just a disgrace.  Now maybe I'm a guy who just enjoys living in the past, but I can tell you that this game had potential but terrible execution.\n\nKeep those skies clear.\n\n(PS I don't like to put spoliers in my reviews, so I am unable to explain, in this already long review, certain key elements in the story that are just bad.  Also I don't really play multiplayer due to internet problems.  So my review is focused towards those who enjoy the campagin of games.)","July 25, 2014","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to freely take down my targets how I feel is suitable, like gunkilling exclusively with a relatively crappy ship not made for such combat (like A-10s gunkilling Su-27s; A-10s rock, nonetheless, but they're not supposed to fight like this).\n\nDogfight Mode, especially with the required TGT_LEAD types is a royal pain in the ♥♥♥, seeing as they're invincible, unless you use this mode, which involves maximizing damage to the place you're defending, "Because God the programmers say so." or for cinematic effect (I sympathize with the "Modern Warfare with Planes" viewpoint here), which screws your mission goals while at it. I mean, the oil fields got nearly destroyed because of scripted events, whereas my skill alone minimized the damage overall (I kill better when I'm not scripted to; I mean, Yellow Squadron along with AC0's many aces was more fun to take down sans 'railroad guidance' (plus, they had better music when they arrive for combat) than this game with it's mere rookie "aces" making me look stupid because of scripted godlike maneuvering and precision killing during cinematic dogfighting).
