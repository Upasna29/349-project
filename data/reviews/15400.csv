You've made a remarkably unique Tower Defense game, and that takes some serious effort these days, along with a whole lot of crazy.\n\nHarvest: Massive Encounter is honestly just that: a TD game. If you like TD games, you're going to enjoy it.\n\nSo what makes it so unique compared to the others out there on the market, from the starcraft 2 maps to flash games?\n\nFirst off, resource harvesting. You get nothing for killing enemy units; you're dumped into the middle of an endless field full of minerals. Your job is to mine as many minerals as possible, and survive as long as you can. (With some variations on a theme for different game modes).\n\nThe map starts out small, but if you build towards the edge of any one side, it'll stretch out, expanding the minimap further and letting you move farther away from your base. As such, you have pretty much unlimited room to build, but the most dense packs of minerals will be close to where you start off, and the farther from your central base you get, the less efficient mining will become.\n\nThe towers provided to you are remarkably few in number for a tower defense game, but they're very carefully fine tuned to be exactly what you need. For example, laser towers have relatively short range themselves, but can be set to focus all of the laser towers in an area to a single, massive beam. This effect can scale to an unlimited degree, and you can chain smaller groups of laser towers together to form an enormous, intricate network of lasers that has immense range and godlike firepower, or break off their power temporarily to wipe out a swarm of smaller enemies that are faster.\n\nYou can set your towers to prioritize, deprioritize, or ignore certain enemy types as well, so it's well within your power to tell little lasers to focus fire kill the suicide-bomber style gehenna shuttles, but ignore some of the larger units, while having your eagle class missle launchers ignore the shuttles unless they're the only thing left on the screen, or ignore them entirely, only aiming for bigger game to hunt.\n\nAnother really unique feature to H:ME is the energy system. I've seriously seen nothing remotely similar to it in any game before or since. The idea is that you build solar power generators, which create a ball of energy every few seconds. The energy ball bounces randomly between any adjacent point that it can possibly reach, until it comes across something that needs power, and then it rams the target and provides the power required, disappearing from your screen in so doing. This quickly leads to a vast, intricate network of energy lines going all over your base, and energy management becomes vitally important. Having a ton of energy on one side of your base, but not the spot that it's needed, is BAD. Fortunately, you have plenty of very easy to use tools to control your energy flow, such as marking a building as top priority to get any and all energy it needs, or drawing out routing paths to force energy balls to travel along a set path, only being allowed to follow their typical AI programming when they exit the path.\n\nPretty much everything in H:ME can be summed up this way: it's weird, but in a really good way. It's creative, unique, and it WORKS. It's not just different for the sake of being different, but rather, it's different because it makes the game more interesting and fun.\n\nIt'll take awhile to get used to most of the unique aspects that Harvest has to offer, but they're well worth the enjoyment once they've grown on you a bit.\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nEverything Harvest: Massive Encounter does, it does well. The learning curve is really quite steep, however, there's no plot, no multiplayer, and it's really just one big tower defense sandbox. For what it strives to be, it's pretty much perfect at. For what it doesn't try to be, however, it doesn't do at all. If you don't like TD games, this won't be the one to make you a convert, by any means, but it'll be one of the best TD games you've played if you do like them.\n\n\nScore: About 70%. It does what it does pretty much perfectly, but it completely lacks a few areas that could make it a lot better still.","November 27, 2013","true","48.1"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","29","29","0","1"

It's up to you to defend yourself against large waves of enemies that attack from all sides rather than predefined routes as you harvest a finite amount of resources and build up your defences, enabling you to expand your territory to harvest yet more resources and defend against even larger and deadlier waves of enemies.\n\nUnlike a lot of tower defence games, Harvest: Massive Encounter is all about the known variables and a synergy of mechanics. You require resources to build Harvesters, Solar Plants, Laser Towers, Missile Turrets and Link Nodes - no endless stream of unlockable buildings here, just the tools for the job! The Solar Plants produce the power you need to operate the harvesters and fire your turrets and everything needs to be connected via link nodes to allow for a smooth transfer of energy, should a link in the chain break or your layout bottlenecks your supply, you'll be looking at an even tougher fight to survive. It's a very clever mechanic that rewards thoughtful placement and allows you to steadily expand without being constrained to build only area's or a grid system.\n\nIt's all about keeping the synergy between your assets allowing you to expand, collect, defend and repeat. For added complexity, Laser Towers can be linked to produce a more powerful beam with a longer range, so it's not just about putting more towers down to stop the flow of enemies, it's also about creating strong defensive points to tackle the harder enemies (of which there are several types with varying strengths, such as speed or the ability to teleport in reinforcements).\n\nIt's a tough battle from the start until you're inevitably overwhelmed, victory is not so much about defeating your enemy but simply lasting as long as you can before your defences finally cave in. Maybe you'll fair better on the field, but it'll be tough as thousands of enemy ships close in.\n\nThis may all sound rather positive but unfortunately, because the game relies on such closely knit mechanics there isn't that much diversity in what you can do or the enemies you face, its simply about using those limited tools you're given to the best of your abilities. You're also limited to the one, barren map until you can unlock another two after putting quite a few hours into the game and while there are a few game modes available, they offer a similar experience.\n\nWhile a solid strategy game and a unique tower defence title, I'd only really recommend the game for those patient few that like a challenge, enjoy refining their tactics and can feel a sense of accomplishment in beating their old records. While the game can be satisfying and very rewarding when you defeat a wave with all your turrets still intact, for those looking for a greater sense of progression or some light hearted fun, I feel the game could quickly become repetitive.\n\nThank you for your time!","March 25, 2014","false","6.8"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","2"

Gladly bought it again. With tough acchievements to keep challenging you, this unique Tower Defense might have you yelling at the sceen, or even going out of your way to destroy any spinning yellow disc-like objects. I've found myself getting into the 'one more run' mentality about it on more than one occasion.\n\nThe only issues I have with the game are that there are only 3 planets (lack of scenary options), and I find at times linking/unlinking towers can be needlessly complicated, especially when I'm trying to get very specific owers to link, unless theres a shortcut command like shift+click that i've been missing all these years.\nBut those minor gripes aside, it's definatly worth a look, for both casual and hardcore TD fans, and casual gamers in general, the general hardcore crowd might not find it intense enough to start wiith, but it does ramp up later.","June 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

In my experience, while the store says it supports Linux, the game refuses to work on most Linux systems you'd ever use.  When you launch a game, a script runs that tries to detect if you have the right libraries installed to run the game, but it just doesn't like 64 bit systems.  The script "runs", but fails to install anything.  Oh, and it relies on apt-get, so good luck getting the script to work at all if you're on a non-Debian system.\n\nLet's say you forget Steam entirely, run the game's executable directly.  NOPE!  If you have the right libraries installed, in my experience, the game will look for the 64-bit library names, meaning you've got a 32-bit game asking for 64-bit libraries.  That just doesn't work.\n\nWhy am I posting this as a review, rather than asking for help on the community hub?  Because this problem is not happening just to me, and it has happened throughout the near year I've owned this game.  The reason I have that hour of playtime for a game that supposedly doesn't work?  I accidentally installed a 32-bit version of Ubuntu when I decided to hop distros, so I played this while I waited for the 64-bit version to download.\n\nTL;DR: I can't speak for anyone using Mac or Windows, but on Linux?

Here you are tasked with defending a space colony where you need to build energy networks to keep your resources flowing so that you can build increasing amounts of defense to handle the onslaught of ufo's.  The game supports the Steam Overlay but the widescreen is clearly stretched to fit a 16:10 screen.  The graphics are a little below average and the sound design is minimal.  Since I am not a tower defense fan the game didn't really grab me, but there is enough here that serious fans of the genre should consider it if it's on sale.","May 30, 2012","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've spent hundreds of hours on the stand-alone client before I saw it was on Steam.\n\nGreat tower defense-styled game. The freeform construction allows for so much more feedom and strategic thinking than other TD games locked into a simple grid. The energy and mining mechanic is very unique; I haven't seen anything like it in another TD game. Four (+sandbox) modes per the 3 maps, Normal, Wave, Rush, and Insane, all have different strategies and require a lot of thought and, in the case of Insane, some . Most tower defense games involve spending a lot of time looking at the screen waiting for stuff to happen. Not in Harvest: Massive Encounter. I have never played a game where I had to spend so much time paused thinking about my next choice of buildings than this game, and it's been a blast. Pretty steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you can reliably get normal mode games to wave 100+.\n\nIt doesn't have endless replayability, unfortunately, and updates have long since stopped and the mod support didn't come until the community had been long dead. There's a very clear "best setup" that you get the hang of eventually (don't ruin it for yourself by looking them up), and there are only 3 maps. Despite the shortcomings, it's well worth the price!","October 31, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
