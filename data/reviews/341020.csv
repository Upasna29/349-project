Finding Teddy 2 is a fun, 2D side-scrolling adventure game in a mapless MetroidVania style but with controls taken from Zelda 2. This feels so familiar, fun and fresh for every retro gamer that grew up in the 80s or 90s. There's no nostalgia here outside of the Adventure of Link poster on the wall, Finding Teddy 2 offers an new 20 hour adventure that relies heavily on exploration, discovery, combat and traversal. Its an enjoyable experience through its entire beautiful world. From an underground river to the furthest reaches of the heavens, its well worth your time to explore.\n\nThere's so much to explore and discover. You'll always find a subtle goal of what to do next, but to know where to go. To explore a new place, you'll need to remember and old one. You're never guided or hand held. You won't ever find a map, so beware, you'll need to make your own or just take screenshots to remember a place or something important. That's all you need to make it easier on yourself.\n\nYou never get an explanation on why you are in this strange new world. You simply travel into your basement after a night of playing video games and you're teleported down. The environments are beautiful and marvelously detailed with an retro pixelated look. The world has a sense of size and scope when the camera is pulled out. You'll see your character so tiny on the screen compared to a massive guardian that's as tall as a skyscraper. For tight corridors, the camera will zoom in tight to give a sense of cluster phobia.\n\nLike other MetroidVania games, you'll explore a vast foreboding world, starting with the outside and inside of a castle. Over time, you'll gather books that will teleport you to four unique areas. You'll visit a rugged forest, a dreary swamp, a charming winter wonderland and a happy hunting ground that hides volcanic caves within. Each of these four areas has a palace with its own theme and boss.\n\nIn each of these areas, you'll come across towns with inhabitants that speak only in musical melodies. Each word can amount to two, three or four notes. Each word gets stored in your Lexicom so you can use them later as codes to open doors or speak to palace guardians. Its the musical melodies that make up the majority of puzzles in Finding Teddy. Since the game is about exploration and discovery, you need to find all twelve tones to your instrument from treasure chests scattered throughout the world.\n\nAs you search through the world, you'll hear melodies over the subtle ambient music. When you perform the same melody, you'll discover a firefly as a sort of hidden collectable that will unlock an extra far deeper in the game. You'll need to use the same play by ear technique to unlock big golden treasure boxes in each palace with each containing a new ability to traverse the world.\n\nYou'll find hieroglyphics in palaces that will teach you necessary melodies. You can shift ice crystals from cold to hot and vise versa. Heating them up will melt ice blocks surrounding doors, chests or even blocking paths. One quick melody can subdue flower petals that have overgrown doorways and platforms. The petals will grow back, so it turns into a timer for certain sections. The real downfall is having to use the quick melody over and over again for several flower platforms.\n\nThe game is easy to control with a 360 controller and keyboard support. You have buttons to run, play music, jump and attack. For anyone used to a whip or a gun in your MetroidVania games, you might not like how short your sword is. I didn't find any issue with it though, because you have a lot of control over it from the start, you can downward or upward thrust enemies easily to keep you moving. You can also double tap a direction to start running, which I thought was an issue, because I'd accidentally run into something. I'd like to be able to turn off the double tap. There are vines you can easily go up or down, probably the easiest game to climb things quickly. Floors you can drop through and one way platforms to restrict as an entrance only. You can even crouch to attack or crawl through tight areas. Even walk through walls to find secret areas! If its all been done before, Finding Teddy 2 pulls it off to perfection.\n\nThere are four traversal abilities, a duck inner tube to float through water, a double jump that temporarily transforms you to an angel, a wall jump and a downward thrust that will break special blocks. The bosses of each palace require you to use your new skills. Everything from floating in the water to dodge projectiles to wall jumping in order to avoid a giant snake made of crystals. While all of the bosses are interesting, none is that difficult. Its a fun game so nothing is ever too daunting. Each ability allows you to move not only further in the castle that holds this world together, but you'll have to back track to find other things. The further you go, the more books you'll find to enter new areas.\n\nYour menu has placeholders for everything that you'll find. Items to give to people, 25 collectable items in each of the four themed areas. There are colored orbs, each one turns hollow squares into blocks that you can platform on. These orbs can also unlock colored doors. Keys will of course unlock locked doors. Each defeated boss earns you one of four colored eggs which is your ultimate goal to the final boss. Its all about finding what it takes to get you through the next door.\n\nThere is a big variety of enemies that will keep you on your toes. Even a variety of blobs become a threat. Standard yellow blobs give way to electric blobs that will hurt you if you attack them at inopportune moments. Fire blobs that leave trails of fire and then explode into flames when destroyed. Several foes have shields so you'll need to attack from behind, above or any place you can time it right. They're all intelligent and will block accordingly.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, you'll collect marbles and health. The marbles are a currency that let you buy things from the world's only store inside the castle library. There's a brief selection of sword and defense upgrades, a health sphere, a health container that gives you more health, a ring with mysterious powers and a death diamond. While Finding Teddy 2 is a forgiving game with plenty of health, death explodes your character, including losing a lot of marbles in the process. Each death sends you back to an entry point of the area or palace. Having the death diamond resurrects you where you are with half your health bar full. A nice thing about the store is you can put a down payment on an item, so if you die, you'll have less marbles.\n\nFor anyone looking for replay value, you can unlock a new game plus by making it through the game. It doesn't stop there, because you keep unlocking more new game pluses. There are tons of secrets that will have you solving melody puzzles for hours as you search and listen for firefly tones. Its a wonderful game for explorers and completionists to pour time into. A fun game just to move around and beautiful to look around too.\n\nI think the only thing holding this game back is its music is ambient. Its still good and makes an effort to sooth and relax you. The issue is it doesn't have a big, bold, upbeat catchy soundtrack like Castlevania or Metroid. I do understand the music needs to be subtle to add to the atmosphere and ensure that you hear the melodies, but it can be a detriment to just how great this game is.\n\nIn conclusion, outside of a few issues, Finding Teddy 2 is a great game that's well worth $15 or even $25. Its not a difficult game, its a joy to play and exactly what I was looking for. Its beautiful, immersive and even if a bit time consuming having to scour every area over and over again to use every new item or ability. I'd also like to thank Delphine of Plug In Digital for the copy.","April 6, 2015","true","21.2"," 84 of 93 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","84","93","0","0"

Some will appreciate this as a challenge.  I f'n hated it.\n\nNegatives:\n-You'll need a controller as button mapping cannot be changed, and on a keyboard it's almost impossible to play.  This should really be pointed out.\n-No Map-Why???\n-Your sword is tiny.  It's more like a shovel.  You have to be two pixels from an enemy to connect.  I found this super frustrating when...\n\n-THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST THING: The controls for the most part are fine and responsive, but pushing forward twice causes a dash.  So when you are trying to get close to an enemy or platforming, you end up dashing into an enemy or off the cliff.  When your sword is friggin tiny you find yourself getting hurt by otherwise easy to kill enemys.  PLEASE CHANGE THIS!\n\n-Its very easy to miss things, because the backgrounds, while beautiful, are very subtle.  I didn't realize there was a store till after resorting to a walkthrough.  By then I had died a few times reducing the $500 I had to a little over a hundred.  Because...\n-When you die you lose HALF your money.  Saving for that upgrade?  Better not kick the bucket!\n\nDespite all those negatives, It's stll a lush, challenging, beautiful game.  It's frustrating that some of the difficulty lies with the controls, but I'm sure I'll keep going if I don't break  my controller first.\nI'd say 8.5/10\n\nIf you like this game I highly recommend Elliot Quest.

I'd recommend it to those that are interested in it but be warned because I had to resort to a walkthrough about 30 minutes in... You'll enjoy it more and more as you progress!\n\nVerdict - 7.2/10 - Good GameGraphics - 9/10 - Amazing\nMusic - 8/10 - Great\nSound - 8/10 - Great\nCombat - 5/10 - Average\nLevel Design - 8/10 - Great\nStory - 5/10 - Average\n\nPros:+ Pixel Art Graphics\n+ Amazing Animations (The first guardian looks awesome)\n+ Average Combat\n+ Some really well-done Boss Fights\n+ Great Platforming\n+ Good Level Design\n+ Good Atmosphere\n+ Good Music\n+ Good Sound\n+ Decent Progression\n+ Lots of collectables in the game (Great for completionists!)\n+ Achievements and Trading Cards\n+ Reasonable Price\n\nCons:- - Little-no guidance, frustrating at times\n- - Some parts of Combat are frustrating\n- Little-no storyline (As far as I'm aware)\n\n\nAdditional Information:\nLike I said, I actually had to look up a walkthrough after playing this game for 30 minutes, it really doesn't give the player any information at all. The information is available in places, for example the NPCs do give you some of the information but other times I had no idea what I was doing, it took me ages to get the hand of things and I started to get frustrated with the game because of it... Which is a major gripe in this game, it's a shame really because otherwise it flows quite well.\n\nThe graphics are pretty awesome, the actual style of the graphics is kind of basic; it's just your average Pixel Art but it's the animations that make it awesome, some of the combat animations make it fun to attack and the animation on the first Guardian is absolutely awesome and really well done.\n\nThe combat is... Kind of... 'Meh' to be honest, some of the enemies feel clunky to fight and there's no knockback - from what I've seen - in this game at all, once an enemy starts charging their attack there's nothing you can do to interrupt it, in addition just touching an enemy causes damage to the player, this is find for enemies such as Slimes but warrior based enemies with weapons is just plain irritating, especially after they have already charged and commenced their attack... All of this really makes the combat feel; clunky at best... There is a shop where you can purchase items like a better sword and armour as well as a few other items which I have no idea what they do, it gives a small sense of progression but it's not a major part of the game. There are some Great mechanics in the combat though, such as the shielding mechanic but at the moment this isn't really expanded upon well.\n\nThe actual platforming of the game is actually really well done and the movement is flows really well, it's a shame that it's all let down by the 'average at best' combat...\n\nThe first one - as far as I know - was a point and click adventure game, and it feels like Finding Teddy 2 is very much the same but in a platformer style format. It's not the best platformer but it does feel like a pretty good 'point and click'...\n\nOverall I did have fun with this game after I knew what I was doing but I'd advice you to read a guide for the first few levels because this game does absolutely no hand-holding what-so-ever.\n\n\n\nMy suggestions to the Developer - remove the pause that occurs when you fall too fast, it really removes the flow of the platforming. Make the attack range just a tad larger and allow some of the charge attacks to be interrupted. Lower the amount of sliding the character does so it doesn't feel like an Ice Rink and the game will feel much tighter and more solid.\n\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","April 13, 2015","true","7.0"," 69 of 103 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","69","103","2","2"

It looks alot like another game you may have seen before, or perhaps even played yourself.  Abruptly the strong glow of the television cuts out and shrouds the room and its contents into shadow.  Upset by this, the girl tosses her controller to the carpet, stands, and roots arond in a nearby chest -- eventually pulling out a small dagger and green coloured shield.  Now so equipped, the girl traverses the disparate rooms of the unpopulated house with the resolve to find out the cause of this unwelcomed interruption.  In the basement she finds something strange... and peculiar.  The nebulous shade of a teddy bear floating next to an open doorway full of bright light beckons the girl to follow it into the luminance beyond the portal.  She renews her grip upon her dagger and shield, descends the basement steps, and begins her adventure.\n\nOkay so, I will start by giving the obvious thing away.  This is - through and through - a METROIDVANIA.  So if you know what that phrase means and arent put off by it but rather all-the-more intrigued, then I can happily report that you should BUY THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY!\n\nHere are some reasons WHY:\n\nThe Music, Sound Design, Graphics -- basically anything aesthetically pleasing about a video game is done SO, VERY, well here.  This game has Syphony of The Night mixed with FEZ levels of graphical splendor that just oozes over your eyeballs and coaxes your brain into telling you only to simply nod and go, "Wow...".  It's a seriously gorgeous game.\n\nIt also has a very maze-like approach to level design and, without the help of a map, you really have to use your brain-box to sort it all out for yourself.  Navigating can be a bit of a nightmare because of this mapless system, however I never begrudged the game this missing feature because it forcefully got me to explore things more than I already had and to also stumble upon numerous  secrets and to amass more currency via slaying monsters to spend in the vendor's shop.\n\nAs far as I can tell the game is made by non-english speakers, and as such, the whole thing has this theme of non verbal communication that is rather charming and it only ends up adding to the overall mystique of the world in general.  The only downside to this is that when there is text, there are several typos and odd sentances that end up occuring here and there but, this is nothing that a patch won't eventually fix.\n\nFinding Teddy 2 is exploration, it's combat, it's lyrical puzzle solving.  All to the waxing of a beautiful soundtack, and stunning graphics.  It's also pretty hard and doesn't hold your hand through the puzzles.  I found myself getting stuck for small pockets of time and having the game test me to see if I had indeed been paying attension or not.\n\nSeriously, if you want to relive the good old days and with a little bit of what contemporary PIXEL technology has to offer... what are you waiting for.\n\nHIGHLY RECCOMENDED!  A game of this type hasn't been done THIS well in some time.\n\nCan't wait for the THIRD one!","April 2, 2015","true","26.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","23","26","5","1"

The art and animation is wonderful. I love the idea of music/notes to pass through major unlockable areas.\n\nHowever, the world makes no consistent sense, and there's no mapping.\n\nMapping: Many moden games like this have auto-mapping to help keep track of where all the twisting branching areas go. There's just too many areas and doors to simply "memorize" it. I'm probably less than 1/4 into the game but have already surpassed like 1.5 Metroids worth of maps and corridors. Knowing that now, it's okay; I've busted out paper and pen for when I can't seem to get any further, and carefully take notes. But this is jarring when you fist experience it.\n\nConsistent Sense: Nothing seems to make sense. The hub-world doesn't make sense. None of the equipment you pick up or purchased is explained at all. I have a ring! No idea what it does. I upgraded to cute blue oeveralls; they seem to provide no protection bonus. I collected Eggplants, Scarabs and Snowflakes: I'm hours into the game but have no idea what they're for! In my inventory I have sunglasses and christmas ornaments, but no idea what they're for. And on and on.\n\nThe discussion boards are flooded with the same questions over and over: Using the shield, opening certain doors, how to use the books as warp gates (this is one of the most intregal features of the game early on, and there's no explanation given for it. The only way to know how to proceed is to check the answer in the Discussion board... What the heck??).\n\nUltimately, the above two points (complex maps that require hand-mapping; and no sense or guidance on objects or their uses) lead to far more frustration than fun. I've gone through The Talos Project without many hints, so I know my way around puzzle games... and yet I find myself stumped regularly, with no guidance as to where to go for the next hint/clue/action... Have spent more time backtracking in this game than making forward progress!\n\nSo, currently I'm about halfway through the game. I'm of equal parts joy and frustration. The art, animation, themes and sound have me going further instead of giving up. We'll see if I make it out the other side.","April 5, 2015","false","7.8"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","51","78","0","0"

The worlds and areas are really diverse and filled with small details, secrets and gives a great sense of exploration. They all have their own little personality too. Music and sound effects are made really well and it'll definitely be a soundtrack I'll chill out and listen to every now and then.\n\nThe FEZ mention is because it's the first game since I brought out a pen and paper and actually had fun doing that "old school" and also listening to things in the world that are of importance and can be crucial for going forwards.\n\nI immediately got into the controls with ease, this might be due to finishing Zelda 2 countless times in my youth and recently last year. There's an enemy straight out of that game as well which was nice to see actually, the Iron Knuckle (the orange, blue or red knights) gets a warm welcome back from me oddly enough :)\n\nBut you won't have a helping hand or a tutorial guiding you hence the slight FEZ comparison above, though I personally have no issues with it. I love the feeling when you're frustrated, confused or just impatient and you solve some cryptic puzzle without a walkthrough etc. it's just amazing and really makes you appreciate it a whole lot more in my opininon.\n\nCompared to other games today where I'm tired of following a linear tutorial that's supposed to teach you the basics (but you'll most likely forget ~50% of it depending on how advanced it is, and still figure out the rest on your own anyways) and at the end of it you'll get a pointless achievement - no thanks.\n\nI'd take Finding Teddy 2-style no holding hands type of exploration any day over some uninspired dumbed down guidance in a game that's supposed to make you feel good at the game.

It has the same kind of style but puts its own little twist into everything..\n\nIt really seems like it would be those games if being seen through the eyes of a child. For example, in order to go in water effectively in one of the castlevania's, you needed a scale.  In this, you need one of those water ring duckies.\n\nThe game in terms of text on the screen is quite bare. It doesn't say what an item is when you pick it up and the only time any dialogue text appears is when you meet with the inhabitants. You yourself don't speak..technically. Along the way, you pick up an object called the Musicom which lets you play 'words' and by words, I mean music tones which everybody speaks in. Think of it as the ocarina from Zelda but you're making words with the notes.\n\nIf there was anything I had to complain about this game, it'd DEFINITELY be the slime blobs in the third and fourth worlds. The ones that electricify themselves so you can't hit them. Now this is an enemy we know from every game. You just have to wait for it to be done. That's just the problem. Depending on how you move around him, he will just keep reactivating this 'shield' and basically make themselves unhittable forever. They should only do it based on a time limit. LIke they only do it every 10 seconds or something like that.\n\nThe other thing would be one of the doors in the star road place. (The place you can get to with all four orbs.) It's the top right door with all the spike balls, flame guys and stuff.\n\nIf the people who designed that area is reading this, I hate you. I would have slapped you if I was there when you made it.\n\nLastly the block pushing animation is pretty glitchy for me so it takes a while to push blocks and pots around.\n\nOther than that, it's a beautiful game that I just found myself being absorbed into as I played. It's one of those games where you start playing and then before you even know it, several hours have gone by","July 22, 2015","true","23.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Honestly one of the best platformers I have played in years. They really don't make them like this anymore, great level design, interesting and fun game mechanics, tight controls (your skill and timing are the only thing to blame for your failure), good soundtrack, lots of secrets. I put this game on the same level of enjoyment as 'Ori and the Blind Forest'. The aesthetics might not be the same, but this game is intentionally retro. Finding Teddy 2 does not hold your hand. Most of the progression through the game is left up to the player to figure out and find. Personally I enjoy this aspect. If you prefer to have your hand held and be told where to go every step of the way, then this title might not be for you. A gripe I keep reading about this game is the lack of maps. If you play the game past the first 15 minutes, you will discover that the game areas are separated in a way that it's ok that there aren't maps. The areas are not enormous, and they all have half-way portals between the main map and the boss dungeon in case you need to return to the main hub. If you enjoy exploration based metroidvania games with challenging (but not impossible) platforming, then I could not recommend this title more. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, played it exclusively until I beat it, and was terribly sad to see it end. To reiterate, they just don't make games like this anymore, and even fewer of this caliber.

The controls are tight and combat fun. When you use the jump + down attack you bounce off their head like a trampoline which leads to some bouncy combos. The dungeons like dungeons within dungeons. Your hub world has rooms to unlock as you collect different abilities and encourages revisiting old areas to get to previously hard to reach treasure boxes. The pixel art and effects are smooth as butter and make the world very attractive to look at. There are no tutorials, no map system (Which I admittedly wish we had) so you can't use the complaint "Video games try too hard to hold your hand" because this game definitely lets you fend for yourself.

I was so excited to play and ready for a really cool adventure, as the reviews described. Unfortunately, the description failed to mention that the key configuration is basically unuasable for Mac or PC users without a controller. It is also impossible to rebind the keys, so there is no way to fix this. The movement is set up for Aroow keys and WASD, pretty standard. But the action keys are KLOP and the instructions on how to do extensive commands (ie - running, a necessity) is only explained for controller format ("press right bumper") instead of letting the user know that double tapping the movement keys makes her run (also difficult). I had to press every key on the keyboard before I could figure out how to see the inventory. This problem has been brought up in several forums and never been resolved. A simple key rebinding option could fix many problems.\n\nBut not the fact that the opening scene is just a black screen with the words 'press any key to skip'. Which I have read is another ongoing problem.

It's the only redeeming factor for this game. After making a nice Point'n'Click game with Finding Teddy, Storybird tried their hands on a platformer with puzzle elements in the second installment. Sadly, this idea backfired immensely.\nThe controls are hellishly unresponsive with your character carrying far too much momentum over when changing direction, especially mid-air. Everything just feels delayed and sluggish. Your first sword is so short, you have to move extremely close to your enemies to hit them. Also, there's a LOT of backtracking involved, but opposed to other Metroidvania-style games, there is no map whatsoever which aids you in finding your way around the world. Top that off with the absolutely abysmal level design, which is completely incoherent. Some sections wrap around with several screens being connected by doors in no sensible way. Most of the time you're running around screen after screen after screen without knowing what to do. Some of those screens serve no gameplay purpose whatsoever. They're just filler scenery.\nThe Musicom is a concept that was carried over from the first installment. It allows the player to communicate with the environment via musical notes. While this is a great idea, the execution in Finding Teddy 2 only contributes to the amount of frustration and confusion players have to endure while playing this game. The first one had 26 notes which corresponded to the latin alphabet. Communicating was as simple as putting in an english word. Finding Teddy 2 on the other hand introduces some kind of syllable language with 12 symbols (notes of one octave), which look far too similar most of the time. At least there is an in-game dictionary of words, but still this feels more like learning Korean.\n\nAll in all, this game is not worth your time, no matter how low the price tag!","August 19, 2015","false","3.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

But the problem comes in the lack of information the game presents to the user: The user is very much on their own in terms of figuring out things, from figuring out what the next thing to do is, to even simple things like finding out how to use your shield. Needless to say: impatient or players who want their hand held need not apply, because it's going to be  a rough go for you with the games lack of direction.\n\n+:\n-Beatiful art + seamless animation: makes the world come alive with every step and movement.\n-Pixel art works well in terms of presentation.\n-Sound/Music design well done.\n-Explorer's dream, several secrets.\n-Controls are alright when you get used to them.\n\n-:\n-Very much on your own. Severe lack of information means a lot of back tracking and probing against walls that may have a room you didn't notice. I don't want to make a connection to a game like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, but it isn't far from it with the lack of information.

If  you look for really well made metroidvania platformer with polished style and good feeling of control over the character - that's it. Maybe you won't like it at once - at beggining there's absolutely no tip about what to do or where to go, but with the time exploring vast world will get you some answers. Most of the interactions in the game are based on the Lexicon musical device, that consists of many runes that works same as words. There are also collectibles, some upgrades (for ex. you cannot swim at first nor do wall jump). Playing with keyboard may be little off since you do not jump with space (as always), and there's no redifining the keys. Pad though works just fine.\n\nStill after some time in game, I got that feeling of slight boredom, since walking around to "this or that door" is not the great definition of action or puzzle -  which is shame, because taking into consideration  previous game devs could make a better job. Walking to get key for door and walking back and opening it does not work as great incentive after few of those situations.\n\nOverall it is really hard to just simply point to "yes" or "no" as for this game.  I guess in this case I'll take it to money factor, which will point to "NO".

I haven't had this much fun in ages, as well as frustration (but in a good way!) This game has kept me on my toes, having to rethink and revisit the chapters you come across as you go. sometimes it does get a little laggy in terms of fighting, but for the most part it has beautiful graphics, the music is wonderful, and i for one haven't gotten bored playing it :P\n\nI'd say 10/10 graphics, 8/10 for gameplay, and overall solid 9. There are some complications in terms of direction, but I think for the most part that's what makes the game well invested in. You're not spoon fed the answers, you have to literally go back because if anything, there's something you've missed. I've found myself lost a few times, but after revisting places and doing certain things I find the answers eventually.

Finding Teddy 2 plunges you into its world, robs you of your floaty companion, and delivers a great metroidvania experience. Solve puzzles, upgrade your equipment, face bosses—who seem to be allegories for modern, spiritual tribulations—, and find teddy.\n\nI absolutely loved this game. It's so far become my favorite game this year. Combat is finnicky, and some enemies are placed in very spiteful locations, but it definitely remains enjoyable the whole way through. I didn't have that impulse to 100% the game because it's very tedious to do so. Nothing really fun about it in this game.\n\nEither way this was such a great game.

Significant patching has greatly improved the game since launch, eliminating an awful lot of its major issues. After a frankly awful beginning, Finding Teddy 2 winds up being a really satisfying slice of Metroidvania, albeit with some niggling combat issues. It also happens to be one of the best looking pixel art games I've seen in years. It's just a shame that some dodgy controls, troublesome bugs and an initial lack of purpose and direction might put players off discovering the game's later, finer moments.\n\nStill a huge win for anyone looking for challenging puzzles though.\n\n\nFull review here: http://www.gizorama.com/2015/computer/pc/finding-willpower-finding-teddy-2-review","April 14, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music, sound, and art really set the mood well. The sound of marbles pouring out of a treasure chest is intensely satisfying.\n- The abilities you get that let you traverse new parts of old levels are innovative and well-woven into the levels. Even the standard abilities (such as double jump) are fun to use, and beautifully animated.\n- There is a secret code language, and I really like the way this game handles it. Rather than a simple substitution cipher (where each symbol stands for one letter) that you have to puzzle out yourself, the code is more complicated. However, whenever you see someone say a word in this secret language, you automically record it and can look it up whenever you want.

Forget playing this on a keyboard, the control scheme is locked and cannot be rebound and are in such odd places on the keyboard using either WASD or the arrows put your hands in pretty uncomfortable situations. Use a controller or gamepad and that problem goes away, but some things still don't work quite right. The jumping, running, ducking, slashing, and sprinting work magnificently, until you get to a point where you need to wall jump. Sometimes the character will hit the wall and the wall jumping works, but most of the time at some point during your chain of jumps, the character will just not hit the wall, or the game will have you double-jump instead ruining the combo and you will likely fall into the abyss.

But it is NOT invasive)\nIntergrated dash button is MORE THAN welcome, as is the simplistic map\nGood audio\nSound being the main idea is a cool concept\n\nCons:\nMetroidvania style platformer; you will be doing A LOT of backtracking\nHit box for your character seems a bit bigger than it should be (combined with your limited range, it can be a nightmare)\n\nPersonal Cons (FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED DEXTERITY): As was my complaint when I first bought this: "I wish there was a dedicated button for..." That's still the case, only this time, a.. well, it's a spoiler. But, there comes a time where you need to double tap the down button QUICK, as it's a main mechanic. Luckily, XPadder was playing nice, and I was able to map the down arrow to one of the unused controller buttons, and turn it on turbo.\nControllers are... wonky. They work, just buttons seem not to line up as you set them (it could be the controller itself too). Mini con\n\n7/10.Frustratingly difficult at times, and you'll love every minute.","July 17, 2015","true","46.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
