By stripping them of their clothing so that they dissolve in the sunlight. Duh.\n\nPart action/adventure brawler, part visual novel and part dress-up game (have you seen how much customisation there is!?), AKIBA'S TRIP is definitely one of the better games to be released on Steam this year. Not bad considering it's a PS3/Vita port.\n\n+ Great environments based directly on the real Akihabara\n+ Likeable cast of characters\n+ Stripping random people for the good of society\n+ Easy to learn, tricky to master combat system\n+ Massive customisation (clothes, weapons, walk & strip attack styles)\n+ Stripping random girls for the good of society\n+ Maids\n\n- Boys' Love fangirls keep putting me in their twisted fantasies\n\n10/10, would run around stripping people naked again.","June 11, 2015","true","39.7"," 398 of 419 people (95%) found this review helpful 236 people found this review funny","95","398","419","236","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicCh33se/recommended/333980/","EpicCh33se","EpicCh33se","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicCh33se/","49 products in account","Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed (Akiba's Trip 2), is a game where you strip vampires out in the open so that their skin may be exposed to direct sunlight. Sounds about as ridiculous as it gets, aye, but there's plenty of fun to be had, even in all the problems that this game brings.\n\nI first heard about this game on Amazon, before it released in the West on the PS3. I bought this game on Steam when it was on sale. That said, the Steam port was my first experience with this game.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the system requirements for this game. An i5? GTX 760? What kind of game is this?\n\nUpon booting it up, I was greeted with a window which allowed me to map controls, change the game and voice language, set the resolution, change the number of NPCs rendered at a time, and turn VSync or anti-aliasing on... and that's it. There are no other PC specific options throughout the entire game. The game is even capped at 30 FPS with occasional drops, which really makes me wonder if the system requirements were because of the NPCs or port-job. This game is also really hard to play on the mouse and keyboard, so a controller is highly recommended.\nStrangely enough, the controller buttons in this port show the XBox buttons, like A,B, X, and Y, even though this game was never released for XBox systems.\nThe PC port is a port of the PS4 version, which includes the DLC in-game already, faster NPC and area load times, and the Visual Editor, which is awesome. You can change the saturation of colors, or even just invert everything.\n\nAfter starting a new game, it took me to a character model editor. Limited options are available at first, and more are unlocked as you play and complete routes, including the option to change clothes on different characters, change their voices, and even their entire model altogether.\n\nBefore I go any further, I'd like to point out that I played this game with Japanese voices, so I can't make any comments on the English voice-over. For the Japanese voices, as expected, everything sounds top-notch. However, I did find the "weak male" voice to be incredibly annoying, what with the HUEHUEHUE and the very high pitched screams, but that's just personal opinion. I did find that the translation for the game was a more Westernized one. A lot of meme and popular references here and there, and Tohko is a bit more sassy. The music consists of mostly techno tracks. In my opinion, there just aren't enough. A certain boss gets an awesome battle theme that only plays during that specific battle; it doesn't even play in the battle against him in Shion's route.\nI also noticed that many of the NPCs say "Yoshi!" or "Yatta!" a lot, which mean "Alright! (determined)", and "Yay!" This happens frequently and I'm left wondering what they're celebrating for.\n\nStory\nThe game starts off with you being trapped inside of an underground laboratory where you've been turned into some kind of "Synthester" or "magaimono." A girl named Shizuku saves you, and you take her to the base of operations for the Akiba Freedom Fighters, which is a game bar named MOGRA (it's a real place). The game revolves around the group of friends as they try to figure out the mysteries beind these Synthesters.\nI won't go any further, as there are spoilers, but there is a common route, and then it separates into character routes like in a visual novel. Each route has their own series of events and endings, with a True and Normal ending for each. How you get onto these routes depends on a hidden affection points system, which are given based on dialogue choices. Once you beat the game once, you'll unlock the Affection Hint option, which allows you to see which dialogue options give affection points to whom. The game doesn't tell you this, but each character has an affection priority, which is basially how difficult it is to get into each route. It goes from Tohko to Shizuku, Rin, and Shion.\nShizuku's, Tohko's, and Rin's routes have very similar series of events. Shion's is almost completely different, with only some shared dialogue. No matter how much I liked Tohko's character, her route was the most... ehh, and Rin's route was even more in-depth than Shizuku's, with extra background exposition, and an extra scene during the final battle, which is ironic since Shizuku is supposed to be more of a main character. Kati doesn't have a route, by the way. Shame. There is an additional Sister "route", which isn't really a route, but an add-on ending sequence, which you can get by completing all the Sister side missions.\nWhen I first played through the game, I ended up on Shizuku's route, and I felt extremely intruigued at the end-game events. It was just so... awesome, like I was really doing something. The atmosphere was done well.\n\nGameplay and Combat\nIn this game, you roam around mid 2013 (I think) Akihabara, shopping in different stores (that are real) and interacting with many NPCs. Many ads and commercials are seen in giant monitors, but you'll mostly be seeing ones from Conception II and some other games. You can dress your character, and then later, your partner character with different clothes you can buy, or pick up from enemies. You can only strip and keep clothing from enemies depending on whether or not you've maxed your strip skill in the specific clothing type. The progression is mission based, meaning all story events are missions, and you'll go back to MOGRA to renew them. Side missions are plentiful, and can be accepted via your smartphone, which is the game menu. There are too many weapons to count, spreading across 4 weapon types. It's very fun to see what kind of combinations you can make with the abillity to change clothing, weapon, strip style, and even walking style. Both weapons and clothing can be upgraded via the synthesis system.\n\nIn combat, you have to wear down your opponent's clothes before stripping them. Clothes are separated into head, chest, and bottoms. They must be targetted individually. Almost always, the enemies will attack in numbers, so it's better to have hit-and-run tactics on higher difficulties. Some weapons allow for great combos, and it's really fun to just beat the crap out of everyone.\nThe AI is relatively good. You can set partners to evade or attack, which works out well. When they evade, they also heal themselves if they're damaged. Unlike you, their clothes will always come back, whether or not they're teared. However, for some reason, your partner will only heal if they are damaged, not if they are missing clothing and their other pieces of clothing are at max health. This can get annoying as you have to set them to attack so they can lose health, and then set them to evade again. Stripped clothing comes back to you when you've finished a battle, but sometimes, the game doesn't register a completed battle so you have to buy your clothes back for 1,000 yen.\n\nThe game doesn't tell you much of what you can do often. There are unblockable attacks that you can pull off, which require you to flick the slick in the direction away from the enemy and then press an attack button, but this is much easier to do when you hold the guard button along with it. It also doesn't tell you that when you are knocked into the air, you can get up immediately if you press X (or square). There is also a hidden repuation value. The more you fight random people, the more it goes down. If it is low, whenever you are fighting near NPCs, some of them can join in the fight, causing irritation.\n\n----------\n\nAlthough the game has many flaws in how polished the system is, a lot of these can be overlooked. The story and characters are very enjoyable, and the combat gets more fun the more you play. To be honest, it's much more better if you're familiar with anime and such. The game doesn't tell you much about its mehanics or features, but if you're willing to experiment, then it'll be a worthwhile experience.","June 29, 2015","true","72.4"," 181 of 198 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","181","198","4","3"

As you can tell by the amount of time I've spent on this game, I can assure you that it's a pleasure to be playing this game.\n\nStory (6/10)\n\n"AKIBA’S TRIP tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.\n\nAnd of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…"\n\nThe story of the game isn't something completly innovative or new, neither is it really complicated or deep - it just adds a nice touch to the game as you strip your way through the streets of Akihabara.\n\nGraphics (6/10)\n\nThe graphics aren't all that spectacular due to the fact that game was released for the PS Vita in the first place and was never remade for the PC version, as mentioned by the game developers. Due to the game being an import the graphics aren't what some people would say "amazing" or "next-gen", but put in other words the game can be described as a rough diamond - the more you play it, the more you will realize it's true potential.\n\nSound (7/10)\n\nThe sound or alas music in this game is what you'll be noticing the most in your playthroughs, even when just opening the game you'll be met with a very sweet opening sequel, then followed up by the main menu background music. It all hypes up to the actual gameplay and gives the player a sense of anticipation towards the beginning of the story.\nWhen it comes to sound effects such as combat etc. the game has a very amusing approach towards the combat itself, when it comes down to the real "combat" of the game you'll be hearing more moans than your average gangbang, whether it be male or female ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).\n\nGameplay (8/10)\n\nSpeaking of gameplay I can honestly say that the game's combat system, overall 'mission' system etc. synergizes well with each other in the way the game is built. Each side mission in this game is uniquely designed to be entertaining in their own special way, whether it be making a good luck charm for your sister or by being hired by a famous otaku to fight gothic lolitas in broad daylight with the sole intent to strip their clothes off (who cares about story when you can do this instead, am I right?)\n\nB-B-Back to the combat system, it's a bit over simplified to the point whether it be pros or newcomers have no trouble being either offensive or defensive in combat. You fight by pressing Q (or LB on controller) to enter combat mode then by either pressing A, B & Y (controller) or (for example 4, 5 & 6 on PC, all up to what you bind them to) and block with one button in my case E, (or by pressing RB while using a controller) if a foe tries to attack you and you hold E (or RB) you will automatically dodge the attack and you'll be able to counterattack by pressing either 4, 5 & 6 (or A B & Y) shortly after dodging.\n\nThe only attacks which are deemed unavoidable are power attacks (you'll recognize them while playing through the game), to dodge them you simply press W, A, S or D or (UP, LEFT, DOWN or RIGHT on your controller) while holding E (or RB) to side-step their attack. Don't be fooled by the combat system and think otherwise, despite the relatively easy combat system it's one of the most enjoyable games I've experienced.\n\nTL;DR: Hold one button to dodge, hold one button to fix equipment, press 3 buttons to attack/combo - it's so easy even Mashiro could do it! (please don't hate me for this)\n\nReplay Value (8/10)\n\nComing close to an end here, that last paragraph probably left many wondering if I'm trying to review the game or if I'm trying to give you tips... oh whatever it's up to you. Since this is what you might call a pretty simple game in terms of "mechanics" I would still say that the game overall has an astounding replay value, even if I wouldn't have mentioned it you'd need to replay the game at least 4-5 times to actually complete every route of the game (plus for every route that you complete you gain new unlockables and equipment for both you and your "companions") so I'd recommend replaying the game just for that sole reason.\n\nThe quickest I've played through the game without doing any side quests would be about 3 hours and 20 minutes, with all the side quests I'd estimate an amount of 8-13 hours of gameplay depending on how quick and efficient you are (without doing the side quests you're missing out on a lot, just saying).\n\nEstimated amount of gameplay (including extras, side quests & others): 20~40 hours\n\nExtra\n\n>Having a strip combo of 7+ will queue a combo finisher which will make foe's panties drop if completed\n>Max equipment stats are 999\n>Hold Q to fix equipment (Hold LB with a controller)\n>There are about 50+ side missions\n>There are about 15 main missions +/- depending on route\n>You can customize other characters after completing their respected routes\n>Nana best girl\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis review is not very critical towards general gameplay/graphic mishaps as well as I don't really care too much about the 30 FPS cap since it's playable and it's unlockable, overall giving this game a 7/10 even though others may think otherwise.\n\nI would definitely love to witness a remake of this game for the next gen consoles as well as on PC, let's wrap this up with a big old PANTSU~","December 26, 2015","true","274.6"," 114 of 136 people (84%) found this review helpful 96 people found this review funny","84","114","136","96","9"

Don't be an elitest scum and argue about using only keyboard and mouse on pc. Just use a freakin' controller. That aint hard, yo.\n\nThe port works just fine as well.

It's really good, I mean you're in a place that's all about animes and video games, stripping people in fighting, you got a little sister that's your "onii-chan" there, a childhood friend that's a badass (and keeps saving your ♥♥♥ in the past), a girl that saved your ♥♥♥ (which also has a--whoops! that's a spoiler right there, my bad.) I mean if that's not a good beat em up/Visual Novel like anime game with a "What the ♥♥♥♥ am I playing" storyline, then I don't know what is!\n\nFor the PC version: I like the feature of customizing the visual screen of the game. Really nice touch. I was mostly comfortable with Vita-like controls, so I recommend using a controller instead of keyboard and mouse. To my surprise, XSeed actually put all the clothes and weapons add-ons from the Playstation version into the PC version already...so you can say they "XSeed-ed" my expectation. The catch is that you need to beat the game to unlock Dejiko (Di Gi Charate), Sonico (Mascot for Nitroplus), Potami and Potaru (Mascots for M), Taiyo Tenkawa (Tokyo Toy Box), and Susanna Hopkins (Genshiken). Another thing they fixed was some of the side missions. In the Playstation version, there were bugs that prevented you to finish the mission, but they fixed it here.\n\nIn conclusion all I can say is this: " I spent 100+ hours on this game on the Playstation 3 and the PS Vita. And I will so, as hell, do it again on Steam. "","June 19, 2015","true","441.0"," 51 of 61 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","51","61","12","0"

So what I'll offer is the more techical negatives this game suffers from first.\n\nThe biggest problems with Akiba's Trip is that the game is quite easy, especially once you max out your equipment although on the hardest difficulty setting (Otaku Mode), even with maxed out items the game can still be a challenge if you don't plan your attacks, and learn how to counter effectively especially when your enemies can do juggle attacks which completely prevent you from dodging/blocking or escaping.\n\nAnother problem, fortunately it doesn't really appear until you play the game on higher difficulty settings such as Gamer and Otaku mode is that during major fights, the view can become blocked by scenery or the entire viewpoint can shift completely.\n\nEverything else about the game though is positive,  their are many different endings - a huge amount of character customization, lots of different and wacky weapons to use although, a few weapons are a bit overpowered.   The story and character design is very good, alot of emotional scenes and interesting areas of Akihabara to discover.\n\nPros\n\nGreat character customization\nTons of items to collect\nTons of weapons\nGreat Story\nGreat Location\nFun and humorous battles\nBased on Akihabara\nReal Life Ad Flyers to read\n\nCons\n\nSlightly too easy\nViewpoint can shift in the heat of battle\nEnemies can do frustrating juggle attacks\nEnemies have near perfect evasion on higher difficulty settings","May 31, 2015","true","41.7"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","39","49","2","0"

If you want that sort of "satisfaction" you're better off playing Hunie Pop.\n\nWith that out of the way I will say that when I initially saw the game I was skeptical, but when a friend of mine (who I might add gave me the game as a gift) told me the premise of the game, I realized that this was for me.\nWhat exactly was that realization? The fact that I have the ability, to punch someone so hard, their clothes come flying right off of them. I myself have watched a few animes (but am in no way an "Anime Otaku") and am rather surprised by the fact that this trope hasn't exactly been executed as much. I think I've only watched like 3 out of roughly like 12 animes that did this, so the fact I am able to play a game that does this and is basically the entire premise of the game (to strip the clothes off your enemies in the most rediculous and awesome ways possible) I was sold the minute I had my first real official battle in the game.\n\nThe game's battle system moves fairly well and has a similar counter mechanic to like that of maybe the Arkum Series (block attack and then immediately counter), there are a ton of weapons you can use at your disposal each with different combos and also different "Strip Animations" you can obtain in the game's Battle Arena that get more epic and rediculous with each unlock. The story is, oddly enough, a somewhat refreshing storyline, where you have been turned into some sort of superhuman and must fight off manmade energy sucking vampires called "Synthisters" which must be defeated by exposing their flesh to the sunlight, which means you've got to beat the ever daylights out of them until you're capable of ripping (or actually safely removing) their clothes off. Some of the characters do feel a little one-dimensional, but the more interesting characters (like your little sister whom you must love with all your heart!!!) keep the story fresh and entertaining. The English Dubbing is not bad either, at first I was skeptical given the female protagonist's uncanny Raven-esque tone of voice felt off at first, but I've gotten use to it and her personality starts to make more sense as you learn about her (no spoilers here).\nThe game is grindy, but this is one of those games that doesn't get boring at all, every battle feels like one of your favorite slice-of-life anime fights that ends in some rediculous way, and with the different strip animations you can obtain along with the dozen of weapons available, you'll be entertained for quite sometime.\n\nAs stated at the beginning, this is not a Hentai game, nor should be approached as such. While you can probably get your kicks with ripping off Female clothing like a crazed sex-offender, but if you want your full pleasure, this game isn't going to give that to you, so please, for the sake of everyone, don't try to go that far. :\\n\nOverall, with a fun combat system, fantastic soundtrack, and amazing feel for Japan's lively city of Akihabara, this is a game I'm pretty sure will keep you thoughourly entertained for hours to come.","September 16, 2015","true","32.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","1"

Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed is not that kind of game. Rather, it is a goofy, utterly silly romp that never takes itself, the entire JRPG genre or otaku culture seriously. Also not recommended if you're a prissy prude who thinks showing underwear is more morally reprehensible than blowing people's heads apart.\n\n\n\nThe Long of It: Akiba's Trip is the story of Nanashi, a young man who wastes his time watching anime DVDs and hoarding figurines. His life of couch-potatoism comes to an end when he is turned into a Synthister, a type of vampire-alike who drain people's life force and dissolve in the sun. He is rescued from the evil bad guy's laboratory by Shizuku, and together with her and his loser otaku friends, Nanashi sets out to bring justice to the creators of the Synthisters.\n\nThe Synthisters' weakness defines the way they should be battled, since they protect themselves from the sunlight by wearing clothes. Why they don't simply walk around only at night is a mystery. Regardless, their weakness and immunity to physical punishment means Nanashi has to defeat them by exposing them to the sunlight... by, yes, ripping off their clothes. Now, this may sound like it's a petty excuse for fanservices, and yes, it is - but the game's entire tone and atmosphere is a parody on JRPG's, and this whole setup fits the mood perfectly.\n\nAlso pretty nifty is that XSeed have actually modeled the game world after Akihabara (Japan's nerd capital) faithfully, and the enviroments can stand the comparison with actual Akihabara, right down to the shops and businesses, all exactly the same and in the exact same location as real-life Akiba. It adds a lot of spirit to a game to know that it's set in an actual city.\n\n\n\nThe Right of It: Akiba's Trip makes no excuses about being nerdy, silly and just the right amounts of lame, and its whole comical setup is delivered in all aspects, not just the storyline and characters, but the weapons, the techniques, the combat animations, the entire thing is just made for goofy fun. Nanashi is anything but a fighting man, and his attacks are clumsy and dorky, and always funny to watch, as are those of his enemies. Almost every weapon has a unique set of animations, and a lot of the fun in this game is just beating your opponents over the head while wielding a giant leek, a collection box, cheerleader's pompoms, a kebab stick or any of the other ridiculous weapons. The stripping animations, too, are full of goofiness and anime and video game references.\n\nWhen fighting Synthisters, you can involve just about any passerby in the battle just by hitting them a few times. With some persistent aggression, you can turn a one-on-one battle into a full-on mass brawl where everyone rips everyone's clothes off. Few things are quite as satisfying.\n\n\n\nThe Wrong of It: Akiba's Trip's humour may not be to everyone's taste. People who want serious games should definitely abstain, and the effect might not resonate with people not really familiar with JRPGs.\n\nAs said before, the combat and game system is more attuned to silliness than it is to balanced and challenging gameplay, so don't expect the polished combat you'll find in other action games, don't expect to play a game that is 'easy to learn and difficult to master' - it is not that kind of game. The difficulty, too, isn't made for forehead-knotting challenges, but simply for good hilarious fun.\n\nMany people will also claim the game is short, and it can be - you can finish the entire story in two hours if you rush - but those people are simply playing the game wrong. The game's intention is not to let you do side quests until you're ready to take on the Big Bad, the side missions are simply meant to be done for the fun of doing them. So don't rush through it and then complain the game is short.\n\n\n\nThe Last of It: Don't think this is a game for perverts or people with ♥♥♥♥ fantasies. If you play it, you'll see that it's really no heavier on the fanservice than 'normal' JPRGs, and that the whole stripping thing is more funny than it is pervy. Definitely give it a miss if JRPGs aren't your kind of game, or if you're looking for a spectacular, smoothly playing and hair trigger-responsive beat-'em-up. Pass on this one if you like spending your time on tumblr whining and crying about misogyny and the patriarchy.\n\nDo give it a try if you think you'll like a game that makes fun of all the JRPG and anime tropes and approaches fanservice and otaku fetishes in a humorous way.","May 6","true","35.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","22","24","7","7"

I would have never thought of Vampire related game that involves stripping people (lol) but I think it is fresh and very well thought of.\n\nStory & Missions: I loved it. I think the story is very good through out the play.\nI just wish there was Kati's True End and REAL Sister's Route (SISCON ALERT)\nIf you are playing this multiple times the first 25% of the missions feels repetitive.\nSide missions are very good and not boring *FEW OF THEM ARE PRETTY HARD*\n*I ALSO EXPECTED THERE TO BE SECRET END WITH MALE NPC WHEN YOU DON'T CHOOSE ANY ROUTE BUT THERE'S NONE. JUST SAYING.*\n\nBosses: Ah... They are way to easy. Really easy even on Hardest difficulty. when you and your gal gets maxed out weapons and do unison attack, the bosses are piece of cake. (HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THEY ARE EASIER THAN SOME MOBS)\n\nWeapons and Customizations: Fantastic. Lots of ways to customize you and you can even customize NPCs which I love the most about this game! A lot of weapons can be used too!\nOnly problem with weapons I would choose is that on Hardest Difficulty, you don't get to pick much other weapons since you sorta need weapons with high speed and wide attack radius and range which makes Heavy weapons garbage..(I loved them and only used them on first play through)\n\nCombat System: It is pretty okay considering if you are average (have fun) player but if you are hardcore gamer (UNLOCK ALL THINGS AND BECOME GOD TIER IN EVERYGAME POSSIBLE), the combat system becomes quite annoying later on.\nThe A.I. Dodging is real pain in the ♥♥♥ when you play this game with HARDEST difficulty. (They mind read you and dodge most of your attacks BUT WELL I GUESS THAT IS WHY IT IS HARDEST DIFFICULTY)\nIt is easy 1vs1 or 1vs2 (yeah including your partner) but when it becomes 1 vs Multiple enemies, it feels like your Partner doesn't do much...\nIt gets annoying when they can dodge most of your attacks and you don't even get to dodge while getting hit by them.Unless you block the first attack from the enemy it is almost impossible to dodge next attacks since you become *Struggled* (there is even Record for how many time you press buttons when you are in *Struggled* status) **This excludes when enemy is using slow two handed weapons or heavy weapons.\nOne of the problems is that the counter attacks seem iffy sometimes because they don't even hit when enemies get into attack motion while you are counter attacking.\nAnother problem would be targeting. When you are fighting against multiple enemies you cannot target lock on one target and it keeps switching targets. Wish you could use R2 or L2 buttons to switch targets!\n\nWell the combat review was just me QQing and whining about the things that I found hard... so don't take it seriously because I still had fun and still having fun playing this game on Hardest difficulty!\n:D\n\n\nOverall I love this game and I enjoy playing it!\n\n\n\nbtw if you wanna have real challenge\nplay this game on Hardest difficulty\ntaking Shion's Route while doing all Side missions & Battle Arena\nand doing secret sister route all at the same time","June 17, 2015","true","46.3"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","68","50","74","37","1"

Aside from a few cringe worthy references here and there which I imagine aren't in the original japanese translation, the game ultimately feels like a love letter to otaku culture and isn't afraid to poke fun at it or deconstruct it briefly in the meantime; I swear while reading pitter in this game that I somehow found my way back to a chan website in the middle of the game.\n\nYou can tell this game was made on a budget since some side missions are re used by the end of the game with merely an increase in difficulty and a different reward and the story is presented to you via Visual Novel like appearance. On top of this, the combat system is a bit repetitive but when you think of it more like a turn based RPG with brawler elements with a heavy emphasis on crowd control instead of a brawler with RPG elements, it makes a lot more sense within it's context that it'd have repetitive animation as turn based RPGs usually do.\n\nAkiba's Trip is still a genuinely enjoyable experience though if you're into JRPGs as a whole, however. The writing is often flippant, witty and also intentionally campy; Just reading item descriptions is an enjoyable experience in this game. The characters are likeable (Except for Rin although she gets some redemption in the game), there's a lot of custimization, even down to the color pallete of the game itself and what animations your partner uses.\n\nThere's not a lot as utterly hilarious as giving your partner a thug walk/idle animation and having them follow you around starting ♥♥♥♥ with random synthisters, which are the antagonists of this game. Basically the reason you have to strip the clothes off of your enemies is because they're vampires of a unique brand who will burn up in the sun only when their clothes are removed.\n\nIf you like stuff in this vein, I.E. stuff like Persona or Yakuza, or you like visual novels and or immersive Playstation 2-era JRPGs then you'll like akiba's trip. If you can't stand things like anime archetypes, even though they're presented more subtly here you probably you won't like this game.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a decent 7.50/10, my first playthrough doing every side quest I could see took me about 35 hours. The game's worth your time if you like JRPGs or just colorful light hearted settings. And besides, this game is previously a playstation exclusive; Having it come to PC is kind of a big deal, I just wish it wasn't locked at 30 fps. I forgive it though because it's supposed to be emulating an anime art style, and that ♥♥♥♥'s usually at 24.\n\nI plan on doing more than one playthrough because it has NG+ in it and there are different routes to pursue in typical VN fashion.","May 31, 2015","true","36.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

So much fun, sort of a GTA3 style anime game. The graphics are much like a PS2 or PSP game. Honestly I think its an intended art style. Its very story driven and if you give the wrong choices you die. The missions are quite entertaining. Characters are charming. And what jRPG is complete without a crafting system. You buy things like clothes and have your little sister make armor. Its a relatively simple game with a small map, but has a lot of replayability due to many missions. Chain attacks are pretty easy to pull off by pressing the button onscreen. Overall a pretty fun game and if you fancy pulling peoples clothes off in public, this is a must have.","April 30","true","5.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","2"

No complaints. The frame rate is not amazing but the console version never did any better, and the PC version can handle four times the people crowding the streets.\n\nI've played this extensively on the PS3 so what follows is my experience from that.\n\nPart love letter to otaku culture and Akihabara, part goofy comedy, with a dash of Yakuza and Gladiator Begins, Akiba's Trip is hard to describe easily. A loving recreation of Japan's nerdiest district, trying, not always successfully, to imbue it with a sense of wonder and mystery, with all the sorts of crazy characters you might expect to see in such a place, from overwrought lolitas to tsundere idols to obsessed otakus to goofy foreigners excited to drink in the culture. The nonstop ads for animes, video games, and the like providing the background noise as you wander the streets. The worldcraft is not as good as GTA or Yakuza, but there's something to like about this virtual Akihabara.\n\nThe actual gameplay is just as charming, and just as rough around the edges. It's an action-RPG beat-em-up where you aim to damage an opponent's clothes enough to tear them off. While there is not a lot of skill to the system, your weapons always hit with a satisfying thunk, thwack, or clank, and most combats involve you trying to weaken every enemy's clothes to set up for a massive chain strip, which gives the combat a satisfying meta-game where the simple guards, counters, and guard breaks don't otherwise provide much to go with. Naturally, you want to collect every type of clothing and weapon you can to fill out those collectible books.\n\nSide-quests, exploration, multiple endings based on which girl you end up with, the game is quite short but meant to be replayed. The difficulties then are built more around your level gear than your own skill, but the game exercises one bit of brilliance here: Your XP is reset each game. So you can always redo a low difficulty without being overpowered play just by shelving your overpowered 999 weapons and clothes and crafting up something from scratch again, whereas if you need to take on the high difficulties, you can always whip out the good gear again.\n\nIf you have a heart that likes charming, unpretentious, and goofy anime schlock, you should enjoy Akiba's Trip.","May 26, 2015","true","1.3"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","26","38","0","0"

I really would.\n\nIt's quirky, full of references and content geared towards your average weeb.\nIts gameplay is clunky, but satisfying. With its only problem being that difficulty comes from annoyance and higher numbers rather than mechanical challenge.\n\nIt's a neat little game that even if it won't suprise you with its collection of outfits, will with the weird - although very categorical - weapons.\n\nAll normal professional reviewers would just look at this game and go "lol japan" and try to be a comedian. Completely missing the fun of the self-deprecating story about shut-in NEETs, and the ability to beat people with a Neptunia Hugpillow and use consumables like Transformation Belts. You get a qt imouto that uses "bro" puns. Different unlockable fighting styles can have you rocking Jojo poses after a strip. All as you become a famed hero of Akiba, and visit maid cafes.\nThere's just a lot you'll miss if this game isn't made for you, and you can tell whether or not it is by looking at it. As long as your info isn't coming from some reviewer flexing his massive normie peen for comedic purposes.\n\nThe problem is - as a port - it's a mess. This game is a port of the PS4 upgrade of Akiba's Trip 2. Which is an upgrade of a PS3 game. This game, as a game, lacking a few features and polish, can be played on a Vita. Yet I can barely play it. It is so poorly optimised that its recommended system specs are higher than a PS4.\nWhether your games runs perfectly can be entirely random, and seemingly not indicative of rig.\nA game made of small areas seperated by brief loading screens, where NPCs fade into existence should not cause screentear, and freeze my game every hour and a half.\n\nAt least it's a friendly freeze. Depending on if the game's custom anti-aliasing is on or off, for me it either full out crashes, with "has stopped responding", or just freezes the game with the music and sound effects clearly playing on loop. Even with the window easily closed without problem, the sound continues until I open my task manager and manually end the process.\n\nI admit, I don't have a computer with the recommended specs, but people who have analysed them can easily tell you how bloated they are. A GTX 760 does not need 4GB VRAM. Looking around, people have even said that the 760 was even designed with 2GB VRAM in mind.\nI do have way above the minimum though with a GTX 660, and for a game where you have to be within 5 meters of an NPC for them to phase into existence I hardly think I'm pressing my luck by having that draw distance at maximum.","June 17, 2015","false","27.4"," 62 of 104 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","62","104","5","0"

The story is great, and the humor and references are always fun. The stripping (combat) is done relatively well. There's tons of costumes (and underwear) to dress you and your partners in. It's not a typical JRPG by any means; it's all about fun. When you can always occupy yourself with fun sidequests, there isn't that much of a grind. Once you get through your first playthrough, it's pretty much smooth sailing from there (unless you play on Otaku mode, which I don't suggest unless you have maxed out gear).\n\nThere's a huge variety of weapons, most of which aren't real weapons. Toys, computer parts, umbrellas, hug pillows, figurines, and much more. It's just another thing that gives the game its unique appeal. Even after 4+ playthroughs, I didn't discover all the weapons in the game... somehow. There's always new stuff to find, which gives the game great replayability value. You can use a Hyperdimension Neptunia dakimakura as a weapon, 'nuff said.\n\n\nI only have two complaints about this game:\n\n1. It's capped to 30fps. Don't get me wrong, it looks perfectly fine the way it is, but it *could* look better (especially in terms of texture resolution, but that's to be expected of a Vita port). There's guides on how to get it up to 60fps, but it makes the fighting buggy to the point where it's almost unplayable... and for me, it's not a stable 60fps, so it's just not doable. The game relies on real-time combat, so if I can't properly see what's going on, I'm dead. And that brings me to the second problem:\n\n2. If you get surrounded, you're screwed. It can happen even if you're using the most OP sword in the game you get after you finish your first playthrough: you're going to be hit multiple times a second, your clothes are going to lose tons of durability, and you'll have a ton of trouble escaping. Jumping doesn't do anything, so you'll be constantly knocked to the ground until you're lucky enough to push a bunch of people back at once. It becomes a huge problem in late-game fights, and it forces me to constantly use attacks that knock enemies down, which makes the fights take a lot longer. Thankfully, the healing mechanic allows you to recover, assuming you can find a spot to hide in for about 3 seconds.\n\n2.5. This makes blocking useless most of the time. If you block attacks from one person, others will start to attack, and the moment you let go of the block button, you're likely to get knocked back. I got through all routes without ever blocking for this reason. The counterattack achievement (for blocking and then retaliating) is one of the few achievements I don't have for this game because of that.\n\n\nOther than that, the game is great. I highly recommend it. Just make sure to play with a controller and with Japanese audio. My suggested playthrough order is: Tohko, Shizuku, Rin, Shion. Nana's bonus route/ending can be achieved with each of them. You don't have to take a bath with her for it, but I suggest that too.","October 12, 2015","true","59.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

This is my first review, so please be patient, yeah?\n\nAnyway, first up, I want to say this game is awesome. Pure awesomeness. Well, for someone that watches anime and reads manga, it's an awesome game. If you don't, it might be hard to enjoy, but it'll be fun nonethelesss.\n\nFirst up is the game mechanics. It combines a visual novel with an open world game successfully. The action is easy and fun (sometimes it gets really hard with the juggle attacks and constant doding on the higher difficulties, especially Otkau), and the partner system is decent. It could be worked on more, and you only have one type of partner combo for each person that you can patrol with. The English voice acting actually has decent lip sync, and the voices first the characters perfectly (the MC doesn't talk much, only when you die is when I've heard him talk).\n\nSadly, that's all there is for the good stuff. The story could have been worked on. There aren't many main missions, but there are multiple endings which may make up for it (haven't finished them all). You get flooded with side missions, and if you don't complete them, you get flooded with in-game emails telling you to complete them. The combat system was poorly done with only a few different ways to attack (I know this was a PS Vita game at first) and the port to the PC was absolutely terrible. It's kind of impossible to play without a controller.\n\nOver all, I'd give it a 10/10, because I don't really pay attention to the negatives. I just run around stripping manmade vampires of their clothes with my baes Shizuku and Rin. And it's pretty fun. So go buy it if you're a die hard anime fan!","June 12, 2015","true","38.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I had never played a game like this and the concept of stripping people as the main form of combat sounded a bit too weird to me. In the end I decided to purchase it because I am a fan of anime art style, and boy am I glad that I did.\n\nAkiba's Trip is set in Tokyo's Akihabara district, also known as the holy land for otaku worldwide. In the game, you travel back and forth between accurately reconstructed areas of Akiba. Although the game is not totally free roam, like say, Skyrim, it felt much more alive and populated as NPC tourists, high school students, fanboys, lolitas and more travel through the various zones. Billboards broadcast anime and gaming adverts, there are many shops, and you can even receive flyers for real life places in Akihabara.\n\nThe combat of the game is ridiculously fun and addictive (a controller is highly recommended). Your enemies in the game are synthesisters (more or less man-made vampires), so of course it makes sense to strip them in daylight instead of using something more practical like a wooden stake or crossbow, right? Right?? Anyway, you target the enemies' legs, torsos and heads during combat, using one of a multitude of upgradeable weapons, and then when you have done enough damage, tear their clothes off. Clothes act as armour and you can dress however you want, as well as you can upgrade your favourite clothes.\n\nThe game even has its own version of twitter, where you can read tweets and be immersed in otaku internet culture. You also have an email system with useful info that gets sent to you, and the occasional laugh from some of them. For more immersion, the game's version of a character hideout or base is a nice internet cafe where you can play arcade games.\n\nLastly, the replayibility of this game is superb. After finishing the main storyline once (oh yes, and there are tons of sidequests to enjoy), there is a new game plus mode where you can unlock new difficulties, as well as character models and multiple new endings to discove as your responses to certain girls will determine which ending you get. it's also worth noting that you get to keep your previous gear when starting again.\n\nI would highly recommend Akiba's Trip. The game is highly customisable, addictive and has a unique atmosphere. Just make sure you try the free demo before buying the game to make sure there are no major technical issues. 10/10","November 15, 2015","true","50.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elvendragonrider/recommended/333980/","elvendragonrider","{MeTaL}Alucard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elvendragonrider/","833 products in account","(Steam didn't record my 7-8 hours of offline play, how rude.)\n\n\nSo to start off here, this game was on my wishlist for a long time, since it was released on steam if memory serves correct. I received $20 for christmas, and was between buying either AKIBA'S TRIP, or Rocket League. I am so happy I chose this one. This game was a lot of fun from the get go. I got into it for the "combat" aspect, and stayed for the awesome story. I only had a chance to play this for about a hour initially, afterward it was all I could think about. I wanted more, I hungered for the story. I wish I was more of a writer so that I could give this a proper review. Alas, I'm not.\n\nWhen I went to purchase Akiba's Trip I was initially worried about the 30 fps frame lock. As soon as I got in, I found this to have been a silly thing to worry about. The game doesn't look bad in 30 fps. I'm used to playing games in 60 fps on my rig, and while yes it is nice, I really didn't notice the frame lock in it. I had a few issues with the game starting up, but once it was running, nothing happened to it. I found this in my case the game didn't appreciate being in fullscreen, but would run just fine in windowed mode. Not a very big drawback in my book.\n\nCombat was fun for most of the game, but it tended to get a little boring at parts, though it was intense. Essentially you brawl with the enemies and attack three regions: the head, torso, and legs. Each region has its own health and when you damage it enough, you are then able to strip the enemy of their clothing in that region. At a certain point in the game you gain the ability to "chain strip". When you strip an enemy of an article of clothing, if there is more enemies that have clothing that is ready to come off, you get a button you have to push. If you push that correct button, you move to the next target and remove that piece of clothing. This chain can go up to somewhere around 10 (don't quote me on that) consecutive strips before your character does a special move where you press an extra button, and something "good" happens. I'll leave that part for you boys and girls to find out on your own.\n\nCustomization in this game is fun, you can customize all of your clothing, items, and weapons all the way down to what underwear you are using. You are allowed to see your partner's equipment from the get go, but you aren't allowed to do anything with it until maybe halfway into the story. I went from wearing a boring T-shirt and jeans to a military uniform at the end of the game. The possibilities are endless. Well, as endless as you can get anyway.\n\nI played this game in English, and the voice acting was actually rather good. I didn't spot any translation hiccups throughout it, except for the ones that were purposely done. Though I was rather tired while playing most of the game. The voices picked for the characters was spot on in my opinion, someone needed to be shy sounding, they sounded shy. Someone needed to sound smart, they sounded smart.\n\nStory...story. Difficult one to approach withough giving spoilers, but if I had to put a general description on it... It would be halfway your typical run of the mill save the world story, and half a sci fi romantic thriller. Or something like that. I don't wanna go into too much detail, but It's like: boy is kidnapped, girl rescues boy, boy helps girl fight supernatural monsters that want to terrorize city. I don't describe it as very appealing do I? It's one story that had me engrossed the whole time, so they obviously did something right, as I'm a bit of a stickler on stories. If I'm willing to go through all the trouble to play through all the routes in this game, I'm hooked. Speaking of, there is 5 different routes you can take in this game, sorta like a VN but, more engaging.\n\nAs for actually playing this game, I would HIGHLY recommend a controller. I didn't try it out with the mouse and keyboard, but just from the few times I moved the mouse or accidently pressed a button, I imagine it would be a nightmare.\n\nAs for an overall rating for this game, I would give a solid 9/10. Had the combat been just a bit more......exciting (?) I would have given it a 10/10. I am currently in my second round of playing the game and plan on getting the whole way through all five routes. Geez, I made a bit of an essay didn't I, whoopsies. In the end, if I had to pay for this game again, I definately would, even at the full price.\n\ntl;dr: You really should take the time to read what someone works hard on to write, but if you have a controller (or not), like anime, and enjoy beating people up and/or stealing their clothes, go for it!","December 29, 2015","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","2"

I was so wrong.\n\n*note: at the end of the review, I can teach ONE POWERFUL TRICK YOU CAN LEARN THAT CAN BASICALLY CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT GAME\n\n1. 10/10 Fast Travel\nAt the first few minutes, I didn't know there was a fast travel option, and so I thought, "Basically I'm playing anime skyrim and strolling through this concrete jungle." Well, in fact, traveling actually feels like Skyrim to me (aside from the frequent loading screens).\n\n2. 10/10 Cute girls with routes\nIsn't this every virgi-- I mean, every otaku gamer's dream? No need to explain. Choose a girl and make her your waifu.\n\n3. 10/10 Dress-Up game you can buy for 20$\nYou can make Shizuku dress up like a hipster. Or Tohko like a nun. Or much better, you can make your little sister dress like a colorful french maid carrying an anti-material sniper rifle on her back.\n\n4. 10/10 Mob system\nI should be doing missions. Instead, I'm picking up fights everywhere and stripping people in public. This is basically what this game is about.\n\n5. 10/10 Immense replay value\nFinishing the game once will make you hungry for more. Trust me. I haven't slept for days and I'm still trying to dress up every single girl like a maid. And upgrading my Kebab sword.\n\nLastly, here's the trick. There's no crouch/prone command in the gameplay (you can't use it in combat anyway), but when you press [LB] when in scan mode in camera, it allows you to crouch (or prone?), allowing you to see from a lower height. Now you can look up the skirts of any girl you can find and determine the color of their panties.","June 30, 2015","true","14.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","7","9","7","0"

Then, you want to beat those parts to the point where you can strip it off the person to defeat them. Of course, those stripped clothing parts can be yours to claim.\n\n\nMany people said the game is short for about 6hrs, but it took me 20hrs before I finish my first playhthrough. Maybe if you went straight up doing the main missions only, I guess it'll take you about that short of time. I guess collecting is the main charm of this game, where you want to collect them all clothings and weapons. Most of them are obtainable from stripping off random streetwalkers, although some are only available through side missions. Many of the items initial stats are low, but you can power them up by fusing them with items you're not using.\nThere is a NewGame+ where you can carry over your previously finished progress and opened up new bonuses. Difficulties also matters in this game, since some clothings only appear in higher difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grableg/recommended/333980/","Grableg","Ugraum Grableg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grableg/","372 products in account","I don't really know where to start with this game.  The port is a little shabby, framerate locked at 30, limited options, some crashing issues, but passable.\nThe real issue is just that Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is a hot mess.  The developers seem to insist on having knowledge that videogames exist, what with the real ads for other jrpgs playing on the TVs in the game world constantly, the painful self-referential dialogue, the story right off of tvtropes.com/anime, but at the same time it feels like they've never actually played one before.\n\nThe combat system is clunky, and seems to ignore all the progress video games have made up to this point.  You are locked into attack strings, sidestepping exists but is almost functionally worthless, locking on (and the camera is general) is very messy, and the AI leaves a hell of a lot to be desired.  The combat will generally boil down to button mashing or counter spamming until you get smashed by some dishonest unblockable hitbox or gangbang, goading you to run away and heal, rinse and repeat.  The combat could have been much less hollow and unenjoyable with a few simple tweaks like being able to cancel attack strings with blocks/sidesteps, perfect parries, some i-frames on the evades, and other general stuff that almost every beat em up and stylish action game that exists in this day and age has.  It feels almost like the expectation was that the game's lackluster combat systems would be carried by the premise that instead of beating up people you are ripping up their clothes, and instead of normal game weapons you are using wacky, random everyday objects.\n\nSimilar to The World Ends with You, the setting for Akiba's Trip is a real place in Japan (the Akihabara district in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo), and the game insists on giving you a virtual tour of the place at any chance they get.  NPCs will hand out flyers in-game of real life businesses in the area and the game constantly dotes on the place to the point where how awesome it is and how many otakus hang out there becomes a core point in the plot.  I was very suprised to see the game was made by a real game development studio and not the Akihabara Tourist Information Center.\n\nThe game presents you with the surprisingly common 'potentially global serious issue that only these teenagers right here can solve', and a cast of varied, boring, stupid, and inconsistent characters to play around with.  You'll meet such memorable mainstays as\n'little sister that regularly reminds you how adorable she is and hints at liking you a little too much but that's not weird at all because we're sick people'\n'girl visiting japan from finnland with no accent speaking fluent japanese minus an issue she made once when they introduce the character to make it believable that one time'\n'magical sisters that look like they aren't of legal age but because of that magic they're actually like 500 years old so it's ok to bang them or look at their panties or whatever'\n'cool old guy that isn't like all the other adults'\n'guy who plays a lot of video games and watches a lot of anime (just like us!) that can apply that knowledge to the inexplicable real-life-definitely-not-anime scenario we're in right now'\n'self-depricating pasty anime loving protagonist that's supposed to be a thinly-veiled jab at you the player for some cheap jokes and maybe a little self-insertion masturbatory fantasy if you're really that far gone'\nand definitely a couple others that defy my desire to keep this tired bit going.  Basically if you really do like this anime stuff you'll know all of these rascals from somewhere else and I assume it'll provide you with the equivalent thrill of seeing Brad Pitt in yet another movie.\n\nOne of my biggest peeves with Akiba's Trip was the writing, which scaled from 'we can all have a nice laugh at the expense of how bad this is' to 'I'm in physical pain at the realization that people have previously, are currently, and will continue to pay real money for the experience this moment is encompassed by'.  When i say the writing, I mean all of it- the plot structure, the dialogue, the quest logs, the item descriptions, ♥♥♥♥ing PITTER. It's similar in a sense to Borderlands 2- the game feels like it's just been written by a person with a bad, juvenile sense of humor and the inability to really express themself eloquently, like they're the kind of person that shouldn't be a writer.  In the case of Akiba's Trip it's an issue that goes beyond mediocre localization, you can really tell that the core game was plagued with inconsistent tone, an attachment to lazy 4th wall jokes, and a script made by a bunch of guys at the office getting blindfolded and throwing darts at an anime conventions bingo card.  When the player is presented with dialogue choices you get the formulaic Renegade, Paragon, or Completely Stupid Joke Answer triplets. Occasionally you're met with the classic Visual Novel choices of Girl A, Girl B, or Girl C assumedly to pad her favor for a chance at her unique ending.  Since you're a teenager your game's menu is replaced by a smartphone, and menu options are replaced by APPs.  You have a camera phone, you receive quest-related details and spam in your email inbox, and you can read up on current events in some hellish twitter-equivalent called Pitter.  Pitter does a really good job at summarizing what I can't stand about the writing in this game.  Feeding your player backstory by giving them fresh perspective via comment-board archetypes is incredibly lazy, it's a parody of the lowest common denominator.  From the very moment the game starts the player gets reminded that he has an unhealthy obsession with anime figurines and he never has sex.  A few hours of nerd-bashing later the game tries to put you into a 'real' anime story about super vampires sucking the life out of people and it's just so surrounded by ridiculous parodic humor and butt/boob jokes at that point that it's insulting to the player that anything is presented with a hint of seriousness.\n\nFrom what I could tell, all the sidequests in this game are like that one sidequest in other games where you go to fetch something but it ends up being somewhere else three or four times, causing you to run around to multiple locations to pad out game time for very little effort on the developer's part.  I did the first nine or so sidequests before coming to the realization that they were all stupid and hollow and a lot more fetch-y than your average video game sidequests.  They're also all just a means to get more money, which has very little purpose since the stores sell a lot of redundant garbage- once you buy one new weapon and a set of clothes you're done for the course of the entire game unless you want to get really min/maxey.  Also one of my sidequests expired because the passage of time is tied to furthering the main quest and the place I had to turn in the side quest was where the main quest was and the main quest always takes priority when entering a zone so I had no choice but to fail the side quest in an attempt to complete the side quest.  It's all very headache-inducing.\n\nThere's also just loads of poorly-explained oddities and minor issues that I have with the game outside of the core issues that aren't really worth talking about, they just all add up to an unpleasant game experience.  I just played through the game asking myself when I would have fun.  Am I tired of the 20 second super attack animation yet?  Is the drop system supposed to make any sense?  Does there need to be six numbered versions of the same store on the same street that each only sell four or five items instead of just one big store?  Why am I prompted to start New Game+ before I even finish my playthrough?  What are the redeeming qualities of this game?\n\nI really went into this game looking forward to an interesting beat em up with some unique mechanics, it just turned out to kinda suck.","May 27, 2015","false","13.8"," 178 of 342 people (52%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","52","178","342","28","14"

In this cheeky but innocent beat-them-up-and-rip-their-clothes-off JRPG, you'll be taking the role of <Insert your name here>, a Freedom Fighter with the most adorable-and-easiest-to-hate little sister known to all of Japan, with THE BEST Bro-puns known to mankind. Manmade vampires called Synthesisers sucks the vitality out of the civilians and its your job to get to the bottom of this. By your side, the trio of Striptism stands valiantly by, along with a set of twins and the cliché badass grandpa, Pops.\n\nIn my opinion, during my first playthrough, the story was ♥♥♥♥ and easily skipable. But after I started playing it again and again I started to like the lot. Hands down, I still skip most of the dialogue, cos there's ALOT of it.\nFighting mechanics is clumsy and you end up raging over hitting the air in a 5 min combo instead of picking that item up. Its hard to navigate around the map since there's no feeling of which way you're facing, but it matters little.

The game is as i understand it - Ported from consoles and is locked at 30 fps. And don't worry, - It doesn't matter in a game like this. But the textures aren't that great. They are actually very poor, and characters will pop in even when you are not that far from them. See for yourself in the video below. It's a very short video without any spoilers.

It's hidden inside the save dialog.\n\nEDIT 20150614: There have been patches but none to address the multi-monitor issue, yet. Since you need the mouse for camera movement when you play with keyboard I still can't recommend this game for people with that setup. Hopefully either when the problem is fixed or I got my steam controller I can also review the actual game (the semi open-world concept looks fun... with controller)\n\nEDIT 20151024: Got a Steam Controller and tested it with Akiba's Trip. It's much better to play with it and I'm thinking about giving it a thumbs up now because the gameplay itself is fun. However I'll leave this "No" up as a warning for keyboard and mouse players who also have more than one monitor.\nBesides the camera and mouse on second monitor issue also persists with the steam controller with the left pad being configured as mouse-input, but at least it does not have an effect on attacking and moving because you don't click with the mouse. Only just the camera movement is affected.","May 30, 2015","false","6.7"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","20","37","0","0"

The stores and the flyers in game are based on actual stores in Akiba. As a visual novel, it’s decent. The ‘bad ends’ aren’t really terrible, but if you beat the game once, you unlock a feature that makes completing the other routs a breeze. The combat can get repetitive but I still found myself entertained by  the variety of weapons and clothing. To put is simply, it’s kind of like Deadrising without the zombies and with striping. The price of the game does seem a bit too pricey, so if you’re on the fence about this game, then I would suggest that you wait for it to go on sale.","September 4, 2015","true","87.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes!\n\nAKIBA'S TRIP: Undead & Undressed SummaryThe game is a visual novel RPG hybrid with a very good sense of humour and enjoyable fighting mechanics. As it's a visual novel you can be sure there are more than 1 routes through the game (4 in total, 5 if you count the "bad" end). The story behind the game is so-so, with a bunch of strange vampiric-like creatures taking over the streets of Akibahara and well you end up becoming one, quickly followed by becoming a Nighteater's familiar, which is a good thing unlike the vampire, somehow.\n\nI really do love this game, be it the millions of combinations of clothing you can put on your character where each item is fully upgradable so there's no sacrifice really in using your favourite outfit, as well as the fighting which, whilst it can become slighly repetitive, overall it is fun to play and at times, especially on the unlockable Otaku difficulty, can be very challenging. The game's characters are also loveable, even if they are the generic stereotypes of anime/visual novel characters really. Plus you get a panty shot of each of the characters when you've finally completed all the stories!\n\nUnfortunately, and this is the problem, it's a mediocre port of a console game. The control scheme is clunky if you use a keyboard and mouse, so I would very much recommend a controller for this! Also the game is locked to 30FPS I believe, which is unfortunate but I've found the game runs very well and have never seen it fall below 30, which is nice. This is the main reason I haven't given it a 10.\n\nProsFun, challenging combat!\nVery high replayability!\nHighly customisable characters and clothing! Right down to walk cycles and movesets.\nLovely sized map with many change of scenes. close-quater areas and open areas!\nNice soundtrack, accompanies the gameplay very well.\nOtaku difficulty is truly challenging if unprepared!\n(PERSONAL) First game in a while I've actively wanted to 100%.\nFun, decent storyline with loveable, well presented, different characters!\nPlenty of side missions and optional activities.\nGood sense of humour.\nThe bro puns. Prepare yourself!\nConsI can see how the combat may become repetetive (although for me it didn't).\n30FPS lock from it being a console port!\nJudgementAKIBA'S TRIP gets CynicalPopcorn's HIGHLY recommended judgement with a score of 9.5/10!\n\nThe game is very fun, lovely to play through all the stories and a nice game to sit down, play freely and just relax as you strip the public on the streets of Akiba down in a chain until you can perform a strip finisher and take their underwear too! Definitely worth the money!","September 28, 2015","true","37.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unique weapons with special attacking patterns and some what of a small sand-boxy RPG.\n\nWould be even better if the script could be gender specific, I usually swap to a female model and can't stand that the NPCs still adresses me as "Broski" or "boy".

(Zenya or Soga)\nOr maybe routes for Kaito and his bro if a female mode is used. Maybe more places to explore, if i am was not wrong, i saw an option to leave Akiba, so maybe a DLC that includes another part of japan?

Check it out if you don't believe me.) is certainly not something like everything else. That alone is the single most important reason why you would want to buy this game.\n\nThis is no Saint's Row or GTA but it can feel like one when you're doing the side quests.\n\nCrossdressing to get guys to stop hitting on a girl? Only to kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of them for hitting on you? Hell YES!\n\nHunting down cursed urban hardware? Whuuuuut?\n\nStopping a labor law protest coming from 48 girls...only to beat all of them to death in a survival scenario?! (Forget stripping them! I'm UNDER ATTACK BY 48 GIRLS!)\n\nJust...WOW....JUST...FREAKING...WOW JAPAN!\n\nYou start off as a guy that fell for a shady job and got turned into some kind of demi-vampire but you get saved by a random girl. (you learn more about her later and why.) After you get busted out you investigate this town which is actually a rl city from 80s Japan. Unfortunately other people are being turned into these demi-vampires, known as synthisters, and you have to best them in combat by ripping their clothes off so that the sunlight takes care of the rest. Simple....yet not so...\n\nThe game itself is a Aerial Camera 3D brawler. You control your camera with right stick and use 3 buttons for attacking the sections of your victim's bodies. Y for head, B for mid section, and A for low section. After you bust up the durability of your opponent's clothing enough you then hold one of the corresponding buttons for an attempt to rip off the clothing. So the combat is very simple and easy to pick up on. You can also use some special moves too with the different weapons available. To negotiate your targets the one your character will attack will have a ring around them when you align yourself before you start button mashing. Careful though, you're partially like the synthisters too and your opponents will be trying to strip you too. If you lose your headpiece/top/bottom altogether, you die. There's a lot more to the combat than just these. This is just the bread and butter stuff. There are counters and blocking and unblockable attacks.\n\nThis game has some kind of date sim/RPG story element into it in which it has several endings, all dependent on which of the girls you meet feels about you depending on the dialog choices you choose.\n\nAnd mostly...that's pretty much it. The game is short but it does have a few problems.\n\nFirst and foremost. The maps are very small.\nTo add to the very small maps. If you're forced into combat in these small streets or alleyways you can be shoved near the exit points as you're fighting. You won't automatically exit the map while in combat but the camera fixes and zooms out and does that almost instantly which isn't just annoying but also screws up your concentration and view. On my first dry run, it was frustrating but I guess it's something you can train yourself to get used to. You're doing to HATE places like Junk Street.\n\nSecondly is how missions are handled. The main missions are instanced on their own map even though you travel to the map it's at. They start AUTOMATICALLY when you enter that map. It does save you the trouble of looking for an npc but that's where the problems with the side quests come in.\n\nThe side quests are marked by Red ! Points however the game has no local radar or any icons to view quest NPCs. In order to find quest npc objectives you have to make sure you have the Npc titles turned on. (Turn them on by pressing Y when not in combat and you'll see the npcs classes i.e. Otaku, Maid, Gothic Lolita, schoolgirl, etc.) Regular npcs are yellow titled and side quest/objective npcs are Red titled however with no radar some of them are hard to find and the side quests have expiration timers. You do get a good bit of time, don't get me wrong, but when players want to start something they shouldn't have to strain their eyes fishing for out of place NPCs in a sea of yellow words. On the plus side, because the maps are very small, this isn't as bad as it sounds.\n\nAll and all I think it's the closest Japan's coming to making a good and decent open world game but it still feels like it has it's constrictions but it's still nice.

It's kind of like that but more free in choice. Combat gameplay is not restricted to story progression or random events, which means grinding is an option. Depending on how you want to play the game is like a progression of a visual novel game. With five different ending routes and an average story completion time of 15 hours, sometimes you wonder how a $30 game can be as fun as any new $60. Combat is determined by wits more than stats. Thanks to the game’s difficulty modes, even the hardest level that is unlocked by completion can end up tearing apart your most invested clothes considered untouchable.\n\nThe game shows you how to play though story progression tutorials. You can forcibly take off clothes or defend from grabs by mashing the attack button that targets that section. Use attacks or special moves that are unique to each weapon to wear down clothes that give off a color that can be instantly torn off. Or you can wait it out by doing a mix of both by challenging yourself to tear every clothing from multiple enemies though a quick time event that can end with a Justice theme pose, blinding lights, and hefty experience boost by getting more than 7 clothes.\n\nThe choice to go out alone or with a follower is up to you. Usually it’s easier with a follower that can help take the heat off of you or help with cloth stripping combos. Most of the time a follower is attached due to story progression.\n\nThe Game’s loot system is determined by how you play and how well you do it. You have a chance of keeping clothes that are taken instead of ripping them apart. A tough enemy can drop high level gear or unique items. This could be one of those games that get easier the better you play. If you lose your cloths, don’t panic, you can take them back if you defeat the enemy that took them. Or if your clothes got destroyed by taking any more damage while 0 on hit points can be repurchased at a unique shop.\n\nThis game features grinding because you can scan and target people on the street. Don't get carried away or else the police will arrest you at a moment of venerability for a fate worse than a game over, paying a fine that can cost more than a mission award.\n\nThis can be the closest to what is considered street fashion or cosplay, in a game of clothes stealing.\n","June 9, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well I think not. This game takes the main aspects and role of a JRPG, SP Free Roam, Visual Novel, and Stripping Simulator simultaneously! and all while in Akihabara!!\nFor a PS ported game it runs pretty smoothly and its graphics are appealing at that. The story is pretty solid and can take 6-8 hours to complete, If you include the side missions maybe an extra 5-10 hours to add on to that. Once you beat the game there are multiple other endings you can try to open up, this can be done to unlock new models to play as and new items to boost up your character Nanashi (character you play as) or other companions by using the 'Fuse' feature which can be done by just talking to your little sister (Nana).\n\n~ Pros:\n- Animated VN\n- Multiple Endings\n- Length\n- Music\n- Gameplay\n- Story\n- Optional English/Japanese voices/subs\n- Multiple difficulties (including Otaku mode)\n- Smooth animations: Doesn't take much to run the game\n- Appealing japanese ads ;) (can be turned off if you don't like it)\n- STRIPPING and lots lots lots of it :D\n\n~ Cons:\n- Combat: can be complex to jump right into, especially if using a keyboard (doesn't show keyboard layout in-game)\n- Crashing/Bugs: People have many problems crashing (crashed at the beginning then ran smoothly for me), just make sure to save constantly\n- Repetitive Combat/Missions: The multiple fighting styles, weapons, and clothing do keep it interesting though\n\nIs the game worth it?\nHell yeah!! 10/10\n\nNow.

If you have a powerful enough PC to run it (preferably matching or exceeding the recommended system requirements), you will get what I like to think as the best version of the game, even though it doesn't come with the Toyboy cheat mode and broadcasting features from the PS4 version. If you're familiar with the previous versions of the game and their loading times (including NPCs!), you will be amazed how super-short they are in the Steam version. :) I highly recommend this game! Sure, this isn't a perfect port by any means, but there's nothing what I would call game breaking. I also love having all the DLCs already included in the game, for free, just like in the PS4 version.","August 26, 2015","true","61.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've tried to game before on PC and it worked just fine so I gotta ask What happened!? How did it end up into a crashing mess, Although it might just be because I am on Window's 10. (I prefer Windows 8.1 but my family had to keep on telling me to goram upgrade.)\n\nI would still recommend this game as it is extremly fun, I played with the Ninja style when I unlocked it. Did not like the Telekenetic though.\n\nAs you can see from my playtime 0.1 hrs. which is a shame really. It just proves how bad the crashing was that I just got fed up.\n\nThe game for me now was Unplayable. So I sent a Refund reqest, Although I would of prefered a Fix as stated in the Reason for Refund, If I still had a choise, I'd ask for the Fix then the Refund as this is a great game, Good Story, Good Voice Acting.

I mean when I don't like how it layout I have to quit the game just to go to the launch and repeat over and over untill I find what perfect for me.

The story is pretty good, the combat is new and unique, and since there's multiple endings there's a bunch of replayability.

The story is good and at somepoints can be funny especially in the choices you make. So many refrences to other franchises in the form of advertisements or items for example a neptune body pillow weapon (Now you can kill people with your waifu also dont worry theres more than just a neptune body pillow if you into that type of stuff). There is also a lot of side quests so if you like them there here. I also recommend that you play with a controller for this due to using a keyboard and mouse makes it somewhat near impossible to play (might be due to being ported from another console version). My final word on this is if you like a game where you strip vampires then get it or if you want a game what has somewhat of a rpg feel then get it it might be a good purchase for you also all dlc is included with the game.","July 28, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IonianWarrior/recommended/333980/","IonianWarrior","Jet Edge (✿ ♥‿♥)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IonianWarrior/","690 products in account","I personally love this game, I dont really agree with the reviews online however. A lot of places just call this game a mediocre game with a fairly shallow combat system. But the charm of the game comes if you are familiar with Otaku culture. Im not saying you need to be familiar with it to enjoy the game, but for the most part you should know at least a little bit about otaku culture to enjoy it that much more.\n\nThe Combat is meh, but I enjoy it, it's simple but at the same time has some challenge to it. The real reason is for how much it praises/parodies otaku culture, and kind of makes fun of all the fan service in anime (At least that's how i see it since the game is like 90% fan service)\n\nThe game is hit and miss on how well it runs however, for example, my old computer was able to run it perfectly fine, but then I upgraded my computer and it just stopped working. I had to set it to run as admin and be in compatibility mode. Some report crashes frequently, slowdowns, and a black screen after the Xseed logo. Check the discussions if you want more info on all that. It is locked to 30 fps if that bnothers you (It's not bad for me since I grew up on consoles) I only have a few problems with it. First, the enemies can all stun lock you when theres a group of them, which is especially bad on the gamer and otaku difficulties. Second there's no vibration setting for the cfontrollers, which I feel a controller is much needed for this game, but the vibration goes off about 80% of the time when getting hit, and you get hit a lot in this game. Third, I dont like how there is no graphics options whatsoever, only a "Max npc on screen" and "Max npc shadow in distance" setings, unless you have to dig, which I didnt do, because it runs perfectly fine where it's at.\n\nOverall Id say wait for a sale if you think the technical issues will be a problem, or until it gets fixed, but it's definitely worth a playthrough.","June 8, 2015","true","42.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is true with most, if not all console ports.  But with many console ports, multiple monitors will usually go into stand-by mode if you play at a single monitor resolution while at fullscreen.  Whereas with Akiba's trip, even at a single monitor resolution, the game will span all three monitors and zoom in.  The only workaround I found was to play the game in Windowed mode, or disable Nvidia Surround and play it on a single monitor.\n\nAlso, there is no option to change your controller schema or graphics resolution while in-game.  All resolution and controller tweaks are done on the launch menu.\n\nIf you're on a single monitor setup and you have a gamepad handy, then the amount of configuration and/or troubleshooting needed is minimal.  Even with these minor issues, I still had a lot of fun and would definitely recommend it to fellow otaku.","June 14, 2015","true","29.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is pretty good, the combat is new and unique, and since there's multiple endings there's a bunch of replayability.

There are few environment sounds a bit overbearing.\nMusic:  Generic, which is a good thing as the same songs repeat constantly.\nControls:  A proper game pad is the way to go due to the strip mechanics.  No game pad issues except for the batteries dying.\nMechanics:  Not at all what I was expecting from this game, something a bit new and different for a beat'um up.  Up to three clothing items need to be removed head,middle, lower to defeat baddies.  You can straighten out your clothes in combat to regain 'durability'.  The blocking mechanic feels to slow and hence broken. This might pose problems at higher difficulty settings.\nStory:  The base story is generic, however actions in the game actually change the outcome.  I had Touko always join me in my pantsu raiding and was pleasantly surprised on how that turned out.  The game did not force the story to be about Shizuku.\nEntertainment: I was expecting a shallow generic game.  Turned out to be a lot more fun then expected.\nDifficulty:  Adjust the slider and enjoy.\nReplayability:  Absolutely replaying this game to see how the story changes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysisa/recommended/333980/","dysisa","dys?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysisa/","698 products in account","Akiba's Trip is an amusing and definitely very unique game. The name of the game itself is a clever little pun alluding to the main feature of it; stripping! In the game you take the role of the nameless main character (whom becomes fully customizable in subsequent playthroughs at least) that by certain events is forced to start fighting vampires across Akihabara, and what better way of doing so than undressing them to expose their skin to the sunlight?\n\n"Simple" is the best word for describing the combat, it's largely reduced to three different buttons which make you attack head, body or legs. In attacking said part of the body you will cause damage to the piece of clothing they are wearing on that part of their body. Once you've attacked that part enough you can either hold down the button to initiate a strip or keep attacking it until you destroy that piece of clothing. Despite it's simplicity, the combat is still very customizable in that there's a quite frankly ridiculous number of items you can equip to use as weapons. Anything from posters to electric guitars to water guns. A lot like Dead Rising, except there's more of an RPG element to it where you can upgrade your weapons to become stronger.\n\nSadly the combat is also the weakest point of the game. Because of how simple it is, a lot of fights can quickly become very tedious or just straight up obnoxious. In addition to the 3 basic attacks of each weapon, every weapon also has an unblockable attack. Several enemies in a tight area harassing you with the unblockable attacks can be a very frustrating experience.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that the PC port is far from the best. As the developers are a couple of Japanese dudes who have never before made a game for the PC, you can probably imagine that problems cropped up. Trying to get the game working can for many people by like trying to navigate a maze. Constantly having to change around between seemingly trivial settings to find the one that will hopefully make the game run. Fortunately the refund feature exists now for people who can't get it working at all, but worth giving a thought to in case you'd rather not have to refund something.\n\nThe story of the game is by no means anything to write home about, but it's fairly entertaining and many of the dialogue choices in the game made me audibly laugh on various occasions. There's several endings to aim for and the game loans itself very well to being replayed, much like Way of the Samurai 4 for instance. If you're a weeaboo like me then I think the jokes will most likely hit it home with you too. Both story and combat are full of anime and manga references to really drive it in who the game is mainly aiming for.\n\nThe areas of the game are all either very small or very narrow, a side effect of the game originally being made with the intention of running on a PS Vita. This in turn goes back to the problem I mentioned earlier with the combat where you can easily get gangbanged if the enemy is feeling extra cheeky. The positive of this is that at least it makes it very easy to find the plethora or stores across town fast, and it makes finding quest givers for the many and varied side quests a very easy task.\n\nAkiba's Trip is a heavily flawed game, but it's an entertaining one none the less. It has a certain charm to it which can easily keep one playing for a long time. It's also a pretty great dressup simulator if you're into that.\nWould I call it a good game?

Its super tight with a bunch of customisable animations through the use of different weapons, and you get rewarded for combos with "chain strips."\n\nthe visual novel part of the game is why you play past the first playthrough and is a really good way of intergrating NewGame+ because you can start again ala newgame+, to go through a different route meaning it is easier due to your gear which you upgrade over time (or harder if you crank up the difficulty and this game can get real hard), while the story doesn't really change from what I have seen so far on different routes ( as of writing I have played 2 seperate routes) the game really makes you feel the emotion of the characters and you really feel them grow with you depending on the route  **SPOILERS**   you could have one girl become like you and literaly become a vampire so that you and here are the equals like you have always been (BTW you turn into a vampire) or you can convince a girl you like to stay with you instead of leaving a little bit of a difference between them scale wise but it all makes sense when you play them.   **SPOILERS END**\n\nCough.. what did I say about emotion nah ♥♥♥♥ that I ment dank CG's. that all can be set as your phones background picture. So yes you can strip your companions and have that as your phone background.\n\nAlso I don't normaly like ads in games but these ones add a theme to the game you never really notice them (apart from the loading screen ads but they are in japanese and normaly look sweet as heck so who cares) but in the town of akiba there are screens playing ads for real life anime and what not constantly and it really adds to the atmosphere that you are in akiba. I aint been threre my self but I think I have watched enough anime to have a grasp on how it would be  /s.  Just in case you didn't know /s means I am trying to convey sarcasim in text\n\nBut all of this aside the main game, 1 playthrough will take around 10-12 hours unless you are sick good at these sorts of  action RPGs and/or literaly don't give af about the story and skip it all. subsequent playthroughs will take a few hours tops unless you crank up the difficulty. Also if I had to recomend play on easy/casual on a first playthrough because learning how to play the game whilst getting one shot was not fun.\n\nIf I had to rate it would be 9/10. amazing story, amazing gameplay and overall great theme.\nWhy no 10? cos nothing should ever get a ten its not the best game ever, but in my eyes its damn close. (also 30 FPS lock BOOOOOOO)","January 5","true","21.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

When it's not a bizarre mix of comic otaku culture shenanigans and entirely softcore hentai, it's a visual novel and dating sim. The game features over 100 collectible flyers from real stores in Japan. Parts of it feel like the whole thing was cooked up by the Akihabara Tourism Board. If you couldn't care less about Japan and want a totally engaging, polished video game experience, this one isn't for you.\n\nBut for those who can appreciate what it is and where it comes from, there's something lovable about ATUU, and while the combat system can be frustratingly unpredictable, it's also part of what gives it its charm. After an intentional back-alley brawl turns into a seemingly endless mosh pit of clothes-stripping, glowstick-stabbing, laptop-pelvic-thrusting hijinks, you get a bit caught up in the game's chaotic sincerity, and the rest becomes just another vehicle for currying the favor of whichever girl you think is cutest. After all, as the Silent Male Protagonist, you are somehow both inexplicably irresistible, and devoid of all character traits--except those selected in certain conversational dialogue trees.\n\nAnd then, of course, you dress up your waifu how you like and eventually earn special cut scenes of stripping her to her panties. Because hey, this is still Japan we're talking about, and games don't get much more modern-Japanese than this one right here.","March 23","true","26.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just play on Easy or Casual so you can breeze through the combat. This game is not well-balanced or well-designed enough for the higher difficulties to be tolerable. If you aren't interested in the game's story and atmosphere, stay away.\n\nSupport for higher resolutions would be nice. You can hack the game to a higher resolution, but even if you do, the game still has a hideous filter on it that makes it blurry and ugly anyway. The effect is noticeable even on officially supported resolutions like 1920x1200. Terrible. Take it off. The game would run better and look better without it.\n\nIt would be nice if the game ran at 60fps but I appreciate that's not gonna happen.

The combat takes sometime to get used to so if you suck at video games dont play this. But if you are willing to learn it is very rewarding. The game not only is hilarious with its fighting style being about stripping others, but it also supplies a challenge when playing. Plus its like DeadRising in the sense that the weapons and cloths you can use/wear are hilarious. On top of all that it has one of the best stories I have ever seen in any videogame. The different paths you can take make the game replayable and each story arc is just amazing.

Everything about this game will make you wonder how in the world was it even approved. For starters, the figthing mode and the cameras are a joke, at the very beginning it seemed hilarious and I did think I'd have a great time with it but it isn't like that, unfortunetely, it is so repetitive that after 3 fights you'll be sick of it. The cameras are so bad that during a fight there might be times where you won't be able to see your character and as the game areas are seperated, if you approach the transition zone during a fight, the camera will zoom out and you won't be able to see ♥♥♥♥. The graphics are laughable, taking into account that this game is sold for 27€ I can confidently say there are better anime games out there with a far more reasonable price and that will entertain you for a longer period. The game is ridiculous, but there are a few decent aspects about it, you can customize your character's clothing...yey...but that won't be so easy since clothing has stats and they increase or dicrease your resistence to dammage which makes the feature pretty much useless. The characters are surprisingly interesting, and they are most likely the only decent aspect in the game, at least it kept me playing. They are likeable and the interactions you maintain with them make the experience somewhat enjoyable since there will be times where you'll have to choose the according dialog option to get a certain ending (pretty much like any other visual novel). The game is not as boring as I am discribing it, but is does stress you out quite a lot specially if you think how funny the concept is and how hilarious this game could have been if done right. Overall, the game is painfully bad, but still enjoyable to a certain extent, you will have to force yourself thru it a few times but if you're a dedicated anime fan you'll still be able to enjoy it, specially because you'll be walking in the streets of Akihabara and there will be many stores with real brands such as Kotobukiya, PS, Vaio (that aspect did please me a little) it gives you the feeling of being in the actual district despite the horrendous graphics. If you feel like you have to buy it, then go for it but for me this game feels more of an obligation rather than a fun time so it's up to you. 5/10 in my opinion.\nPS: I felt the need of making a review after the gam crashed, so I was pretty angry, the game is fun, but not worth the money.","March 5","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The intro narrative is informative while also quick and not long and confusing. The concept of combat: tearing off clothes of your enemy, is creative and colorful in its own way. The game provides a solid combination of Persona-styled JRPG with Easy-to-grasp combat systems and minor visual novel-elements. The English voice acting is good, colourful and funny while maybe not the one with most soul nor best skill.\n\n\nTECHNICAL PROBLEMS\nIf you experience problems with launching the game (hangs on logos), try this:\n\n1: uncheck fullscreen in the launcher/config\n\n2: when you're at the game-menu, press alt-enter to use fullscreen\n\ngood luck, might not help","May 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Each weapon variant has its own combos and very different from each other making combat a lot more interesting. The story is also a plus for this game as well with its characters. The only downside to this game i'd say is the world. While its cool and interesting for the first while It quickly becomes very 2D as in everything is flat and becomes very boring quickly. Also the combat when played at extreme lengths can get stale as well. I'd still recommend this game for its strengths but keep in mind it has just as many weaknesses as well.","July 2, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's totally what happened.\n\nThankfully a far cry from the usual overwrought attempt at a titillating experience, unless you really get off to the digital equivalent of swimsuit Barbies. Rather, Akiba Strip (let's not kid ourselves, that's the real name) is about... the plot, surprisingly enough, with a clumsy as hell combat system tacked on as the selling point. You've been kidnapped and turned into a vampire - sorry, synthister - that normally must feed on other people's positive energy, but thanks to a fateful blood pact you are able to retain your free will, and thusly go about your business of vaporizing other synthisters by stripping them of their clothing, exposing them to sunlight. It's equal opportunity pantsing of both genders whether you like it or not so it doesn't come across as horribly sexist, but for the majority of this game you go about brutally murdering your less fortunate kin via clothes removal with little hint of remorse. Rather morbid, really.\n\nBut that's okay because you get to buy keyboards and giant novelty items to use as weapons and it's slapstick ha ha and there's the mandatory forced romance subplot and... well at least the characters are amusing and the translation's good. Combat, sadly, is the worst attempt at a ripoff of the Arkham games I've yet seen, so again, the best you can hope for from this is an amusing story and lampooning of otaku culture. Does crash on load screens occasionally though.\n\nIf nothing else it's a comfort to know that I'm not quite so far gone as to identify with any of the wackjobs in this game in the slightest.","May 27, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

As far as the port's quality goes, you can scale the number of citizens that walk around the game, but no real visual settings.\n\nThe game has everything an Otaku would ever want. A realistically recreated virtual Akihabara, 5 girls to pick from, lots of character clothing to pick from, and of course, let's not forget the pantsu shots.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for anyone who is an Otaku (interest in Japanese Anime/ Video games), as the game itself advertises a bunch of other popular games made by the same developers and publishers, and even some anime.\n\nIf you are not an Otaku or even slightly interested in the Otaku culture, do not buy this game.","May 26, 2015","true","68.5"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","18","39","2","0"

Ah, and with lovingly crafted art, music, and the ability to control the action, vidcons are the ultimate combination of the high arts. While I tend to play the stoic, I will be the first to admit that vidcons have driven me to cry, to scream and shout, to feel actual hate; such is the power of this force beyond our wildest reckoning. And here I am, before you, to tempt your tongues with the taint of such a tantalizing topic. And the Japanese, the true geniuses behind the world of video games. Pah, I throw my scorn upon such incompetents of the West who would mock the true art of the Japanese with "games" such as Baldur's Gate and Madden. Perhaps the West is not as intelligent as the East, but this is a matter for another day. Japan has given us such masterpieces as the Final Fantasy series, Star Ocean, Wild Arms, and of course, Arc the Lad. Yes, some of the finest vidcons in the world were created by the Japanese. I come to you today to ask you in all earnesty, what is your favorite vidcon? I will reveal mine after the grand debate has illustriously begun, but not before the first poster falls victim to my plot of discussion.","May 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","45","13","29","12","1"

Even the control config screen could not be persuaded to fit properly on my monitor and the initial keyboard settings required a memory of the abitrary settings (the in game tutorial hasn't been updated to show your actual key settings) and three hands - the game uses WASD and left end keys for movement, arrow keys for even the most basic camera control and mouse for actions and attacks.

The devs are working to fix this, and I will remove this the moment it is fixed\n- Does not have autosave, you must manually and save often.\n- The anime / Japanese aesthetic may not be appealing to some.\n- Don't let your friends see you playing this or you might be subject to extensive needling.\n\nHaving played this game extensively for one ending on the hardest starting difficulty, I think I can wholly write up a review on this thing now that I've stripped the grand majority of Akibahara's residents of their garments.\n\nThis game is something I'd say anyone could pick up and have a ball with. There are So many little things, such as all weapons having their own fighting style. Some share similarities but overall, every weapon is different in it's own way.\n\nThe environment itself, from the stores to the streets, are actual places from the real Akihabara in Japan. I personally thought that was a wonderful detail to the game and it makes it feel more alive.\n\nCombat is pretty straight forward. One button hits one body part and the others hit whatever body part they correspond with. Smack the body in the part till the cover comes apart!\n\nIt does have a lack of variety in activities, but that doesn't seem to scuff the shine of this incredibly fun little experience. There is a large variety of side quests and an arena to spice things up.\n\nThe game does have some issues, though I have not experienced them. Issues like, crashing on start up, inability to get passed character creation and so forth. Most issues seem to be nothing more than crashing, so I'd advice that if the game works wonderfully for you, save, save and save often! I learned that the hard way, as the game has no autosave feature.\n\nWant a score?\n7.8/10 - Comes close to an 8, but if it was more polished with a bit more to do, perhaps better combat even, this would be an 8. Hands down.\n\nMy real score?\nFun/10 - Buy the game\n\n\nHope this review helps anyone wondering whether or not to buy this perverted romp through the Otaku Capital of the world.\n\n...","May 29, 2015","true","52.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

With that said, let's carry on.\n\nThat game should have been subtitled "Anime: The game". But other than the references to videogame and anime "culture", this game doesn't hold anything.\n\nThe combat system is nothing interesting, you just keep smashing one button until you break a clothe limit in order to strip it away. It's hard to die, as you can heal instantly, while the enemy's AI is as good as any Assassin's creed AI: It waits in line and doesn't attack a lot.\n\nThe plot is just mediocre. You good guy other bad guys strip bad guys because evil plan buh bad! Not seriously. It's your typical good/evil scheme. The plot is just there to justify unclothing people. You know, like a porno.\n\nThere's a great replay value as you got choices in your dialogues (any choice's consequence being as obvious as the sky when looking up) and different endings and ton of modification after your first playthrough, but let's be honest. The game is a brainless, repetitive, uninteresting button masher with no challenge filled with empty characters. I had more fun being whipped by my dad after sex than playing at this game. Also, the OST is mediocre.\n\nBut most importantly, what's the most important aspect of a game? Being able to play it! And that game fails at that. Random crashes happen all the time, and there's NO AUTOMATIC SAVE FEATURE.\n\nBut then again, this game is just a gimmick made by otakus for otakus. What did I expect. 27€ is too much for that game. Go outside, it'll cost less and it will have more fun and replay value.","August 7, 2015","false","11.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Only displays gamepad controls and no option to show keyboard controls while playing. Keyboard/mouse controls also did not work consistently. Mouse displays constantly on screen, mouse does not do anything.\n\nI couldn't even get past the first dialog in the game. It skipped over everything even when I tried to select a single advance, and I could not choose an option to go with.\n\nEnded up refunding.

What happening next was the following:\n\n{[TL;DR VERSION]}\n\nTHERE ARE ANIME WOMEN AND YOU CAN STRIP THEM AND STEAL THEIR UNDERWEAR WHILE WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING AND WIELDING A HYPERDIMENSION NEPTUNIA BODY PILLOW. THERE'S ATLEAST 5 DIFFERENT WAIFU'S EACH WITH VARIATING CUP SIZES AND DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES (Tsundere, Moe, etc) AND THEY ALL HAVE A "TRUE ENDING"\n\nYES YOU CAN STRIP YOUR WAIFU'S IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT CHOICES IN THE GAME.\nYES YOU CAN EDIT THEIR CLOTHES TO WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT ONLY AFTER SOME POINT.\nCROSS DRESSING IS UNLOCKED WHEN YOU ACCEPT A CERTAIN SIDE QUEST.\nBODY PILLOW IS PURCHASABLE FROM 5DAY'S IN ELECTRIC PLAZA FOR LIKE 5000 YEN.\n\nI R8 IT 9/10 M8 TIS GR8, LOTS OF WAIFU, LOTS OF FANSERVICE FOR TEH MAN AND TEH WOMAN THAT CAN BE REVIEWED VIA OPTIONS>PHONE BACKGROUND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\n{[ACTUAL REVIEW FOR WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE GAME]}\n\n{[Regarding the System Requirements]}\n\nAkiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is an amazing game that I simply love. Yes, the reccomended specs are somewhat ridiculous but I don't meet either the minumum or reccomended specs but I can run it perfectly fine. So daijobu, kimi shinai de.\n\nIf you don't meet them but your graphics card and stuff is pretty up there you should be fine (I have Nvidia GTX 680 Ti and it runs sweet.)\n\n\n\n{[Plotline]}\n\nThe storyline (Although questionable) is pretty solid;\n\nYou're an otaku shut-in who got lured in by a mysterious company offering you limited edition anime figures and any other collectibles you so desire as long as you sign this totally not suspicious contract that has fine print on it that you can't read. As any normal person would, you sign yourself up and turn up for the first day of work... Only to wake up with no recollection of what happened and to find yourself strapped to a metal table surrounded by men. At this point you choose 3 out of the possible 9 or so choices that the game gives you (Be careful, choosing the wrong one will make the "Game Over" screen appear, this is the only time in the game this happens so don't worry about the other game choices) and then a heroic bishoujo waifu bursts in and whacks the living sh*t out of one of the body-guards with her umbrella. The story goes on, you lose your first kiss. And you proceed to lead her to a gaming bar and abduct her into your group of fellow otaku vigilante friends, or the "Akiba Freedom Fighters."\n\nFrom that point onwards the game keeps developing and you have pretty much free reign to explore the game entirely. Some main quests are required to go to some of the areas in the game (Akiba Park, Battle Arena, Yobodashi Camera Area) but the only one really worth visiting is the Battle Arena for money and testing your stripping skills.\n\n\n\n{[Pro's & Con's]}\n\nPros:\n~ Can crossdress after taking a side-quest from a girl\n~ After finishing the game on any(?) difficulty you get the following;\n1) The final bosses weapon\n2) If you managed to get a TRUE Ending then you get an item that allows you to walk like your waifu\n3) Assorted shoes from different plot relevant characters\n4) Access to more customisation options from each mode/completion. Voice, Model, Skin tone, Every persons height.\n~ You can gain every persons clothing as long as you have the required mastery level\n~ You can beat people up with funny random objects\n~ One of the main missions is to strip your waifu of choice in "Training"\n~ The game is made in scary accuracy to real life Akihabara in 2012-2013, so you've basically been to Akiba now.\n~ Shizuku's ending will make you cry\n~ Offers gameplay in both Japanese and English for both subtitle and dubs\n\nCon's:\n~ The only way to defeat an enemy is to strip their clothes or tear them, I get that the purpose is to strip people but can't we have like a knockout option aswell??\n~ The stupid sister sidequest that requires you to fetch cake from like 4 different places is the worst thing ever\n~ Sometimes you may have to battle against awkward camera angles when you're supposed to be fighting Synthisters\n~ The areas you can visit are very small. You'll know where most things are within your first hour or so of running around\n~ The controls are definitely not optimised for computer usage. You can tell as soon it tells you to press A, Y, B, X and generally tells you the controls for an Xbox controller, not a keyboard.\n~ There is no way to rebind the keys once in-game, so you're required to save and quit everytime you forget one of the controls. The alternatives are to memorize the controls, or to just use a controller. Or press every letter and button until you find it.\n~ The game is smart and knows that you're playing on casual when you fight in the arena and get to rank S and ask for a battle, it literally tells you "Maybe if you were to play on Hard mode...." which is sad. And not really worth it in the end unless you want a decent fan weapon and a shrine maiden outfit\n~ For some reason they set the minimum and standard waaaaay too high for a game like this.\n~ Playing with a keyboard is most DEFINITELY harder as your strong attacks require you to move in the opposite direction while attacking. Can prove difficult without full 360 movement support.\n~ There's a store that kicks you out for being underage when you're 17. You can't actually in anyway enter this store. The store name is M's btw.\n~ Once you do every side quest and main mission that's about it. You're done. Nothing much else to do. Buy everything? Conquer the arena? Max out your gear? You can choose a different waifu path but that's really it. You're finished. Now get off of casual scrub.\n~ The scaling is really unbalanced. You're either fighting in normal where the strongest deal 200+ damage in a normal situation or in hard/otaku where the enemies deal 400+ on the weakest. It's insane, there's no consistency between the leveling. And when you do level up you don't get awarded much.\n~ Maxing out your gear to 999 doesn't help too much. When it comes down to Hard and Otaku you can still get wiped out easily in 3-4 hits.\n~ The way the game addresses you about your accumulated "Waifu Points" really hurts the ego. With either, "Doesn't care about you either way" or "Trusts you, or atleast a little bit..."\n~ Offers really unneccessary game options. What about locked-on camera or something more useful than game colouring filters?\n\n\n\n{[Overall]}\n\nOkay, so maybe there are a LOT more Con's than I expected but nonetheless, overall this game is freaking awesome, you should definitely buy it if you're looking for a solid game that offers a great story full of twists and turns and "Awww" moments and some other "Awww??" moments along with plenty of joking around and content that you can just love, then definitely, MOST DEFINITELY buy this game.","July 2, 2015","true","74.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I should read the title of every japan-made game before actually playing it.\n\nSerious thoughts + warnings at the bottom (also a summary if this is TL;DR)\nThis game is originally a console game and there have been many bugs relating to this game. I won't lie I have had multiple problems like black screen or such but they are pretty minor. Majority says their game works well including me. If you want my opinion then its a defintire yes. Why? Mainly because the story and gameplay is worth it. If you're easily offended by stripping (as in stripping people's clothes off) then don't play this game. It also has some humour at times and can be categorized under the "open-world" category. If you want some hardcore panty stripping then by all means pick up the game\n\nA short summary and some warnings about the game\nIf you've got a nvidia graphics card then don't play it cause there are a lot of problems with this game.\nI strongly recommend using a controller to play this game.\nDon't just expect pictures of partly nude girls, there are guy version as well.\nGame has multiple endings so take your time to play it.\nCheck out the community if there are anymore problems regarding the crashes and graphic problems.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game thanks to its storyline.

Akiba's Trip quickly went from a "spur-of-the-moment" buy, to one that I wish I would've done sooner. The amount of polish this game has is phenomenal. Particularly in the VN aspect of it.\n\nVN Aspect: The characters are 100% voice-acted (which all of the English VAs are amazing, to my surprise! [whoever did Kati's has the cutest voice on the planet]) and their mouths move as they talk. Not only that, but the characters are all loveable, memorable, and most (read: Kaito) are hilarious. Plenty of unique CG to keep your eyes pleased too! The options you can choose from do direct you down the route you so choose, but the not-so-important dialogue choices are hilarious. Typically it's\nOption 1: "You're right. We'll succeed."\nOption 2: "I've been waiting for this all day!"\nOption 3: "BRB. Hot babe spotted. Don't go nowhere."\nEven if you don't enjoy the combat or story too much, the VN portion should give you enough fun to propel you forward and to the end. It's that good.\n\nCombat: Probably the game's weakest point, but, in my opinion, not by much at all. The fights are fun (as you progress, you unlock new strip techniques, some of which are so flashy, they made me Lol) and enjoyable. My friend says that the combat format is similar to some other games, and is a bit lackluster in comparison. But to me, it's perfectly fine and fluid enough so as not to make it UNfun. In fact, 1/4 of my time in the game was probably spent just battling random enemies for the fun of it! I dunno. I guess the combat is hit or miss, really, depending on how many similar games you've played.\n\nStory: For a game about stripping clothes off of people/vampires, the story here is pretty well-crafted. I won't give too much away, but I was impressed at the blend of reality and fantasy. It's a real place, but has some fantasy things going on, while not going completely off the deep end. Tough to really say much without spoilers, so I'll just say it's fine, but nothing completely amazing!\n\nAll in all, this game REALLY surprised me by how well-made it was. You can tell a lot of hard work, time, and effort went into most everything here. Music's really good (Toshiko Tasaki has some really great battle music in store for ya). The city layout is modeled after the actual Akihabara IRL, and you can recognize some of the streets and stuff if you've been there! Even the finer, not-so-important things like shopping, items/gear, and menus are all really amazingly done and enjoyable. I really can't recommend this game enough, and I fully intend to beat it 100% (which is something I NEVER do in games), going through every route. If you happen to see it on sale, pick it up. You'll probably be surprised like I was at just how polished, fun. and flawless it really is.\n\nPS- XSeed Games, Marvelous, Inc., Acquire... listen here.  I'll pay $5-10 for a Kati route. Pleeeeeeeease? DLC, anyone? I mean, JUST LOOK AT HER. How can you put someone so goshdarned BEAUTIFUL AND ADORABLE like that in a game and not make her have a route?! That's just not right!","July 10, 2015","true","141.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenzoku/recommended/333980/","kenzoku","Kenzoku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenzoku/","411 products in account","A really fun little hybrid between character action game, RPG and dating sim / visual novel. Has a fun and unique combat system and one of the few games that I actually enjoyed playing on the highest difficulty.\n\nAkiba's Trip is full of esoteric anime and Japanese culture references, mainly due to the fact that it's a highly detailed virtual recreation of the real life Akihabara in Japan. If you want a game where you can customise your character to look almost exactly how you want it to, then this game is for you.\n\nI found this game to have some really interesting customisation options. From the generic Torso, Legs, Head and accessory slots, there's also a slot to customise how your character walks, and how your character finishes off enemies. In addition to this, upon completing the game you gain the ability to play as nearly every character in the game as your lead character. You can also customise other lead characters in this manner.\n\nThe customisation mentioned above is obviously bare-bones at the start, as your options increase as you unlock them through playing the game. Some options can only be unlocked after clearing the game, meaning replayability is through the roof as everything is unlocked after playing through the game about 6 or 7 times.\n\nAside from the interesting customisation system, replayability, and fun anime / game references; the gameplay is solid, easy to understand, fun and varied.\n\nI found my favourite part of combat was trying out all of the different makeshift weapons, as every single one has its own moveset, animations and effects in combat. From what I can tell, there are over 100 different weapons, from wooden swords to laptops and dakimakura, that's a hell of a lot of combat variety. Even with all this variety, you end up finding a moveset you love, and for me it was my trusty ol' High Quality Wooden Sword (which I upgraded to "godlike" status along my several playthroughs).\n\nIn terms of story, the writing and dialogue isn't too bad. About as good as you can expect from an RPG in a modern fantasy style setting. But still it's no The World Ends With You! The music is fantastic, and the ambient sound ringing through the town of Akiba as you rampage around really makes the game feel like a bustling, living city when it comes to the atmosphere.\n\nNow to adress the elephant in the room. The titular (s)tripping. It might put off a lot of people, or embarrass those who want to purchase it / play it but are afraid of people on their friends list saying "Ew, are you playing a porn game?".\n\nI assure you, the stripping scenes are presented in a more humorous way, rather than sexualised or erotic. 90% of the time the most you see is a characters underwear, and if you manage to chain strip your way to a finisher where you remove the underwear as well, everything is coated in a liberal layer of censorship sparkles, so there's no chance of seeing any actual nudity. If you're worried about the game being gross and derogatory towards women, there's actually a very even split of the genders when it comes to enemies. You'll be releasing just as many men from their textile prisons as you will women.\n\nSadly there is weird unrealistic boob jiggle physics where apparently every character with breasts has them made out of some kind of gravity defying super jelly. But I guess when you buy an anime game, it's part of the package, so to speak. ♥♥♥♥♥ physics seems to be the calling card of a vast majority of Japanese developers, love it or hate it.\n\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this game for all that it is. A tongue in cheek modern fantasy game where you use giant anime pillows to beat the clothes off of vampire-like beings until they melt while you wander around the mecca of games and anime.\n\n(Also if you dont like how the game looks in terms of colours, there's a visual editor feature where you can change literally every colour hue in the shader. So if you want you can make it look like a clown exploded on your monitor, or hey, turn it all brown and enjoy playing Call of Moe: Modern Waifu 3)","July 10, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

AKIBA's TRIP, is probably easiest described as a close but not quite a clone of what we know as "Persona".\nWith the twist of actually having to fight enemies in the actual town of Akihabara instead of going into "dungeons", as we know it from other JRPG's. Now firstly this was announced for consoles, but I am very glad to see it appear on steam as it was unfortunately NOT available for Europeans on the console market as it didn't support the European "PAL" system.\n\nWith that said, this is probably one of the most fun times I've had, once you get through the awkward and weak introduction to the game and it's protagonist. Also the controls are quite awkward at first and I strongly recommend the use of a controller for this one, otherwise, you might have troubles ever getting through the persistent introduction tutorial that will nag at you in the beginning of the game, not to mention the annoying camera angles the game sometimes throw you into when you reach the map edges of the game during fight sequences and scenarios.\n\nThis is also one of the harder games when it comes to the fighting, so if you get easily frustrated over such things, pick this game up at your own risk.\n\nOver all I recommend this game to everyone interested in JRPG's especially if you're into Persona.\nAs for replayability, there do exist several endings depending on your reputation and "actions".\nThis game gets a 8,8/10.\nNow to wait for Persona 5. x)","May 29, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Synthetic vampires who have been created to feed on the life force of unsuspecting citizens in Akihabara, a.k.a. Akiba.  They do have one weakness, however.  Exposure to daylight defeats them, so your goal in the game is to strip them down to their underwear.  The twist here is that you, too, as the protagonist, are affected as you'll learn at the beginning of the game.\n\nIn order to defeat your enemies, you must stip them of clothing, but that's not an easy task.  Clothing must be weakened before it can be removed.  The third person melee combat uses an assortment of items like toys, street signs, guitars, and umbrellas, just to name a few.  Hitting a part of the body lowers the threshold of the clothing on that part of the body to the point that you can grab it and perform a strip move on it.  A successful strip move may lead directly into another one, should the threshold on another piece of clothing be low enough.  The game gives visual clues to show that the "health" of clothing is low.  If you keep beating on a part of the body, the clothing on it may just disintegrate.  However, strip moves come with certain advantages.\n\nWhen multiple enemies are involved, it becomes possible to perform many strip moves in succession by pressing the buttons that appear on screen within the time limit.  This can stun the enemies, allowing you enough time to "heal" your clothing.  Even better, if you're able to strip enough clothing within the time limits, they will become completely naked.  Of course, it's not THAT kind of game.  Nudity is censored, but you get to collect the underwear that the enemies drop.  And collecting things is a big part of the fun in this game.\n\nThere's so much to collect, from clothing to weapons to advertisements, and so on.  The advertisements that appear in the game are from actual businesses in the real Akihabara.  You'll find yourself going through your inventory to check out all the new stuff you've collected, and there's a lot of it!  The descriptions are often quite funny, too.\n\nWhile the story in the game isn't all that deep, the writers clearly had a sense of humor about it.  Depending on the choices you make, your game could end quite literally at the very beginning.  (Don't worry, just start over.)  But wait!  There's more!  Your choices affect which ending you get, and there are normal and "true" endings for each one.  Replay value is also enhanced by the fact that you can enter a new game with the gear you've collected in the previous game, making it easier to get things you might have missed on your first playthrough.\n\nIn summary, I recommend this game.  Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed will make you laugh, and the gameplay will keep you coming back just for the fun of stripping people naked on the streets of Akihabara.","September 8, 2015","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This has been the best 18.1 hours of my time.\n\nWhen i first saw this in the store, it was only for PS4 and PS vita, but timeskip to a few months later, and now it's on steam!\n\nThe battle mechanics might be a bit hard to get in your first time, but it grows on you as you play on. The targetting system may be a bit off but hey, if you "accidentaly" hit people, it seems more like a raid instead of a 1v1. The Story is also great, the outfits are really nice, and the weapon upgrades are a bit pricey, but if you sell enough of them and get up to 20000+ yen, you can sell all your 50+ ATK items and give yourself a big powerspike. While grinding might sound really boring af, it's not the same here in Akiba's Trip. Grinding allows you to maximize your chain-stripping techniques and best of all, it's also the best way to practice counters. while there is a battle arena, it's more fun to shove people, beat them up and strip them down. And not only that, on all difficulties, the AI is really cruel and punishing. Great for players who love a challenge. While a 2v1 might not seem to flashy, try shoving one and piling them up, hitting people with whatever's in your hand. The best part is the endgame rewards. I'm not gonna spoil those, so just play it and see for yourself. Best 750.99 Php i've ever spent, and the installation was worth the wait.\n\n\n10/10 Best beat-stripping game ever. hope there's another sequel to this (since this port is a sequel of the original psp port)","October 3, 2015","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The keybinds are displayed and can be changed before the game begins which is *much* better than getting no instructions at all and having a horrible keybinding set. As for the FPS - yes it is capped at 30 FPS, and it's true the game doesn't always exit entirely (you have to force close it down in Task Manager once you exit for your system to resume modern specs). The Story is comical although not so much that it's completely out of context, the English translations imo are akin to stylized writing being judged for it's errors (ie Intentionally making spelling errors, does not always warrant correction). I won't spoil the story but I will say that there is a New Game+ for those who wish to repeat it with a different character model, although your in-game sister still calls you "bro" and all the pronouns are "He" instead of "She" with a female model. You don't get to change your partner's clothes until somewhere in the middle of the game, and even then you have to wait till ng+ to change their underwear. Game is anime-inspired no question about it. It has several of the typical "dress styles" one will find in most Anime RPGs (Lolita,School,Maid,etc/I didn't bother looking at the male ones lol.) All of which you can collect given enough patience. Undead & Undressed is kinda a niche game, but it's cutesy and not all that intense (except given the foul language on plitter, the game's version of twitter). Would probably be OK for teens (13+) but I'm not sure about what the rating is right off hand (i think it's M, but it's likely only that because of the language). As for undressed, you never see a character truly "nude" - they always retain their underwear.","June 4, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Akiba's Trip quickly went from a "spur-of-the-moment" buy, to one that I wish I would've done sooner. The amount of polish this game has is phenomenal. Particularly in the VN aspect of it.\n\nVN Aspect: The characters are 100% voice-acted (which all of the English VAs are amazing, to my surprise! [whoever did Kati's has the cutest voice on the planet]) and their mouths move as they talk. Not only that, but the characters are all loveable, memorable, and most (read: Kaito) are hilarious. Plenty of unique CG to keep your eyes pleased too! The options you can choose from do direct you down the route you so choose, but the not-so-important dialogue choices are hilarious. Typically it's\nOption 1: "You're right. We'll succeed."\nOption 2: "I've been waiting for this all day!"\nOption 3: "BRB. Hot babe spotted. Don't go nowhere."\nEven if you don't enjoy the combat or story too much, the VN portion should give you enough fun to propel you forward and to the end. It's that good.\n\nCombat: Probably the game's weakest point, but, in my opinion, not by much at all. The fights are fun (as you progress, you unlock new strip techniques, some of which are so flashy, they made me Lol) and enjoyable. My friend says that the combat format is similar to some other games, and is a bit lackluster in comparison. But to me, it's perfectly fine and fluid enough so as not to make it UNfun. In fact, 1/4 of my time in the game was probably spent just battling random enemies for the fun of it! I dunno. I guess the combat is hit or miss, really, depending on how many similar games you've played.\n\nStory: For a game about stripping clothes off of people/vampires, the story here is pretty well-crafted. I won't give too much away, but I was impressed at the blend of reality and fantasy. It's a real place, but has some fantasy things going on, while not going completely off the deep end. Tough to really say much without spoilers, so I'll just say it's fine, but nothing completely amazing!\n\nAll in all, this game REALLY surprised me by how well-made it was. You can tell a lot of hard work, time, and effort went into most everything here. Music's really good (Toshiko Tasaki has some really great battle music in store for ya). The city layout is modeled after the actual Akihabara IRL, and you can recognize some of the streets and stuff if you've been there! Even the finer, not-so-important things like shopping, items/gear, and menus are all really amazingly done and enjoyable. I really can't recommend this game enough, and I fully intend to beat it 100% (which is something I NEVER do in games), going through every route. If you happen to see it on sale, pick it up. You'll probably be surprised like I was at just how polished, fun. and flawless it really is.\n\nPS- XSeed Games, Marvelous, Inc., Acquire... listen here.  I'll pay $5-10 for a Kati route. Pleeeeeeeease? DLC, anyone? I mean, JUST LOOK AT HER. How can you put someone so goshdarned BEAUTIFUL AND ADORABLE like that in a game and not make her have a route?!

I should read the title of every japan-made game before actually playing it.\n\nSerious thoughts + warnings at the bottom (also a summary if this is TL;DR)\nThis game is originally a console game and there have been many bugs relating to this game. I won't lie I have had multiple problems like black screen or such but they are pretty minor. Majority says their game works well including me. If you want my opinion then its a defintire yes. Why? Mainly because the story and gameplay is worth it. If you're easily offended by stripping (as in stripping people's clothes off) then don't play this game. It also has some humour at times and can be categorized under the "open-world" category. If you want some hardcore panty stripping then by all means pick up the game\n\nA short summary and some warnings about the game\nIf you've got a nvidia graphics card then don't play it cause there are a lot of problems with this game.\nI strongly recommend using a controller to play this game.\nDon't just expect pictures of partly nude girls, there are guy version as well.\nGame has multiple endings so take your time to play it.\nCheck out the community if there are anymore problems regarding the crashes and graphic problems.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game thanks to its storyline.

Although its certainly not terrible, its also not all that fantastic either.\nAttacks are focused on High, Medium, and Low. you damage the opponent's clothing before you rip it off of them...remove everything they have on, before your opponent, does the same to you.\nNow, I like this system, because its the same for the player....your three main articles of clothing become your health bars. where reaching Zero is dangerous, but doesnt kill you.\nHowever, where this falls apart, is in the weapons.\nThe game, does not take itself seriously, and it expects players to do the same. where this is an issue, is that, SOME weapons, attempt to be funny. forcing your combo to finish in a hilarious forward dive attack that leaves you on the ground for a few seconds. or converts your moves into ridiculous dance poses.\nThis is fun, yes, but its also VERY frustrating when your BEST weapon, has some combo attack that leaves you wide open for the enemy to steal your pants. (Or skirt, I'm not gonna judge)\nHowever, this is remedied upon playing New-Game Plus, or completing certain storylines, where you eventually get weapons that have you fighting more seriously.\n\nAside from combat, there's very little in the game to expand upon...the story, although decent, is little more than an attempt to make a 'logical' reason for why you need to rip off your opponents clothes, while mixing in some 'drama' so that the dating sim part of the game works as well.\nThe story does its job, and rather well at that....but to judge it as a story on its own, without the gameplay. its worthless.\nI also reccomend finding your own music, as the soundtrack of the game is rather plain, and the combat music is especially bad. (Though when compared directly to the above average combat itself, I guess they sorta go together)\n\nIn the end, I can really only say this, to truly summarize my entire point about this game,\nTake the most droll, uninteresting, and yawn-inducing Slice of Life anime you can think of, and have it meet in the middle, with Kill La Kill.\n\nWhich, If you're like me....a noble anime fan, who is willing to accept the fact they have simple tastes, enjoy a bit of time grinding away at a game with end results that inspire a resounding "Yeah~" and a self-high five; Then I'll assume you're going to like this game.\n\nThough I imagine if you actually read this entire review. You're probably already taking this game too seriously.\n\n\n","December 4, 2015","true","34.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enjoyable /simple combat, depressingly tame for Jap anime.  Great visuals.\n\nI loved this for the first hour, than just slowly had my joy for it fade as I just repeated more of the same over and over with questionable reward.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but didn't end up loving it. When given the option to replay a game I knocked out in almost no time at all, I just couldn't think of a reason I'd go back to it.\n\nIf you're here for traditional japanese anime boobs - forget it, there are none here, this is as PG13 as it gets, any nudity on enemies is glossed out by bright shiny animations.  As for your heroes, after you start playing they point out everyone is underage (wtf? why?) so even if you get a glimpse of underwear via the character equip screens, expect to feel just kind of gross about it.\n\nThe combat's not bad and if you're a clueless button masher like me, you can quickly find yourself in trouble facing large mobs - don't expect this to be the kind of combat you see in the Batman or Lord of the Rings games, it's 90% mash and 10% luck, but if your expectations are low, it's still fun.\n\nEverything looks lovely, the characters are fun - and as someone who's actually been to Akihabara, the map is awesome to wander around for how much it looks like the real city.\n\nShort version, it's worth a play if you're into cheap combat - otherwise, move along.","January 2","true","43.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

This has been the best 18.1 hours of my time.\n\nWhen i first saw this in the store, it was only for PS4 and PS vita, but timeskip to a few months later, and now it's on steam!\n\nThe battle mechanics might be a bit hard to get in your first time, but it grows on you as you play on. The targetting system may be a bit off but hey, if you "accidentaly" hit people, it seems more like a raid instead of a 1v1. The Story is also great, the outfits are really nice, and the weapon upgrades are a bit pricey, but if you sell enough of them and get up to 20000+ yen, you can sell all your 50+ ATK items and give yourself a big powerspike. While grinding might sound really boring af, it's not the same here in Akiba's Trip. Grinding allows you to maximize your chain-stripping techniques and best of all, it's also the best way to practice counters. while there is a battle arena, it's more fun to shove people, beat them up and strip them down. And not only that, on all difficulties, the AI is really cruel and punishing. Great for players who love a challenge. While a 2v1 might not seem to flashy, try shoving one and piling them up, hitting people with whatever's in your hand. The best part is the endgame rewards. I'm not gonna spoil those, so just play it and see for yourself. Best 750.99 Php i've ever spent, and the installation was worth the wait.\n\n\n10/10 Best beat-stripping game ever. hope there's another sequel to this (since this port is a sequel of the original psp port)","October 3, 2015","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tell them why they should."\n\nUmm... You get to strip every girls (including your sister) in Akihabara off their clothes and steal all their panties? :3\n\nOn the serious side, Akiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is a hybrid of visual novel dating sim with RPG elements in it.\n\n[This review may contain spoilers.]\nIn this game, there's an organization that's doing some evil experimentation on humans, turning them into artificial vampires called "Synthisters", including you (the main character). However, with the help of a mysterious girl, the main character managed to escape the experimentation lab. Even though he managed to escape, but he's already a Synthister.\n\nSince the enemies are all artificially made vampires, they are weak against the sunlight. So, you and your friends in Akihabara must strip them off their clothes and expose them to sunlight! A word of caution though - since you're also a Synthister, do not let them strip your clothes!\n\nProsYou get to choose between English voice / Japanese voice. I always preferred Japanese voice with English subtitle.\nQuite a lighthearted game. I get a lot of lol's with this game.\nCity is modeled after real life Akihabara.\nStrip everyone off their clothes and steal their underwear.\nNeutralKeyboard and mouse controls are kind of awkward. The use of a controller is highly recommended if you want to play this game.\nThe controller mapping is a little bit awkward as well. I mapped my A button to jump, but it's also the button for picking up stuff dropped by enemies. So every time when I pick up something, I'll always jump. That issue aside, it's pretty funny if you ask me.\nConsThey did not fully utilize the maximum hardware power of a PC. For example, NPCs at a further distance are turned into shadow silhouettes.\nSide missions are a bit... uninteresting. Only do them if you need extra cash or some exclusive clothes / weapons since some of the clothes and weapons only drop from side missions enemies.","June 1, 2015","true","72.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always wanted to go to Japan. After playing this REALLY want to go\n\nEquipment - lots of clothing/accessories/weapons and fun customization options to try new character layouts, even making other characters cross-dress which can be strangely hot.....\n\nWorld Map - A great way to advertise to tourists. Real buildings, shops, real flyers, maid cafes, restraunts etc\n\n\nCons;\n\nStory - A little one-dimensonal, lame villans, somewhat reminds me of Blade.\n\nControls/combat system - can take some getting used to and a little rock, paper scissors style. Can be annoying when some guy wants money and it turns out you end up causing a stripping riot. Controls a little clunky and collisions is a little hit & miss.\n\nGraphics - could be better even know its not a brand new game but could have longer draw distance, more NPC's with more unique clothing.\n\nMusic - OST is also not a strong point. A little cringy.\n\nOutdated Akihabra - I know its a bit old but it would have been good if the devs would update the city once every 2 months with new posters, big screen ad's and even roll out new outfits and cosplays from more animes.\n\n\n\nTheres more cons than pro's but for those who just love Japan its great way to show its colourful city. I really want to work in a maid cafe...... :)\n\n","July 21, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenzoku/recommended/333980/","kenzoku","Kenzoku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenzoku/","411 products in account","A really fun little hybrid between character action game, RPG and dating sim / visual novel. Has a fun and unique combat system and one of the few games that I actually enjoyed playing on the highest difficulty.\n\nAkiba's Trip is full of esoteric anime and Japanese culture references, mainly due to the fact that it's a highly detailed virtual recreation of the real life Akihabara in Japan. If you want a game where you can customise your character to look almost exactly how you want it to, then this game is for you.\n\nI found this game to have some really interesting customisation options. From the generic Torso, Legs, Head and accessory slots, there's also a slot to customise how your character walks, and how your character finishes off enemies. In addition to this, upon completing the game you gain the ability to play as nearly every character in the game as your lead character. You can also customise other lead characters in this manner.\n\nThe customisation mentioned above is obviously bare-bones at the start, as your options increase as you unlock them through playing the game. Some options can only be unlocked after clearing the game, meaning replayability is through the roof as everything is unlocked after playing through the game about 6 or 7 times.\n\nAside from the interesting customisation system, replayability, and fun anime / game references; the gameplay is solid, easy to understand, fun and varied.\n\nI found my favourite part of combat was trying out all of the different makeshift weapons, as every single one has its own moveset, animations and effects in combat. From what I can tell, there are over 100 different weapons, from wooden swords to laptops and dakimakura, that's a hell of a lot of combat variety. Even with all this variety, you end up finding a moveset you love, and for me it was my trusty ol' High Quality Wooden Sword (which I upgraded to "godlike" status along my several playthroughs).\n\nIn terms of story, the writing and dialogue isn't too bad. About as good as you can expect from an RPG in a modern fantasy style setting. But still it's no The World Ends With You! The music is fantastic, and the ambient sound ringing through the town of Akiba as you rampage around really makes the game feel like a bustling, living city when it comes to the atmosphere.\n\nNow to adress the elephant in the room. The titular (s)tripping. It might put off a lot of people, or embarrass those who want to purchase it / play it but are afraid of people on their friends list saying "Ew, are you playing a porn game?".\n\nI assure you, the stripping scenes are presented in a more humorous way, rather than sexualised or erotic. 90% of the time the most you see is a characters underwear, and if you manage to chain strip your way to a finisher where you remove the underwear as well, everything is coated in a liberal layer of censorship sparkles, so there's no chance of seeing any actual nudity. If you're worried about the game being gross and derogatory towards women, there's actually a very even split of the genders when it comes to enemies. You'll be releasing just as many men from their textile prisons as you will women.\n\nSadly there is weird unrealistic boob jiggle physics where apparently every character with breasts has them made out of some kind of gravity defying super jelly. But I guess when you buy an anime game, it's part of the package, so to speak. ♥♥♥♥♥ physics seems to be the calling card of a vast majority of Japanese developers, love it or hate it.\n\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed this game for all that it is. A tongue in cheek modern fantasy game where you use giant anime pillows to beat the clothes off of vampire-like beings until they melt while you wander around the mecca of games and anime.\n\n(Also if you dont like how the game looks in terms of colours, there's a visual editor feature where you can change literally every colour hue in the shader. So if you want you can make it look like a clown exploded on your monitor, or hey, turn it all brown and enjoy playing Call of Moe: Modern Waifu 3)","July 10, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

AKIBA's TRIP, is probably easiest described as a close but not quite a clone of what we know as "Persona".\nWith the twist of actually having to fight enemies in the actual town of Akihabara instead of going into "dungeons", as we know it from other JRPG's. Now firstly this was announced for consoles, but I am very glad to see it appear on steam as it was unfortunately NOT available for Europeans on the console market as it didn't support the European "PAL" system.\n\nWith that said, this is probably one of the most fun times I've had, once you get through the awkward and weak introduction to the game and it's protagonist. Also the controls are quite awkward at first and I strongly recommend the use of a controller for this one, otherwise, you might have troubles ever getting through the persistent introduction tutorial that will nag at you in the beginning of the game, not to mention the annoying camera angles the game sometimes throw you into when you reach the map edges of the game during fight sequences and scenarios.\n\nThis is also one of the harder games when it comes to the fighting, so if you get easily frustrated over such things, pick this game up at your own risk.\n\nOver all I recommend this game to everyone interested in JRPG's especially if you're into Persona.\nAs for replayability, there do exist several endings depending on your reputation and "actions".\nThis game gets a 8,8/10.\nNow to wait for Persona 5. x)","May 29, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What happening next was the following:\n\n{[TL;DR VERSION]}\n\nTHERE ARE ANIME WOMEN AND YOU CAN STRIP THEM AND STEAL THEIR UNDERWEAR WHILE WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING AND WIELDING A HYPERDIMENSION NEPTUNIA BODY PILLOW. THERE'S ATLEAST 5 DIFFERENT WAIFU'S EACH WITH VARIATING CUP SIZES AND DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES (Tsundere, Moe, etc) AND THEY ALL HAVE A "TRUE ENDING"\n\nYES YOU CAN STRIP YOUR WAIFU'S IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT CHOICES IN THE GAME.\nYES YOU CAN EDIT THEIR CLOTHES TO WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT ONLY AFTER SOME POINT.\nCROSS DRESSING IS UNLOCKED WHEN YOU ACCEPT A CERTAIN SIDE QUEST.\nBODY PILLOW IS PURCHASABLE FROM 5DAY'S IN ELECTRIC PLAZA FOR LIKE 5000 YEN.\n\nI R8 IT 9/10 M8 TIS GR8, LOTS OF WAIFU, LOTS OF FANSERVICE FOR TEH MAN AND TEH WOMAN THAT CAN BE REVIEWED VIA OPTIONS>PHONE BACKGROUND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\n{[ACTUAL REVIEW FOR WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THE GAME]}\n\n{[Regarding the System Requirements]}\n\nAkiba's Trip: Undead & Undressed is an amazing game that I simply love. Yes, the reccomended specs are somewhat ridiculous but I don't meet either the minumum or reccomended specs but I can run it perfectly fine. So daijobu, kimi shinai de.\n\nIf you don't meet them but your graphics card and stuff is pretty up there you should be fine (I have Nvidia GTX 680 Ti and it runs sweet.)\n\n\n\n{[Plotline]}\n\nThe storyline (Although questionable) is pretty solid;\n\nYou're an otaku shut-in who got lured in by a mysterious company offering you limited edition anime figures and any other collectibles you so desire as long as you sign this totally not suspicious contract that has fine print on it that you can't read. As any normal person would, you sign yourself up and turn up for the first day of work... Only to wake up with no recollection of what happened and to find yourself strapped to a metal table surrounded by men. At this point you choose 3 out of the possible 9 or so choices that the game gives you (Be careful, choosing the wrong one will make the "Game Over" screen appear, this is the only time in the game this happens so don't worry about the other game choices) and then a heroic bishoujo waifu bursts in and whacks the living sh*t out of one of the body-guards with her umbrella. The story goes on, you lose your first kiss. And you proceed to lead her to a gaming bar and abduct her into your group of fellow otaku vigilante friends, or the "Akiba Freedom Fighters."\n\nFrom that point onwards the game keeps developing and you have pretty much free reign to explore the game entirely. Some main quests are required to go to some of the areas in the game (Akiba Park, Battle Arena, Yobodashi Camera Area) but the only one really worth visiting is the Battle Arena for money and testing your stripping skills.\n\n\n\n{[Pro's & Con's]}\n\nPros:\n~ Can crossdress after taking a side-quest from a girl\n~ After finishing the game on any(?) difficulty you get the following;\n1) The final bosses weapon\n2) If you managed to get a TRUE Ending then you get an item that allows you to walk like your waifu\n3) Assorted shoes from different plot relevant characters\n4) Access to more customisation options from each mode/completion. Voice, Model, Skin tone, Every persons height.\n~ You can gain every persons clothing as long as you have the required mastery level\n~ You can beat people up with funny random objects\n~ One of the main missions is to strip your waifu of choice in "Training"\n~ The game is made in scary accuracy to real life Akihabara in 2012-2013, so you've basically been to Akiba now.\n~ Shizuku's ending will make you cry\n~ Offers gameplay in both Japanese and English for both subtitle and dubs\n\nCon's:\n~ The only way to defeat an enemy is to strip their clothes or tear them, I get that the purpose is to strip people but can't we have like a knockout option aswell??\n~ The stupid sister sidequest that requires you to fetch cake from like 4 different places is the worst thing ever\n~ Sometimes you may have to battle against awkward camera angles when you're supposed to be fighting Synthisters\n~ The areas you can visit are very small. You'll know where most things are within your first hour or so of running around\n~ The controls are definitely not optimised for computer usage. You can tell as soon it tells you to press A, Y, B, X and generally tells you the controls for an Xbox controller, not a keyboard.\n~ There is no way to rebind the keys once in-game, so you're required to save and quit everytime you forget one of the controls. The alternatives are to memorize the controls, or to just use a controller. Or press every letter and button until you find it.\n~ The game is smart and knows that you're playing on casual when you fight in the arena and get to rank S and ask for a battle, it literally tells you "Maybe if you were to play on Hard mode...." which is sad. And not really worth it in the end unless you want a decent fan weapon and a shrine maiden outfit\n~ For some reason they set the minimum and standard waaaaay too high for a game like this.\n~ Playing with a keyboard is most DEFINITELY harder as your strong attacks require you to move in the opposite direction while attacking. Can prove difficult without full 360 movement support.\n~ There's a store that kicks you out for being underage when you're 17. You can't actually in anyway enter this store. The store name is M's btw.\n~ Once you do every side quest and main mission that's about it. You're done. Nothing much else to do. Buy everything? Conquer the arena? Max out your gear? You can choose a different waifu path but that's really it. You're finished. Now get off of casual scrub.\n~ The scaling is really unbalanced. You're either fighting in normal where the strongest deal 200+ damage in a normal situation or in hard/otaku where the enemies deal 400+ on the weakest. It's insane, there's no consistency between the leveling. And when you do level up you don't get awarded much.\n~ Maxing out your gear to 999 doesn't help too much. When it comes down to Hard and Otaku you can still get wiped out easily in 3-4 hits.\n~ The way the game addresses you about your accumulated "Waifu Points" really hurts the ego. With either, "Doesn't care about you either way" or "Trusts you, or atleast a little bit..."\n~ Offers really unneccessary game options. What about locked-on camera or something more useful than game colouring filters?\n\n\n\n{[Overall]}\n\nOkay, so maybe there are a LOT more Con's than I expected but nonetheless, overall this game is freaking awesome, you should definitely buy it if you're looking for a solid game that offers a great story full of twists and turns and "Awww" moments and some other "Awww??" moments along with plenty of joking around and content that you can just love, then definitely, MOST DEFINITELY buy this game.","July 2, 2015","true","74.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The MC gets sucked into a contract of doing shady work for rare goods... only to become one of the vampire-ish creatures!\n\nWhile the PC version lacks some features from the PlayStation 4 version; the PC version runs great. It's a little choppy at times, but if you can forgive the engine's quirks, the dialogue is funny. Unfortunately, the English dub ruins the experience, but the original Japanese is the way to go. Also, Shizuku is waifu material.\n\nOverall, it's a fun and quirky experience. Remember to save after major events and use Casual difficulty.
