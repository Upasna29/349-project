The game itself isn't bad.  A lot of the HO scenes are a tough, which compared to some of the HO game's was a nice change of pace.  So why the negative review,  Simply put, I cannot, nor will not, condone yet another dev that slaps a port on  an app game over here and refuses to support it.\n\nThere are 5 broken achievements to the game.  If you go to the steam boards you will find that several people (myself included) have emailed the devs letting them know about it.  Their responses have been bold faced lies.  They have said:\n\n1)  They have so many versions it's hard to find the problem.  (this is the only version with achievements so. . . . ?)\n2)  They haven't been able to find the issue.  (they created the port, not a third party, which means they are the ones that coded)\n3)   They aren't sure they are going to be able to fix the issue.  (there are several devs that have just eliminated broken achievements from their games when they couldn't find the issue)\n\nAnd through all of this, they continue to gleefully sell their game with no warning on their page that some of their achievements are broken.  Buyer beware, and oh thanks for your money.\n\nI don't play games solely for their ahievements, but when they are there, I enjoy the extra challenge and replayability that they give.  I; however, also went to college not for the grades but to learn.  If I were to enter a class and find out that if I 100% every test I would receve an 85 max I would probably have been miffed (anyone still use that word?).  This is the same.\n\nNot only do I not endorse this game; I will subsequently refuse to purchase any games from the devs and publisher in the future.  There is nothing that is more telling (imo) of a person or company that will take money from you for a product or service and not stand behind it.  With so many games on steam, I would love to see valve start holding devs accountable for selling broken products and ban them from selling here again.  I love steam for all it does to fill my entertainment void at times.  Devs like this one don't deserve to be a part of it.\n\nCheers.","January 9","false","12.9"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","86","103","2","2"

It's been a while since I played a hidden object game that didn't feel too short. It also had some charming Indiana Jones references that made me smile and I really liked the protagonist. Bonus points for having different difficulty settings, that's always a nice and considerate touch. The best part is that this isn't a clear-cut hidden object game. It has many mini-games but also many adventure elements that kept my interest and made the experience even more enjoyable. Oh, and it has a bunch of extra hidden-object and other mini-games after you finish the game! Yay!\n\n\n-On the other hand the 3d animation is almost funny in it's crudeness, which becomes even worse when compared to the aforementioned jaw-droppingly beautiful illustrations. The plot may be interesting but the writing is bad. Some scenes are so poorly written that they become disconnected from one another, to the point I thought I'd skipped some in-between ones that explained how we got from point A to point B (no, unfortunately that was not the case and yes, I double-checked). The voice acting was hilariously slow and boring.\nBut most importantly the puzzles were not challenging even on the expert difficulty.\n\nI still had a good time it's true, but there's one thing that really annoyed me, and tipped the scale into me not being able to recommend this. There are 2 specific puzzles in the game, one being the final one, that are near impossible to complete on a pc. It was clear the game was meant for touch-screens and those 2 would have been a breeze if I had one. But I don't and neither should I since I bought this on Steam and not for my tablet. This is something that should have been addressed and fixed before it was released on Steam.\n\nI spent the better part of an hour trying to frantically click through the tiles of the final door puzzle. That was obviously not intended by the developers, seeing how easy that task was on tablets. It wasn't fun and neither felt rewarding when I finally made it.\n\nThere are other minor problems like some pixel-hunting and adventuring that just don't make sense -you have to look through the weirdest places to find an item that will give you a solution to a riddle no sane person would ever imagine, but they are not even close to being as irritating as the final door puzzle.\n\nSo yeah, I can't recommend it although that doesn't mean it's bad. Overall I had a good time, even if I lost some sanity points somewhere at the end. It's rough around the edges and that simply did not rock my boat.\n\nTry it at your own risk.","February 13, 2015","false","9.0"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","45","55","3","1"

Even William Shatner delivers dialogue faster than this.\nThe writer clearly wanted to make an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider epic but got lost somewhere in the endless sideplotting and should have focussed less on twists and cut scenes and more on great puzzles.\nThere is the constant backtracking, where suddenly new items shows up either just after you have visited a scene or 10 minutes later.\nThe game also has a problem in navigation in that you are really not aware that there might be extra scenes to your left or right, as it gives no indication they are there.\nI usually give these types of HO games a thumbs up due to good puzzles, good HO scenes and a decent amount of play time, but the boredom of this made me even skip the extras and the "Collectors Edition" adventure.","September 28, 2014","false","5.2"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","35","50","0","0"

I've casually observed others play them in the past, so I had some idea of what to expect.   I'm not easily impresssed, but Melissa K. and the Heart of Gold impressed me.   The production values are high.  The cinematics and voice work are better than I expected.     The artwork is top-notch.   The story that creates a narrative for the gameplay is intriguing enough to want to see how it plays out.   The puzzles so far are not brain-taxing, but they are not as brain-dead as something in recent Telltale games (which I enjoy and appreciate as interactive fiction).\n\nFor the price, this game is a steal.   We all know that Steam is now overflowing with substandard, buggy, amateur, and ill-conceived titles.  This is NOT one of those.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/recommended/321150/","balaamsass","Balaam's ass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balaamsass/","452 products in account","I was surprised at how engaging this storyline is, especially for a scripted, and hidden-object puzzler, which don't often hold my interest for long; I played through the basic story in ~under 7 hours or so.\n\ntl/dr:\nFun puzzler, will take 5+hours for an adult on first playthrough (with some use of hint button/strategy guide - which is provided in the options menu in-game); worth the price.\n\nPros:\n1.) Hint button timer can be set to fast or slow, and the difficulty of the game describes these options *clearly* at game start.\n\n2.) Cinematics can be skipped - but there is an achivement for watching them all without skipping.  Some are annoying, and all take a bit too long imo, but they're tasteful, if low budget.\n\n3.) Puzzle instructions are clear, but puzzles themselves can be challenging.  There are extra puzzles at the end, and three different difficulties for several of them.\n\n4.) Music can be turned off, but if you like Enigma-type music it should suit some of your taste.\n\n5.) Safe for kids, but not patronizingly idealistic/simplistic.\n\nCons:\n1.) For those interested in achievements/completionists, you will inevetibly need to play through at least twice if you don't carefully read the achievements.  Most can be unlocked in normal game play, but some are related to puzzles or events that are just tedious, and the skip button becomes so very easy to use, thus preventing the accumulation of a completion in some challenges.\nEDIT1a.) ALL puzzles and extras are available in the extras menu after game completion, and the achieves do pop from solving them there.\n\n2.) For those interested in stunning graphics, you will be nonplussed by the decade-old character textures and limited facial expressions, though animations are fairly fluid and overall animation quality isn't unbearable.  One character looks close to Nathan Fillian's appearance from his Firefly days.\n\n3.) Some puzzles are dependent on spotting almost miniscule variations in item texture.  While the puzzle isn't hard once you figure out what to do, finding that first tiny button is sometimes annoying if you don't know that's what you're looking for.\n\n~In terms of a puzzle game, this one get 7.5/10 from me, which means it's not a failing grade.\nEDIT - After solving the puzzles in the extras menu, this goes up to an 8.5.  Very nice!\n\n~In terms of creativity and clarity of puzzles, there were some good ones, and some were very well thought out; most will complete (and some even show the perfect solution) when you're 'close enough' that it's not absurdly tedious (the string puzzle will explain this remark): 8/10.\n\n~In terms of a story game, this one gets 8/10 from me because there were things I didn't see coming, and yet those things weren't outrageously unbelievable, though some of the plotline was difficult to follow without using hints.\n\n~In terms of technical difficulties, I ecountered none; 10/10 on this front.\nEDIT - There are five achievements that don't pop on Steam, but that do properly award in the game; assuming the devs correct this minor issue, we will (presumably) one day get all the achieves at login.\n\nVery nice work, SDP Games!\n\nThis review is based only on the base game, not the CE content.\n\nEDIT - Having finished the CE content, let me add an 8-8.5/10 for that.  You learn more about the Nathan Fillian character (he has the right personality for this, and dialogue is simple, but engaging and amusing - well done, here!) and his motivations, and gain a new player ability that makes looking at things a new way an absolute.\n\nCE content adds about 2 hours to the game (with some use of the hint button).\n\nGood game overall in its genre.  As a rule I play wargames and puzzlers, with some side-scrollers and 3rd person shooters, and this game got my attention on content alone.  8-8.5/10 overall.\n\n@Devs - Please do fix those couple of achieves! :)","June 23, 2015","true","22.5"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","4"

If you want an adventure game or you are a completionist, forget that this store page exists.\n\nLong version:Melissa K. and the Heart of Gold is a collection of good fragmented object scenes (with some classic hidden object scenes here and there) and a large number of varied puzzles. All of these have additional challenges beyond the story mode to keep the game a little fresher, and play time surprisingly high for a smartphone title.\n\nBut it’s definitely not an adventure game. For starters, it has less than half dozen locations overall. They are all beautiful, and the pseudo-3D makes it unique among this genre, but said 3D is also the foremost tool to hide everything in the stupidest spots, turning the game into a tedious pixel hunt.\n\nAnd there is the story… or more like the lack of it. It is supposed to be about the resurrection of an ancient Buddhist demon, but actually understanding it is impossible. The plot and the dialogues have zero cohesion or dramaturgy: events happen and people (dis)appear randomly, and all conversation is made up of awkwardly, boringly acted lines that have no logical dialogue structure whatsoever.\nTherefore, this game is only good to play a bunch of puzzles. But Steam has better and cheaper alternatives for that.","July 27, 2015","false","16.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/321150/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","With the tens of releases every month it’s hard to make your game stand out, especially if it’s a hidden object game and when there are already plenty of those available. Neither of those games bring new life to the genre but Melissa K And The Heart Of Gold makes a bold attempt anyway.\n\nThere isn’t much to tell because the game is meant for casual gamers and the gameplay is always kind of fun, but ultimately still too shallow. The story brings you to Thailand where you eventually have to solve a case about a missing Buddhist. Further into the game you’ll stumble upon new discoveries which require you to travel to new places and solve even more puzzles.\nThe game is shown to you from a first person perspective, which isn’t entirely fixed, but I’ll talk about that in a minute. Your objective is to then find the correct objects to click on and to occasionally solve a (relatively easy) logical puzzle. No, that’s right; it’s not all about hidden objects.\nClicking on certain objects will reveal puzzles or other objects. These objects can sometimes be used in combination with other ones, or you have might have to find a whole set of them. From time to time you have to click on an object and rotate it to unlock a certain item. So there’s actually a very decent amount of diversity to be found here.\nLater on you’ll also acquire objects like a gecko and spyglass that you can have access to all the time. The gecko for example will help you grab items from tiny holes and the spyglass can be used to zoom in on far away objects, usually to find hidden/secret messages and codes.\nIf you don’t want to solve a puzzle or don’t know what to do next you can click on a Skip button (which becomes available after a few minutes) or you can press the Hint button. The Hint button doesn’t give any penalties and can be reused after about 30 seconds, free of charge. See it as some sort of ‘Win’ button. In my opinion, there should be consequences for using things like this, but on the other hand I can understand that the developers want anyone to be able to play and finish this.\nA lot of the puzzles later on in the game are farfetched, however, and seem to be made to give the game a longer life. You can definitely tell that the developers stretched out the story. This ultimately hurts the game. Again, this is a game that would’ve been better if it was shorter. These games don’t have to be very long, as long as they’re enjoyable all the way through. I enjoyed it very much until 4 hours in, after that I couldn’t wait to just finish and quit it.\nI do have to admit that this is still one of the better hidden objects/casual adventure games out there so even though it might seem that I’m bashing the game that’s not my intention. It’s just that with games like these it’s easier to talk about the negative parts since everyone usually already knows what to expect as far as the gameplay is concerned.\n\nA cool feature that the developers introduced with this game is that the game looks 2D but in reality it is actually 3D. That perspective I was talking about in the last paragraph can also be moved to the left and right. It’s nothing fancy; don’t expect complete freedom here, but it looks great and it’s something that gives the game a little more depth. I wish more games would use this because it makes the game a lot more interesting visually. The art is beautiful and colorful and there’s plenty of detail to be found in them, but sometimes things are tucked away a bit too good.\nThe actors also did a good job with the voice acting. Some of it is still terrible, sure, but most of it is at least decent.\n\nMelissa K And The Heart Of Gold is again one of those games that doesn’t reinvent the genre but hey, at least it tried. The developer has integrated some smart (gameplay) elements that should be available in more games like these. It’s nothing big or revolutionary but still good in any case.\nFor now this remains one of the better hidden object/casual adventure games. If you’re into those I can gladly recommend this. And if not, I suggest you wait for a sale before giving it a try.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","September 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

It's essentially a point & click and hidden object game, with a cliche plot and a pretty terrible script and voice acting.  The puzzles are often well made, and there's a option (and achievements) for playing every puzzle separately and beating all of the "best scores."  Despite putting in the time and doing this, I somehow and missing a bunch of achievements for them.  Perhaps part of the game/achievements are broken.  I know some of them art on Mac at least, because there are 5 more achievements I have credit for in-game that Steam won't register.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, gameplay is a bit infuriating.  At times the narrative of the game and the nature of the puzzles are non-sensical... and you'll most likely need a guide even if you're a very seasoned adventure gamer, not because the game is difficult, just because the game doesn't always make sense within its own design.  Also, in an attempt to obtain the a final item for an achievement, I started replays of both the regular game and the Collector's Edition additional chapter.  Both of these replays are now "frozen" because of broken, insurpassable hidden object scenes that don't have the objects in them I'm supposed to be finding (this isn't a case of me not knowing what the objects are-- I've beaten these puzzles on speed runs for "best" scores and know all of the objects intimately-- they're simply missing from the puzzles).  As both of the games are now broken, I'm giving up on getting the last few achievements.\n\nAll of the achievements and broken elements aside, I'd probably rate the game a 5 or 6/10.  Because of them, we're down to about a 4/10.  Parts of the game look beautiful, but it's obviously designed for IPad.  There's one final puzzle at the end of the game that's impossible without a mouse, and seems best played on a touchscreen.  If you're trying to do it on a laptop touchpad (as I was for a time while traveling), it's impossible to complete.  Overall I found the game tedious and not very fun.","January 15, 2015","false","28.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

The graphic is pretty, and I like the animation/3d effect. But on the other hand you can really feel that this game is made for touch pad. Too much click-hold and dragging for computer user.

Why? Because I just don't know if I should give this game a praise for the sometimes marvelous graphics and Sound. Or if I should put you to the stockade of shame for bad voice acting, cutscenes that seem to sap even high powered machines and a very bad adventure script full of stereotypes and... literally superfluid sideploting.\n\nThis is more a solve a riddle game than a hidden object game. As said, the graphics are quite good and if the story of the game would be alone with the sound and the graphics be an emersive dream that you wish to go on forever...\n\nSadly, there are too many issues. The voice acting is at times a real pain in the neck, the cutscenes sometimes seem to stutter (even on a High-End Machine with new graphics adapter) and the story itself is lacking depth, logic and real suspense. The protagonist is too much of a Mary Sue character to be comfortable.\n\nSome of the riddles are ... too easy to give them any credence here, it would have been nice to brew up some new riddles which weren't recycled for the 9th Million time since 7th Guest (And at that time some of the riddles in that game were already as old as Methusala... Shaving impossible... maybe that is not a beard, but some kind of fungal growth). Other riddles were well done and even though the basic concept was used elsewhere the solution was given a new image (the floating lotus riddle for example).\n\nThe hidden object scenes were used to give the game more a feeling like an adventure, and in my opinion that too ruined some fun in this game maybe a mixed solution (as in some construction HOG and more normal HOGs to liven the atmosphere) might have been a bit more into this genre.\n\nThe important question is: Can I recomend this game? That would be a no, it is at times a too cheesy story too stereotypical and with far too much, well visiting a history lesson about Siam might have helped the game... also about the unique mythology that this land has. The price wouldn't be too high - if all things would fit into a perfect sheme - but sorry, again no. :epiczombie:\n\nOh, and yes - I will still play this game further, since I am a completionist... bad habits die hard... insanity dies even harder ;-)","March 20, 2015","false","8.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You can sit back and enjoy the plot, engage yourself in medium-hard puzzles, or just marvel at the graphics.\n\nThe graphics engine indeed represents a breakthrough for this genre: 3D effects mixed with the usual lush 2D scenes, with excellent character animation direction. It is a treat!\n\nThe background story is based on Thai Buddhism, a topic that as far as I know has never been covered in a video game before this one.

Alternates between hidden object sections and logical puzzles(where you need to find objects, combine them, use them somewhere specific, etc), and thus becomes more interesting than your average hidden object game.\n\nIt's not particularly hard and you stroll along just fine without getting frustrated, making it somewhat of a relaxing playthrough, which is helped even more by the charming artstyle.\n\nMelissa K has a bit more care for the visuals and art than most game I played in the genre. The game is actually rendered in 3D yet it emulates 2D art quite well, making it rather impressive when you actually see that it's 3D and you can see it on a few different perspectives.\n\nFor a more casual playthrough, the game offers "Skip Puzzle" and "Hints" options, which can be rather handy when you can't find that darn last piece you need.\n\nDefinitely worth it for any Hidden Object game fan, brings a few twists to the genre and it's more diverse than most of the game of the genre because of the point and click/adventure section.

I played it on the middle difficulty setting. I've completed the regular game, but I haven't yet completed the Collection's Edition expansion.\n\nAs others have said, this is better classified as a puzzle game than a hidden object game. Sure there are some hidden object scenes, but most of the time you are trying to collect objects to complete certain tasks that then result in solving a puzzle or riddle.\n\nCompared to other games in the genre, the artistry in this game is much higher quality that others (you can actually play the game at 1920x1080 and not some upscaled lower resolution). The objects do not appeared muddied or distorted like other games. The view is not constrained to static scenes. It is actually a 3D view with a locked viewing window (different scenes allow different amounts of movement and viewing). There are probably about 25 different scene locations plus about 15 "hidden object"-esque scenes. There were also some additional puzzles.\n\nThe voice acting is average. Nothing to write home about, but I've definitely encountered games with worse. Sometimes it can get a little frustrating to sit through conversations where the speaking pace just seems very ... drawn ... out... The story line was descent, although at times it wasn't really captivating (at times I felt like skipping a cut scene, but I didn't want to risk missing a key plot point or hint).\n\nThank goodness for the hint button. There were times where I didn't have a clue where I was supposed to go next. It usually ended up back tracking to a previous location where a new item had appeared or something was now clickable. I was able to complete all of the puzzles and hidden object scenes without hints, but figuring out the next destination proved tricky at times.\n\nPros:\nMany puzzles to solve. Some pretty challenging, others pretty easy\nDecent story line\nVery nice graphics for this type of game\nNot too difficult, not too easy\nCons:\nStory feels a little drawn out at times\nFull motion video could have been a little better quality. Seems like something out of 2005\nSlooooow voice acting at times\nSometimes very tricky figuring out what to do next on your own\nSome puzzle solutions seemed way out there\nOverall, I've give it about a 7.5/10","February 9, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It has an original approach to the scenes - you have to look around, they are 3D-ish. The story is not obvious, characters are interesting and animations are realy nice. Voice acting is also very agreable, even if a bit too slow for one of the characters (but I guess that was meant to suit his old age). Music and sounds are wonderful, combined with the animations and moveable scenes it's like you're in the game. Oh, and of course those Indiana Jones references :D\nBoth hidden object scenes and puzzles are difficult enough to keep the player concentrated, but not to the point of making him bang his head on the keyboard.\nI've already won the game once and I'm just about to play it again, and that speaks for itself.","March 13, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Whoever drew them had a good deal of fun and skill, and they are really nice to look at, especially the jungle and water oiasis area later in the game. Sadly the animations on the people are derpy. Your guide looks a bit malnourished, but only in his arms. And when he talks he opens his mouth way to wide for the smallest words; it's kind of like an awkward play-dough. Same goes for a monk you meet later. The animations on Melissa during cut-scenes aren't that bad, but her boobs are jacked.\n\nThe story isn't bad, but it is spotty. I never heard anything about Queen Elizabeth in game, contrary to the description. I do know Melissa works in an office and gets invited to teach a young monk in Bangkock politics or something similar. Why? No idea. Apprently she's famous and gets a huge warm welcome when she arrives that's featured in the papers. The little monk goes missing and you gotta find him. There's quickly some hint towards the paranormal with some scenes that made me jump because they literally come out of no where. No build up, no warning; just bam, creepy imagery and delightfully terrifyinig sound effects.\n\nMelissa has some visions, blah, blah. There's a lot to do with Buddism and the legend around it and the atmosphere is very nice. You meet this random guy that literally shows up out of no where but apprently Melissa knows - he's an old professor or some such, and either they screwed each other some time in the past or they both kind of wish they screwed each other and never got around to the act. I don't know if there are others of this games that should make me understand, but I'm lost from just playing this one.\n\nOtherwise the gameplay is nice. Good clicking, and you can move the mouse to give you different perspectives in the scenes, which works really nice to give it a more 3D/real enviroment feel. Puzzles aren't too hard and sometimes might be too easy. I'm playing on medium because easy is literally TOO EASY.\n\nAnyhow. The voice acting is pretty good, the cutscenes can end a bit suddenly and be a bit rushed, but the commentary from Melissa can be rather funny and she's overall the best character.\n\nI reccomend the game because, despite the flaws, it's a pretty good with a pretty good storyline, when you know what's going on. Just don't buy it for full price; I'd say 50 percent off or less.\n\n7/10\n","July 12, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Graphics are well-done, story isn't bad (though it starts sort of abruptly, with no real intro). It bothered me a bit that one of the logic puzzles actually had multiple solutions that satisfied all the listed conditions. It's also not very obvious that you can switch between silhouette mode and word-list mode in the hidden object scenes. Overall, certainly worth a play if you like hidden object games.","July 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a game with such a low price, this has quite high production values. The voice acting is quite good, the hand-drawn art is beatifully done, and the 3D rendering was also mixed in very well for a seamless experience. Most of the point and click puzzles were challenging enough without being too overwhelmng.\n\nThat said, the final "reverse Tetris" puzzle was very annoying and felt out of place due to being more of an arcade game instead of a logic puzzle. I guess it's meant to be a bit of a joke because there's an achievement for failing this particular mini-game 10 times, but it still really didn't have a place when compared to the other puzzles.\n\nMy only other gripe is that a few of the individual solutions didn't make a lot of sense. There were a few times when the game (via the "hint" button) showed me the solution and I thought to myself, "Seriously? I would never have made that association."\n\nEven with those bumps, the game was primarily a smooth ride. The story was enough to keep my interest and there were several nods to the various "Indiana Jones" movies and made me smile. If SDP games makes more games like this (minus the arcade-y bits) I'll be a repeat customer for their games.","December 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game itself classifies the mini games into 2 parts: Puzzles and Hidden Object. The puzzles are basically a different and unique mini game while the hidden object is... just like other hidden object games where you have to find specified items. There are some collectibles in this game, although you can't see the progress unless you are in adventure mode (story mode). Other than that, it's basically the same as other games with the same type (read: Artifex Mundi games).\n\nStoryTo be honest, i got some trouble in understanding the story. The story doesn't flow quite well, and the messed-up subtitle timing makes it worse. I like how they are talking in a normal speed in cutscenes, but other than in cutscenes, people are talking too slow for me. I know that it's kinda normal for a game like this to have people talking very slow, but i think it's not needed.\n\nSwitching to the plot, although the big picture of the story is given out, the story lacks detail, especially on how they are not even telling why they have to move to another place. The tasks given on the game doesn't really flow well (especially when you have to talk to someone out of nowhere and some items which are appearing out of nowhere) and i have to admit that i will have a lot of trouble if i'm not playing this game with a walkthrough in hand.\n\nGuideBecause this is a collector's edition, there is a guide on this game. I just want to say that the guide section doesn't really well-made, and i rather use the steam guide rather than the in game guide. The guide is only listing pictures and youtube video, and it loads slowly when i open it for the first time.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics in this game is decent. I hope you are not expecting graphics in AAA titles in this game, because it's far from that. However, i am impressed with the details for the face part and how the mouth are syncing with the voice. The environment details are made greatly, and i was really touched with how the artists were trying to make the environment as close as the real one (you can see it on the bonus track).\n\nSoundWell, i can't really say much about sound in a game like this, because they give off the same vibe. The music is kind of relaxing and slow, which makes a perfect sound, especially when you are doing the mini games. The voice overs are done beautifully, especially the "crazy monk", because imo, that's the one who were giving the most effort in doing the voice overs. However, i have to admit that the ghosts voice are hard to be heard.\n\nMini gamesThere are a lot of mini games in this game, with some being easy and some being hard (this includes both the puzzle and hidden object games). Some puzzles have difficulty level which gives another difficult level to solve, while some hidden object games have a different type of hidden object: a hidden object game with a text as the list-to-find-items besides images. To be honest, i enjoy the mini games a lot, especially the puzzles. Although the hidden object is just the same as you'll expect, there are tons of variations in the puzzles.\n\nConclusionThis game can satisfy you in weekends with its long playtime and you can enjoy it to the fullest with tons of mini games on it.\n\nPros:\n- Tons of mini games\n- Collectibles\n\nCons:\n- Story doesn't flow well\n\nShould you buy this game?Yes\nNote that it only applies if you don't mind with the missing achievements, otherwise, Don't buy it.

I thought the theme was pretty unique and fitting for the genre. The game does have some flaws but they seem standard for the type of game( being stuck until you complete the series of events in the exact right order or clicking something in the exact right spot). I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the dialogue throughout the game. I also liked that you can go back and play any of the completed puzzles individually and that each puzzle had a little information blurb to click and find out what you needed to do to. The game has a good assortment of puzzles and hidden object puzzles. Also - how can you not like a game that gives you a gecko to name !","June 4","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
