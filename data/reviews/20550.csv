I have mixed feelings about recommend this or not. Let's start the Review:\n\nRed Faction 2 when compared to its predecessor, is a disappointment. Despite maintaining certain foundations established in the first part, mainly due to technical issues.\n\nPROS :\n\n- LOTS of weapons (with primary and secondary shot system for each one as in the first part).\n- The shooting mechanics makes some intense gunfights fun.\n- Sections where you drive vehicles are well made ​​and are quite fun.\n- Apart from the primary mission objectives, the game have hidden secondary objectives for each map, which when completed, will give you bonus points.\n- Karma system that varies the ending of the game (Accomplish the primary and secondary objectives provides you of good Karma, while doing bad actions like killing innocent civilians, will give you bad Karma).\n\nCONS :\n\n- Generic story.\n- Easily forgettable characters.\n- Clearly this is a PS2 port (You can easily notice it viewing the avaliable options, not to mention the graphics).\n- Enemies and allies AI is doubtful.\n- There are sections where enemies respawn infinitely until you pass a certain point.\n- Exploration of the maps is practically non-existent (compared to the first game).\n- The Geo-Mod technology is implemented despite being not quite exploited.\n- Ridiculously short (the campaing last 5-6 hours).\n\nIf you can get past the fact that this is a direct port of a PS2 game, and you value the game for what it is (a short, mindless, linear first person shooter focused only in killing whatever you have in front) you may like it, if you want something deeper, you won't find it here.\n\nMy Score: 5.8/10\n\nNote: Played it on Windows XP - SP3","February 15, 2014","true","6.4"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","62","77","0","3"

The original Red Faction was quite a success (in terms of quite positive reviews and sales) so a sequel was eventually determined to come out soon. Originally a console game and later ported to the PC, it tries to outmatch its predecessor with more action, more vehicles and with a definitely more stupid storyline. What's the final result?\n\nOf course it's not as good or original as Red Faction I. The charm of sneaking around in a Mars colony is nowhere to be found anymore (there's really no link to the story of the first game), the gameplay got definitely dumbed down and the level design is extremely linear. To make it worse, you can no longer make use of the legendary GEO MOD engine as in Red Faction I. You are partly able to blow out some walls or pillars, but that's all. GEO MOD my ♥♥♥.\n\nNonetheless I must admit that riding vehicles or blowing away enemies with your yellow grenade launcher can be quite fun. The focus definitely lies on action and that's not necessarily a bad thing. On the other side the cons really let you down after all.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Non-Stop action\n+ Many vehicles\n+ Many weapons\n+ A not so bad second half of the game\n\nThe Bad:\n- Dumb, repetitive gameplay\n- Linear level design\n- Boring, foreseeable story\n- A horrible first half of the game\n- No real replay value\n- No real multiplayer available, only a bot mode\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Non-skippable ingame cutscenes (I HATE that, seriously)\n\nIt's really hard to recommend this game in retrospective. It's an ugly console child with a horrible first half and a more interesting second part. If you still decide to buy it, at least do so during sales or via the Red Faction Collection.\n\n4/10","October 16, 2014","false","5.0"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","37","59","0","0"

There are better games. This game is.... it's bad. It's essentially what Red Faction: Armageddon (I mean, Armageddon was disappointing comparing it to Guerilla, but that is at least better than this blasphemy) was to Red Faction: Guerilla. Red Faction 1 was fun, interesting, but... Red Faction 2 is just... like, at some points I found myself having mild fun while playing it, and then the feeling of numbness just returned after a while. The characters are bad, the story is awful, and... did they really have to remove/lessen the extent of how destructible environments were? I know in Red Faction 1 they were there, but in Red Faction 2...\n\nAlso, perhaps something I should have started out by saying, this game has literally nothing to do with the Red Faction. It doesn't even take place on Mars, it takes place on Earth. I played Red Faction 1 prior to this game and remember thinking "I'm having fun." but when I was playing this game I just sort of spaced out and kept thinking to myself "Why am I playing this? I have hundreds of other games I could be playing.". The terrible voice acting just droning on and on... my Steam time for this game is like 3.8 hours. I won't lie, after the first hour and a half of playing this game I just wanted it to be over, so I turned on the cheats and just suffered/blasted through the rest.\n\nI can't even get over the fact that they called this Red Faction. It's not Red Faction. Thus, if you're actually looking to play through this series (or more likely, you played either Guerilla or Armageddon and are interested in giving the older games a shot which is how I ended up here, play Red Faction 1, and then skip over this one. You will literally be missing nothing.)\n\n1/10","July 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/20550/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Red Faction II is a sequel of Red Faction by Volition Inc. While the first game has you starting as a simple miner caught up in the rebellion and you end up being the best soldier capable of defeating even mercenaries, this one has you playing as Alias, one of the few nano-tech enhanced soldiers left in the world, joining Red Faction against the authoritarian regime of Sopot and his elite guards. The story felt very derivative and rather lame, compared to the "fish out of water (that turned out to be a shark)" story of the first. This time, you're simply better than anybody else, and everybody knows it. You're the demo guy, while others in your squad are scout, sniper, heavy weapons, vehicles, and commander.\n\nGraphics are good for the time, and Red Faction has a feature called "Geomod" which allows certain walls or terrain features to be destroyed, creating alternative avenues of approach. However, what's destructible and what's not are not obvious and you don't have indefinitely amount of ammo for experimentation. in the single player you will sometimes have to create exits with the explosives.\n\nBased on tech of the time, poly count is relatively low, but tolerable. Texture was state of art back then and merely tolerable now. The fun part is the gun play, but this is an old-school shooter... no lean, no cover and blind shoot, no tagging, What you see and aim in the crosshair is what you get. And you get to carry bazillion weapons... single or double pistol, machine pistol, and later, nanotech pistol (single hand means you can throw grenades, doubled gun can't use grenades). Then you get to shotgun (dual barrel, one with regular buckshot, other with incendiary) SMG, assault rifle, assault rifle with grenade launcher, LMG, rocket, grenade launcher, sniper rifle, railgun, and other fancy weapons. There's also grenade, incendiary grenade, and satchel charges.\n\nYou will also sometimes get to play with vehicles, such as aerial gunner (man the turret!), submarine fighter (launch torpedoes), tank (main and coax guns), as well as armored suit with rockets and twin gatlings, just to break up the monotony of shoot, shoot, and shoot.\n\nThere are occasionally severe lack of hints, as you are given NO IDEA on where to go, but if you explore a little, there's probably a door you need to open, or a hole you need to make bigger, or a wall you need to jump over, and such. And to encourage you to go on your way, an infinite number of enemies will spawn to "encourage" you to move along and since your ammo is limited, you should move along, albeit this was never explained anywhere.\n\nOn easy level your health resets to 100% between stages, so that makes the game quite a bit easier. Furthermore, your health autoheals if you stay out of combat for about 10 seconds. You can have up to 3 health kits on you, and they will auto-heal you when your health gets too low. Obviously that means you should not get hit that often, lest you run out of them! Fortunately, they often can be found on dead soldiers (just run over them to collect). It's only later that there are certain enemies that don't leave loot.\n\nAll in all, RF2 is an also ran. In making the protagonist a super-soldier, it also lost most of the charm of "fumbling your way around" of the first RF game. Not to mention the plot is virtually cliche. Basically, you do the heavy lifting, someone else reap the benefits, and then there's the... surprise! :)\n\nI managed to finish it in a couple hours, and I'm not a speed-run guy. It's just very short in single player. I imagine there can be more fun in MP, but being this old, MP lobby's long dead. It's kinda fun for historical purposes, and it's cheap, but you'd probably be better off with a modern RF, like RF: Guerilla or such.\n","July 31, 2015","false","6.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","2"

Over all the game was good, the plot wasn't to bad, but the twist in the plot was pretty lame, which they could of easily just ended, but didn't, also the bots in this game were alright, not the greatest. If you wonder if this game tied to the 1st game, it's hard to explain, but none of the characters from red faction 1 has anything to do in red faction 2 plot other than the plot that carry over at the start of the game about the nanobots technology which used to make super soldiers, which doesn't tell you about any of the character from red faction 1, as to what happen to them or what.\n\n\nPros:\n- Bots are pretty good.\n- Playing the game on certain difficulties to unlock game contents.\n- Has Bots to fight in a match such as team deathmatch, etc...\n- Get to customize the bots for Bots match, such as behavior, stats, etc...\n- Great boss fight challenge at the end.\n- Lots of weapons to use in game to choose from.\n- Awesome vehicles to use in game, mostly liked the battle armor.\n- Destroying some environment.\n\nCons:\n- The Plot has some pretty bad flaws.\n- Hit boxes wasn't that great compare to the 1st game.\n- Mostly simple and easy to beat the game.\n- There no online/lan Multiplayer, only Bots match, where you fight nothing but just bots.","January 9","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

This is not only a downgrade compared to the first game, but it's a radically different kind of game whatsoever. Not that I have a problem with something different, but when the first game was already quite original and interesting, sacrificing that in the name of dumb, macho straightforward action with a laughable storyline and unappealing characters. The level design ranges from frustratingly confusing to infuriatingly linear "Call of Duty" style, complete with piles of rubble conveniently blocking the paths you can't follow. What's worse is that the game boats is Geomod feature, but makes poor use of it -- you can never know when you're allowed to blast your way through a door or wall, or just patiently look for another way around it. And really, when you have rockets and grenades that can punch massive holes in regular walls, not being able to walk through a simple locked door is pretty insulting.\nIf there is something that could salvage this game is the weapons, which are pretty nice and diverse, but weapons alone don't make a good game. The bad level design and arbitrary variations of difficulty along the way work against the fun constantly. But what utterly killed the experience are the unskippable cutscenes. Now, the first Red Faction also had those, but you could save the game anytime and anywhere, so you could conveniently save after one of those. But here, you're not allowed to save manually, and you can only restart between level transitions; and some of them have some extremely long and boring cutscenes at the immediate start, especially the tough boss battles. I have no problem with a tough boss, but when I'm forced to idly stare at the screen for 20-30 seconds to watch a cutscene I have already watched, and which adds no information at all about the game, that drives me nuts.\nOverall, it's a huge wasted potential: it's not very fun, it's very ugly and boring to look at, and it doesn't follow the original game at all. If you really expected something to carry on the experience of Red Faction, abandon all hope.","June 28, 2015","false","4.0"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/u2ezxaphiara/recommended/20550/","u2ezxaphiara","-[Caesar]_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/u2ezxaphiara/","144 products in account","Many years ago I had played the demo version of this game on Playstation 2, which included most of the second level. Having played the first game on the same console, I had a higher expectation of this one.\n\nThe game feels and looks basically the same as the console version. There are a few subtle good things worth mentioning upfront. It would have been one of the first games to move towards some proper dual-wielded weapons- in which left-click fires one and right-click fires the other. It has an interesting way of introducing each (admittedly bland) character upon your first encounter with them. It has fancy animations on the edge of the screen when putting on your nightvision goggles (rather than just instantaneously switching like most games) or getting into a "Battle Armour"- unlike most games of the time, in which the player was simply in a vehicle right after pressing the button to enter it. One weapon- the NICW- even has a digital ammo count on the side of it, reminiscent of the Assault Rifle from the original game.\n\nUnlike the PC version of the original, this includes a Bot Match mode against AI-controlled players- something which was in the console version of the original. This is a typical Quake-style deathmatch which strangely has a different HUD- and the weapons behave differently. For example, the Rail Driver in single-player has 3 rounds and a reload between each. In Bot Matches, this same weapon has 6 rounds and only requires a reload after firing all 6...\n\nThe story is almost cringeworthy at times. It goes on a semi-political bent and basically has all the characters betray you shortly after first meeting them. It has almost no connection whatsoever to the story of the original game. It reuses some music assets from the first game in Bot Matches- some of the techno-style tracks from the first game, some of which are quite impressive.\n\nThe game is basically linear and very poorly designed in some parts. The sewer level's beginning is one of the better examples of this. Everything is maze-like and you'll probably just get through it guessing where to go- having to shoot at the same constantly respawning enemies along the way. Once you're at the end of the level, you probably won't be able to think about the map design in your head. Trying to understand the maps... your thoughts will be about as murky as the sewer water.\n\nThe game's difficulty is also really inconsistent. You will find some shockingly easy parts and then run into a boss battle with an enemy possessing a ridiculous amount of health and respawning minions to assist them. Boss battles should have been toned down, standard gameplay should have toughened up. You can't leave a vehicle that you have entered unless you are in a certain area. You can't skip cut-scenes- prepare to rewatch the same one before a boss battle several times if you die in it. The game includes a fairly rudimentary health regeneration- where you essentially have one small health bar and you automatically use a health kit once that health bar runs out. You don't manually use your health kits- nor does it take time to use them. You will finish it in 3-4 hours (maybe less) if you don't die much through it.\n\nAs many other reviewers have stated, this is something of a downgrade on the first game. For something from a professional studio- Volition- it is almost unforgiveable. I think most players will find this game to be extremely generic and short- a 5/10 at best. Spend your money on the first game instead.","March 17, 2015","false","6.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/20550/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Red Faction II is the sequel that fans of the Red Faction franchise would rather forget. Decent graphics for the time, trouble free gameplay (no crashes & full 1080p), multiple environments (some levels are completed on foot, others in planes, others in tanks, others in power armor), and great voice acting (Jason Statham!).\n\nSo what are the drawbacks?\n\nRed Faction II contains little or nothing that made the first Red Faction game a classic. The game is linear as hell. So was the first game, you might say; but even within the levels, there often were multiple ways to progress. Not so in Red Faction II. What about Geomod and destructible terrain? Well, that's still here, kind of. There's plenty of stuff that is destructible. But instead of unlocking different routes, Geomod's role is reduced to the only path. One level begins with Alias in an alley with both ends blocked off. There's no way to progress forward. Oh, wait, shoot those barrels. Boom! The wall explodes and (realistically) crumbles, opening a hole to walk through. There's your Geomod.\n\nAlso missing is the Everyman character. Parker (Red Faction), Alec Mason (Red Faction Guerrilla), and Darius Mason (Red Faction Armageddon) were all ordinary joes called upon to be heroes. In Red Faction II, we play as a Nano-agumented super soldier who is already special. The plot might look fine on paper – super soldiers attempt to overthrow a despot – but the execution isn't even up B-movie standards (maybe C-movie standards). And while the voice acting is good, there's no emotional attachment with Alias (your character), even when he is betrayed and has to fight an entirely new enemy about half-way through the game.\n\nRed Faction II is also short for a fps. A complete run-through clocked in around 5 hours. The enemies are generic and repetitive (even the “zombies” of later levels present little challenge). If you're good at getting head-shots, you'll be able to coast through this one. The boss battles do present a decent challenge; the final boss is insanely hard / old school at first. Then I realized his pattern (from which he never deviates), and beat him in 90 seconds. There was one boss that had a charged electrical field for protection; if he got too close, and you became electrocuted, all of your controls become inverted (left is right, down is up). That was fun and a great challenge.\n\nBut one unique and fun boss isn't enough to save a game, and unfortunately Red Faction II has little else of interest. Skip it unless you can get it REALLY cheap.\n\nOf note: If battling bots is something you like, you might be interested in Red Faction II's highly customizeable Bot-Match mode. There are quite a few maps and a great variety of weapons.","January 14","false","8.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It's PC port was augmented with a very fun online multiplayer mode.\n\nRF2 has a decent sense of plot, but to be honest, I didn't care for it until I was on the verge of beating the game for the first time. Something in the second half of the game caused the plot to 'click' with me in the sense that I started to give a damn about the story. In fact, I felt motivated to replay the game to better understand the story and characters that I previously found dull and unworthy of my attention. For that reason, I actually enjoyed replaying the game more than the experience of taking it in as a new experience. RF2's plot is merely serviceable, whereas RF1's plot is interesting enough to keep you playing to see what happens next.\n\nRF2's gameplay is mostly fine. The limited extent to which you can create improvised stairs, entrances, and tunnels by blowing up concrete and terrain is one of RF1's major highlights. Unfortunately, this 'GeoMod' feature is so limited in the sequel that it's virtually non-existent. I found far more instances where 'GeoMod' technology could be actualized in multiplayer maps than in the single player campaign. The fact that RF2's solo campaign is far more linear than RF1's* does nothing to offset this disappointing discrepancy, and the fact that RF2 features no online or even LAN capabilities makes the multiplayer mode a tremendous disappointment. Playing RF2's multiplayer mode against bots is no substitute for playing it with real people.\n\nRF2 is one of the first games I can remember playing that features regenerating health, but it features a hybrid system that combines traditional FPS health management with Halo-esque health regeneration. To its credit, RF2's plot legitimizes the fact that the character you play has the capability to heal. Because healing occurs at a far slower pace than in Halo and the tons of clones it spawned, taking damage in battle does not feel inconsequential unless you make a contrived effort to stall the game by holding your ground after a battle.\n\nI give RF2 a score approximating 6 out of 10, which might be a tad generous. It's not a horrible game, but it's not worth worth going out of one's way to acquire. Give it a try if you invested in the Red Faction bundle, which is worth getting for RF1 and RF: Guerilla.\n\n* = Some of RF2's vehicle-based sections literally play like rail shooters. In contrast, RF1 gives players the freedom to fully explore their environments while operating vehicles.","March 20, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

Some levels feature traditional FPS gameplay, other levels have you riding a vehicle blowing things up.\n\n+ Short game, this is good because you want it to end quickly.\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe level design is all over the place. It ranges from boring, uninspired to sometimes confusing.\n\nThe game has a lot of level destruction which is really cool except the game doesn't do a good job of telling you which walls can be destroyed and which can't. Only certain walls/objects can be destroyed which sometimes makes for a frustrating experience. Whenever I got stuck in a level I began to blindly fire rockets/grenades at all the walls around me in the hopes that one would get destroyed and reveal a path. It's a cool feature but one that wasn't executed as well as it should have been mostly because of the technological limits at the time.\n\nGraphically it looks worse in some areas than the first game.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The story, characters and dialogue are bland, boring and very forgettable. It was hard to like any of the characters, the story made no sense and I couldn't care less about what was going on, I just wanted it to end.\n\n- The first game takes place on mars and featured some varied and unique environments which made this game all the more disappointing when it takes place on earth and most of the levels feature bland office spaces or large empty areas filled with bullet sponge enemies.\n\n- Unskipable cut scenes especially placed before frustrating boss battles. The game is pretty easy (on medium settings) but the bosses are basically bullet sponges.\n\n- Lack of quick save/quick load\n\n- Terrible 360 default controls: Either I experienced a bug or the person who did the default controller controls was tripping out on acid. Pushing the right joystick left made me walk forward, right joystick up made me walk backwards, etc. nothing made sense. Stick to keyboard and mouse.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAren't sequels suppose to be better? This game takes a large step backwards. After the first Red Faction game the series had real potential to be really good. The first Red Faction reminded me of Half Life in its linear level design and pacing, this game reminds me of quick cash in and a poorly made one at that.","April 24, 2015","false","4.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It isn't deep, it isn't an industry leader, but it is a fun game. I know this because I had it on my gamecube back around 2004, completed it, and always remember it as an underrated shooter.\n\nWhat does it get wrong?\nWell, they will tell you it is shallow, predictable, a bit bland and a big departure from what made the original game so good.\n\nWhat does it get right?\nWell how about I answer this question with a bit more depth:\n\nI want to make it clear that I played the first Red Faction, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the gameplay, setting, and also the little 'glass house' side game. I didn't feel any sense of disappointment, however, when I played this sequel.\n\nThe game starts with you acting on behalf of a corrupt dictator (looked a bit like one S Hussein) as part of his elite counter-goodperson squad, sieging a base of revolutionaries. The mission introduces you to fellow cybernatically augmented comrades, destructable environments, a great assault rifle/grenade launcher weapon, and sets you up for a campaign of twists, thrills and spills.\n\nThe very next mission has you and your turncoat comrades storming the central government tower of the dictator, blasting chunks out of his gigantic stone bust, flying through the streets shooting fools from a gunship gunnery seat, and getting right into the nitty gritty of joining the Red Faction.\n\nMissions are varied. Weapons are also varied and generally well balanced. Pacing is good and tight, maps are thoughtfully conceived and often showcase the wide range of vehicles one can make use of. The graphics and gameplay may be getting outdated these days - how could they not? - but the fun of the game shines through yet. Incidentally, the console version had multiplayer with good bot AI and some great scenarios, something that was golddust on the often PG rated gamecube system.\n\nI don't know why people didn't like this game, even if it didn't blow my mind in the same way Halo or Metroid Prime did, I really enjoyed the storyline - in the later stages of the game the levels get really good indeed - and I actually thought some of the weapons were pretenders to iconic status, the relatively vintage AK-like assault rifle, the aforementioned super assault rifle, the blocky shotgun and dual weilded submachine guns were all really great.\n\nI think you can get a raft of shooters that may be better, but this shooter deserves to be played if only because of the hours that went into producing it, the genuinely wide range of things they developers got right, and the unfair blasting it has routinely suffered from critics.","May 23","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you aren't tech-savvy and have a newer computer, you most likely won't like this game. Getting this game to run was frustrating, but finally solved after about a half hour.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent weapon variety\n+ Satisfying gunplay (sometimes)\n\nCons:\n- Numerous on-rail segments\n- Graphics and voice acting from 2003\n- Lackluster "geomod" gameplay [1]\n- Unskippable cutscenes immediately after checkpoints\n- Annoying boss fights (bullet sponges)\n- Uninspired story that only makes sense if you're on drugs\n- Uninspired level design that ranges from dull (offices) to confusing (sewers)\n- No challenge on medium difficulty [2]\n- Extremely short at 3 hours (this might be a good thing)\n\n[1] The GeoMod technology is the cornerstone of Red Faction. Red Faction: Guerilla is considered the best of the series because of how far they took it. This game, not so much. There is no destroyable terrain, only a handful of walls that almost always need to be destroyed to progress. There was no strategy element to it as enemies always know where you are and there is no debris to take cover behind.\n\n[2] I can count the number of times I died to normal enemies on one hand.

Like really really bad. No where near as bad as RF:Armageddon (mainly because RF:A was disappointing and not actaully a bad game).\nThe story is nowhere to be found and pointless, the characters are forgetable (i didn't realise that I was Alias until the end, and I have no idea who everyone else is), the boss battles are... strange. For example: after working my way through the graveyard I had to defeat the woman on the balcony. Upon doing so, as I shot my rifle for the last headshot, the sound effect of the rifle was cut short, screen turned black and I was thrown into the next level. That was it. No dialogue, no explaination on how I ended up on the next area or how I ended up holding a new weapon that appeared out of nowhere. Don't get me started on that damn submarine area! The water is so bad that I couldn't see anything until I was almost dead!\nI am so glad I bought the RF bundle and not this game on its own. Its not a red faction game. It's nothing comapred to the first. I cant find anything good about it, and I can't be bothered to complete the last few levels.\n\nJust no.","May 13","false","5.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You'll only need them on the bosses anyway, who have a lot of health. You can just breeze through the rest of the game.\n\nThen there's the story... It's forgettable at best. It's also too short and too fast, so when the game tries to have even the slightest form of character development, it falls flat on its face, since 5 minutes later you gotta kill your former allies (whom you've just met).\n\nAnother disappointment is that destruction is more limited than the first game.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is that it's really short, so you won't have to endure it for long if you chose to play it.","August 6, 2014","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","6"

Red Faction 2 doesn't take place on Mars. It doesn't have a whole lot to do with the first game at all, really, and that's okay with me. I love/hate Red Faction. I hate it because the AI was awful, the geo-mod was not entirely impressive or overly useful, and the levels were linear and sparsely decorated. It felt like a crap Half-Life. I did, however, enjoy the couple of vehicle sequences and, for some reason, feel compelled to play through the game every now and then, if just to remind myself how much it sucks.\n\nHere's what Red Faction 2 does right; more vehicle sequences (the battle mech is particularly fun), better graphics and effects (like rain), and a more interesting story with love and betrayal. The AI still amounts to running around or standing stark still while being shot in the face. The levels are still super linear, and particularly short. Geo-mod provides some neat effects sometimes but I don't think I tore down a single building.\n\nThe biggest flaws Red Faction 2 has are one particularly painful boss fight, and the game is very short. The one boss fight takes place in a cathedral, where snipers respawn in the balconies, and zombies respawn on the ground floor, and between those two you have to find time to whittle down a human size boss's lifebar from halfway across a large room. It is not fun. And the whole game, respawns and all, took me less than three hours to complete. That's Kane & Lynch 2 short.\n\nBut, it is an improvement over Red Faction, even if that's not saying much because Red Faction is pretty awful.","November 25, 2013","true","3.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The menu system is hell to navigate, and no quicksave means if you quit you'll have to sift through a dozen screens to get back to where you were. The story is 100% cliche and has nothing to do with the first game. Even the graphics are worse!\n\nIt is also unforgiveably brief. After a few boring establishing levels rife with uninspired rail-shooting, you get to drive a mech for the first time. After strapping in to this supposed "death machine", you emerge from a garage into a small alley with an invincible enemy attack vehicle blocking one exit and an impassable cement wall blocking the other. There is no way to destroy this vehicle or exit this alley whatsoever, so I have to assume it is the end of the game. You just flail around wildly while your health is whittled down to zero. This occurs about two hours in, and is either the result of lazy development, or an ingenius message about the futility of war.\n\nAvoid like the plague.

It's not even a poor imitation because it isn't even an imitation. It's just poor.\n\nAnyways what I'm getting at is, buy the first one, buy the bundle if it's cheap, I don't care.

It was a much needed graphic overhaul on the original RF engine. Lots of new features, but lots of...downtones. The game has its high points and low points. High points being playability is far greater, more game types for bot matches, and customizability for the matches. Lots of unlockable stuff by playing the game too. The down points however is. Not everything is destroyable in the game. Only specific things. The game play is liniear, theres not much exploration that can go on. Its straight forward. The only thing that bothers me worse is the controls. Its aiming system in this version is pretty bad. Even with tweaking of mouse sensitivity its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to aim.

Only slight issue was its not as long as the 1st. But that doesnt matter, because when it comes to having it higher difficulty, it'll get you to pay attention. Though i just beated this on hard mode, and i gotta say. The final boss battle i couldnt breathe when i beat it.\n\nI wont go further on the details of the game, its less graphics and surely you should be able to run it. Multiplayer i havent paid attention to it, but when i do i'll probably give it a shot since i was mainly focus on the single player campaign. But nonetheless i'll try it when i feel like it.\n\nThe game is also interesting than the 1st because in the 1st game, you are basically one man army. While this game, you get more help than the 1st. But regardless, there are times when you are alone.\n\nThe game is quite very promising when i paid it and was well worth it. I say give this game a try and recommend anyone that is up for a challenge.

But I sort of felt this was needed.\n\nWith Red Faction II, I went in blind, expecting some continuation of the story from Red Faction. What I got was a mess.\n\nRed Faction is a great game, with an interesting story and characters that, whilst somewhat wooden, are still decent and have their uses, dealing with a corrupt corporation that is using it's workers as test subjects for horrific experiments, so with Red Faction II, I expected something similar, maybe playing as a member of the Red Faction or Earth Defence Force, getting rid of remnants of the Ultor Corporation or whatever.\n\nInstead you're playing as a super soldier on (what I assume is) Earth, to bring down the leader of The Commonwealth, a previously unnamed political organisation, and getting your hands on or destroying some sort of Nano technology that is loosely connected to the first game, and even saying loosely is a stretch, aside from the name, there is basically no connection to the rest of the Red Faction series.\n\nCalling the characters wooden would be an insult to trees. I found myself unable to actually care about any of them, even the guy I was playing as, and once I was rid of the BBEG known as Sopot or something like that, I found myself with a new BBEG, my... old commander... who's reason for this was "hurr durr we need more nano soldiers because war reasons". Basically imagine a dumbed down and uninteresting version of Sundowner from MGR and you're pretty close to the mark.\n\nThen he gets stabbed in the back by one of the guys who originally helped him stab you in the back after he branded you an enemy of the Commonwealth for... reasons, I suppose? It's never actually cleared up aside from "You were helping the Red Faction" which is something we were all doing.\n\nThen it's all wrapped up in some sort of 1990's TV Series "Where are they now?" segment, which would have been funny if it wasn't for the fact they were 100% dead serious with this.\n\nI also managed to complete the whole game in about two hours.

But I sort of felt this was needed.\n\nWith Red Faction II, I went in blind, expecting some continuation of the story from Red Faction. What I got was a mess.\n\nRed Faction is a great game, with an interesting story and characters that, whilst somewhat wooden, are still decent and have their uses, dealing with a corrupt corporation that is using it's workers as test subjects for horrific experiments, so with Red Faction II, I expected something similar, maybe playing as a member of the Red Faction or Earth Defence Force, getting rid of remnants of the Ultor Corporation or whatever.\n\nInstead you're playing as a super soldier on (what I assume is) Earth, to bring down the leader of The Commonwealth, a previously unnamed political organisation, and getting your hands on or destroying some sort of Nano technology that is loosely connected to the first game, and even saying loosely is a stretch, aside from the name, there is basically no connection to the rest of the Red Faction series.\n\nCalling the characters wooden would be an insult to trees. I found myself unable to actually care about any of them, even the guy I was playing as, and once I was rid of the BBEG known as Sopot or something like that, I found myself with a new BBEG, my... old commander... who's reason for this was "hurr durr we need more nano soldiers because war reasons". Basically imagine a dumbed down and uninteresting version of Sundowner from MGR and you're pretty close to the mark.\n\nThen he gets stabbed in the back by one of the guys who originally helped him stab you in the back after he branded you an enemy of the Commonwealth for... reasons, I suppose? It's never actually cleared up aside from "You were helping the Red Faction" which is something we were all doing.\n\nThen it's all wrapped up in some sort of 1990's TV Series "Where are they now?" segment, which would have been funny if it wasn't for the fact they were 100% dead serious with this.\n\nI also managed to complete the whole game in about two hours.

I've played them all begining to end. This was probably the worst out them all. With that said Ill break down what I do like about this game and what I dont like. Red Faction 2 was origianally a PS2 title. As you play you can tell how dated it is by the graphics. The Story is ok. It is very cheesy but once you get past that, you can fing your self sorta almost enjoying it. Multiplayer was the more interesting part of this game, sadly absent from the PC version it seems. You can create Ai (bots) name them what ever you want, my favorite was (beefeater). once you complete the story extra characters to play with unlock, and as do the maps. Some maps can be annoyign though as they are large with very little players, (maximum of 6), mostly searching where you or the bots are. The smaller maps provide enough chaos that your not sure where the enemy can be at times till you dead. Those are the maps that can be either fun, or frustrating. What made this game unpopular was that as you play multiplayer you'll notice that its very similar to unreal tournament. It also doesnt have alot to it, the bots run aroudn chaoticly and at times get stuck. Red faction, the first game, had geo mode in it. It is almost completely absent from this game. I have played hours with this game and my brothers which was great. the multiplay kept this game semi afloat for a while. Unless your just into having all the Red Faction titles its not really worth the $10 you'll pay for it. Red Faction 2 is the Black Sheep of the Red Faction Family. It really had  almost nothign to do with the other 3 games. I got this game in the steam package deal when i purchased the whoel collection so for how much i payed i cant complain too much. Really my only beef with the pc version of this game is the lack of multiplayer. i cant say i would buy this again if i had to.","March 20","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are on Earth now, seeing the choas that spreaded when you succeed in gaining an item that allows for super-soldier research, then things go horribly wrong, research turns up poor results.

If it werne't for the appalling sequel due to outdated gameplay mechaics, stretched and convulted level design and subverted themes centered on the Soviet Russia motif which appeals to it's revolutionary thematics, we could've had a dystopian city of uprisers, similar to Half Life 2 or Ultor on Mars finally gets terraformed by the rebels or on Earth without Sopot which tied in with our current one Guerilla, which I might add is far, far more improved than this piece of sh|t.","February 1, 2014","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline was fun, the story didn't have overused tropes, the humor could have been better (especially with Shrike) and the boss fights were challenging. The weapons had multiple abilities that made a meaningful impact on gameplay and the way you approached enemies. The enemies also felt alive in this game, as they weren't just AI roaming around in scripted paths and events. They would have conversations, make lewd comments to eachother, talk ♥♥♥♥ about you when you were fighting them, and it just made the game a lot more enjoyable. Overall, the game has a really industrial/cyberpunk theme to it and a pretty appropriate soundtrack.\n\nAs far as the multiplayer went, it was fun playing this game in splitscreen when I owned it on the Playstation 2. The only downside to this game is that it's a port from a console version and it doesn't include all of the maps that were in the console version for the multiplayer. I believe the Xbox version had more maps than the Playstation 2 version. The AI in the multiplayer, especially if you were just playing alone just to kill time, was fun. They were challenging and not just mindless bots running around. It almost felt like an arena shooter. The gamemodes are pretty fun as well, CTF, Bagman, Deathmatch, etc etc.\n\nI would recommend this game solely so people could see the pinnacle of this game series, not the attempts made to resurrect the game years later with Guerilla and Armageddon.","February 13","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't even take place on mars, the plot makes no sense, the campaign is too short and it's nothing but a let down. Fortunatly the other games in the series are a lot better than this one. Can't Say I blame THQ for pretending this one never happned.","January 20","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Red Faction Armageddon was to Red Faction Guerilla, they completely missed what made the first game great and ended up with a completely forgettable shooter.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but it is very short and has almost nothing to do with the Red Faction story. If you like old school shooters you'll probably get some fun out of it, but don't go out of your way to buy it unless you can get it bundled with other Red Faction games.","May 8","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if Jason Statham quickly betrays you, you'll have a fun time. Oh, that's not a spoiler, that's the basic plot. There are traitors in the Red Faction, kill them and get vengeance. The GeoMod engine returns, giving you free reign to destroy whatever the hell you want, and it's magnificent. This time, there are more weapons, better sound design, more interesting level-design, and some crappy levels, less interesting story, better controls, and improved destruction.\n\n+ Improved GeoMod\n+ Better shooting mechanics\n+ Fun weapons\n+ Level-design\n+ Jason Statham\n+ More Red Faction lore\n\n- Some rail-shooting levels\n- Simple plot\n- Really short\n- Accidentally destroying your only route, making it unable to progress","December 19, 2011","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/recommended/20550/","OperationalOperator","Ridah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OperationalOperator/","519 products in account","Its a game thats typical of the time. This can be said about all the Red Faction games. They seem to chase trends with only one gimmick, some destruction of some sort, but at the end of the day it dousn't add enough to the game and the rest of the game suffers from not being very good.\n\nThe best part is there is an Enemy At The Gates reference in a scene in teh game thats exactly like a scene in the movie. Most peopole would probably miss it, but it was the only point I smiled so far.\n\nMuch like the first game Red Faction 2 just isn't fun and does nothing new and the GeoMod tech is not only even less used than RF1 but rather its barely used at all and is even more nerfed when it is.  I still got stuck a few times here adn there with no real idea of what to do next so I had to try and open every door I saw. Seems they still didn't get directing the player correct.  The graphics don't look better, this is probably the only thing that dousn't look better. The graphics look somewhat muddy and the guns are to big and the UI is pretty basic. I'll admit the first probably looked better.\n\nEnemies behave less irratically but they don't take cover but they will atleast attempt to find the player in situations aswell as dodge fire realistically instead of behaving like a multiplayer bot. Even then they can barely shoot and will very often stand there and let you shoot them.\n\nWhat it started feeling like is just me going from enemy to enemy holding shoot until the random bullet spread killed them and then moving on. The gameplay mechanics are really dull and the combat gets very boring in a hurry.\n\nThankfully the pacing, story, and story telling are better than 1 aswell as AI and some other things but its still not a very fun or good game even with those upgrades.\n\nIts just really boring. Theres a bunch of games releeased within 6 months before or after that this one released in 2002 that are just better games. Its not a classic, its an abysmal game that people look back on with nostalgia.\n\nOn another note Lance Henriksen provides the voice of the squad leader, Molov, and Jason Statham voices the vehicle expert, Shrike. But most the other voice actors are meh to terrible so you have a huge deviation between Statham and some random person thats pretty jarring.","June 4","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
