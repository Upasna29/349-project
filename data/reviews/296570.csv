Played through it straight twice, and I can see myself playing through it again in the future.\n\nI could list some pro's and con's or repeat what others have already said, but instead I will highlight a few points which may clarify some of the mixed points you will see in other reviews.  The purpose, I hope, is to help potential buyers in figuring out the perspective from which other reviewers are coming from.\n\n1.  The game is "linear" in that you are expected to go a certain path on the game world, but the path is not in a straight line.  This will throw off some players who are used to the typical themepark RPG set-up where the game holds your hand on how to get to the next area.\n\nFor a slightly spoiler-ish example:  Early on you will get a quest to kill a high level enemy blocking the road, a road which also leads to another part of the game map.  You are not supposed to kill said enemy at that point, as your party will get slaughtered.  A note tells there is a back way around, which is the intended path.  Thus, some players get "frustrated" by trying to brute-force their way through an encounter which is designed to be avoided until later.\n\nThe game has several of these set-ups (and honestly, get a bit predictable by the end).  If you are the type which prefers the modern take with quest compasses and the game telling you exactly where to go next, this will be a con.  If, however, you enjoy seeing the game map as a "puzzle" and discovering how to proceed to the next area, then don't mind this "con" you may see in other reviews.\n\nIt should also be noted that the game does drop clues on how to proceed, so it doesn't feel "cheap" as long as you are paying attention.  With the above example, there are 3 or 4 hints that try and tell you to take this back route.\n\n\n2.  Difficulty.  The combat in this game is turn-based whack each other in the face.  Thus, like other games of this type, combat boils down to which side has the bigger numbers.  The discrepancy you will see in regards to difficulty comes from the game starting you out with "smaller numbers" than even the beginning fights, which may feel like it is overly difficult.\n\nFor better or worse, the way around this isn't necessarily advertised.  There are priests in each city which can apply a 24 hour (in-game time) blessing.  These blessings are very powerful early on, because they take your "small stack of numbers" and boost it up to the point where early fights are no longer overly challenging.\n\nThus, the best way to get through the early game, to get some early levels and gear on your characters to make fights manageable, is to quest in "bouts".  Apply a few blessings, then do a quest or clear an area.  Head back to town, heal up, re-apply blessings and head back out.  You won't need to keep doing this the whole game (in fact it would get extremely expensive and tedious), as later on they are not as needed, but they are the best, efficient way to start out.\n\nSo don't be fooled by reviews claiming the game is overly difficult or challenging.  The game does offer the tools needed, but the "flaw" is that the tools aren't exactly advertised well to the new player.  If you dive straight into the game without blessings, you will find the early game to be extremely unforgiving.  If you get past the early game, you will find the difficulty pacing more comfortable.  Perhaps even too easy.\n\n\nA bit long for a Steam review, but people who read these just want to know what they may be getting if they drop the money, so I wanted to clarify some discrepancy.  I had a lot of fun with the game, but it may not be for everyone.  For me, personally, I've ran into zero bugs or crashes and got a solid 150+ hours out of it, which is more that can be said about a lot of modern 60$ AAA releases.\n\n\n\n\n","December 24, 2014","true","214.2"," 461 of 472 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","461","472","2","4"

I feel bad buying this game for 19.99, it is definitely worth a higher asking price. Lords of Xulima was an awesome experience.\n\nHere are my thoughts on the game, both good and bad:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n+ The graphics are gorgeous. They are the perfect balance between old school and modern without being overly flashy. I loved the aesthetics of the enviornments.\n+ The animations while in combat were much more than I expected. The models of some of the more epic fights are extremely well done.\n+ For the most part, there are a ton of different enemy visuals. Some games tend to just rehash skins for certain enemies over and over with different colors to "differeniate." Lords does this a few times, but for the most part, there are a ton of different visuals and it adds to the flavor and keeps the game fresh.\n+ Open world gameplay. Lords is not completely linear, and it gives you the freedom to roam around and just kind of do your thing. Tons of sidequests/areas to explore. Do what you please!\n+ As far as gameplay length versus asking price, this game is unbeatable as far as indie games are concerned. 70+ hours of gamplay for 20 bucks? On an INDIE title? That is unheard of. Wow.\n+ Challenging. I have seen a lot of people on the forums complain about the difficulty of the game (too hard!), but I felt it was near perfect. There are three difficulties and different levels of challenges for all types of players, from casual to hardcore.\n+ The Lore. Numantian created a beautiful world filled with all types of creatures and Gods and they all have their personalities and roles.\n+Combat and strategy is well done. You have things to consider like positioning, resource management, different weapon types, debuff strats (should i stack bleeds/wounds/stuns?), skill allocation, among much more. There is a pretty good amount of depth here.\n\nThe MEDIOCRE:\n+ The story. I understand this game is not completely story focused and development was probably emphasized on other aspects. I actually liked the story, it wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't amazing. For the books though, I really enjoyed the ending. A lot. Props on the ending!\n+ Slightly grindy with the aspect of food. I understand the food system is necessary for this type of game and it adds a lot of strategy and decision making, but it can get repetitive to just grind out food resources in order to conserve precious gold.\n+ Itemization is a bit boring. Because of the way the stats on gear are designed, they aren't overly interesting or force you to make deliberate choices/tradeofffs. A few stats are just a bit too overpowered and could use some balancing (I won't mention any names).\n\nThe BAD:\n+ This is my only big complaint about the game. The way that you obtain loot.. For the most part, much of your gear will come from the vendor. Basically end game is just constantly checking all the vendors over and over again hoping a good item spawns. You will occasionally find a good item naturally from a chest, but it is very rare. Having vendors being the strongest source of loot in the game seems like a poor design. Finding a really strong item on a vendor does not have the same rewarding effect as if the item was obtained after overcoming a difficult encounter.\n\nSuggestions:\n+ Crafting. I really wanted to see a crafting system in Lords. I don't see why a regular base item plus some unique crafting currencies couldn't yield some new items.\n+ I feel like some really cool items could have been created that would have fit the themes of the lore. Something creative like "Life's Spark - Febret's Touch," a unique staff which can only be equipped by certain classes and has unique effects/stats. Explore the design space!\n\nOverall Lords of Xulima is an amazing title. If you are a fan of Baldur's Gate style games, definitely give Lords a try. It is the best game of this style I have played in years.\n\nLords of Xulima takes about 60-80 hours to complete. It will just depend on your pacing/how much you are into questing around and doing side stuff.\n\n9.5/10","December 1, 2014","true","70.8"," 122 of 129 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","122","129","0","1"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Lords of Xulima (pronounced as 'Shoo-lee-mah') is a 2D isometric old-school role playing game from Madrid-based developers Numantian Game Studios.  The game is a ‘Kick starter’ success story that, as far as I know, had an original goal of only $10,000 but managed to reach a grand total of $35,657 by its end.  The game features a world map gameplay similar to that of Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty, but has a combat mechanic that is more akin to the Might and Magic series with certain areas of the game being blocked off by monsters until you're powerful enough to defeat them or find a way around them.\n\nThe game places you in the boots of Gaulen, an adventurer summoned by one of the nine (9) gods to go to their divine homeland of Xulima where a civil war has broken out when the god of death declared war against the other eight (8) gods.  Gaulen sets sail with five (5) other companions but to their dismay, upon reaching Xulima, the gods had already left and in their place, terrible lords have taken power who will stop at nothing to keep Gaulen from interfering with the on-going war between the gods.\n\nPROS:+ Good 2D graphics and art style but... (See CON #4)\n+ Well implemented gameplay that is reminiscent of old CRPG titles\n+ Helpful first mission tutorial and tool tips that covers the game's basic elements\n+ Challenging difficulties\n+ Good class system with different skills and abilities but… (See CON #2 and #3)\n+ Good atmosphere for a CRPG with day and night cycles as well as weather effects on some maps\n+ Healthy game time\n+ Large world with a lot of room for exploration\n+ Good story worthy of a sequel but… (See CON #5 and 6)\n\nCONS:- The main character cannot be customized to have another class or portrait\n- Some classes are almost indispensable for a successful campaign (ex. Cleric)\n- No skill overview or mapping: This means you can not plan out your builds if it is your first play through unless you look it up in the internet or you're already familiar with the skill system.\n- Portrait selections as well as some cinematic art works could use a bit more work\n- The game's story (not gameplay) is linear because there are little choices to be made during important dialogue with the story NPCs\n- Plot twist was a bit predictable\n- Difficult early game\n- Score system that is best ignored if you want a fun rather than competitive experience\n- Game gets a bit boring at the end but that depends on you as the player\n\nCONCLUSION:Lords of Xulima is a surprisingly GOOD GAME and I have no trouble giving it my full recommendation especially with Classic RPG fans.\n\nI can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price especially since it is only $19.99 or your regional equivalent.  The game can net you at least 60 hours of game time and has a lot of content to enjoy and therefore, making a simple $19.99 purchase worth more than some of the Triple A titles that were recently released.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

Guided by a dream sent by the gods of this world, he sails to a forgotten continent. During exploration, the game is very similar to classics like Baldur´s Gate, but once combat begins, it will look like a mixture of Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy 10 and the newer Etrian Odyssey series.\n\n\nMajor Features:\n\n- A charming atmosphere, travel through a mystical world and explore secret graves, forsaken temples and more.\n- Challenging and strategic combat. Very original due to the elaborate debuff system.\n- Character skills and equipment management are rich and rewarding.\n- Extremely polished for a beta: bugs are rare, less than in many recently relesed games.\n\n\nPossible weakpoints (depending on your taste):\n\n- Story plays only a secondary role. Exploration, combat and character management take the main spotlight.\n- Hard to get going. You have to manage the party, food reserves and find your way in a huge non-linear world. (If you have troubles, try the easiest difficulty. There you can learn the basic game mechanics without getting your head chopped off for every mistake.)\n\nMinor addittion: You CAN run in this game, the trailer shows only the walking speed.","August 4, 2014","true","163.7"," 94 of 103 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","94","103","0","0"

I was in between games & looking for something different to play when I ran across this game in a thread about good RPG-Tactical Games. I am glad I gave Xulima a try. It has a nostalgic feel to it and that old fashioned D&D appeal (I date back to the white box/3 booklet early D&D Pen and Paper Days) that some of us old timers still remember. This feel though, is coupled with some very nice (albeit very basic) game mechanics that just simply work for the type game it was designed to be. At first glance, I thought that the combat mechanics were a little “hokey” but they work and they work elegantly. I look forward to the battles and they make you think and plan each combat turn. In addition to the combat and questing, there are some nice surprises in your exploration & adventuring. For us old schoolers that enjoy some logistics, there are some simple but elegant food & rest requirements that work without being tedious. To me, the best part of the game is the old school leveling up and making hard choices in your skill & attribute allocations as you advance. If you are a “instant gratification / pew-pew” gamer that needs high end graphics and action, stay away. But if you can use your imagination a bit and want a nicely done, old school adventure game, Xulima is your ticket. I hope they follow with a sequel…The game is quite addicting....buy the Golot Treasure DLC...its worth it....\n\nPros\nOld School Nostalgic Feel\nNicely Done Game and Combat Mechanics\nImmersion\nElegant Logistics, basic but not tedious\nNicely done advancement system\nChallenging (recommend the medium or hard settings, don’t play on “normal”)\nOverall game package just works – good feel, fit and finish\nHours and Hours of RPG Adventure Fun\n\nCons\nSimple but elegant graphics – no huge explosions or 3D action here\nIs grindy at times\nSome might miss the “follow the green arrow” tips of other games ie., this is a thinking persons game…\nCombat system may be too quirky for some (again, no “pew-pew” here)\nSome may miss the “Monty Hall” feel of other titles…you work for your loot here…\nSome of the game can bog down w/ tedious puzzle like problems to solve\nYou sometimes get stuck w/out any clear route to proceed, which can be tedious to figure out what to do next\n\n\n\n","September 29, 2015","true","25.5"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","63","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nachoing/recommended/296570/","nachoing","Nacho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nachoing/","251 products in account","This has been a tough game to decide on whether to give it a positive or a negative, but after some thought I have to go with negative.\n\nI was a huge fan of the Might and Magics growing up (World of Xeen was one of my favorite games) and saw this was recommend as a similar type of game. While it might be similar, it simply isn't as good.\n\nThe biggest flaw of this game is the ridiculously spikey difficulty. I am playing on the recommended difficulty (classic) and find playing it an act of willpower.  First, the early pacing is horrific.  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to see how many people quit this game by level 5.  The combat is simple in terms of mechanics, but dirt cheap in terms of enemies.\n\nYou are the chosen of the gods, well get use to being horribly murdered by bees and spiders.  Sure there are other enemies, but the poisons in the game are obscenely strong and will wipe your party.  I have found countless encounters where the game tells me it's a "balanced fight" that are totally unwinnable.  Why not go somewhere else? Well sometimes you simply can't, especially early on. That area is the one you have to suffer through so get use to constantly loading and hoping you get some rolls in your favor.  By the way, the poison isn't even really curable until you get a priest to 15 which is WAY too late in the game.\n\nThe difficutly is further inflated by the way random encounters work. Basically, any time you can get jumped and have a chance to flee or fight, but sometimes it just means load. This is because your chance to flee is based on your party speed, which if it is lower, will be a small chance of fleeing. Meanwhile, this same stat determines how easily you can hit things, so the same stat that determines if you can run away determines if you would hit the mobs (except casters).  That doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. It really means you will die and load.  While this is happening, you have to wait for your party memeber to get a turn before you can load.  Well guess what, some of the mobs are so cheap they will chain sleep, mind control, stun, etc affects to the point where you never actually get a turn before you die.  I have found it faster to alt f4 if i fail the flee role than to wait for my first turn.\n\nThis random difficulty seems to calm down some after about level 10, but you will still find poison mobs to be the most frustrating in the game.  In general, the monsters stack way too many of their conditions on a single apply and often to multiple party memebers.  You often feel as you need to win the fight as fast as possible, because you have no way of winning a long fight and some of the effects do not persist outside of combat.\n\nThere are some effects that last outside of combat and are only curable by the town healer for a ridiculous price until MUCH later in the game, or unless you buy a more expensive potion. I am currently 45 hours into the game and still cannot cure curse, which is unavoidable after certain events. Typically, after you get this cured, the next mob will reapply it and just suck away more of your money.\n\nAside from the combat, that game loves to throw ridiculous puzzles at you and disable saving just to make you restart them from the beginning.  Failed to weave inbetween those mobs 10 levels higher than you? Watch your whole party die in combat and reload and do better next time.  That's not the way you should go based on random art in the background? Have fun back at the beginning.  After a while, you'll just get sick of it and probably google the answer because you don't like having your time blatently wasted.\n\nThe game does have interesting pick lock and disarm trap mechanics that are difficult, but pretty fair.  However, the detection system is pretty wonky.  You have to level up detection to see the traps, but even with it the appropriate level, you will not always see the closest trap in a timely manner.  Get use to quick saving every few steps in a dungeon because if you set off a trap, you will either die or be on the brink of death.  Since trap detection is only on movement, you will find yourself saving before a trap and just walking back and forth in front of it until your detector randomly decides to see it.\n\nOverall, I've had a lot of fun with this game but much more frustration and aggravation, which is why I chose to give it a negative review.  The game itself isn't bad but feels like it screws you over just a little too much. I haven't encountered any bugs in the game or had any crashing.  If you decide to pick it up here is some  advice for you:\n\n1. Wiki your party. Some classes are totally useless and will only take a spot.\n2. Get use to saving and loading a lot.\n3. Mark food on the map. This will help save early game costs.\n4. Prices at the first town for food, sleep, and healing seem to be cheaper.\n5. The towns sell a one time use portal device for immediate return.\n6. The bosses are pretty unfair and may require you to leave the dungeon and do something else for a few more levels.\n7. You can determine the difficulty of a fight by right clicking on a monster. The game never told me this and it is pretty useful but don't take it as gospel.\n8. The game doesn't tell you where to go next so if all the new places seem too difficult, see if there is a spot in the old zone you missed.\n9. The game puts a lot of instant fail criterias in place so when you are warned about certain things, you HAVE to head the warnings.  You will not be able to just power your way through.\n\n","July 4, 2015","false","45.3"," 116 of 152 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","116","152","9","0"

I've been surprised about how often I'm seeing comments about "movement is too slow / can I run?" I admit, it's the first thing I turned on... and the first thing I turned off as I had to work my way through a particular area or two. :D I really liked that there was a reason to walk as well as run.\n######\n\nI don’t normally write reviews, but having been a kickstarter backer of this game & followed it’s development, played a number of builds, sunk a heck of a lot of time into it and the conclusion I’ve drawn is…. this game is just so much fun! Honestly!! It’s been ages since I’ve enjoyed a game so much.\n\nBut seeing as how the other early reviewers have already made some great comments I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Put simply - this game is just absolutely awesome!!\n\nSo far I've been in the beta (prior to steam early access) and have had to force myself to stop playing on numerous occasions.  I just didn't want to ruin the full experience - it is just so much fun and so very addicting - even at this early access stage.  I've lost countless hours to it… and never regretted it for a moment.  If you're a fan of classic RPGs, turn based combat, building and managing a party, gorgeous artwork, engaging story & a decent challenge (without it ever feeling like the AI is cheating) then don't wait another moment!\n\nThe quality of finish is excellent, the game is more than playable and (with this latest release) we’re actually mostly just waiting on a few more tweaks & balances rather than major content.  At least, that's my understanding of things as they stand.  Fear not though, if I'm somehow mistaken, you should be able to experience a good 50 hours or so (of the stated 100 hours) of solid gameplay right now. :-)  Music, artwork, combat, story, etc for that first 50 hours of gameplay is already there... and freakin' awesome.\n\nNOTE: There are multiple difficulty levels so don't be put off it seems a bit too daunting (eg. lower levels mean less requirement to manage party’s food rations, encounters may be composed of less challenging beasts, etc). All levels present a challenge, but seriously if you can pull off a #spoiler (cursed hounds) #end spoiler encounter or two at the higher difficulty setting, you'll actually congratulate yourself!  In fact, you’ll probably start bragging. ;-)\n\nPS: ha short and sweet.  I just love the game too much to not keep writing about it. :D  Also it wouldn’t be fair of me if I didn’t mention the excellent manner for which the developers have kept in touch with the community and given careful consideration to the provided feedback.

You would never guess from looking at the screenshots, but it's a very original and well-thought game, that takes lessons from old-school RPGs and adds some unique flavour.\n\nFor once, it has a very challenging combat and a nice mix of a Wizardry-like first person combat with isometric exploration, featuring traps, mazes and hidden passages. It also has one of the best resource management system I ever saw in a RPG.\n\nClearly the developers played hundreds of RPGs, and tried to fix issues that old games had. For example, Xulima has random encounters, but only on certain areas. And they are actually limited fights, that scale up in difficulty as you beat them. Defeat all enemies in one area, and it becomes a safe zone, and you even get some bonus XP. And the game is full of other "twists" like this.\n\nSo in short, if you like old-school RPGs try this game. It isn't revolutionary, but it's very well designed and clearly made with passion.

I was a teenager in the 90s, and remember the RPG gems of the era, a lost age as far as I'm concerned. Games where the story and sense of exploration, strategy in combat was more important than flashy cutting edge graphics. Games where literacy was important and they came with huge manuals, with a fleshed out backstory and bestiaries of all the monsters.\n\nLords of Xulima hearkens back to that era, the late 90s isometric RPGs, but with the traditional turn based first person "enemy in front of you where your chars portraits are on the bottom of the screen" RPG format. Its fun. Its awesome. Ive wanted an RPG like this for ages.\n\nDeep story, decent combat, a sense of exploration and wanting to see what was farther down the path. I love this game and would recommend it for anyone who finds modern "RPGs" lacking.","November 16, 2014","true","104.2"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","56","62","0","0"

I read some interesting thoughts about it on the RPG Codex and snapped it up.\n\nWhat does Old School RPG mean? If you think it means I played RPG back in the day and therefore fully capable of playing this one on Difficult - you won't get very far. Back in the day a bunch of us played RPG like Bards Tale 1, Wasteland 1, Ultima IV etc. They were not easy games. Try playing them now.\n\nSo my first tip is to play this game on normal difficulty and save yourself some angst - unless - unless you can remember all the mantras from Ultima IV and know the optimum party build for each Wizardry and Might and Magic.\n\nThe game - it's a blobber. Party based turn based combat. It is better than M&M X Legacy.\n\nIt's a beautiful little gem developed by this small group of people that obviously love RPG games. It comes through in the design and gameplay.\n\nI was exploring and came across this structure and went inside. I found a talking skull that asked me its name. How would anyone know that. I was stuck. There are a few teleports around so I explore - going from place to place and mapping as I go. Still stuck. Frustration time right? I look at the overhead map and my poor old brain tells me the different sections sort of look like letters. If you look down from above like a map does. I have letters - but what is the order? Each section has candles - leading from 1-6. I solve the puzzle and progress.\n\nI found the puzzle unique and amazing.\n\nThe game is not linear. But that does not mean you can go where you want. The trick is navigating a pathway through the dangers and my path was different from others. For example, I did not tip toe around the sleep causing mushrooms heavily cursed by all the frustrated players giving negative views. When I finally came across them I ate them for breakfast.\n\nSome players get stuck because they do not pay attention to the text. Unlike M&M X, you need to pay attention. Pathways previously blocked open up as you progress. You need to backtrack. The game is not linear.\n\nYou need to use strategy in this game. RPG Strategy? What is this game some sort of RPGS - never heard of that. SRPG?\n\nOff course you can run around and eat mushrooms and pick flowers. Your bard can sing 80s pop music. Can you manage assets? What the heck will your mage do when he runs out of magical energy - defend every turn? Maybe take a short tea break? You stock up on health potions but what are you going to do when you know someone in your party is likely to die because four spiders have their turn in combat before they get a chance to gulp down a potion? Damn healing scrolls - stock up.\n\nAre you stocked up on torches and lock picks? Buy food and explore and then come back. Push your limits before heading back. Usually about five days is enough because after that the cost gets prohibitive. Don't rest after each fight like some weakling. Man up.\n\nThe combat is complex. I could write pages about it. Bleeding, Burning, Burping, Stunning, Wounding, Sleeping.\n\nYour little thief from only doing 1 damage per turn with his little dagger becomes the best fighter in the game if you train him on Shurikens. Pointy ninja weapons that disappear after you throw them. Apart from the basic damage they do they also do Bleeding damage that stacks over time. STACKS OVER TIME. Remember that. You can only buy three of these at a time before the shopkeeper runs out - come back tomorrow! Keep all of these until you really need them. I had around 100 in stock before I came across some badass that would not go down.\n\nStacking works on your party as well.\n\nStunning. Some weapons don't do bleeding damage or cause wounds. They stun your opponent. I came across this evil looking Emerald Wyvern who basically could not get an attack in. That was amazing. Makes me ponder a STUN + STUN + BLEED front three. I came across this little Imp guarding a treasure chest who would not get out the way unless I answered a little riddle. Get lost you little squirt. He then grew to a gigantic size and nearly polished of my party as none of the bleed or stun effects worked on him. Eventually I figured out he was weak to burning and basically went into defensive mode apart from my Mage throwing fireballs like a maniac.\n\nI could tell you lots of amazing stories about the game. The time I went through the desert and came across a kebab vendor. I will just say Buy It and support this little company.\n\nTips for beginners unless you want to learn the hard way.\n\nHarvest those little wheat plants in the first town and sell for profit. That little money will help pay for food or blessings.\n\nBlessings - get them for Speed increase and Resistance and Evasion - you get the idea\n\nSkills - train up as many skill points as you can afford - you get four per level up but what would you do with 6 or 8 or 12?\n\nYes. Spend that cash mate. Your thief can pick locks better, train weapons, improve immunity and gain experience faster. They can even do some body building in the local gym.\n\nDon't waste your Mage's time training his little puny staff fighting skills or trying to buff his muscles, maximise his potential in magic. He don't need the ability to wear Steel Armour as if everything goes correct - he won't never be in the front row.\n\nThat little twerp Gaulen - try waiting on picking flowers until he can get 3 herbs per pick. Train his hunting and exploring skills. People complain about the food requirement all the time. With hunting your whole party can transverse many maps with animals without losing food - you gain it!\n\nYour Bard - he ain't a fighter - he is a pansy artiste. Stun music, music that make you angry, music that inspires you is the way to go.\n\nYou don't have to rest 8 hours after each battle to heal up - your cleric can do that - just make sure you have mana potions in stock\n\nIt's a charming little gem of a game. Don't think you know it all cos you played Baldur's Gate back in the day.\n\nSupport these guys and let's look forward to Xulima 2","May 27, 2015","true","128.5"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","49","53","4","0"

When this type of game is properly done,  you start of so wimpy, itty bitty little cave rats can take you down but by games end you should have a character stong enough to take down the game's god. Lords of Xulima understands this concept and gives you plenty of options to level up your character.\n\nYou can level up,  of course with the normal way by accumulating points from winning battle.\nYou can level up stats by solving the games dozens of quests\nYou can level up stats by gathering  and using herbs\nYou can level up stats by drinking from wells\nYou can level up stats by drinking from fountains\nYou can level up stats by items left over from your victims battle drops\nYou can level up stats by praying at statues (one way permanent and one way temporary)\nYou can level up stats by solving puzzles.\n\nSome of the leveling up of stats is automatic, and some you get to pick. And there is so much to level up. You can level up stats, attributes, mind, body, prayers, spells, songs (yes the Bard characater is the most fully realized yet), weapons, armor, attacks, thieveries,  field knowledge etc. I would quess there are probably over a hundred things that can be leveled up. However some charaacters (spell casters) have more then others (soldiers).\n\nGameplay wise, its your old school turn based combat and it is well done. But that may be the one qualm I have with this game. There is a lot of combat and by late mid game it becomes tiresome. By the last quarter of the game the high stat/hit point monsters are taking a long time to take out. And while the game has a great story and great lore, it does tend to get lost with the continious battling. And speaking of story I was able to tell the story ending early on in this game but the story rail did not allow me to change my destiny.\n\nStill, I had a lot of fun with this game. I loved the color palate. It was bright and fanciful like a Might and Magic or early NES game. And the music is spectacular. The composer, Nicholar De Ferrar, is on the same level as Soule (Skyrim) and Rosenkranz (Gothic). And with some limited voice over work, that was also of superiour quality, the music had to carry you over and it delivered. Qualms aside the game deserves an A rating.","January 24, 2015","true","206.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","45","49","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/296570/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLords Of Xulima is an isometric party-based RPG mixed with a few casual elements. For those looking for a game similar to the recently released Might & Magic X or last year’s Legend Of Grimrock don’t necessarily need to look further, because the combat is, as mentioned, turn-based and shown in the same way as those games (although not entirely) and even the difficulty can be hard for the unexperienced or unwary. Furthermore, the game plays like a mix of Hero Of The Kingdom (where you also have to collect herbs by casually clicking around) and classic RPGs, with your central hubs and huge amounts of quests to be completed.\n\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned: you walk around by clicking on the ground, or by using the WASD keys. By default your party moves at a low (read: walking) speed but by pressing and holding the Shift button you can let them run. You engage enemies by moving into their territory and if you’re walking into an area that originally belongs to the enemies random encounters will also appear. Here you can choose to fight, evade/avoid combat or to use a skill to hide. Obviously, the last two choices don’t always work and require on luck and in-game skills.\nBesides fighting enemies you’ll find treasure chests and other loot. Some of these chests will be locked and can be lockpicked with your thief and or anyone who has this skill and enough lockpicks on hand. A small Minesweeper-like minigame will trigger.\nYou also have to take into account the food supplies.  Collecting edible plants allows you to add a small amount of food to your supplies. This is shown in a circle in the bottom right corner of the screen. Fill it up and you can walk an entire day around without having to worry that you’re going to run out. Food is used for activities like resting and traveling and when it’s empty you won’t be able to use these as efficiently, or they may not even work altogether. So it is advisable that you fill it up for at least a few days because who knows where you might end up and when you might see the next town where you can eventually stock up again.\n\nThe graphics have a casual look. Some of the portraits could use a little work, but the world itself looks splendid and detailed. The combat seemingly uses 2D animations converted from 3D models (not sure, though) and they look a tiny bit wooden to be honest. Even if they are technically okay. Other than that I have no issues.\n\nNavigation can be a bit hard but that’s mainly because you can get stuck or walk into objects that you shouldn’t get stuck into to begin with, like trees or stones. It doesn’t happen very often but it’s definitely noticeable when it does happen and sometimes you have to backtrack a bit in order to get past the obstacle.\n\nThe user interface isn’t always entirely clear or user friendly and therefore not as intuitive to use as it should be and some tooltips that definitely would’ve come in handy seem to be missing. It would’ve been nice if there was a checkbox for this in the Options menu or something.  I understand they don’t want to hold your hand, but at least explain some of the buttons or mechanics for the less experienced gamers out there, or for those who have no idea what they’re looking at (trust me, once you’ve clicked a weird looking button you exactly know what to look for next time). I don’t think the interface should be part of the difficulty level (as you can see in the comments below you can right-click on most of the important things to get more information, but this doesn't work for everything you see unfortunately).\nAnd why can’t I close ‘Level up’ window without having to select my skills and stats first ? Sometimes I just want to compare things before I choose. This should absolutely be optional, and not forced.\nI’m also missing things like pop-ups when you level up and/or sound alerts. I know that this information is displayed in the upper right corner, but showing these events on-screen, in the center, in full detail gives a sense of progression and fulfillment. This is just a personal preference, of course.\n\nThe music is subtle and is well done. I think it fits the game well because half of the time I hardly even notice it. And yes, that’s a compliment. It all feels very natural and well integrated. The sounds used for the creatures and in battle are decent so far, and the narrator is doing a good job at telling the story sequences.\n\nFinishing the story should take you quite a while. I’ve taken a look at the map and it’s pretty big. The game isn’t finished at the moment of writing this so we can’t experience the entire thing just yet. But I think it could easily take you anywhere between 25-50 hours. It’s hard to exactly pinpoint at this moment, and it also depends on what sort of gamer you are (do you want to complete all of the sidequests and explore every nook and cranny, for example). I’m somewhere between 8-15 hours into the game and I’m still hanging around near the beginning I think. So there’s plenty to do in this game.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this still is an Early Access title and despite its small flaws I’m 100% certain most of the things I’ve discussed will be (at least partially) addressed.\nThe game already feels quite polished and I had a great time playing it. So if you like lengthy party-based RPGs don’t forget to check this one out. It might not look like much judging from just the screenshots but you’d be surprised to see how much fun this game actually is.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","August 7, 2014","true","16.0"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","48","55","0","5"

It has similar combat mechanics with the Disciples 1&2 series(the good ones), with M&M series, with M&M Legacy, but it seems way better, cleaner and more fun.\nIt also has interesting puzzles, very neat and crisp 2D graphics and exploration mechanics. But make no mistake, this game is all about combat. And combat it does very very well. If you like a challenge and a game where you must think hard before you just push buttons, then Lords of Xulima is the right game for you.\n\nThe game is recommended for the Veteran level, because at this level the challenges imposed by the enemy parties require you to use everything at your disposal to win. Be it potion, spell scrolls, buffs, debuffs, usable items, there are many fights in which you must use tactics and think ahead more than a few moves to be able to move forward. Also it is one of the first games where threat assesment is spot on. When you right-click an enemy and it says Troublesome, it will be TROUBLESOME.\n\nThe rpg mechanics are well-thought, being a progression based game. The higher you level up, the stronger your heroes get, but at the same time the enemies begind to vary in their attacks, properties and sizes. Each class brings something to the table; there are no useless clases in this game. As there are tons of varied enemy combinations, the game encourages you to make a diverse party, not try to cheese it with 6 archers(that does not work, you need dps tanks in front). you will need heals, thief skill,etc.\n\nThis game is also very long (50 hours in, almost at half) and, to be honest, it can take a seat near Wasteland 2 and Divinity OS as inovation, feeling and attention to detail. Like those games, it combines the game elements in a way that entices the player to keep playing, ignoring sleep and food to just finally defeat that last monster.\n\nThe only negative part in my opinion is the mediocre story, but as you play the game, the design is so good that you never notice it during gameplay.\n\nI really recommend it, as it offers huge and complex content for a low price.","November 15, 2014","true","92.2"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","2"

Because the game is this good.\n\nI am truly amazed at how the fine little details this game has. I purchased this right after the UI change and have already put in 20 hours. I'm an old school player have played all kind of RPG games from Baulders Gate to Dragon Age Origin to Arcanum to Divinity Sin to now... this. I barely touched 20% of the content and I'm already 20 hours in.\n\nThe game is remanence of the old school Baulders Gate except that it has an amazing new UI. It's like Might & Magic X Legacy feel to it but less buggy and less hexy. The game world is huge and story is right to the point. It shows a beliveable world.

Then I go to sleep then work and repeat the process. This game got me hooked and I can't wait till I finish it and play in Ironman mode.\n\nI wish the developers can get more money/exposure because honestly they deserve this.

(Very similar to Wizardry). The Art-Style is charming and the music is very good! The best part of Lords of Xulima is the battle system, which is very in-depth. The game is fairly non-linear, usually there is more than just 1 thing to do, outside of story specific things such as temples, often the only thing that is blocking a path to another area is a monster, so if you are able to defeat it you can advance into new areas without doing them in the intended order. The map opens up a lot once you have defeated the second prince in the game.\n\nStory: The Story unfortunately doesn't make a good impression to begin with, It is Pokemon style, you are tasked with purifing 8 temples, killing 4 princes, 4 witches etc. There are a few good pieces of dialogue that give you a back-story into Gaulen's (The main Characters) past, and some nice dialogue between the Bosses and Gaulen which I found interesting, there aren't too many NPCs around in the towns to really give much of a history on the setting of map. It is workable though and the other aspects that Lords of Xulima more than make up for it.\n\nGameplay: Lords of Xulima has you create a Party involving Gaulen (The main character which you must take) and 5 other characters of your choice from 9 different classes. There is enough variation in the classes, and in the skills you select as you're leveling the classes up, to warrant 2-3 playthroughs of the game. The battle system is what really sets Lords of Xulima apart. It is very good, very in-depth, if you are a fan of old turn-based RPGs you will love the LoX battle-system. You control Gaulen through-out the world and fight your way through forests, deserts, snow, demon-infested ruins, dungeons, temples and castles to achieve your objectives, there is a nice variety of enemy types (although some are palette swaps, there is plenty of original enemies to keep you interested) and settings. There are a lot of tough puzzles and riddles in LoX which are very good and make you think, again, like classic old-school RPGs. Everything you do in LoX is limited by your supplies, which you will need to use to rest (to heal) and to move around the map, you can regain supplies by picking them from the terrain, using Gaulens hunting skill after killing monsters, and buying them from towns or looting them, there are plenty of secrets hidden in the maps to have you searching for. The game is hard as you might expect for an old-school RPG, seeing an Ironman mode is very refreshing :)\n\nMusic: Very good, there are plenty of times where you'll find yourself humming away to the music, especially in the snowy town :) . Good variety of battle music, dungeons sound creepy etc. It is very cool\n\nArt: I found the art style very cool and classic looking, but modern enough to be charming. Keep in mind that this game is working on a very tight budget, I think they've done a great job with the music and art.\n\nThe devs are releasing 1-2 updates per day (Even on weekends) and bugs are getting fixed very quickly. Even though it's an Early Access Game I have never had any problems with crashes. The only bugs I have encountered are localization issues, the developer is a spanish developer so there is 1-2 weird translations here and there, but they get fixed quickly if you post them in the forum.\n\nIf you are a fan of classic RPGs, get this game, it's great value. I've already gotten 50 hours of it. For £12 that's a bargain.\n\n\n\n","October 18, 2014","true","73.9"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","0"

I was very sceptical when I saw a trailer and gameplay, and thus downloaded a pirate version of a game. But after 10+ hours of non-stop adventure in this fantastic RPG i decided to buy this game and I think I am gonna buy another copy for one of my friends.\n\nThis game has a great ballanced gameplay and that what makes it so addicting. You are always managing resources - mana, food, hp, gold. You can't just go and kill everything that moves or steal 20 million gold from a stupid merchant. Everything in this game has a price, and you really need to choose wheather you want to earn a little bit more gold for a greater item in the shop, or venture forth into the magic forest (since you need food for adventures)\n\nIf you like Baldur's gate, Divinity and old school rpgs - this is a must buy.\n\nThey say there are 100 hours of a content, I don't know if that is a true.

If you expect a deep story with choices you will not like LoX.\n\nA summary of Pros and Cons:\nPros:\n-Character system is well designed, gives you a lot of choice. Distinctive and relatively well balanced classes.\n-Combat System which is easy to get into, while offering a good amount of tactical options\n-Big game world with different areas, explation is fun.\n\nCons:\n-The Stoy is badly written. You do not have any choices and your main character's conversations tend to be very silly.\n-Overview of Skills is not existant in the game. You have to use external information, which is cruicial on higher difficulty levels.\n-The game slightly pushes to into "grinding" enemies.\n-Food mechanic: You can save a lot of money by spending 5 minutes per hour for gathering food. This is not adding anything to the game but a time sink.\n-In the last third of the game you have a couple of "hard fights" which block your path, after which you have to kill a lot of trash which is not challenging you at all.\n-Difficulty Curve within the game isn't optimal: It's hard in the beginning and gets easier.\n-The herbalism skill encourages you to leave all plants behind until you maxed out the skill, which causes backtracking.\n-In Version 1.5 the game still has two bugs which can appear quite often: A sound effect is carried over until game is restarted. And swapping of character positions in combat is broken if you use the summoner class.\n-The Score System rewards and pushes towards styles of gameplay which are less fun. Best to ignore the score altogether for the best experience.\n\nMy complete review in Video Form (German):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HODVjCvr8sw","December 20, 2014","true","214.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

An old-school style RPG, with everything that entails, seemed an investment of interest to me.  Alas, that is not what we get in this version of LoX.  Let me start with the good.\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe art.  Character portraits are well-done, the world is very detailed, and every single thing I've encountered is easy to recognize.  All too many independent studios are going for a eye-bleedingly ugly 8-bit pixel art, but this game has an art style much more like Eschalon.  It's quite pleasant.\nThe customization.  You can select a pre-made party, if you aren't really into chargen, and it's a good group.  But you can do much better with a little experience, you can make a party that really supports one another and is strong against what the game will throw at you.\nThe sound.  Though quite loud, the quality of the music, speech, and sound effects is solid.\nThe lockpicking and trap disarming minigames.  Seriously.  Numantian hit that sweet spot; easy to grasp, quick enough not to be a bother, requiring player input to keep some interest, and no long animations to waste your time.\n\nTHE BAD\nBasically everything implied in "old-school RPG."\nThere is no manual (though of course this will be fixed on full release).\nThere is no in-game explanation of the game mechanics.  The old-school RPGs that we remember, we remember because the rules made sense, were easy to learn and reasonable to master, and did not get in the way of the gameplay.  LoX cannot claim this, alas.  How does the game decide if you resist a sleep effect?  You'll need to go to the forums for that.  How much does a point of armor reduce incoming physical damage?  No explanation in-game, and the implication that it's a flat reduction doesn't hold true.\nMovement speed is arduously slow.  It feels like you're actually fighting the game to get from one place to another.  With a speed increase, moving about will be much less painful.\nThe game economy scales to your level.  Old-school RPGs did not do this.  In the first town you meet, you will find that each time you level, essential items become more expensive.  Food, resting, even things like lockpicks and torches.  The economy in fact punishes you for levelling up, for completing quests, for exploring beyond the critical path.\nEnemy spells are not yet well-balanced, especially with respect to status effects and spell cost.  For example, one of the earlier enemies you will face in game is a caster who will deal powerful damage, with a high combat speed, and also provide solid healing to the front-line fighters, and a massive AoE stun that is difficult to resist.  While it is possible that they will eventually run out of spell points (called Power Points in LoX), during a typical-length battle, they will be able to cast a spell every round; not a feat you will be able to replicate even with a dedicated caster character.\nRandomized item stats.  If you liked that in Diablo (and every other appearance since then) then you wouldn't consider this a negative, but games that leave you at the mercy of the RNG reward luck as much as player skill, and that's not really what old-school RPGs were about.\n\nI hope that Numantian will take this opportunity to fix a few of the more painful problems with this game.  I would really like to be able to recommend it, because at its core, there's some real potential.  But as it is, right now, I would strongly suggest to anyone, no matter how much they like the top-down RPG, that they not buy this game.  It's just not worth your time and money.","August 7, 2014","false","15.0"," 115 of 177 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","115","177","0","10"

If you grew up with the classics or liked newer games like eschalon, knights of the chalice, or the spiderweb games despite their non-AAA gfx, but the immersive gameplay, then this might be for you.\n\nFrom the first looks it might seem a little like the infinity engine games, but actually it is more some flair of those mixed with half random, half fixed encounters on the map (the randoms can be avoided at some cost) and the battles itself are more like the ones in wiz6/7 games.  Beside the ranges of the fighter's weapons also their position plays into the ranges so you want or have to reposition your fighters while it battle, which gives a nice twist.\n\nWhile in pre-EA there where some bugs, usually ironed out quite fast by the devs. I played a bit before EA and now I am waiting for the Linux version.  Suggestions at that time given to the devs in their forum where implemented within a few hours.  The devs are very dedicated and sure listen to reason.\n","August 4, 2014","true","3.6"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

This game is fantastic.  There have been very few truly great RPGs over the years, and lots of almost-but-not-quite ones.  The greats for me - Pool of Radiance(and nearly all of the SSI gold box games), World of Xeen, Baldur's Gate(1 & 2), Plansecape:Torment, and now Lords of Xulima.\n\nThe pacing is solid.  I basically have been leveling up just about the time I start to feel like I need to.  Too many games either level you constantly or make you grind it out.\n\nThe game runs smoothly and the interface is fantastic.  One example:  Whatever way you want to choose the next baddie to attack, it is there for you - Want to kill off the guy on the right that is threatening your cleric with oblivion; just click on him there in the field of battle - Want to focus your firepower on the next monster idue to try to put a stomping on you; just click on his representation in the attack queue.  It is a little thing, but it is right.\n\nThe mission feels meaningful, even if it is the old "chosen hero saving the world" overall storyline.  It doesn't feel like a generic group of pixels clicking attack buttons.  The classes are unique and each has a flavor (my favorite is the divine summoner - mostly because you've never seen a class quite like that before.\n\nThe biggest compliment I can give this game - it was obviously NOT written for the console jockey.  Don't get me wrong, I think the game would work very well ported to a tablet, or even a console.  I just does not feel like a console game ported to PC as an afterthought, which is what we have been getting way to much of for the last few years.\n\nI'm sure people could find things to nitpick, and if I had one improvement to suggest it would be the way the story is expressed feels a little jarring.  Conversations don't feel natural...the more I think about it, I am not sure this is a negative - The game conversations remind me of listening to a DM in the pen and paper days of my youth - They tend to feel like they are coming from the same guy, just in different voices.  lol.\n","January 20, 2015","true","62.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

There has been a lot of turnbased games the last couple years, most of them good, this is in the higher end of the good one's, really nothing that stands out as a short-cut or not done right.\n\n3 difficulty settings and they are needed, this game can make you fall to your knees, but I did find the addition of the easier difficulty welcome as the original difficulty made you work for it and I haven't tried the hardcore.

The difficulty is steep early game, but that's the driving factor for developing your characters.  The one downside to the game is that because you do need to have care about your party's development, the party will eventually become really powerful late game, making the last challenges trivial.

Opulent graphics, action-based combat and you can get even a nude cheat.\n\nThat is all what this game is NOT about.\n\nLords of Xulima is a game which is old-fashioned. In a very good way. You lead a party. It has turn-based combat. And in this combat positions, skills, side-effects like bleeding, poisoning and so on are really meaningful and at the same time not annoying. The food system is something I was very critical about in the beginning but now I see how it adds to the tension (in this game you have food reserves and deplete them slowly by wandering about and quickly while resting to heal up again). I admire this game especially for the economy. It is tight but not too tight. There are games out there where gold has no meaning: you have always enough and buying potions and such is more of a hassle than a decision. Not so here. Money is scarce, potions are expensive and you need them.\n\nThe graphics are not Skyrim but they are beautiful. The back story is not a high point but it does its job, that is giving you a goal and mile stones to achieve it. There are secrets and lots of puzzly stuff. You know these old rpgs where you get a hint, then a seemingly unsolvable situation appears but then you remember the hint and you can progress? Xulima has that in spades.\n\nYou can save whenever you want. You need to save often. Because you can lose fights. Yes, it is one of these games. No mercy for the weak. Ok, there is a kind of mercy: you can always lower the difficulty. But on the normal difficulty setting ("Old Veteran") the game is challenging - but just in the right way.\n\nI always searched for a game which triggers the same feelings like Might Of Magic and Bard's Tale of old. Here it is. With just the right adjustments for modern times, with an automap where you can make your own notes and a comfortable journal. If you are grown up with Bard's Tale, Might of Magic, Wasteland 1 or Dungeonmaster: buy it. Now. If not, buy it anyway. And take some weeks off.

I'll try keep it short and sweet.\nLooking for an 'oldschool' rpg to scratch the itch? This is probably the game for you.\n\nYou play a party of 6 characters choosing either the default setup or custom classes. Decent mix of classic and hybrids are available from Bards through to Arcane Soldiers. Choice of class effects base stats, starting skills and weapons but can be developed into modified variants depending on how you choose to play. 3 difficulty levels are available and while the game has been criticized for being a bit brutal, playing on normal or easy with the default party should be more then managable and enjoyable for most.\n\nCombat is Turn Based and feels very similar to Legends of Grimrock or the Might&Magic Series. Position of units on the battlefield plays an important role with two blank spaces available for you to move units around as you see fit. Traveling on the worldmap acts in pseudo realtime consuming up time and rations as you move. Which is what you will be spending your gold on earlygame, stockpiling food before traveling is a must.\n\nDepending on party skills as you travel you will find extra rations, detect traps and just discover curiosities in general. Which leads me to my next point, this game has a strong focus on natural exploration along the same lines of the early divinity games and the eschalon series. Far from being linear you are often moving around trying to find the next 'questline' thats achieveable by your current level, which works extremely well. That's not to say you don't have quests handed out from towns either. Content wise I have been told there is around 50-60% unlocked and 100% already ingame which is just getting some refinements.\n\nGraphically the game supports 1440p+ setups and I assume being handdrawn art it really is a joy to play. Small nitpick would be the fact you can't seem to enter inside many(any?) buildings early on, but you do go inside dungeons and other locales. Doesn't take away from the game too much. Voice acting is of a bare minimum but the text and colours used is well written with good readbility. The soundtrack is mostly instrumental and not only relaxing but fitting for each environment and I would love the ability to purchase the soundtrack on steam. :)\n\nTL:DR\nEnjoyed any of the games I referenced? Should at the very least be keeping LoX on your shortlist.\nIt is fantastic, ready to play now and personally has me completely hooked.","August 17, 2014","true","11.7"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","3"

And I'm happy to say that it really shines in these areas.\n\nProgression-wise, the game lets you build a party of 6, including a premade main character with a unique class.  You can pick from 9 classes when making your other 5 characters, and each class offers unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.  You can definitely agonize over what the optimum party config is for hours if you are prone to that madness :).\n\nAs your characters level-up, you gain skill points that you can spend as you choose.  In LoX, weapons, spells and skills like "lockpick" are all treated as "skills."  The majority of skills have "levels," with different skills having different max levels.  What this means is that you will probably want to focus on maxing out a few skills so that you don't gimp your characters with a bunch of weak skills as opposed to a few strong ones.\n\nAll in all, the progression system is nice because you have a lot of wiggle room in how you customize your party and each character within your party.  You also unlock new skills as your characters level up, so this makes leveling pretty fun.  You won't find the absolute crap-ton of skills in LoX that games like Wizardry had, but the fact that you can level up skills independently and that each skill feels pretty unique makes up for this.\n\nAs for combat, LoX has turn-based combat with the turn order displayed on the side of the screen so you can see who's going next and strategize.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the combat.  It is VERY challenging, and you feel like you really need to consider every action, especially early on.   It's really imperative that you think about how your party is going to work together effectively if you want to succeed in combat.  You absolutely need defensive characters in the front row to soak up damage, or you will find your poor fragile mage getting his or her face kicked in repeatedly.\n\nThe combat interface feels slick and snappy, and the combat graphics are very impressive for a $20 indie game.  I was really impressed with the combat overall, stellar job here.\n\nNext, the exploration aspect of the game,  Exploring in LoX seems pretty good so far, the zones all seem to have interesting things to find, like puzzles, riddles and lots of loot to gather.  The exploration also has an element of danger, because you never know when you're going to wander into a trap, or get ambushed by a monster that will absolutely destroy you.  Make sure to save often!\n\nIf I have any gripe about exploration, it's that sometimes there are secret doors and the switches can be insanely frustrating to find, requiring you  to combat over wall after wall with your mouse.\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to any fan old school CRPGs, or new-old-school CRPGs like Divinity:OS.  It's a really quality indie-RPG that seems to be a cut above most indies.  However, if you're looking for a very story-heavy experience, or you don't want a challenging game, you may want to look elsewhere.","November 16, 2014","true","65.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

It is set on a mythical lost continent called Xulima, where the world makers lived in ancient times. The game features a vast, challenging world where you will lead Gaulen the Explorer and five of his companions on an epic journey filled with the struggles of Gods and Humans. Create your party with up to six characters, choosing between 9 classes and more than 100 unique skills.\n\nGraphics: ★★★☆☆\nAttractive hand-drawn 2D graphics and 3D Pre-rendered models. Overall it looks pleasing.\n\nSound: ★★★☆☆\nThe music is reminiscent of some of the classic older titles and the sound effects and ambient sounds are nicely done.\n\nPlayability: ★★★½☆\nEasy controls and interface with an easy to follow Tutorial.\n\nEntertainment: ★★★★☆\nIf your familiar with games of the past like the Ultima series or the Might & Magic games, you will love this title as it takes you down memory lane. Those who are new to these type of games will get to experience the games that revolutionized the gaming industry.\n\nReplay Value: ★★★½☆\nI feel the game has a Good replay value since you party consists of 6 members and there are a total of 9 possible Classes to mix and match with 100 different skills to choose.\n\nOverall Rating: ★★★½☆\n\n\n\nMY PERSONAL REVIEW\n\n***This is Based off the Beta and Early version of the Game***\n\nThe Game is a throwback to some of the great classics of the past all mixed into one Game.  It has a Top-down view like the Ultima games and hand drawn backgrounds like the Baldurs Gate series. Combat switches to a turn-based combat system with a first-person view like Wizardry and the Might & Magic series. You start the game with six party members five of which you can create manually or you can simply click quick start to have the game create them for you. You have 9 classes to choose from each with there own skills. The game offers a lockpicking mini-game which I felt kept me entertained. Playing the early released version of the game is quite fun and I definitely recommend it to both those familiar and unfamiliar with these type of games.","August 7, 2014","true","32.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Once you gain a few levels it becomes a more fair and doesn't punish you as brutally as it did at the start.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand and I love it. There are times were I had no clue what to do or where to go (sometimes due to my own fault, not properly reading what was in front of my eyes!), so I'd visit a zone 2/3 times eventually giving up and reading the forums (most of the time I figured it out tho).\nSo if you are a person that gets annoyed easily with trying to figure out where to go, or things not being overly clear I would say: don't get this.\n\nI've heard comments on it being repetitive and a grind, I can understand why people feel like that. It's not an overly complex combat system. I didn't mind it as much because I was having a blast with exploring the map, picking flowers and getting distracted with the side quests/activities. There's plenty of stuff to bring in some variation.\n\nOnly 'downsides' for me was: sometimes the story can be a bit silly and the cheap version of Russel Crowe' as a voice actor. The tone didn't fit for me (otherwise a well done job)... So not real downsides, more personal preference.\n\nI fully recommend this if you are into the genre, if you don't have love for the genre (Boo! :p) there might be other games that suit you better for an introduction.\n\nWould love to see more games from this developer.\n\n\nThanks to Lolo for bringing this game to my attention and especially to Luft for giving me the opportunity to play it!","December 11, 2014","true","54.3"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","2"

And i dare to say its amber. While playing i felt like time went back and stopped. And its a positive thing!\n\nThe gameplay is classic in a good way, if you like turn-based games with teamplay you will find it here. The temples and other dungeons are challenging the puzzles will force you to your brain. The world is open in a way, if you are strong enough you can go almost anywhere in Xulima. Some of the sidequests are great, some are average but there is enough to make you wanna explore the whole world.\n\nI only played it on normal but the fight was challanging i didnt feel frustrated, but an autocombat feature might have been good, since the game rewards you for clearing a whole area, but the 'easy' fights can be too long sometimes.\n\n\nThe story was great, and it kept me going till the end. But the climax wasnt the last boss fight, it was the last picture, which is sad since i want the story to go on:D.\n\nThe lore is complex and i wanted to read it all and i enjoyed it, what is a great achievement in 2014. Videos only showed pictures but with the game it worked well and the atmosphere was nice.\n\nGraphic wise its hard to say anything since the core of the game doesn't need good graphic, but what we got was nice even the grass moved while you walked in it.\n\nTrap disarming and lockpicking is great, some games it can be frustrated but it was one of the best i have played yet. The food&rest system works well, but can give you a headache till you figure out how to deal with it.\n\nMy only disappointing part was the loot system. After you disarm two traps and lockpick the chest what you get? Three pile of gold, which is useful but you expect a good sword or a magical amulet.\n\nOverall i say this game is 9/10 for me. Even on normal it gives you around 40 hours of playtime to go through once, but you may even wanna go on later.","November 28, 2014","true","39.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

It allows people to play both pregenerated and individually created characters in the party. Solid game, for a fairly cheap price.\n\nThe biggest negative for me was that compared to many other games of this type, it is VERY linear. There is basically one path to advance through the story and game. This is done through content being tied very closely to party levels, and ability. Sure, there is the illusion of "sandbox" or non-linear questing, but in reality, you can go to the various places whenever you want, but the enounters there will wreck your party if they try to do things in the "wrong" order.\n\nPros:\n- Few bugs\n- Decent UI\n- Reasonable graphics\n- Decent if fairly generic gameplay\n- Reasonable sales price\n\nCons:\n\n- Very linear in playability\n- Some quests not explained well or have misleading instructions\n- Wide disparity in usefulness of character classes (some are very powerful, others nearly useless)\n\n\nOverall it gets a positive rating, it is a good game for what it is and what it is sells for.

It has been a long, long time till a game could make me lose track of time and give me a jump-scare when I finally look up at the clock. I used to be 13 hours in by then, but I am sure I will do multiple playthroughs of it.\n\nI absolutely love the diverse locations and enemies, and even more so the combat. It has a Disciplies 1&2 feel to it and it works beautifully. There are so many things to explore, discover, including hidden objects and doors, wandering through a forest maze to get to a treasure and so on.\n\nThe only gripe I have with this game is the loot. It is unfair to kill a boss and get something mediocre, or nothing at all. While looting the Prince of Nebros palace was fun, the big bad guy himself gave me nothing (EDIT: I was a newbie enough at that time to check the secret rooms, so here's a thing for you). Not even a chest in the throne room. I have a bad feeling that I will be forced to buy my gear throughout the game if I want to tweak it to my liking.\n\nGet the game guys, and try it. Last time it was like 10€ on sale, and for that price, it is a steal.\n\nOk having finished Xulima, let's see what it does well or poorly:\n\n1. Good stuff:\n- Good classes and underdog classes. All rpgs have those. It is fun to complete the game with both.\n- Quests tie to areas, so it is very easy to track. You dont get lost.\n- 80% of the Divine Summoner's summons are actually smart. The healer one will protect the most hurt party member.The Offensive ones will attack at random.\n- SO many difficult areas to navigate through and use your brain on. Like brain? That thing in your head?\n- Areas vary. So rarely you will see the same enemies.\n- Classes are diverse, but play in a similar manner, so you wont feel lost.\n- You can play some very hard class combos for your own masochistic enjoyment purposes.\n\n2. Bad stuff.\n- The loot. You will gain plenty of cash in this game, but loot is a problem. Buy doesn't compensate for those jumpstart moments when you see a great item.\n- Some classes are outclassed by others. Arcane Soldier is one. GIve him more burn and freeze please!!!\n- Classes need some reworking, although they an work like this well.\n\nTo edit further, this is the first game since MIght and Magic 6 and Wizardry 8 to make me do a 20 hour non-stop gaming spree.

Even too difficult for some fast-food player. But IMO it's very the difficulty Classic Rpg should be.It forces player to think and plan carefully for every step, not only those during the battle or char-building, but also when to go where for what. A brainless roaming or fight without plan will certainly cause disaster while a little adjustment of formation or equipment leads to total different end.\n\nAnd in the game, plot and mission fits each other perfectly. You don't get the bold direction as "Collect 20 pcs of Boar Skin and Return it to Joe" , instead you only know an orge block the way to somewhere you(or the merchants) need to go through. Rest of the mission should be explored by player self. Yes lacking 'direction' but full of fun from unknown.\n\nA lot of riddle and secrets, not so hard without any clue but still needs think and action.\n\nA huge world in elegant 2D graphic. You'll not get anything you need to know on the map but some implication of giant horror or tremendous treasure. You need to explore the world by your move, eyes and brain.\n\nA system of char-building based on skill and properties with strict rule of classic RPG. A system of many loots and equipment while none of them is useless or IMBA.\n\nThanks for such a great work. IMO it's far better than many so called AAA game with fancy graphic and no fun.\n\nJust wanna you guys know I'll certainly buy the next work even I live in China and payment method sucks.\n\nNO More to say but play.","November 18, 2014","true","74.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

It was well-done in that old-school Phantasie style I grew up enjoying on my Amiga.  But for the curious, I'll go over a few specifics which I think will provide for a better understanding of the game.\n\nStoryline -- Well thought-out and engaging enough to keep me attentive.   It wasn't enough to pull me in and make me feel like I had a personal stake in the outcome -- but I didn't feel utterly detached from the tale either.\n\nGame-play -- You can tell the game has been play-tested.  I got the impression that tweaks had occurred throughout the game in specific instances where you could sense something was approaching mind-numbingly repetitive or flatly unreasonable.\n\nMoney -- One of the major flaws in almost every rpg game is that at some point, money becomes completely irrelevant.  This wasn't the case here.  Again, I could tell the programmers intentionally designed it to always be important.   Some of tweaks were insightful (like buying skill points), while others were hamfisted (2600 gold for 6 days of food?!?)\n\nQuests -- Most of them were pretty easy, but enjoyable.  There was one MAJOR exception.  The Hall of Heroes Quest was a complete and utter waste of time and resources.  When I finally completed it, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I didn't feel an ounce of accomplishment -- only a strong disbelief that anyone thought that pile of stink would improve the game.  It irritated me enough that almost stopped playing the game entirely.  Yes, I went from "Can't wait to play every night" to "I'm OK if I stop playing this game for a long time."  As you can tell, I'm still irritated about and I completed the game at this point.  To anyone who buys this game, don't bother trying to figure it out for yourself -- there's nothing clever or original about it.  It's just an unfortunate blemish.\n\nLeveling -- The skill system was pretty straight-forward.  Perhaps it's in the documentation, but I rather wish I knew what skills I could've learned at later levels -- it certainly would've caused me to spend my points differently early on.  Which brings us to ...\n\nExploration -- Look, you're going to die.  A lot.  Save after every single battle.  I come from a school of thought where I tend to view this approach as cheating -- but honestly, it's not in this case.  If you wander into an area that you shouldn't be in, you'll die.  If you happen to meet a tough wandering monster, you'll die.  If you're in battle and you get an unfortunate roll, you'll die.  Exploration is basically a Lemming Mine Detector method.  You go there, die, and then you pick a different direction to go when you re-load it.  It's pretty much the only way you learn where not to go.   I've never been sure if this type of programming is intentional or not, but there you have it.\n\nLeveling -- At the lower levels, you'll die.  A lot.  <see exploration>.  It's a common problem you see with rpg games -- you just don't have any strategic options at lower levels.  You walk into battle, attack in the only way you can, and hope the rolls go your way.   Becaue if they don't, you'll die in 1 or 2 hits.  Tough stuff, really.  At the higher levels, you have quite a bit more leeway when it comes to strategy and recovering from bad rolls.  Someone, some day will figure out a way to address this issue.\n\nFavorite part of the game:  Probably the Herb gathering.  I'd walk into a meadow without any monsters and get excited.  That's pretty cool.\n\nLeast favorite part of the game:  Hall of Heroes Quest.  Whoever designed it should be shamed.  So much shame ...\n\n","January 26, 2015","true","118.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

Even though this game is supposed to lead you in a new territory, in the wilderness, you are restricted to follow a path in the woods, strictly leading to enemies that con "impossible", or "lethal" or "titanesque", each could as well be replaced by a wall, the message would be the same: don't go there. It feels more like a "heroes of might and magic" style of movement on the map, with a huge troll blocking the way until you grind enough and level up enough in a small zone to get rid of him. That's not my idea of an RPG.\n\nThe mechanismsThe possibilities of your characters are very few, 1 spell for your magician, 1 song for your bard, 1 attack for your warriors. That's it. The enemies are bags of HP and you have no other way to interact with them than just pressing your unique attack key during your turn an add up damage until they die. The same mechanism used in the last 25 years, nothing has changed. HP and mana doesn't regenerated with time, meaning that in order to resore your HP you have either to sleep for 8 hours, or use a spell or use money to purchase potions. Each resource being finite. In fact you could probably calculate how much gold is available on the first map, how much food is avaialble etc. Entering a city means paying with 100 gold, being hit means having to rest or having to cast,  which means food, which means gold. You can barely loot anything, even fighting armed humanoid won't drop you a weapon, in 3 hours I've only looted one rat tooth. All of this leads to a feeling of being restricted. You have to go there, you have to fight this, you have to rest, you have to purchase food etc, with no other option.\n\nDifficultyA rat will kill one of you character in 3 bites, but this is not where the difficulty resides. The real difficulty is to heal you characters with the few gold, potions and spells available. There is no real difficulty here, in the sens that there is no real skill involved, because there is no real choice. If your group takes too much damage in a fight then you reaload a saved game, since healing would cost too much. It's not really difficult, you are not challenged by the game, you rather have to endure a poor choice of game mechanism.\n\nLasting impressionI'm really dissapointed to see that even with free and performant game engines avaialble for everone there is still such a lack of inspiration when it come to game design. "Dungeon master" offered more diversity and a more immersive experience and it was 25 years ago. Brass blade, then what? Iron blade? then steel blade and then silver blade? I can see it coming, just like the lesser heal, then medium heal, etc.\n\nTL;DR: There is not enough here to keep me entertained","April 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 98 of 167 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","98","167","4","0"

In fact it was only 3-4 weeks before the v1.0 release. It was incredible how interested the dev was in user feedback and how quickly they worked in even major additions like the character quick-bar we now have or how they implemented weight info for shop items you intent to buy. All on user feedback and I have to say it again: amazingly fast.\n\nNow on to the game itself:\nThe game consists of an overland map where you move your group of 6 chars (5 of which you can design yourself out of 9 classes) and of a turn-based fighting screen which is best compared to Wizardry 8. Chars get turn depending on their speed. This means you can get more turns than other group members or enemies, if say... your thief is very quick on her feet. You have many tactical options in the form of spells, skills, moving chars around and using items.\nOn the map you have to look out for your food consumption and remember to restock in time. This mechanic shouldn't be a big problem in the easy and medium difficulty, if you are not too much into such things. Different terrains have different food consumption rates (think desert, meadow, forest, road, snow). There are also skills which influence this.\n\nThis game is oriented on old-school RPGs like Wizardry and Ultima. This means that there is little hand-holding and you have to use your brain and pick your fights. The dungeons have hidden doors and other environmental puzzles. Some of which are hard nuts. This may turn off some people who have never played older RPGs. I recommend to give this game a try nevertheless since it is a real gem. If you want to have a little bit more help you can always get the add-on "The Talisman of Golot" which has (among others) the option show you the right direction of your quest.\nThe world is full of little secrets and just wandering off and go exploring is great fun.  The art of the game is very pleasing and more than sufficient for the game to work. You can even use custom portraits now. Just like back in the Baldur's Gate days.\n\nDepending on how you play you can get 60 to 120h of game time out of one walkthrough. I have over 100h on the clock now and enjoyed every minute of it. For what you get this game is almost criminally cheap and the devs really deserve it. I can't wait to get more tales of the world of Xulima.\n\nIf you are interested in RPGs and liked the revived old-school gems that came out this year, you owe it to yourself to give this title a chance. I'm pretty sure you won't regret it! And there are always nice people on the steam forum to help you out with tips and clues if you are stuck ;-)\n\nAll thumbs up from me!\n","November 20, 2014","true","107.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Over those 20 some levels there have only been a couple of events that changed the feeling of the game - oh, look, my mage got their first mass-AoE; now most combats are about the mage spamming that spell.\n\nWriting is poor at best, I don't enjoy the "challenge" of the combat enough to consider playing hardcore, and the game breaks all sorts of guidelines that I look for in RPG design - with a point-based irrevocable class AND skill system there are lots of skill traps and poor party mixes. Now that I suspect 2 of my 6 party members are never going to be up-to-par, I don't enjoy the game or the story nearly enough to start over with a new party.

It took me a few times of starting a party, playing a bit, and then going back and making a whole new group. There is no right or wrong approach to party creation, although the game will punish you if you decide to, say, make five casters and the protagonist.\n\nYou're required to think and actually read the dialogue, the game nips grinding in the bud quite well with scaled areas that have a preset number of hidden and visible encounters. Clear an area, and you obtain an EXP bonus. It is quite possible to put yourself in an impossible situation where it appears that a restart is the only answer, however this typically means that you are missing the next area that you are supposed to go to. A bit of intuitive thinking (as a lot of the game are puzzles) and you can get right back on track.\n\nGameplay wise, the artwork is amazing for an indie RPG. There is the ability to both run and walk on the map, and more often than not I find myself walking, if only to look at the visuals. The world, characters, even combat animations are all gorgeous for the caliber of this game, and every area has its own unique look. The feeling of "I've been here before" is not present, unlike some other games I've encountered.\n\nCombat is all time and turn based. Pretty nifty system in my opinion, and one that's quite fun. You have your straight up damage, but then there are effects that, depending on the weapon type being wielded, can also come into play. Bleeds, which cause damage per combat turn (and every 10 'seconds' of combat time), stuns, wounds (stackable debuffs affecting ability to hit and evade incoming attacks). Then, you have poison, freezing, setting things on fire... the combat system is a well tuned machine in my opinion.\n\nCharacters are a bit tricky, I'll admit that I had to go and read one of the guides to get a better understanding... after all, you have 9 classes, and can only create 5 members. You are slightly railroaded here, in that if you don't have a healer of some type, you WILL encounter untold difficulties to the point that you will most likely end up dumping that save file. Core stats and skills run the game, you have 5 primary attributes which in turn affect various stats. The Skill System is also pretty filled out, making you carefully weigh and decide what you want your character to specialize at... The points are limited, and there's always going to be something else you want to put them in that you can't.\n\nThe only potentially annoying aspect that I've found thus far is that there is a food system in place, which decays based on the land you are traversing at the time. It caps out at 8 'game days' so that there is no extreme stockpiling, but even then, it hasn't been too large of a pain.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game for anyone looking for an RPG more in the vein of the classics. Simple yet complex, makes you stop and think, and is rather rewarding in my opinion. Would probably put it around an 8.5 or 9.0 out of 10 myself. Already nearly 40 hours in, on my 5th party, this one I'm keeping, and I'm already thinking about my next playthrough, even though I've barely scratched the surface on this one.","November 26, 2014","true","188.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Heres why.\n\nBought this on a whim, and it is extremely well put together, but the problems it has makes it a miserable experience to play in its current state.  The balance is very poorly done.  I only played it for a couple hours, but the entire time was just me running around trying to find an enemy I can actually defeat, and trying to save up enough money to actually purchase some equipment.  The problem is, when I finally leveled up, prices for everything also went up....Not to mention the fact that the guards charge you an entry fee the first time you enter town, and will do so over and over after a certain amount of time passes. Also, running in this game isn't actually "running" so much as it is just speeding up time making you appear faster...but everything else happens faster too.\n\nThe combat itself needs an overhaul.  I found that even during fights with some of the weaker enemies, only 1 out of every 3 or so attacks would actually land without a miss...a problem the enemies rarely have, making spells my only guaranteed damage..  Most of my combat experience has been me quicksaving before a fight, and trying over and over again until luck went my way and I landed enough hits to kill them.  I also found that when leveling up, it seemed almost counterproductive to level some spells.  The absurdly small increase to the spells power in a some cases isn't even close to being worth the extra mana cost considering the super low mana pools.\n\nAnother thing, I found the system for purchasing food supplies which are gradually depeleted as you play/rest (camp)/etc to be bugged...maybe?  It seems like purchased food doesn't stack with the food you're carrying.  Say I currently have 16 hours of food left, and I go to the vendor to buy some and I pay 60 gold to buy 1 days worth of food.  That fills me up to 1 day on the dot.  Basically only giving me 8 hours of food.  Which sucks, because it is more expensive to buy in bulk.  1 day supply of food - 60G  2 days supply - 150G starting out.  Those prices also increase as you progress.\n\nAll in all, this game has a TON  of potential.  And if they could get all the numbers lined out, It'd be a hell of a game.  Again, all of these issues were experienced in just a couple hours of gameplay, so maybe something changes later on...but combat based entirely on chance kills the experience right out of the gate.  Don't drop your money on this expecting anything but an extremely unbalanced early access title.  Again, my recommendation is to keep your eyes on this one, because it could be something awesome.","August 8, 2014","true","4.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The lands of Xulima are beautifully presented throughout impressive hand drawn backgrounds all covered in blood. I have not felt so satisfied since Ultima VII.\n\nThe core mechanics and combat are strikingly well implemented. Without respawning enemies of meaty experience, planning ahead is critical. The only way to progress is by becoming an armored armadillo rolling under / over / through every obstacle. This world is huge, but an unobservant party will miss a sprawling jungle behind one violently lonely rose.\n\nBeatings received in Xulima scale well between game settings. I have found the most entertaining difficulty to be Hardcore mode with Ironman enabled. Characters in a party receive a fraction of leveling rewards while demonic cursed hounds might as well render themselves as earth moving ironclad tanks pounding out bolts of electric death.\n\nUnfortunately, my Hardcore party hit an unstoppable spike in brutality after a solid thirty hours. I accepted their wonderful and savage defeat by transmigrationing them into a world filled with far less grim synergy. Veteran difficulty is the Goldilocks zone of Xulima and remains severely enjoyable.

It blends Ultima style isometric world exploration with turn-based Might & Magic style combat and delivers over 100 hours worth of adventuring.\n\nXulima’s designs and art assets are extremely reminiscent of the classic Ultima games with numerous familiar character models and items, to the point where one could question whether it’s more homage or theft. The story also progresses in a manner which is somewhat similar to the Ultimas and some of the NPCs even spout similar catch phrases, so fans of the old Lord British series will feel right at home.\n\nCombat is turn-based and fairly similar to old school Might & Magic and Bard's Tale games (or Paper Sorcerer would be a more recent example). Your party is arranged in front and back rows, with melee up front and only spells, missile weapons, and polearms capable of attacking from the back. Turn order is shown on the right side of the screen, with your Initiative stats and some randomization determining the initial attack sequence and Speed stats determining attack frequency. Each weapon type has a bonus effect, either stuns, bleeds, or wounds, and different spells also leverage those effects plus others like burns. Attack success is determined by a die roll exceeding a target value which is set by comparing the attacker's Attack stat to the attackee's Defense and Evasion stats.\n\nIt's actually a pretty cool system that pays homage to classic CRPGs while adding some modern updates, with a bit of extra depth thanks to effect stacking and turn order manipulation, plus an emphasis on resource management for power points, potions, scrolls, etc.\n\nWorld exploration is also fun, each area has a unique flavor with distinct terrain and other characteristics. Towns tend to be small, often just glorified outposts, but overall the world is fairly interesting and the entire game benefits from being hand crafted to show off the land’s unique features.\n\nXulima tends to be somewhat challenging compared to many recent RPGs, you can easily gimp your characters by building them incorrectly, and it doesn't provide quest arrows and other modern conveniences. It's not for everyone but the world exploration and combat is fun enough to make it worth the effort.\n\nA few noteworthy negatives… Xulima isn't truly open world, the available paths are far more restrictive than in the classic Ultima games and the world is split up into separate zones instead of being one continuous map. There’s also no monster respawn, once you clear a zone it stays clear, so that prevents the world from feeling as alive and realistic as the old Ultima games and it eventually limits how much you can level your characters. While the game offers a fun mix of classes there are some issues with class balance which tend to marginalize some of the options, and the combat system can be fairly unforgiving if you don't put points in the "correct" stats.\n\nThe Talisman of Golot DLC provides an item that you can use to periodically give your party a little boost. It collects energy as you kill things and progress through the game, then you can spend that energy to request assistance from the talisman in the form of money, food, bonus stat points, or bonus skill points. Also, if you're not sure what to do next to advance in the game, the talisman will tell you which objective you should be pursuing (and those little hints don't cost any energy). And that's all there is to it. No extra quests or other content, just a talisman that collects energy which you can occasionally exchange for a little boon (plus it's tied to an achievement or two).\n\nXulima isn’t a perfect game but it’s a fun homage to some of the classic CRPGs from the 80s and 90s. If you're looking for something that captures the feeling of the old Ultima games, Xulima will have no problem scratching that particular itch.","February 11","true","149.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

While the Game is still Role Playing light and Combat heavy and the Role Playing is mostly during combat with the enemies communicating with you and a few villagers communicating with you the game is very well designed.  There isn't much of plot line and the ending plot line means there really needs to be a Lords of Xulima 2 but one of the best things about the game is character customization.  The characters in this game are highly customizable via the ability to add two Stat points each turn to your normal stats such as Strength, Constitution, etc but you also gain ability points each turn that you can put into various spells, lockpicking skills, detect traps skills, learning skills, etc.  The list is huge of things you can put your ability points into making for a very customizable character.  Not just your typical Thief or Wizards but you can have guys that Identify things, Killing machines with Wounding skills and Blood drawing skills, etc.  There are quite a few puzzles and secret doors in the game to discover, there are vast areas of Frost and Desert to explore that are deadly at lower levels and there are 9 gods to appease :) .  You can gather herbs and raise your herb finding skill which is really useful as you can bump up many Stats with herbs.  The game grew on me a lot and I really felt I wanted to play more by the time I finished it.  I felt one of the very best aspects of the game was how you could super customize your characters.  I defintely recommend this one.\n","December 16, 2015","true","164.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It does a lot of really unique ideas and generally hits more than it misses.\nThe most noticeable aspect is its open world, with no difficulty scaling.  The game teaches you right away (literally the first encounter) that fighting everything you see immediately can kill you.  Your characters' strength scales quickly though, and you'll frequently go back and crush the things which previously required a lot of Save/Load failures.  It's quite satisfying, but frustrating when you find yourself in an area you're not supposed to be yet.\nThe RPG system is unique and well designed.  It has your usual characters (fighter/rogue/mage/cleric), along with some really unique ones (divine summoner.)  You can use excess money to improve your skills, and min-maxers will really enjoy how the system works.\nGraphically, the world is really vibrant and varied.  Which is good, because the game is LONG, and you'll be staring at it for a while.\nThe combat can get a bit old by the end.  You definitely are encouraged to specialize, which means you're usually using a lot of the same skills and abilities for the entire game.  The difficulty keeps things tense, but encounters can become tiresome.\nThe mod tools are very intuitive and you can easily tweak things you are annoyed by.  (such as the random encounter rate or the skill distribution on a pre-generated character.)","April 14","true","65.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's hard, it's old school, it's not exactly the most forgiving game, and it does not holds your hand at all. And frankly, I love it :)\nAnd once again, we have a kickstarter to thank for this.\nStoryline of the game is pretty well write but somewhat typical for a fantasy RPG. Although the fact that game features riddles where you have to enter answer yourself, does motivates you to read and remember all the dialogues thoroughly.\nThe core of the game though is it's overworld and combat - since that's what you're gonna be doing most of the time.\nTurn-based (or rather time-based) overworld features stationary enemies as well as some random encounters.\nCombat has a very simple set of rules to follow, but can be extremely hard (especially on higher difficulty). And it's definitely damn enjoyable if you like the idea of turn-based tactical combat in general.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-D-CA6-crU","August 30, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

But with this game it was different. At first glance it seems like a nice blend of might and magic concept at combat level with eschalon series in movement and awareness. But that is where all the similarities end. The mecanics, the mixed dungeons exploring, the carefull design quests keep you hooked and "coming back for more" when you loose combats by few drops of health.

I actually like the system of clearing, but perhaps allow us to auto trigger a combat if we are looking for a fight?  I mean, its obvious we can track the enemies, maybe a getting warmer sort of thing?\n\nThe loot.  This has been mentioned many times before, opening the treasure chest in the third sisters house to find an AMAZINGLY POWERFUL... dagger, and a necklace made of the best possible material is rather... blah.  I have no problem with randomized loot, but thats been pretty much the experience the entire game.  Every three days I run through all the vendors hoping theres a new better weapon which is pretty boring, but needed.\n\nEnergy.  Magic users utility sharply declines as the game progresses with pp costs increasing as much as 25 points between 1 level and the next it drastically curtails the abilities of the magic users to maintain viability without drinking craptons of potions.  If this is intentional thats fine, but allow us to stock up on potions at the vendors rather than giving us another reason to make the gauntlet to grab our 5 pots per stall.  Otherwise allow energy to grant more pp than it currently does.  Perhaps each point gives 4 after level 10 and 6 after 20?\n\nI spelled out the bad parts because the good dont need to be impoved upon.  This is an excellent game, and I believe if these minor annoyances are fixed it will become one of the best in recent memory.

It is a lot of fun with a decent story and interesting combat.\n\nPRO's:\n\n-Good variety of enemies that can require changing combat tactics.\n-Random encounters can be avoided 2 ways if you want to avoid it and you can also "clear" any area.  After xx encounters in an area the area becomes clear and you get an xp bonus.\n-Plenty of exploration and a pretty big world.\n-Puzzles, secret doors, traps and such\n- In theory a good variety of spells/weapons/abilities\n\nCON's:\n-Some classes just seem completely useless compared to others.\n-For all the opportunity to explore, solve puzzles, and treasure hunt the loot in this game is extremely dull.  It is so bad that multiple chests in one dungeon with give you an identical trash item.  Depending on who you are it can really take away the motivation to solve a puzzle knowing you will get complete garbage.  The only items I have used are sold from towns.\n-Every boss fight has been a joke in difficulty and the challenging fights seem to be from random encounters.  Some can argue that if you play at max difficulty, dont use certain classes/weapons/spells its more of a challenge, well I could also play blindfolded to create a challenge.\n\nSome petty complaints:\n-Your main hero is a pre defined character by name/portait/class.  I think they should have let us customize him in some way and the game can still reference him as the explorer as they do now.  This guy just looks like such a goober.\n-I have had this game for a month and from what I can tell the dev's have been completely silent.  Personally that is potentially a red flag that support has ended.\n\n\nAll in all this game is a lot of fun and a good buy.  There are some simple improvements that could be made that would go a long way.  Also if this game ever gets opened up for modding I would say it is worth double the price.","January 12, 2015","true","47.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game seems to have a little of each of these games in it and has its own flavor. My only problem with the game is the graphics. They seems a little too cartoonish for a game that has a serious story. On the other hand, maybe this is intentional because the best of the 80's was no different. In terms of the 80's, there is even a giant who talks like Macho Man. What really surprised me is that the first real big boss battle I had was with a Beholder from D&D. I think their doing a great job of Old School appeal. As far as the story, its epic. You get that real sense of mission that a good story delivers.

You get to pick out of 10 classes and you can have more than one of each in your party, making a lot of combos interesting. You never get to level up all the skills available for each class, even at max hero level. That gives space for planning and strategy. Weapons get disablng or damaging effects that change the battle and you get to specialize in them if u want.\n\nOverall it is quite satisafactory to build a great party and win battles. Each battle is unique and challedging, although after a while it may get repetitive. Still there is always a battle you cannot win no matter your level or equipement and that keeps you going.\n\nThe story is original and good.\n\nGameplaywise It plays somewhat like kings bounty mixed with Might & Magic\n\nI am surprised that even after so many hours spent playing the game i never get enough.","October 8, 2014","true","84.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Took me about 80 hours of my lifetime, spread over like, eeeh, 9 months or so... I had abandoned this game multiple times due to unbearable frustration caused by, well, you will see :D\n\nI'm gonna start with some basic stuff about the story: you play "Gaulen, the Explorer" and his five ever loyal companions (which can be predefined or custom made). Gaulen is chosen by some god-dude to go on an epic quest to... urgh, jeez, go read some wiki or whatever -.-' Just be assured that the plot could hardly be any more all-out and important and epic and fate determining and... monotonous :\ Did you ever watch any crime series on TV? There's always a murder at the beginning, 40 Minutes later justice is spoken, episode's over, see ya next time. Ah yes, and of course there is some super-important plot swirling around in the background, like the inspector, who's actually a writer, is in love with his female partner or something! Thats pretty much how Lords of Xulima feels: do the same thing over and over, watch some storypieces drop by every now and then. So if you are into unforeseeable plottwists and non-linear stories, don't expect too much here! Don't get me wrong, the game does have a really nice handcrafted lore in which the story takes place, it's just your activities in it which are rather repetitive.\n\nMentioning the lore leads me to tell you about the game world. Xulima is an island, it can be traveled in its entirety and is devided into several regions. Despite its size Xulima shows a lot of diversity, from icy snow lands, over lush meadows to dried sand deserts, everything's there. Each region has its own map and is connected to neighbouring ones. Traveling between regions can be done via those connections or through portals, which of course have to be activated before they can be used. Your party, represented by Gaulen, is moved around the maps by clicking or by use of the arrow keys. Talk to NPCs, explore dungeons, collect treasures and do all the other fancy RPG-stuff, but always watch your food supplies! Food adds a strategic element to traveling the world of Xulima, as it is needed to replenish your party after a though fight, or simply to travel the world without an empty stomach (which otherwise causes debuffs and over-time damage, jeey ^^). Xulima is not all open-worlded though, while you could theoretically go anywhere you want to from the very beginning, the game prevents you from doing so by placing undefeatable enemy squads in your way. Sounds cheap, but this is actually a major part of the challenge posed by the game. Finding your way around and opening new paths is one of the dominant early game activities (and really really sucks at some times, you gonna want to quit, believe me).\n\nNow enough about exploration, let's face Combat! Might! Magic! Hit chances! Critical fails! Spell failures! Over-time damage! Action modifiers! Inabillity to act! Curses! Death! Frustation! Fighting is a big part of Lords of Xulima. You will have to fight handplaced enemy parties as well as random encounters. The battle system is actually quite simple: every fighter takes his turn in order of the action que and can then perform a single action, like attacking, casting a spell or using an item. "Buh, lame!" , ok wait, wait, theres more to it. This game has the most exaggerated amount of bad status effects and things that could possibly go wrong I have seen in any video game yet. Well, of course there's poison and bleeding and burning doing some nice over-time damage, stun or freeze to prevent combatants from acting, or maybe one of your heroes just goes crazy and clobbers his allies, thats of course only if he's not too heavily wounded to get anything right in the first place! And then there are critical fails, actions that fail so hard, that the character attempting it actually hurts himself. Imagine your mage spent a huge amount of power points (thats what you need to perform skills and spells) to cast his most deluxe spell, that would turn the tides of battle in your favor and then it just... FAILS! ... *fizzle*, power points gone, caster takes damage, battle is lost, hurray! Even your bard tends to fail singing songs so hard that he manages to hurt himself (go find an other job pal)! But at least once the battle is over, all the pain is forgotten, well except for lost health and power points, wounds, critical wounds, sicknesses and curses... take a 24h rest, not like food is rare and expensive, and don't mind those sicknesses and curses, the kind priestesses will glady lift them from you for, like, all of your money -.-\n\nI don't want to say a lot more about this game, these were the crucial aspects that come to my mind when I think back on my playthrough. But wait, this review sounded quite negative so far, still I'm recommending Lords of Xulima! Why? Here goes the conclusion:\n\nIt is an excellent video game! Period! Maybe I'm not the most representive gamer on earth, but thats how I feel about it. If you like games that hold your hand, show you your way around with questmarkers and let you swap difficulty if a boss is too hard, Lords of Xulima is not for you. This game hates you! It hates you and it lets you know! You will have to think about how to set up your party and how to skill them, farm for level-ups to get bosses down, solve puzzels connected to the games lore and endure a lot of frustration. But to manage your way through all those seemingly undeaftable bosses and unsolveable puzzles feels so incredibly rewarding, that you will not want to miss the experience of having played Lords of Xulima!!!1one11!!eleven1!\n","November 22, 2015","true","80.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also, I found gold never lost its value, you never became wealthy to the point that gold became worthless, there was always a nice balance. The visuals are nice, sharp and vibrant but here we move onto some negatives.\n\nSome of the monsters look almost Disney like. At times, I found my party of 6 armed heroes taken out by a couple of Ravens. The villages you come across are almost clones of one another which doesn't offer much excitement and there are few people to interact with. At times the voice acting and dialogue is cringeworthy. I guess these points can be subsumed under immersion, in that they reduce the immersion of the game. Other annoyances for me were things like traps going through walls or being unfair. I remember many times walking slowly through a hallway with my perception being high and still not detecting a trap until it was too late. Repetition was also an issue sometimes with fighting similar groups of monsters, or disarming traps, picking locks that were similar throughout the game.\n\nBack on the positive however, combat was always good and never ceased to be challenging. It was a good experience when you make it through a battle by the skin of your teeth or get defeated and try to work out what needs to be done differently for next time. The music is good and I thought the levelling system worked well. Overall, it was good enough to keep me playing for over 90 hours and if you are willing to overlook the flaws, there is a really solid game just beneath.\n\nRating: 7/10","June 9, 2015","true","90.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This was a Kickstarter homerun for me, and I'm glad I got the physical edition (very nice fold-out map, among other things).\n\nThis game can be quite challenging, especially in the early parts of the game, if you don't know what you're doing. There's very little handholding, so check out the community guides for some very helpful advice on builds and classes etc.\n\nMy favorite type of game tends to be turn-based strategy games w/ a fantasy setting. This game has that, a decent story, some interesting classes and synergy between them, tons of things to do, and a lot of gameplay and replayability on top of that.\n\nIf you want to grind (to get "area cleared" bonuses, along w/ normal xp, loot, etc.), you can, but the game doesn't force you to. In fact, the lead PC has specific skills to avoid combat altogether (not sure why you'd want to, but it's a nice option at least).\n\nI highly recommend taking very good notes on the various maps; especially if you plan on playing a 2nd time (e.g., locations of secret doors, switches that open them, that kind of stuff).\n\nThis is a game that shows what you can do w/ a modest budget and a love for what you're doing. The only negative thing I could say about it is that the English translations (mostly spellings) aren't always perfect. Most people won't even notice...\n\nOne piece of advice (I should have followed in the 1st game). Don't pick any herbs (fruit is ok) until Gaulen has maxed out his Knowledge of Plants skill. It will require backtracking on the various maps, but after they're cleared anyway, that doesn't take too long, and the benefits are definitely worth it.","August 14, 2015","true","267.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game does many things right. Combat is pretty fun and a radically different experience can be had when playing with different classes. I love that the game is fairly simple but still offers plenty of challenge. The maps are nicely drawn and engaging.\n\nMy problems stem from the obscure puzzle like approach to questing - this confuses the heck out of me. Time and again I find myself not knowing what to do next. How do I get into this tower? How do I get to the next zone? How do I get into the castle? How do I cross the woods? Each time I have to tab out of the game and scour the internet for advice.\n\nI would love it if this game just kept the hack/slash attitude and toned down the puzzles greatly. I don't need puzzles in my hack and slash and I don't think others do either.  Another problem is that the food mechanics feels very punishing for exploration - makes one regret exploring the map. I think the food should be reserved to restoring health only and not used when just walking around.\n\nI am still playing the game even after the above - that means that there is a good game to be had here. My main regret is that the game could be so incredibly better if they only made a little more accessible.

The story is good, and has an ability to make you want to keep playing to see what you'll unlock next, and where the narration will take you.  Some have described the game as "too linear", but I didn't feel that much.  At the beginning, yes, but it allows you to get a feel for the game play, and get used to managing your party.  Soon players will find that the world begins to open up to them, and the whole set up makes discovering a new area to explore all the more exciting.  Puzzles abound, with many in game clues that are obvious once you discover their secrets, but you will have to read.  Find a random note on some dead adventurer's body?  It's not by chance.\n\nOne thing to note:  Level 1 is VERY difficult.  If you're not careful with encounters, and keeping your characters fully rested, some of your party members will die.  That said, there are in game mechanics to over come this, and make the early game difficulty a non factor.\n\nI've played several RPGs that started out great, and then begin to lose their luster mid game.  Not so with Lords of Xulima.  I find myself wanting to continue on to the next quest, and unlocking the secrets of the next area.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes old school, turn based RPGs and is looking to recreate that feel without going back to "retro" graphics and game play.  Lords of Xulima provides that feeling, while keeping a fresh perspective on how a modern RPG should play.\n\nOne of my favorite games to play, and sure to be a future classic.  Definitely a world worth visiting, and revisiting.","June 8, 2015","true","267.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not being able to understand the game makes it even harder.\n\nWhat can i say? The game is great and absolutely brilliant, a really throwback at classical RPGs.\n\nIts a very rush and unforgiving world but vincible. The unbalance thing of the game is only notice at the start when you have no idea of what to do, its necessary to understand that in this game you got to preserve every resource that you find.\n\nI'm liking it mysteries and secret stuffs to be found, and defenitly recomnd the game if you like classical RPGs with oldschool approach and a hard unforgivable world.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nDont get me wrong, i liked the game, its really good.\n\nWhy negative? its too much unbalanced the initial party could even kill simple rats... the game is designed to be hard, i support that idea, but the balance of the game will be a very challenging feat to achieve, and i really hope they do. The game is very impossible to kill anything, my statment is from the begining of the game of course..... Will wait till some balance come or the game will be dead for me....

Be prepared to reload, and wince everytime you rest, seeing your precious food rations go down.\n\nSort of reminds me of Demon Souls style, just not so punishing. (Aka you die a lot, but when you die, you reload from last save, no worse)\n\nNo bugs or crashes either so far for me - and these days with AAA publishers releasing crappy buggy games, it is nice to see a new developer managing to get a game out with so few bugs (that is atleast for me, and so far in the game)\n\nOnly 13 hours in but so far so good.

So much so that I just want the game to finish already. There's too many random encounters late game but unfortunately these are needed for xp so you can level up enough to to beat the harder mobs. Ths is just a repetitive space filler IMO.\nAlso, reading the forums will make it obvious there is balancing issues with the chars. Needing to build a party with a particlar loadout (ie: 3 soldiers) to beat the game is poor balancing. Keep this in mind.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nReally good game ! Perfect for anyone wanting a modern turn based RPG old school adventure. A few points:\n\n1) It's challenging. You need to think. There are times when things seem impossible - but there is always a way around.\n2) Not every monster you come across must be fought then & there. Some are too hard and must be revisited later.\n3) This game requires a lot of 'path finding' - finding alternate ways to reach your destination (walking around traps, tough mobs, thickets of trees etc).\n4) Ensure your party is well balanced. All attributes are necessary.\n5) Prioritise purchasing of mana potions.\n6) Use the blessings from the town spiritual healer as often as possible - they make a huge difference.\n7) The talisman of Golot DLC is worth it. The gold giving ability it provides is a massive help.","May 13, 2015","true","133.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And for a good reason.\n\n-----This game is RIDICULOUS in how good it is.-----\n\nWith the lack of quality games recently, I'm becoming the type of person that picks a game up and is bored of it within an hour, tops, because I usually can already tell what the game is, where it's going, and feel like I've already experienced the best it has to offer. For this reason, I typically don't spend money on games and end up playing mindless flash games on the internet.\n\nThis game is just wow. I downloaded it and just played it for over 5 hours straight. It sucked me in. It's perfectly challenging.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough if you are a fan of RPGs in ANY facet. This could end up being one of my favorite RPGs of all time, and that's saying a lot as I've played and beaten well over 50.\n\nI feel like I STOLE the game only paying 20 bucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/recommended/296570/","jinsaku","Jinsaku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jinsaku/","1022 products in account","Lords of Xulima is an old-school isometric party-based RPG with turn-based party combat in the classic RPG style. You control a party of six looking to end a war on your homeland and end up getting caught up in a war between gods in far off lands.\n\nWhile Lords of Xulima is a good game, it's not necessarily a great game. The combat system is a nice and fresh take on a 25+ year old system. The world is large and well detailed. The game definitely doesn't hold your hand, requiring some decent wandering to figure out sometimes where to go next. (hint: make use of the in-game world maps, shows you at  a high level where a lot of things are). The exploration and plant mechanics are interesting and there's a lot to discover about the world.\n\nUnfortunately, the story isn't particularly interesting. While the ending is good, the lead up is really just a series of "defeat X bosses. Ok, you did that, now defeat their Y bosses. Ok, you did that. Now defeat their Z bosses". With only one set character and 5 generated/built characters, only your one main character speaks to NPCs or has any personality. There's a ton of artificial gating in the world to keep you out of areas you shouldn't be yet. You sometimes don't realize that a path that was gated is now open because you progressed in the story.\n\nThankfully, the game does have a good amount of fast travel between most regions having a gate you can warp around to and each town having "hearthstone"-like crystals to allow you to quickly return to the town.\n\nLook to spend about 40 hours on a playthrough. A lot of that will be grinding levels. The levels come somewhat quickly, but progression in the game is slow. The story is linear, though there are side-quests you can do in pretty much any order. The replay value is very low, except to try on harder difficulties. I recommend the "Old-School Veteran" mode. It was a decent challenge, particularly at the beginning.\n\n6/10. I'm glad I played through it, but it's not a game I'll remember much of a year from now.","January 31, 2015","true","34.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Some dude beat up all of us, can you beat him up for me?" That's literally all there is to the plot. Gaulen also has no personality beyond fulfilling this mission. Since the game wipes out your party for trying to not follow the red line, you have no means to influence that, either.\n\n-Character Creation\n\nEven if there's nine classes in total, I can't help but feel there was no balancing involved. I haven't played all of them yet (not that I want to waste any more time with this than I need to), but I'll give a brief overview of each of chars:\n\nGaulen the Explorer\n\nMain character. He's basically a fighter, but also has a bunch of overworld boons. Not that interesting, but at least the only forced character is not a liability.\n\nAzura the Paladin\n\nStanding in the middle to heal. The only problem with that is that I need to invest into the healing aura to keep it useful, making its skill cost creep up faster than my maximum PP, so that I can use it less often. At least she has enough armor to keep herself alive (tough luck for her fellows in the front row)\n\nKallindra the Arcane Warrior\n\nShe has what I'd like to call the Black Mage problem. As her only skill is one that does damage, in addition to being not as strong as a true fighter, she must spend PP to accomplish what a fighter can do without spending PP. While she isn't weak when just hitting things, her skill is pretty mediocre and quite frequently fails (reminds me of random tripping in SSBB).\n\nBoreas the Thief\n\nI believe any group without a thief is weaker than one that has him. He can pick locks and detect traps, which allows you to get loot without massive wounding and also not taking humongous damage in dungeons. Furthermore, he even gets a skill to lower buy prices and raise sell revenue (which is crucial given how scarce money is). The bow sucks at Level 1, but as he skilled it, it gains wounding that cripples strong enemies.\n\nMike the Wizard\n\nHe has the Black Mage problem I mentioned with Kallindra. The game keeps the oldschool idea of a damaging mage while most modern games make spellcasters focus on crowd control. While I don't oppose this idea, the scaling of PP makes it really hard for him to do his job right.\n\nMaia the Divine Summoner\n\nThe only class with any form of originality in it. She summons creatures that are the avatars of the gods to help you for a few turns. Her energy growth was decent enough that I could have her help out in tight battles, too. I'd love to have a better explanation for what the summons are for, though (I had a tank beast and a healer chick at my disposal).\n\n-Enemies\n\nThis is the number one point where most RPGs fall flat - no matter how unique and interesting a game makes the character creation, enemies seem to solely consist out of HP and Attack values and maybe a status problem or a multi-hit ability. Lords of Xulima is no different. Enemies generally have no more than two actions and have little variety in how they're arranged. Success solely depends on you having higher numbers or, if the numbers are roughly even, that you roll better on hitting than the opponents do. An example how I'd do encounters (an example):\n\nFront Row:\nWorker Bee, Monster Rose, Worker Bee\n\nBack Row:\nMonster Lily-of-the-Valley x2\n\nThe worker bees have high evasion, but low HP and are weak to lightning. Their main action is gathering pollen (which recovers the HP of the rose or the LotV), which they can throw at your dudes for little damage and stun. Provoking them makes them sting you, which does quite a bit of damage and poison, but instantly kills the worker bee.\n\nThe monster rose mainly shoots spikes to do low-medium damage to the entire front row. Hitting it in melee makes your attacker take damage in retaliation. At lower health, it uses a single target petal shot that does shadow damage and can wound. It's health is quite high and it's weak to fire and resists light/divine.\n\nThe LotVs have rather low health and poison melee attackers. They shoot pollen at you that can cause stun, dealing medium-high damage. They swing their blossoms in melee if forced into the front row, dealing less damage and removing the chance to stun. A friendly LotV can force them to go into the back row if there's someone to stand behind. Immune to poison, resists shadow and weak to fire.\n\nThis is a battle where you can strategize - do you blast the worker bees with lightning so they can't heal? Or do you save  the magic for the melee-punishing rose? Pick apart the LotVs with ranged strikes to keep them from murdering your group? Or do you neuter them by provoking the bees with your tank? Protect your group from poison or rather stun?\n\nIf I can think of creative enemies without any drafting, the maker sure as hell can.\n\n-Other things\n\n-Having a tight food clock and constant expenses punish exploration and cripple you for looking into old places, forcing you to use a guide to know where to go at all times.\n\n-No custom portraits? Acceptable, but disappointing.\n\n-It's amusing that the game lets you access quickload in the middle of a battle. Did the maker expect savescumming the encounters?","April 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

The game is not incredibly complex, but harkens back to games of old like the Wizardry and Might and Magic series (which the developers are admitted fans of).  The combat is fun and many fights require strategy to defeat without the fights being getting very repetitive.\n\nCombat is a mix of random encounters and static encounters (which you can see on the map).  You can fight enough of the random encounters that they stop spawning (which gives you extra experience) - so they don't bother you forever.\n\nThe game is not flawless.  There are some points which are obvious road blocks which you aren't meant to pass without proceeding elsewhere (or levelling up) first.  That's fine - but there's not always an indication or hit of where to go next.  Some areas are intentionally meant to be time consuming to get through, such as the deserts and tundras which require tons of food to get through.\n\nRegardless, a great fun game - especially for those who enjoyed the classic RPGs of the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nOne tip: Level your speed skill heavily on all characters (every level up, or close to every level up).","December 27, 2014","true","76.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was surprised by the depth and scope of this game when I started playing it. The art style suits this type of game very well and the music is very soothing making playing this game a very enjoyable experience. It also a quite difficult game, which requires strategic planning and levelling of characters. The enemies don't scale to your level, which means that exploration is dangerous as it is exciting. There is always a general direction the story is taking you, but that doesn't mean there is isn't a fair amount of exploration to be made "off the tracks". Oftentimes, you need to explore independently because otherwise you won't be able to take on the enemies further on. This difficulty makes it deeply rewarding when you actually succeed in defeating a boss or making it to the next area.\n\nThis RPG title introduces a host of different spins and ideas on the genre which I think are valuable for RPGs to come in the future. I would also love to see Numantian Games make more titles as they demonstrated true skill and passion in the design of "Lords of Xulima".","April 28, 2015","true","28.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't at all play like an indie game (perhaps thanks to the generously overfunded kickstarter campaign), even though it's the first game released by the developers.\n\nIn a nutshell, LoX is a classic console RPG re-imagined for the modern gaming age.\n\nWhat really makes this game unique is the rich combat system. It takes already-established systems and greatly expands upon them to build a brilliant tactical system. For example, while most Final Fantasy games have a front-row/back-row system, the impact of it is minimal, and it's so automatic that some players won't even know it's there. However, it's front and center in LoX, and has a massive impact. Enemy melee attacks can only target your front row, and your melee attacks can only target their front row, usually only from your front row. Furthermore, neither you nor the enemy can have a unit in the back row without another unit in the front row to hide behind; kill that front unit and the one behind it moves up.\n\nThe game uses a turn-time system whereby faster units get to take more turns. I'm really baffled as to why more games don't use this. (It's quite similar to Final Fantasy 10)\n\nThere's also the rich debuff system; each weapon type inflicts one of three debuffs, each of which can stack to no limit. There's Bleed, which is a permanent damge-over-time effect which can easily do the majority of damage to a big character, Stun, which delays the unit's next turn and prevents attacks against it from missing for the duration, and Wound, which decreases the unit's stats. Some enemies partially resist some debuffs, and some flat-out immune one or two, but I've yet to find an enemy immune to all three, not even bosses. This is especially nice; your typical classic boss is immune to everything except raw damage, so bosses in LoX are more than just simple slugfests.\n\nA word of warning: LoX is hard. Min/maxing, intelligent tactics, and some amount of save scumming will be vital to success.","February 24, 2015","true","98.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a smash-up of games like Ultima, Might and Magic, Baldur's Gate and many others. It pulls many of the qualities that made the early RPGs so great and gives it a 2014 spin.\n\nCreate your party and venture into the wilderness. Be sure to bring plenty of torches, lockpicks, and food. This game will quickly let you know when you're in over your head and will force you to explore your options in the world instead of bull-rushing a questline.\n\nTwo thumbs way up on this one.","September 4, 2014","true","166.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's one of those games that demands that you keep playing it, even when you're knackered and should have gone to bed 4 hours ago. More polished and non-buggy than I've seen a lot of games at release lately (including AAA games), provides more content than many modern RPGs (including AAA games), and has a combat system that on the middle difficulty and above absolutely insists that the player thinks about tactical decisions carefully and rewards gamers for playing cautiously and thoughtfully and picking their targets well. It doesn't pull punches on difficulty, which is great, and the maps are nicely made for a decent amount of exploration (and with lots of hidden secrets and fun stuff to do when you wander off the roads).\n\nAnd I'm so glad that the devs didn't water down and effectively sacrifice any prospect of robust and tactical gameplay by insisting that players co-ordinate their party of multiple characters in combat in real time so it can 'look more action-packed' and frenetic on video footage (dear Bioware: stop doing that, most rpg fans do actually like to think and are capable of doing so).\n\nIf you like crpgs with tactical turn-based combat like the classic crpgs had, I'm fairly sure you will enjoy LoX and find it staggeringly good value for money. If it were full price I would still consider it good value for money based on the amount of content, detail, and hours of engrossing gameplay.","November 17, 2014","true","70.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While I did give this a thumbs up, it is barely a thunbs up. I am also writting this review after giving this game a break for a few weeks.  I didn't finish it because I got bored of it.  I wanted to give it time to see if I could get back into it because I wanted to see how the story turned out.   As of this writting, I do not plan on playing this game again to finish it.\n\nThe good:\nIt has an interesting story (which is sorely lacking from so many games these days) and an intresting world to explore.   It does a good job at drawing you in.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe game-mechanics are opaque.  You have no idea what skills / powers will do before you purchase them.  The descriptions can give you an idea, but you really do not know.  I am convinced that there is some kind of level mechanic in combat calculations because some encounter will kick your ♥♥♥, and then you level up a few times and suddenly it is easy when nothing else much changed about your party.\n\nThe loot is also fairly uninteresting.  Its mainly +stats on most gear and some +damage on weapons.  It is just very dull loot.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe game is gated such that there is really only one path to go at any given time.  However this path is not clear.  Basically the gates are monster stacks which will destroy you.  As you "open up" the world, you get a much larger area in which to test these monster packs to find the one pack that you can beat.  It gets quite frustrating at times.\n\nThe combat itself, which you do oh-so-much of, is terribly dull.  At some point many encounters will become trivial to you, yet you fight the same kinds of monster packs over and over and over.  It gets tedious quite fast.  This is the reason I put the game down.  There were a few more "gates" of uber monst packs around, and while I was trying to find the one I could beat, I was plagued with endless random encounters that were trivial to beat.  I just cound't deal with anymore and put the game down.  As it turns out, it will be for good.  Still though, I got a tremendous amount of play time considering the money spent.  This is why I gave it a yes vote instead of a no vote.","December 28, 2014","true","111.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As many have pointed out, it definitely caters to a more "hardcore" fan base.  As fans of the Might and Magic or Ultima series can relate, there will be a lot of time spent trying to understand your characters, their skills, their uses, their scaling, their interactions/synergies, and learning a few other tips and concepts that would normally be outside the bounds of common sense(I’m looking at you herb skill).  In this day and age that means wiki, guide, and forum reading, rather than the previous trial and error systems, to hammer out the workings of your characters.\n\nBut skipping over all the debates of sleeping off death but not disease, low drop rates, or finite xp, it boils down to seeing Lords of Xulima like this:\n\nIf you believe "hardcore" means the game has a million ways to 100% screw you based off one decision you make, this game is for you.

No choice, no flavor. Adds absolutely nothing to the genre and the game seems proud of it.\n\nSTORY\nThe dialogue is longwinded. Walls and walls of unvoiced text from the moment you boot up a game.\n\nThe story-arch just dumps you into the deep from the very beginning. There is zero introduction of what appears to be the main character. It leaves you wondering wether you missed half of the story before even starting the game. To be fair, I didn't get past the first chapter- maybe it picks up and intentionally overwhelms you seemingly random, self made fantasy lore.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is repetitive and frustrating (you miss a good 50-75% of the time, your opponents hit 90% of the time). These odds trump any 'tactical' play and leaves you to either outlevel/gear the units you fight, or simply die and reload.\n\nAs I normally thouroughly enjoy turn-based RPG's of any kind, this was a disappointing experience.

What each skill does is unclear.  If you make any mistakes in character development, it is impossible to take back short of reloading however far into the past.  There are stat choices at levelup that are flat-out mistakes / traps, and the same with skills.  The way you purchase extra skills and the scaling cost also leads to mistakes in char dev due to a false sense of skill abundance at first.  I've gotten through the game so far only by reloading every fight until the enemy misses enough that I can win.

Party Based, Turn-Based Combat from a first person perspective, this might be it. And I really want to like this game, as it is faithful to old-school while adding something new.\n\nBut I cannot recommend it, as it just takes itself too seriously.\n\nIt is hard, very hard, unecessarily hard. For some people this might really make it more appealing. But the game has really come down to only two things, have I saved recently and resource management. Everything is based on gold, every hitpoint you have really does boil down to how efficiently you can use it, and the cost to replace it. You can replace hps with food, with mana or at an inn, but all come with a cost.  And every battle is hard. At least at level 6 they all are. There is no resting after every few battles, you need to rest after each fight. unconsious party members don't get exp for parts of battles after they go down. And the monsters progress in difficulty very fast. And there is no place to go grind easier monsters a bit and catch up, let alone get ahead.\n\nWith all of that said, I made it to level 6. I can make it further, every battle comes down to a very tough fight that a little RNG love going your way means victory, a quick save and move on. But that is not fun. Fighting a long hard battle out, and having it come down to a point where you are just barely going to win, only to have your soldier critically fail and kill himself, instead of the enemy is not fun. Having to start a battle over and over again that the game says is balanced fight is just not fun.\n\n\n","March 25","false","19.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

My main damage dealer, a berserker with no skills besides your basic attack, has 66% chance of hitting the big orc in front of him. if your rolls succeed, you will win the fight. If your rolls fail, you will lose, and there is no way around this.\n\nMost RPGs take a different approach: in FF series, Baldur's Gate and others, a "miss" is a rare thing. Victory is often achieved through management of your  character's health bars, and through the knowledge that there is a constant outgoing and incoming stream of damage.\n\nOther games which have high "miss" chance, such as XCOM, rely on tactical choices and calculated risks: you can move your assault in closer to the enemy, in order to have a higher hit chance, and expose yourself in the process.\n\nThis game, though, is the worst of both worlds: battle is an unpredictable RNG-fest. In a "balanced" fight, according to the game, the two enemy archers took out my backline before I had a chance to act (that was my summoner and rogue, 1/3 of my party). I can see why the enemies make such poor choices in combat, such as focusing on my paladin: because if they made the right choices, it would become obvious how unbalanced and broken combat is.\n\nI am currently awaiting a refund request.\n\nPS: after 8 hours of gameplay, I have no direct heal spells. It seems only one of the classes of the game have an ability of this type.","June 11, 2015","false","13.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Most likely my fault I always have the highest expectations. Its like HoMM or Kings bounty but with just one party. Completely frustrating and overly restrictive. More of an adventure then an RPG. Even the RPG aspect of it is extremely restricted for example you can only level skills once per level even if your character is drowning in skill points. Trying my best to enjoy it but I cant seem to find anything really appealing about it. The story thus far is ♥♥♥♥. 100 hours of game time is probably spent walking to one possible win to another. Just another game trying to reinvent the wheel when we have seen even the largest developers fail and lose it all. The Talisman DLC is like a cheat box where you gather points and trade them in for money or more skill points that just stack up in the progression screen. I can only push my self so far so maybe there is more to it but I honestly could care less. Hope the dev decides to allocate his skills to a more open and enjoyable game.","May 21, 2015","false","8.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"

The game was fun the first few hours, but when the game is so extremely linear you feel more and more frustrated when you play the game. In which spot is the content now so I can advance? You can sadly only do one task at a time. You also need to harvest vegetables after each mission. 40 of them!!! How fun is that!? When you click the vegetables your character don't even go there and pick it up. You need first to move your character to correct spot and after that click the vegetable. You need to do that for 40 of them. What did devs thought of? If I don't harvest, it will hurt your economy badly as you need to pay 100 gold entry fee each time you go back to the village where the next not so fun quest is? Why do I need to pay a fee each time I enter the village and need to communicate about the same thing over and over again. Not so fun. Very repetive game.

If you're looking for a throw-away fantasy RPG experience, I guess this'll do, but there really isn't anything at all here of any value beyond that. The game basically consists of finding the next fight that you can possibly survive, surviving it, and repeating that process hundreds of times. There's otherwise not a lot of thought that you can put into it. I don't think the game has a single multi-floored dungeon.

In addition to that it’s all turn based combat with weapons and skills that can stun and while not as comprehensive as say final fantasy x and it’s turn based system it’s still pretty good.\n\nThe voice overs are pretty good:\noften the proper voice can make or break a game, but they pretty much nailed it here the narrator and the voice of god sound very appropriate and usually are dipping with dramatic feel to it.\n\nThe environments are pretty well detailed and everything looks good:\nit actually a good thing to be a developer on Steam and not have your game look like it was done in MS Paint and here it looks really well done, with good detail in pretty much everything you encounter and every where you go.\n\nIt has a Steam workshop:\nthere is too many mods and for the most part they haven’t done too much in terms of really outlandish stuff, but it’s always nice to have.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe outright necessary grinding:\nI’m not kidding here you WILL grind in this game you WILL kill every enemy in every area if you want to continue on your quest there is no maybe here.\n\nbut wait there’s more! the enemy's are finite and you get a bonus for killing all of them that you will need, so you\nLITTERY have to go everywhere to fight every enemy.\n\nThe lack of skills:\nthe ones they do have are more trial and error and outside of the divine summoner class it feels like most characters really don’t have a lot of skills in the beginning and as they level up they still feel really under powered.\n\nComplete lack of explanations:\nmost of the skill icons you can’t click on so you don’t know what they do same with the icons on the weapon stat’s, even concepts like when poison or bleeding will affect you is never explained, Also it never gives you a look at what skills you character will receive way down the line so you're never sure what you're building towards.\n\nOften times completely unrealistic with its difficulty:\nsomehow even after you take down nearly EVERY enemy in EVERY part you can go in a map if you didn’t build you didn’t min/max your characters correctly then congrats you get to start all over again from the beginning of the game.\n\nit has such an unforgiving difficulty that even if you have been playing CRPG’s your entire life you're still going to lose, that being said however you're probably going to restart to get your revenge (after you buy a new keyboard).\n\nThe DLC feels like a slap in the face:\nI swear it like the devs when they making them were like “aww is it too hard for you? that’s ok you can just spend more of your money too make it allll better.”\n\nIt has a weird stutter when you run:\nthis could just be my computer but it has a really weird jerky stutter when your character starts running again it could be just me but it’s weird.\n\nThe Summary:\n\nThis game just is not approachable by anybody who isn’t direly serious about needing a challenge in a CRPG and Dark Souls & Bloodborne just aren’t your thing, everybody else just needs to stay away from this title because the only thing you’ll find with this game is frustration and a lot of broken keyboards, but if you can make it past all that there is a good game here albeit one I can’t recommend but a good game all the same.\n\nFinal score: 7/10 Good","January 7","false","12.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","0"

If you try real hard. I just doubt you care, so i give this game a very hard time. But i still gonna try to explain why.\n1) The character development is very straightforward once you realize that combat system is based on various status-effects. And they stack. Yes. It was the dumbest idea they came up with, really, the wounds mean penalty for any action in the game and you can stack a hundreds of them on single target. Enemies cant heal the wounds, cant mend their bleedings.\n2) The battles. There are a whole lot of them(literally hundreds of them, if not thousands if you willing to clear everything), with no autoresolving feature. You can evade them, but why would you wanna do this? The gameplay idea is that you farm hard untill you get strong enough to face group of enemies blocking the passage to the next location (By the way.. wanna know what you gonna do once you get there? Well.. take a wild guess). So you have to clear out anything getting in your way. Oh yes there are some encounters that you absolutely need to avoid in order to progress, like avoiding patrols while finding a secret passage to the castle but that not happens very often and you have to be brain-dead in order to not realize what you have to do. So it is a grind fest, generally speaking.\n3) It is a grind fest that cant even reward you properly. No unique items, no armor sets, no kickass legendary loot.

I know it's supposed to be a "throw back" game, but damn. It's just too much.\n\nYour characters classes are dull. It gives the hint of leveling up freedom to bend the classes somewhat, but with the point system your basically making one type of character, or making a super weak useless character that "breaks the mold".\n\nThe story seems deep at first, but I found it was sort of "meh" after a point.

The 'chosen' humans get involved and do the work for the good gods and defeat the evil god. And then plot twist. I didn't run into any bugs or plot holes, but the character builds are skewed badly. I don't regret kickstarting this but I do regret not cheating earlier.\n\nPros:\n- Details of expected plot twist are unexpected\n- No bugs\n- Shop prices are typically good\n- Scrolls and skill books to offset magic uselessness\n- Going over the weight limit doesn't actually cause any problems\n- Skills (eventually) become available to help(-ish) offset the stat issues\n- Multitudes of skills\n- Pretty graphics\n\nCons:\n- Character stats are unbalanced (SPD and AGL should have just been rolled into DEX. And why would CON affect your carry weight instead of STR?)\n- Magic is useless - persistently low MP pool on all characters, high MP costs for low damage. And the only thing the 'magic' stat affects is the MP pool\n- Predictable plot twist\n- Preachy and obedient main character (I really hate zealots)\n- Not enough skill points per level - when skills can cost 4+ and you only get 4/lvl?\n- Skill point trainers instead of skill trainers, and the gold requirement rises exponentially\n- Food - I like being able to rest and heal, but you lose food too quickly to make later (mandatory) areas anything but a grind\n\nRecommendations to anyone playing:\nUse the editor to do the following:\n- Drop the magic costs, and up the power\n- Up the Divine Prayer, Energy Absorption, Exploration and Hunting level limits\n- Up Divine Prayer secondary power rate and Energy Absorptions primary rate\n- Increase the random encounter rate to 10 - this way you'll be able to actually clear an area without running out of food 6+ times\n- Increase the food limit and drop the food consumption\n- Up the Skill Points gained per level","January 1","false","65.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","0"

It's old school, I like old school, the old school ruins this game for me.\n\nThe game stresses customization and options.   You have a party of 6 characters and there are 10 classes to choose from.  You have to pick the explorer, but he can be a very different explorer depending on the other classes in the group.  This is awesome.  But the game is hardcore, very hardcore (old-school).  Out of the thousands of possible combinations that should be somewhat viable formations, only a handful are actually survivable, even on easy mode.  A couple of the classes are just bad.\n\nQuick-save now, quick-save often.  Did something just happen and I want to keep that?  Quick-save.  Didn't quick-save in the last 2 minutes since your last death, well you're dead again.  Running from battles is actually makes up a huge portion of the game.  That's why the explorer is MANDITORY.  But even running doesn't always save you from certain death.\n\nRead the guides here on Steam.  They all explain the game as if every little desicion you make is extremely vital to your success with the game.   And that's because it it.  There's very little room for waste.   There's a food mechanism, exploring is done by quick-saving the game everytime before leaving the main path.   You many find nothing, or your may find death.  Either way you will be loading the save file.\n\nIt's really too bad that the bad outweighs the good for me.

It probably means 40-50%. Every action has a critical failure chance (like 10%) where you hurt yourself and the rest of the time you're going to miss for whatever reasons.\n\nSo you think 70-80% is pretty good? Think again it means you'll either miss or hurt yourself half of the time. And you'll roll low on damage the other time.\n\nAnd no, this is not "normal" or "typical for a RPG" or "oldschool". I have played plenty of RPGs before, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Wasteland 2, Fallout series ... I know what 60-70% chance to hit is like. And this game's RNG is clearly not accurate. I can just spin up the game any time and get my parties to miss 3-6 times in a row despite the odds should be in my favor (and there are no character with "wounded" status either, in case anyone is wondering).\n\nExpect your entire party to go on miss streaks at least one round every single fight. Yeah and that's really the entire game's difficulty - suddenly everyone goes on a missing streak, casters fizzle their spells and then you die.\n\nIf you still think that's fun or acceptable, go read other reviews, they'll do this game more justice.","January 24, 2015","false","86.0"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"

Suddenly some big guy choose you to go to a strange place and you are supposed to destroy the evil lurks within (not exactly that, but you get the idea). Name places', nor characters names, are consistent or makes sense.\n\nGraphics\nI didn't like the graphics at all, but I imagine someone could like them. There are a strange mix between illustrations, and hand-drawn and Gaulen animations are clumsy.\n\nCombat\nMechanics are simple, but fights are boring. Just click, and occasionally use an ability. Monsters are repetitive too.  Fights are hard, but not rewarding, besides, how is possible that I'm being picked by some sort of god, but I can barely manage a party of three goblins. I don't know, it doesn't make sense.\n\nYou just have to walk around to find which fights you can pick, and then go into the next one, and then rinse and repeat. Characters fall flat, specially the "the hero" Gaulen, that doesn't have any kind of personality on his own.\n\nI just played one day, today I found the game using space in my hard drive, and haven't been touched since the day I installed it. The game is simply not fun at all.\n\nThis makes me sad, I've backed a lot of games in kickstarter (not this one though), and I'm getting constantly disappointed :/\n\nPS.- it doesn't work very well on Linux (unoptimized), though I didn't encounter as much problems as other players.","October 1, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","8","2","0"

There is dialogue and history told, but I'm unclear what the next step is or what my ultimate goal is.  Coupled with the inability to move around the map or powerlevel  up to defeat enemies, I'm pretty much at a standstill.\n\nI might try and play now and again and review if anything changes,  but honestly, this game is too expensive to recommend.

The contextual help built into the game (just hover your mouse over anything) is a welcome change from the 90s era games that lacked such things. Well worth the asking price and definitely more fun than a lot of AAA titles I've purchased over the years.","February 6, 2015","true","58.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is generic but well-developed, though it focuses a lot more on combat than dialogue. It doesn't hold your hand at all and leaves it up to you to create a good party, level them up properly and not die horribly. It's pretty difficult so if you don't play efficiently you can quite easily get stuck later on without food and gold (if you use too much). There's lots of exploration as you don't get much direction and have to find quests and where to level up best by yourself. There's also a lot of secret rooms, puzzles and treasure.

Only mages and bards have multi target offensive effects that can hit multiple foes in the front or back lines. Archers and thieves with shuriken can hit front or back lines, but only 1 foe at a time.\nStory\nAs these games go I thought the story was well done and there was an entertaining twist that I didn't expect at the end\nLength\nYou'll definitely get your money's worth, you could easily spend over 100 hours to finish this game. That said it can become a bit of a grind at times, but I always looked forward to playing even with over 100 hours of play time. I definitely recommend it.\n\nNeutral:\nGraphics and Sound\nGood (for an old-school CRPG) but not great graphics and sound, but you don't play these type of games to show of your $500 video card or sound setup. That said the graphics weren't bad but definitely had a 2000-2005'ish feel to them, and the sound was ok including the voice acting which wasn't bad but went a little high on the cheese factor\n\nBad (for some)\nDifficulty\nI thought the difficulty on the Veteran level was perfect, but the game can be unforgiving to those new to CRPGs and even for rusty veterans. Many people on the forum have commented on the difficulty level playing on Veteran (and you can play on Hardcore which is even more difficult). There is definitely a significant difference in this game in terms of difficulty if you choose a suboptimal party or don't level your team with the right skills. The game does little to help here, so you'll either need to learn by trial and error restarting a few times until you figure out the right party mix and how to level your skills. I would suggest that you check the forums and online guides to get some ideas on what parties and classes are most useful and which are least useful.\n\nI will give the following advice for new players. If you want a party that will do well in the early game and all the way through the end consider the following.\nGaulen (axe), Arcane Soldier (sword), Soldier (flail)\nThief (bow, shuriken), Cleric (pole), Mage (pole)\n\nMake sure to get 10 levels of Power and Wound attack for the Soldier and at least 8 levels of Fire/Frost attack for the Arcane Soldier. Get 5 levels of Blizzard early for the Mage to give your group some early AOE. Get the Brittle Armor spell late in the game for the Mage. Get Mass Regen for the cleric (it's OP).\n","August 3, 2015","true","213.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's super accessible without being shallow, and even though I needed to pick through the forums for help early on due to my poor sense of direction, when the game opened up I found little need for outside help. Also, the game's really good at making your progress feel like an accomplishment, and makes figuring out certain tricks incredibly rewarding. Like, to the point where I pumped my fist when I got a permanent buff from doing a specific task. My only real complaint is that it ends kind of abruptly, but not so abruptly that I'd say it sours the experience.\nLong story short is that I highly recommend this game.
