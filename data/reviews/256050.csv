Now if only the tycoon part was good.\n\nThere are only a few rides that you can build, and while they are all very polished, most of them operate the exact same way.\n\nThere is a huge lack of rides, shops and customization options compared with RCT, which came out years ago.\n\nAlso, the maps are so small that you probably couldn't fit all the rides in your park. So in the end, all the park you will make will pretty much look the same.\n\nI wish I could find something positive to say about this game but I can't. Not worth the price,  not worth the time.\n\nStick with your favorite version of Rollercoaster Tycoon.","November 25, 2013","false","2.1"," 171 of 181 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","171","181","0","3"

I immediately got flashbacks to Theme Park world, you got 20 rides per theme section. One thing: You got 4 themes so you've got a lot more rides...\n\nThe Coasters: Horrible, just plain awful. The coasters just fall and go up, without any speed loss/gain. You can't even make loopings... No loopings in a Coaster Game... Even a simple banked bend isn't possible. What were the designers thinking?\n\nThe facilities: The restaurant's are very bad designed and just plain simple. There isn't even a person standing in the stand.\n\nThe scenery: There is almost no scenery, and the scenery there is is very dull. You can't even make simple buildings. I mean Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 from the year 2002 has buildings?!\n\nPath's: Just awful to lay down. Making a square (And i mean like a town square) is a very hard job. And serious: No queues. A Theme Park without queues sound like dream in real life, but it's just terrible that you don't have them in the game.\n\nThe AI: Plain dumb, worst routing ever.\n\nSound: There isn't any sound. No people screaming/lauging/talking. No ambiance, yeah some crickets/birds... And the music is terrible. There are only 2 songs and they repeat and repeat until the universe implode.\n\nConclusion: Don't buy it.

The best bit about these games! But... that is so awfully done. Its drag and drop style, which seems easy in the steam trailer but its not.

When you're not happy with a part of the track there is no undo button.

Whenever you build a ride, it does not automatically allign to the path, which makes it possible to place it over the walking path. Even something like; turning your ride around (so it's entrance faces the right direction) is frustrating to do.\n\nThe rides look ok but since there are only like 20 of 'em you will soon be bored with them.\n\nAdventure Park is more frustrating than fun and comes with steep price.

This is a review for Adventure Park, Right?\n\nIt is, but a little historical context is important here. Let me take you on journey back to 2005.\n\nWe were listening to The Crazy Frogs Axel F on our I Pod, watching Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith at the cinema and secretly hoping that Santa would bring us a new Xbox 360 for Christmas.\nOne of the other things that I found myself doing back the halcyon summer of 2005 was playing an amazing game called Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.\n\nRollercoaster... of Love\n\nA shiny new 3d graphics engine, terraforming, customisable scenery, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 had it all and that's before you start building the facilities and the rides.\nYou'd build a few shops, a few rides, maybe place a fireworks display or two. Employ some staff to run it all for you and tweak your prices to pay for them.\n\nThen you could drop back down into first person view and explore your own park, even take a ride on that huge rollercoaster you'd just finished building! Now lets go back... back to the future!\n\n\nSo Adventure Park is Like Rollercoaster Tycoon?\n\nYes and no..... mostly no.\nIn the sense that you get to build your own theme park, rides, stores and all, then yes, Adventure Park is like Rollercoaster Tycoon.\nIn the sense that it is executed as well or as much fun to play as Rollercoaster Tycoon then No, no it's not like the classic game at all.\n\nBut it looks "nice"\n\nYes, compared to the classic park games, it looks "nice". The graphics are fairly well detailed (if not pretty) even when you zoom all the way in.\nThen again, the hardware we're all running has come a long way since that Rollercoaster fuelled summer of                                    2005, so this is really a given.\n\nBigger IS Better\n\nAt first I found the tiny map size to be another hindrance to my enjoyment of this game.\nThen I began to realise that this isn't a huge issue as there isn't that much content to place on them anyway.\n\nDouble Dipper\n\nThe star attraction of any game like this is usually the Rollercoaster design itself. Unfortunately here, your coaster construction options are limited.\nWant loops, spirals, curved bends banking and twisting their way around the scenery of your park? then you're out of luck.\nThe track design here is strictly an up and down affair.\n\nHey Kids, What's that Sound?\n\nWhilst playing I began to notice that the game felt hollow, empty somehow.\nI gave up with the clunky controls and left my second "upty, downy" coaster half constructed to ponder why. Then it occurred to me, the reason this game was lacking any sort of atmosphere was down to sound, or lack there of.\nNo people screaming as they hurtle around the (just up and down) track of your painfully built coaster. no chatter of people as they stroll between the burgerstand and toilets, no ambient sound at all,\n\nApart from the occasional squawk from a stray flock of birds lost in the souless emptyness that is your "fun" park and some slightly irritating music, all is silent.\n\nDeath by a Thousand Cuts\n\nThere are many little annoyances in this game that by themselves wouldn't overly bother me, but taken all together they become a pretty big distraction.\nI could point out a host of irritations here but I think I can some it up with the example you are about to read.\n\nWhy Can't I sit down?\n\nYou can't sit down because you need to achieve a 3 star park before you can build benches.\nBenches! Wow, We need to get the R&D boys on that! oh wait, their is no R&D, just the star rating system to unlock objects.\nI know this is a game mechanic to incentivise continued play but benches.... really! Oh well, just keep walking...\n\nRose Tinted Monitor\n\nFor me, it's the nostalgia of building a theme park again that attracted me to Adventure Park, unfortunately nostalgia can only carry you so far.\nAfter playing Adventure Park for a while I was left with an overwhelming desire to turn it off and play Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 instead.\n\nEnjoyment can be found here, you just have to look really, really hard to find it.\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","August 31, 2014","false","0.4"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","27","36","5","0"

I was a huge fan of Rollercoaster Tycoon back in the day, and was waiting for an updated version to try. This is not that game. The rollercoaster creation is very simplistic, basically just dragging around tracks clumsily. I felt the spaces were a little cramped, at least in the early stages. This seems more geared toward managing your ride and service placement, and the economic factors of the park, which is fine, but it gets stale if you can't build those impressive rollercoasters from the Tycoon series.  This game just got a little boring after a while, because I didn't see much else happening next besides just going to a new scenario to plop down some rides and manager worker placement. It just felt like something was missing to really draw you in and keep playing.\n\nThe graphics are fairly outdated for a recent game. You can zoom out or zoom all the way in to street level, but nothing really looks good that close. It's also difficult to see exactly where the entrance is to some rides, which doesn't help when you are supposed to line all the entrances up to the paths. The music is what you'd expect, just some bland instrumentals.\n\nI'd recommend just going back to Rollercoaster Tycoon if you are a fan of that series.

It seemed the answer to my theme park building dreams.  However, even from the tutorial the game seemed to lack any polish.  Basic things are wrong within the game.  There is a lack of rides and coaster building is unrewarding and difficult.\n\nThe grpahics in this game are the only thing that is an improvement on RCT3.  Save your money and buy RCT3 instead.

I'm a huuge fan of the RCT series (played the original RCT for hundreds, if not thousands of hours) and everytime something new like it comes out I'm like "Oh boy I gotta try it!" so I picked this game up in a sale - I mean, did you SEE the price on this thing?? - and started playing it. I quickly shut it down after about 10 minutes. And the only reason I held out for that long is because of my loyalty to the RCT genre.\n\nSometimes I'm pleasantly surprised by a game. This time, however, the surprise was everything but pleasant. The control screens and mechanics don't work at all. The visitors in the park seem to get lost pretty much all the time and the unintuitive and buggy building tools make it impossible to get them to their loved rides more efficiently. And by rides I mean the 20 almost similar contraptions that you can plop down, along with maybe ten different kinds of restaurants, which are in fact more like unmanned stalls that magically give out stuff (Hey, I found a plus to this game: Magic-ghost-food-stalls!). The 3D camera handles weird and rotating is just plain awful. The music is noticeably ripped off from Pirates of the Carribbean and is basically a single loop that repeats every few minutes. The core game mechanics are faulty and don't seem to work most of the time. The interface is clunky and doesn't respond half of the time. Oh, and those are the best parts of the game.\n\nI'm going to keep it short since I've already wasted too much time with this game, but if you're expecting something like the RCT games but better: Give up all hope now and go back to the good ol' RCT2, which really was the greatest theme park building game ever.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you're expecting a crappy, uninspired, ripoff game that's not even worth a tenth of what they're asking (I mean, how do they even dare to ask 30 bucks for such a crappy game!) then go ahead. I got this game in a sale and even regret paying 4€.\n\nThis abomination will forever be a dark spot in my gaming history.","May 7, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/recommended/256050/","Apokalupsis","✫ Aionion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apokalupsis/","447 products in account","The actual tutorial, assuming you just go straight through it can probably be wrapped up in about 15-20 mins. You can however, continue playing the tutorial map as long as you wish.\n\nAlso, while I try to be as objective as I can by providing examples, there's still a lot of subjective preferences and expectations here on my part, so keep that in mind if determining whether or not the game is for you based on my feedback.\n\nGeneral Info\nIn the tutorial you start out by buying staff to clean up an island you just bought to make your theme park. At this time there is only the gardner, cleaner, and 5 levels of technicians (different skills levels for complexity of rides).\n\nYou'll end up learning about the finances, services, decorating, keeping visitors happy, missions, creating coasters, etc.\n\nYou can rotate the camera, zoom up or down all the way to the ground level. While on the ground level you can "walk" through the park...see the park as your patrons see it.  You can also ride the rides by selecting the ride, then going to it's "street level" view. This has been done in a few other games, so it's good to see it here too. Screenshots posted.\n\nIn the tut, the last thing you learn is how to create coasters. You select a specific coaster to build, then you lay down the tracks yourself. You increase or decrease the angle of track by holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse. It uses a waypoint system to make things easier if you like. Building the track is intuitive and fun, easy to do and you can make it as complex as you like, however, you cannot create loops which is a disappointement to many.\n\nAs your park gets higher ratings more options become available to you. New rides, decorations, services, etc... Also, new challenges will appear in the mission list (create a ride w/ x g-force rating, create a 3-star ride, have $x monthly income, etc.).\n\nYou also have the ability to modify terrain itself. You can elevate it, decrease it, flatten it, add water, etc... So you have quite a bit of control here.\n\nGame Assets\n\nIn Free Build mode, you can unlock every asset in the game from the start (which is not the case with Campaign mode).  You have about 6 maps to work with, some larger than others, each of a different environment (forest, desert, etc.).\n\nHere is the breakdown of the available assets of the game:\n\n21 rides (includes all kiddie rides and larger coasters). This isn't very much IMO. Now you can completely customize the coasters with your own build (and name), and even add event facilities (tunnels, explosions, etc...), but still, there are only 21 basic types of rides.\n5 path types (stone, wood, etc.)\n30 plants/trees\n8 different fence types, each with their own style gate (including metal, wood, glass, stone, etc...)\n5 Entertainment Facilities - laid down next to the tracks (explosions, tunnels, etc..)\n13 Terrain types\n12 Service buildings (bathrooms, stores, food, etc). They for some reason include benches, but i make a distinction here since benches are free to use by the visitors where as well other services aren't\n3 bench types with about 20 variations (slight style change or color variation)\n2 trash can types, each with different color variations\n3 types of staff (Cleaner, Gardener, Mechanic). There are 5 skill levels of mechanics though, which correspond to the complexity rating of the ride.  There are no mascots or anything else. No animals, nothing other than these 3.\n34 decorations (torches, stones, skulls, rock formations, etc.)\nIMO, it's a little lacking. It could use some more types of staff, maybe more rides (DLC at some point?), fireworks system, more entertainment facilities, etc.\n\nIt is enough to have fun with, but for hardcore players, it may not be enough. As more of a casual player, and one more focused on creativity than min-maxing, it's fine, particularly at the current price point of the game.  It is also an area where the devs could release some DLC to add to the game. I have no idea if they'd do that or not though.\n\n\nThe Good\nGraphics\n\nGraphically, the game is nice. It is similar to, but not quite as polished as Sims 3 graphics. Not that S3 graphics are revolutionary, just that it works for the game style that it  is.\n\nYou can select "User Defined" for graphic settings, and from there you have plenty of graphic options available (see my screenshot in the hub or my profile). I was quite surprised to find this actually given how seemingly simplistic the Settings Menu is at first glance. So from where, I can tweak as needed, to provide the best possible experience.\n\nI'm running with an AMD 6800 GT Series (don't know exact model, sorry) with 1GB vid memory, 8GB 3DDR, Intel i7920. I can play Sims 3 at max settings just fine. However, I have to tweak the User Defined settings a bit here to get it to run smoothly. I'm personally fine with doing so but you should know that the default setting may be a bit rough, so be prepared to tweak as you need them.\n\nStaff\n\nHiring, placing, and directing the new employee  is quite intuitive and a step up from other similar games that I recall.  Before I place the staff member and while I'm holding him (ala Sims 3 style), it shows the green border area of where he will be restricted to working. I can drop him anywhere,and he will stay w/i this boundary.  I can increase this area (simply by clicking on him, then on the increase area button) or decrease it. I can easily relocate him to a new area as well.  It's simple to do and lets me have decent control. See screenshot.\n\n\n"The Bad"\nIn "quotes" because these are minor annoyances vs significant issues that negatively affect the game play experience. See the next section for that.\n\nThe UI\n\nI don't care too much for the Menu design nor the dialog boxes. It's very outdated IMO.  It works, it will not complicate the game unecessarily but it is a little distracting to me personally. See my screenshots (in my profile) for examples.\n\nThe building options are fine however. It's like they used 2 different ui designers. Quite odd.\n\nNo Queue Lines\n\nUnlike other games in this genre, you have no control over queue lines.  What happens is that they go into the ride waiting area (which is a part of the ride build itself). You do see them standing there, waiting to get on the ride when it becomes available.\n\nTo be clear, you don't  create an area for lines. The ride "hub"  does that by itself internally.\n\nSetting Prices\n\nNot only do you price out admission, but each ride. OK...some parks still exist that do that (most large parks do not however). But pricing out bathroom use? Makes me feel like I'm runing a low end, small town, wandering fair or something.\n\n\nThe Ugly\nDynamic Building\n\nEssentially...it doesn't exist. Once you drop something...it cannot be moved. You have to sell it outright then buy another one to replace it (even if you only need to move the item 1 square over). I dropped a trash can in an area where later in the game it prevented a large ride from being built. I missed this by 1 grid square.  The only way to resolve this is to sell/bulldoze the trash can. I still needed a trash can in the area though...so I had to buy a new one. This is very unrealistic of course, and highly annoying.\n\n","December 2, 2013","false","1.9"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

It seems unfinished, The garbage man seems to do nothing at all, at least I never saw mine move anywhere.  There are enough rides not to make it to overwhelming for new players so its a good intro game.  What the game does well is you can click people and walk around as that person enjoying rides going on roller coasters.\n\nNormally TotalBiscuit does great reviews, Id ignore his review for this game simply because he played the game wrong.  Not his fault just from his video the problems are clear, most players are unsure how to set up a ride, such as where the entrance to the ride is.  How to guide visitors to rides.  My bigger problem was that the tutorial was very lacking and there is no help section making a management game with its own rules difficult to play without learning how to play it yourself.  Such as what is an adrenaline meter?  I have no idea, had to figure that out on my own.  Whats worse is the generic names making it impossible to google anything for this game, such as "Adventure Park", Roller coaster, safari ride, their so generic it makes finding any tips anywhere difficult.\n\nThe game is fun IF you learn how to play it, which means for most learning wont be very fun.\nRating:  6/10  Value:  $9.99","May 11, 2014","true","21.9"," 17 of 44 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","17","44","3","0"

This is my review for Adventure Park. This isn't the Rollercoaster Tycoon sequel I was looking for but it's the perfect game for young kids and teens to get into the theme park simulation genre. I've been a long time fan of tycoon games and Rollercoaster Tycoon was one of the first I ever got into. This game was geared more towards the younger generation and focuses more on ease of play rather than in-depth theme park creation and customization which makes it a great introductory game. For die-hard fans of tycoon games I'd recommend looking elsewhere however as there isn't a whole lot to keep you entertained for long. Thanks for reading folks and happy gaming!\n\nYou can read our full review here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/2013/11/adventure-park-overview-review/","November 25, 2013","true","3.1"," 5 of 54 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","5","54","2","1"

You seriously have about 20 "attractions" you can place. That's it. Theme park of your dreams? Yeah, right. There are two roller coasters you can build yourself. One is a metal one, the other is wooden. You have two options for the kiddie ride-ons (horse and alligator). Then a few select thrill rides. Three pirate themed, three space themed, one Egyptian themed. Oh, and the ridiculous animal rides! I get horse ride, I can even see buffalo and elephant ride....but triceratops? dragons? What? Also along the same lines, you can have a jeep ride, a helicopter ride, a blimp ride, and a tram ride. You can't even use all these unless you have the rides go in a tiny circle, because the map is TINY.\n\nBoring, and unimaginative.

It is Wildlife Park 3 without animals and theme park junk replacing them. Same objects, same textures and same sounds. Except wait, the only sound is the ambient music. Game can be easily modded and edited, but no point really. Most of my play time I was afk while I waited for my money to build up to complete level. No where near as polished as WP3 and models are not even optimized. The ride models are nice and have good textures, but there is no fun in the game. If you don't know the rules of WP3 this game makes no sense. It should have been a DLC for WP3 not a game in and of itself. If you can get it for less than $5 it is fun to manipulate, but otherwise stay away from this DLC...er game.","November 20, 2015","false","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
