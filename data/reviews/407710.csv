Love that feeling of affecting my movement in such a simple way. Some textures are very vivid and detailed and still others have some work to do, but overall I was impressed with the visual and sound quality of what is available so far! Hope to see the project continue into development and excited for the potential!\nTHE WATERFALL GOT ME! I knew full well that I was in a VR but approaching the waterfall I really was in AWE by how realistic the water looked and sounded as it approached! Very well done! I felt the need to duck thinking I was about to get soaked.. haha (https://youtu.be/OCxPUmVaBJ4)\nIf you enjoy nature and vr experiences then definitely check this one out!\nby the way i love people because Jesus loves me","October 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

The textures look incredible, geometry is great, all coupled with procedural AI animals that react to the environment naturally, AND in VR? That's too much for one person to ask for a small purchase.\n\nBut the game delivers big time on it's promise: Being a nice relaxing, while still engaging, experience.\n\nAnd the kayak freaking tips when you lean over the side!\n\nBut still, this is a great experience, if only it ran better on my PC. Currently running an I7 4790K and 2 GTX 770s, and that was enough to get me a judder-free experience on medium. High has issues, and Epic is out of the question. Note, this is all with the Oculus Rift on, and to get the best experience possible you need at least 75FPS.\n\nOverall, it's a great experience and is worth a try, but could do with some performance improvements.","October 9, 2015","true","0.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Ran smooth as butter on epic settings with my i7 4790k and gtx 980ti and looked really nice to boot!\n\nThe water oh man so serene and relaxing. I really wanted to put my hand in the water and at one point i extended my hands outward in an attempt to do so lol.\n\nTotally recommend to anyone who enjoys a vr experience that has to do with nature. Only gripe was that it's too short! But Im hoping they will add more seeing how it's early access. Worth 10 dollars as is imo.","October 19, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Lots of the visuals are not great for VR (thin lines on grass and foileage). Might be a lot more fun if you could actually move around freely instead of on rails.","April 25","false","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Now, to be fair, on my (pretty good) system I experienced a lot of judder and black smear / right eye vsync issues on my DK2, but I fault the young technology and my own setup, not the devs of this game, for that.  This was a very impressive demonstration of the future of VR experiences.  I may actually have my parents over and make them strap on my Rift to see this.  10/10.","October 12, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If I was to introduce somebody to the rift, this isn't one of the selections I'd pick to show.\n\nMostly you are a floating body on a kayak ride in a loop. Not much to do, the scenery is OK.. but that is about it. A lot gets lost as the try to use high details which don't translate well and make the experience feel dated in graphics.\n\nSuspect this is just an early prototype before they make it a kayak fishing game. Then I could see it being pretty good with the HTC. (holding paddles, fishing rod, etc.)\n\nBut as now.. it is a 5/10 sorta meh. Pick it up if you want to support the developers and throw some money early on at the VR world.","November 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I really hope that continues as the game continues to grow!\n\nSo, the bugs so far.\n\nThe first is with the DK2. Okay, if you're reading this in a few months time you may have the CV1, but the DK2 is almost impossible to run with the required runtime. There IS a way to use the game with the DK2 that works well, but it's a problem that a lot of DK2 users will have.\n\nSecondly, it is very much geared up to be controller based. The keyboard commands don't currently work, which means that unless you have motion controllers there's very little to do...\n\nBUT, don't let that put you off. They do seem like a great team and I'm really expecting these little issues to be solved as the game progresses.\n\nFor the price, it's worth it. Get a bargain while you can...","April 1","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Really shows off what can be done with motion controllers in VR. The light and water effects look great as well as the physics and movement of the kayak and paddle. Not too much to do apart from paddle around the waters close to the canyon, but wow was that immersive and fun. A suggestion to the devs, if we could have the ability to leave the kayak and teleport to the top of the canyon I think it would add another level of awesome, being able to see from a higher vantage point and perspective.","May 31","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
